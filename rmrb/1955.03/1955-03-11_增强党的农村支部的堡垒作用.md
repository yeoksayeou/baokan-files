    The Party's rural grassroots organization—the rural branch—is the core of the Party's connection with the broad masses of peasants and the political guarantee for implementing the Party's policies and principles in rural areas. The strength of the rural branch's combat effectiveness and the level of its leadership will directly affect the Party's connection with the masses, the correct implementation of the Party's policies and principles, and the speed and effectiveness of the socialist transformation of agriculture. The experiences and lessons of the Zhenhai County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China in grassroots organizational work fully prove this point. Before the spring of 1953, the Zhenhai County Party Committee neglected the construction and leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations. As a result, not only did Zhenhai fail to develop new party members and establish new branches in rural areas, but even the existing branches gradually became disunited and demoralized, gradually losing the Party's combat effectiveness. The Fuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hantang Township, due to the lack of Party leadership, even embarked on the path of capitalism. In the spring of 1953, the Zhenhai County Party Committee began to change its leadership ideology and leadership style, and strengthened the construction and leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations. By the winter of 1954, the number of party members had increased nearly sevenfold compared to the spring of 1953, and more than 94% of the townships had established Party branches. Under the leadership and cultivation of the county and district party committees, these branches actively played their core leading role among the masses, thereby promoting the vigorous development of the county's agricultural cooperation movement. It is thus clear that giving full play to the fighting bastion role of rural branches is a regular and important task in Party building. We cannot imagine that without the strong leadership of the Party in rural areas, we can win the victory in the class struggle, and even more impossible to imagine that farmers can build a socialist society without the leadership of the Party.

    The experiences and lessons of the Zhenhai County's grassroots organizational work tell us that in order to give play to the fighting bastion role of rural branches, county and district committees must first establish the view of relying on grassroots organizations and leading rural work through grassroots organizations, and constantly struggle against the idea of neglecting the role of the Party's grassroots organizations. At present, many county and district party committees, like the past situation of the Zhenhai County Party Committee, have an unclear understanding of the tasks and roles of the Party's rural grassroots organizations, and even have some wrong ideas. For example, they overestimate the leadership role of county and district cadres, saying that "work can be done well even without a branch." Under the control of this idea, many county and district party committees not only neglect the work of party building, but also do not lead or rely on existing branches. Many county and district party committees still regard sending work teams to the countryside as the main way to lead rural work. They think that working through the branch is an extra layer of trouble, so after going to the countryside, they only look for administrative organizations and not for Party branches, and do not consult with the branch on matters. They do not understand that the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas are actually playing a leading role in rural grassroots work. At present, social order has been basically stabilized, and the task of temporary and blitzkrieg nature has been greatly reduced. Rural work has turned into a regular and comprehensive track of production and construction, which requires rural party members who are familiar with local conditions and have close ties with the local masses to carry out daily specific leadership. It is difficult for work teams sent by higher authorities to assume this regular and specific leadership responsibility. Especially, the task of socialist transformation of agriculture will be more arduous than the previous stage, and the struggle will be more acute and complex. If we only rely on a few county and district cadres, or only rely on sending work teams to directly lead, we cannot bear this important task. Of course, in order to strengthen the leadership of rural branches, county and district party committees can send work teams when necessary to concentrate efforts to help a village do some important work, and use this as a typical example to gain experience and promote other villages. However, the purpose of sending work teams is to help and improve rural cadres, not to take over their work; moreover, the county and district party committees' regular leadership of rural work should mainly rely on the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas, and not mainly rely on work teams from higher levels.

    Some people say: "Rural party members are too low in level" and "The branch does not have the ability to work independently." Therefore, they do not believe that relying on the branch can do a good job. There are such county and district cadres who, when working in the countryside, do not jointly study the situation with the branch or jointly formulate work plans, but read out and pass the work plans they have prepared in advance to the branch committee or branch general meeting. They are not "staff officers" but "commanders" at the branch committee or branch general meeting, pointing fingers and issuing orders there. Some also turn reliance on the branch into reliance on the branch secretary and a few key members, failing to give play to the collective role of the entire branch committee and all party members. These practices actually reduce or eliminate the role of the Party's grassroots organizations, and the results will, to varying degrees, frustrate the initiative and enthusiasm of rural branches, resulting only in the bad result of "when county and district cadres are there, the work is very good; when county and district cadres leave, the work collapses."

    It must be recognized that after several major political movements, the working ability of the Party's grassroots organizations in rural areas has been greatly improved, and the political awareness of most party members has also been improved. They have formed relatively close ties with the masses in various movements, and have gained certain work experience and work methods. Of course, the working ability of rural party members is generally not high, and is not commensurate with the requirements of the work task. However, precisely because rural party members are not high in level, we should help them cultivate the ability to work independently. Moreover, several facts prove that as long as the county and district party committees strengthen the leadership of rural branches, take effective measures, and actively educate and improve rural party members, and give play to the fighting bastion role of rural branches, they can be fully relied upon. Conversely, if these branches are not educated and improved because they are weak and low in level, then they will not easily improve and it will be difficult to rely on them in the work of the county and district committees. In the work of unified purchase and sales, the Zhenhai County Party Committee relied on the 80 township branches in the county to deeply publicize the Party's general line in the transition period and the policy of unified purchase and sales, united the broad masses of activists, and successfully completed the task of grain unified purchase in the shortest time, without violating the Party's policy. This powerfully shows that only by relying on the branch to carry out work can the work be done well, and only by relying on the branch to carry out work can the fighting bastion role of the branch be better played.

    Experience tells us that in order to give play to the fighting bastion role of rural branches, county and district party committees must pay attention to actively developing and expanding the ranks of grassroots party organizations. At present, the understanding of this issue by general county and district party committees is not very clear. Although they also admit that the leadership of rural branch work should be strengthened, they believe that strengthening branch work and doing current work well are contradictory, and put the two in opposition. Many county and district party committees, when arranging or inspecting work, often only mention the central work, and do not mention or rarely mention branch work, regarding branch work as the work of the organization department, which has nothing to do with them. Therefore, when they go to the countryside to work, they only grasp the central work, do not understand the situation of the branch, do not solve the problems existing in the branch, and do not care about the development and consolidation of the branch, or regard the rural branch as a simple tool to use, only mobilizing the branch and party members to take the lead in completing tasks, and not paying attention to educating, cultivating and improving branch party members. If this continues for a long time, it will make some rural branches slowly weaken politically, ideologically and organizationally, and make the political enthusiasm and work enthusiasm of some party members gradually wane. The Shuanghe Village Party Branch in Shulan County, Jilin Province, used to be a very good branch, and all 32 party members were relatively good party members. Later, because the district committee only asked them to complete tasks in a blitzkrieg manner, and did not help them summarize their work or improve their ideological awareness, they finally lost their combat effectiveness and gave up their leadership of mutual assistance and cooperation work. Serious class differentiation occurred in Shuanghe Village, and eight new rich peasants appeared in the village, and another 40% of the farmers still lived a poor peasant life. This is a serious lesson.

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us in his book "On the Party":
  "The development of party members and the consolidation of the Party's organization cannot be separated from other work and various struggles of the masses and carried out in isolation. Party members are received from the activists in the masses' struggles and various work, and the consolidation of the Party's branches, districts, and counties can only be achieved in the process of masses' struggles and various work." The facts are also true. After changing its leadership ideology and leadership style, the Zhenhai County Party Committee has always adhered to the working policy of relying on the branch to complete the central tasks and strengthening the construction of the branch in combination with the central tasks. They not only completed various work tasks very well, and extensively carried out the agricultural cooperation movement, but also gradually developed and improved the Party's grassroots organizational network, and improved the leadership level of the branch. According to the statistics in the winter of 1954, among the grassroots organizations in the county, the branches with independent working ability and able to form a leading core quickly increased from the original 15% to 30%. It can be seen that only by closely focusing on the central work can the branch work be done well, and conversely, only by relying on and through the branch can the situation be correctly grasped, the Party's policies be effectively implemented, and the central work be better completed.

    In combination with the central work, constantly strengthening the ideological and organizational construction of rural branches, the county and district party committees must first regularly study branch work, and often go deep into the branches to help the branches check and summarize work, exchange experience, cultivate the branches' independent working ability, especially paying attention to cultivating the independent working ability of the branch leading backbone, and establishing the branch leading core. Secondly, the branch party members should be frequently given political and ideological education, specifically helped to improve the work system and study system, promote inner-Party democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and improve their communist consciousness. Party committees above the county and district committees should also include rural branch work in their work schedule, conduct in-depth investigation and research work, and regularly check and help county and district party committees strengthen the leadership of rural branches. Only when the political consciousness of the broad masses of party members is higher, will the fighting bastion role of the branch be stronger.

### 增强党的农村支部的堡垒作用

    增强党的农村支部的堡垒作用
    党的农村基层组织——农村支部，是党联系广大农民群众的核心，是在农村贯彻党的方针政策的政治保证。农村支部战斗力的强弱，领导水平的高低，将直接影响党和群众的联系，影响党的方针政策的正确贯彻，影响农业的社会主义改造事业进展的速度和成效。中共镇海县委在基层组织工作中的经验教训，便充分地证明了这一点。中共镇海县委一九五三年春以前忽视了对党的基层组织的建设和领导，因而，在镇海的农村中，不仅没有发展新党员，建立新支部，就是连原有的几个支部，也日益涣散消沉下去，逐渐失去了党的战斗力。韩塘乡复兴农业生产合作社，便由于缺乏党的领导，甚至走上了资本主义的道路。一九五三年春季，镇海县委开始转变了领导思想和领导作风，加强了对党的基层组织的建设和领导，到一九五四年冬季、党员数量比一九五三年春天增加了将近七倍，百分之九十四以上的乡建立了党的支部。这些支部在县区党委的领导和培养下，积极地发挥了它们在群众中的核心领导作用，从而推动了全县农业合作化运动的蓬勃发展。由此可见，充分发挥农村支部的战斗堡垒作用，是党的建设中的一项经常的重要任务。我们不可能设想，在农村中没有党的坚强的领导，而能取得阶级斗争的胜利，更不可能设想，农民离开了党的领导，而能够建设起社会主义社会。
    镇海县基层组织工作的经验教训告诉我们：要发挥农村支部的战斗堡垒作用，县区委首先要树立依靠基层组织、通过基层组织领导农村工作的观点，并经常向忽视党的基层组织作用的思想作斗争。目前还有不少县区党委，像镇海县委过去的情况一样，对农村基层党组织的任务和作用认识不清，甚至还存在着一些错误的观念。比如，他们过高估计了县区干部的领导作用，说“没有支部一样搞好工作”。许多县区委在这种思想支配下，不仅忽视了建党工作，就是对现有的支部也不领导不依靠。有许多县区委至今仍然把派工作组下乡的方式，作为领导农村工作的主要方式。他们认为通过支部进行工作是多一层麻烦，于是下乡以后，光找行政组织，不找党的支部，有事也不和支部商量。他们不了解，党在农村的基层组织实际上已经在农村基层工作中起着领导作用。目前社会秩序已经基本稳定，像过去那种带有临时突击性的任务，大为减少，农村工作已转入了经常全面的生产建设的轨道，这就需要熟悉当地情况的、与当地群众有密切联系的农村党员来进行日常的具体领导，上级派来的工作组就很难担负这种经常性的、具体的领导职责。尤其是农业的社会主义改造的任务比前一阶段的任务将更加艰巨，斗争也更加尖锐和复杂，如果仅仅依靠少数的县区干部，或是仅仅依靠派遣工作组去直接领导，是担当不起这个重大任务的。当然，县区委为了加强对农村支部的领导，在必要的时候可以派遣工作组，集中力量帮助一个乡村做好一些重要工作，以此为典型取得经验推动其他乡村。但是，派工作组的目的是为了帮助和提高农村干部，而不是包办代替他们的工作；而且县区党委对农村工作的经常领导，主要还是应该依靠党在农村的基层组织，而不能主要依靠上级的工作组。
    有人说：“农村党员水平太低”，“支部没有独立工作的能力”。因而不相信依靠支部可以作好工作。有这样的县区干部，他们下乡工作时，不是和支部共同研究情况，共同拟定工作计划，而是把自己预先拟定好了的工作计划，到支部委员会或是支部大会上去一读通过。他们在支委会或是支部大会上，当的不是“参谋”而是“司令员”，在那里指手划脚，发号施令。也有的把依靠支部，变成了依靠支部书记和少数骨干分子，没有发挥整个支委会和全体党员的集体作用。这些作法，实际上都是降低或者是取消党的基层组织的作用，结果都会程度不等地挫伤农村支部的主动性和积极性，结果只有造成“县区干部在，工作很好；县区干部走，工作垮台”的恶果。
    必须认识，经过几项重大的政治运动以后，农村中党的基层组织的工作能力已大大提高了，大多数的党员的政治觉悟也提高了，他们在各项运动中和群众结成了比较密切的联系，并获得了一定的工作经验和工作方法。当然农村党员这种工作能力一般说来还是不高的，还是与工作任务的要求不相称的。但是，正因为农村党员水准还不高，我们更应该帮助他们培养独立工作的能力。而且若干事实证明，只要县区党委加强对农村支部的领导，采取有效措施，积极地去教育和提高农村党员，发挥农村支部的战斗堡垒作用，它们是完全可以作为依靠的。反之，如果因为这些支部弱、水平低，而不去教育和提高它们，那么它们就不容易提高，就很难作为县区委在工作中的依靠。镇海县委在统购统销工作中，依靠全县八十个乡支部，深入宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线和统购统销政策，团结了广大的群众积极分子，在最短期间，胜利地完成了粮食统购任务，并没有违犯党的政策的现象发生。这就有力地说明了，只有依靠支部进行工作，工作才能作好，而且也只有依靠支部进行工作，才更能发挥支部的战斗堡垒作用。
    经验告诉我们：要发挥农村支部的战斗堡垒作用，县区委必须注意积极发展和壮大基层党组织的队伍。目前，一般县区委对这个问题的认识，还不是十分明确的。他们虽然也承认应当加强对农村支部工作的领导，但是他们又认为加强支部工作和做好当前工作有矛盾，把两者对立起来。有许多县区委在布置或检查工作时，往往是只提中心工作，不提或很少提支部工作，把支部工作看成是组织部门的工作，和自己无关。因此，他们下乡工作时，便只抓中心工作，对支部的情况不去了解，对支部中存在的问题也不去解决，对支部的发展和巩固毫不关心，或者是把乡村支部看成是单纯的使用工具，只去动员支部和党员带头完成任务，不去注意对支部党员进行教育培养和提高。这样长期下去，就会使某些农村支部，慢慢地从政治上、思想上、组织上软弱下去，使一些党员的政治热情和工作积极性逐渐消沉下去。吉林省舒兰县双河村党支部，过去是一个很好的支部，三十二名党员都是比较好的党员。后来由于区委光要求他们突击完成任务，不帮助他们总结工作，不提高他们的思想觉悟，最后终于丧失了战斗力，放弃了对互助合作工作的领导，双河村发生了严重的阶级分化，全村出现了八户新富农，另有百分之四十的农户还过着贫农生活。这是一个严重的教训。
    刘少奇同志在“论党”一书中曾指示我们：
  “发展党员和巩固党的组织，都不能和其他的工作，和群众的各种斗争分开来孤立的进行。党员是从群众斗争与各种工作的积极分子中接收的，党的支部以及区与县之党的组织的巩固，也只能在群众斗争以及各种工作的过程中达到。”事实也正是这样。镇海县委在转变领导思想和领导作风以后，便一直坚持了依靠支部完成中心任务，结合中心任务加强支部建设的工作方针。他们不但很好地完成了各项工作任务，广泛开展了农业合作化运动，而且逐步发展和健全了党的基层组织网，提高了支部的领导水平。据一九五四年冬季的统计，在全县基层组织中，有独立工作能力，能形成领导核心的支部，从原来的百分之十五，很快地增加到百分之三十。由此可见：只有紧密地围绕着中心工作，才能作好支部工作，反过来，也只有依靠和通过支部，才能正确地掌握情况，切实地贯彻党的政策，更好地完成中心工作。
    结合中心工作，不断地加强农村支部的思想建设和组织建设，县区党委首先要定期地研究支部工作，经常深入支部，帮助支部检查总结工作，交流经验，培养支部的独立工作能力，特别是要注意培养支部领导骨干的独立工作能力，树立支部领导核心。其次，对支部党员应经常进行政治思想教育，具体帮助他们健全工作制度和学习制度，发扬党内民主，开展批评和自我批评，提高他们共产主义的觉悟。县区委以上的各级党委，对于农村支部工作，也应列入工作日程，进行深入的调查研究工作，经常检查和帮助县区党委加强对农村支部的领导。只有广大党员群众的政治觉悟越高，支部的战斗堡垒作用也才越强。
