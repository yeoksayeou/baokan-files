    Editor's Note: This article was originally published in the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" on March 6th, under the title "Hu Feng's Anti-Marxist Standpoint." This newspaper has made some textual modifications during the summary.
    Hu Feng regards the issue of the writer's standpoint, which is established according to the literary direction proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong, as one of the so-called "five theoretical knives."
    Hu Feng believes that the fundamental problem for revolutionary writers of petty-bourgeois origin is not to study and master Marxism, participate in the actual struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and change their original standpoint, but to be so-called faithful to realism. He uses the false slogan of "faithfulness to realism" to actually obliterate the issue of the writer's standpoint. He said: Revolutionary writers of petty-bourgeois origin, as long as they "achieve Marxism through realism."
    Hu Feng uses the name of opposing "the theory of the Proletarian Writers' League" to abolish the important role of standpoint in literary creation. The "creative method of dialectical materialism" proposed by the Proletarian Writers' League mainly denied that life is the only source of literary creation, and asked people to create according to the theories in books, which produced serious consequences of detachment from life and detachment from reality. Therefore, it violated the principles of socialist realism and must be opposed. However, opposing the "creative method of dialectical materialism" cannot allow the slightest weakening of the important role of standpoint in literary creation. In the history of Soviet literature, there are many precedents for the "theory" of obliterating the importance of standpoint by opposing the Proletarian Writers' League. This is something that Hu Feng, who likes to cite the example of the Soviet literary circle's criticism of the Proletarian Writers' League, is never willing to talk about much. For example, the trend faction clique headed by Lifshitz and Lukács, which was purged by the Soviet literary circle around 1940, appeared in the guise of opposing the Proletarian Writers' League. They attacked the "creative method of dialectical materialism," while opposing class analysis and opposing emphasizing the important role of world outlook in literary creation. Therefore, this theory was considered a "cheap reprint" of the bourgeois "liberal literary theory" (Guerstein: "On the Popular Character in Literature").
    In order to oppose class analysis and oppose emphasizing the important role of world outlook in literary creation, the trend faction most likes to find theoretical basis from great realist writers such as Balzac. They distorted Engels' words about Balzac, attempting to prove that Balzac, who had a "reactionary world outlook," could also create great works. Lukács once stated clearly and bluntly:
      Stendhal's world outlook is "more obvious
  and progressive" than Balzac's world outlook. Balzac
  was a legitimist, and Stendhal was loyal to revolutionary
  humanism. ... Balzac, who had a false and very reactionary
  world outlook, depicted the era from 1729 to
  1848 more completely and profoundly than his comrades-in-arms
  who were ideologically clearer and more progressive. (Lukács:
  "On the History of Realism")
    Lukács believes that "socialist realism was originally realism" (Lukács: "On Socialist Realism"), and from this, he came to the conclusion of opposing emphasizing the important role of world outlook in literary creation. This is what brought "great joy" to the "old believers" of bourgeois literary theory, allowing them to "find a pardon, a permission to retreat" (Guerstein: "On the Popular Character in Literature").
    This cannot help but make people feel that some of Hu Feng's arguments are too similar to those of the trend faction. However, the trend faction's analysis of Balzac's and others' world outlook is completely wrong. Fadeyev once said in "On the Tasks of Literary Criticism": "Because there is a principle of advancing romanticism in Balzac's realism, his realism has exerted extraordinary power." "The reason why Balzac as an artist has this characteristic lies in the fact that his world outlook is actually much broader than his superficial and external legitimism." Soviet literary theorists have proven that Balzac accepted the theories of the French Enlightenment thinkers of the late eighteenth century in many places. Fadeyev analyzed other excellent realist writers and further said: "When bourgeois realism is permeated, warmed, and illuminated by progressive ideas, it is the healthiest" "most fleshy." It can be seen that Balzac's "victory of realism" is not due to his "reactionary world outlook," but due to his "world outlook actually being much broader than his superficial and external legitimism," "permeated, warmed, and illuminated by progressive ideas." Fadeyev pointed out: This is "what has been proven by our literary theorists." It is not that Balzac, although he has a "reactionary world outlook," can create great works as long as he grasps realism. On the contrary, such a writer must be a writer who has progressive ideas and progressive tendencies in the general direction, while a writer who only has a "reactionary world outlook" is fundamentally impossible.
    Engels said that Balzac had "class sympathy" and "political prejudice," but Engels did not say that, from the overall direction, Balzac's world outlook was "reactionary." It is precisely because Balzac had "class sympathy" and "political prejudice" that his world outlook was contradictory, which cannot but bring "weaknesses" to his realism. Therefore, even if it is said that the practice of realism can make up for the shortcomings of the writer's views to a certain extent and within a certain limit. It is precisely because of this "weakness" that critical realism and socialist realism cannot but have fundamental differences.
    We should draw beneficial experiences and lessons from the Soviet literary circle's purge of the trend faction and the conclusions that "have been proven by Soviet literary theory." However, Hu Feng, who likes to cite Soviet literary theory, is unwilling to mention these issues head-on. Moreover, when the Soviet literary circle had already launched a fierce criticism of the trend faction clique, Hu Feng published Lukács's essay "Narration and Description" in the "July" periodical he edited, and also introduced it in the "Postscript to Editing and Proofreading" in the same issue, believing that this essay "raised some very important principled issues in the method of literary creation" and "is a very valuable document" ("Sword, Literature, People" page 264). He also mentioned in passing the "argument" about criticizing the trend faction, saying:
      In the Soviet Union, a literary debate is now erupting. The main
  content of the debate is said to be aimed at the theoretical
  tendency of the "trend faction" theorists headed by Lukács to obliterate the leading role of world outlook in the creative process.
  But looking at this article, rather than obliterating the role of world outlook in
  the creative process, it is strengthening the indication of its
  role. The problem may not be obliterating the role of world outlook, but in
  how to explain the role of world outlook, or, in
  how to specifically understand the role of world outlook from the
  history of literature. (page 264)
Hu Feng said this not without reason, because even today, Hu Feng is still repeating the old tune of the trend faction on some issues in his "Opinions on Literary Issues." Hu Feng is also attacking the "creative method of dialectical materialism" under the pretext of opposing class analysis and opposing emphasizing the important role of world outlook in literary creation. Hu Feng is also denying that there is a fundamental difference between critical realism and socialist realism, and denying that critical realist writers are limited in their understanding of reality due to the defects of their world outlook. Hu Feng is also fond of finding theoretical basis from great realist writers such as Balzac in order to oppose emphasizing the important role of world outlook in literary creation.
    Hu Feng uses the excuse of being faithful to realism to obliterate the importance of standpoint, and the result cannot but lead to idealism. Hu Feng believes that Balzac's and Tolstoy's "world outlook is not only defective and limited, but also reactionary," but due to their "practice of realism," they became great realists. Hu Feng believes that there is a "feeling the world" in literary creation. Although Hu Feng has to admit that realism "is a special method of materialistic epistemology in artistic cognition," this seems to acknowledge the important role of world outlook in literary creation. However, Hu Feng fabricated the saying that the "world of ideas" and the "world of feelings" are separated, not only opposing the two, but also exaggerating the special role of the "world of feelings." According to Hu Feng's reasoning,
  Balzac, etc., whose "world outlook is not only defective and limited, but also reactionary," due to the practice of realism, "promoted the expansion and deepening of their world of feelings, and became the power for them to seek an aesthetic standpoint" ("Hu Feng's Opinions on Literary Issues" page 28).
    Hu Feng's opposition between the "world of ideas" and the "world of feelings" actually violates the epistemology of dialectical materialism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Practice":
      The nature of sensation and reason are different, but they are not mutually separated.
  They are unified on the basis of practice. Our practice
  proves: What we have sensed, we cannot immediately understand it. Only
  what we have understood can we feel it more deeply.
    Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly solved the interrelationship between sensation and reason, and can also help us solve many basic problems in literary creation. Of course, literary creation cannot be separated from "sensory activity." But it must be admitted that this "sensory activity" not only does not exclude reason, but is enriched and improved by reason. Because an author is not to describe what has not been understood, but only "felt," but to write out the "deeper feeling" that has been understood. According to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct statement, we can more clearly see how wrong it is for bourgeois idealists to exaggerate the "sensory activity" of literary creation into "unconscious activity" or "intuitive activity" that excludes reason. Hu Feng said that Balzac's and others' world outlook "is not only defective and limited, but also reactionary," but because the practice of realism "promoted the expansion and deepening of their world of feelings, and became the power for them to seek an aesthetic standpoint," this statement is also a bourgeois idealist literary point of view.
    Hu Feng believes that a writer can not ask what his standpoint is, can not ask what class he is loyal to in "art," as long as he has the so-called "artistic conscience" of "being faithful to art," through the practice of realism, he will "make up for the lack of the writer's life experience and the defects in his world outlook." He even said: "Being faithful to art" is "being loyal to reality," and having "artistic conscience" is having "Party spirit." According to Hu Feng, it is completely unnecessary to call on revolutionary writers of petty-bourgeois origin to study Marxist theory and participate in the actual struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to ridicule this call as much as possible. This time, he more clearly exposed this intention in his "Opinions on Literary Issues":
      If not through artistic practice, whether learned from study or
  from the mass life and mass struggle, for the writer, it is
  "non-productive capital."
    I remember that Belinsky also said the phrase "non-productive capital." But what he was referring to was: "thoughts" that are "read or heard," if these thoughts have not been "melted" by oneself and become one's own "conscious thoughts," then they become "non-productive capital." Belinsky's words are correct, but Hu Feng "transformed" the "thoughts" that Belinsky said "read or heard" into "whether learned from study or from mass life and mass struggle," so that they became completely different things. According to Hu Feng's statement, for a writer, learning Marxist theory and participating in mass life and struggle are useless "non-productive capital." Therefore, Hu Feng is not really telling people to "achieve Marxism." His argument is precisely hostile to Marxism.
    In fact, the "subjective fighting spirit" that Hu Feng talks about is built on the worship of the spontaneity of the petty bourgeoisie. Hu Feng believes that the subjective spirit of the petty bourgeoisie will spontaneously "self-expand" or "self-struggle." According to Hu Feng, this is "ideological transformation." In this way, Hu Feng used the "power of spontaneity" to cancel ideological transformation. The worship of spontaneity has nothing in common with Marxism, and is anti-Marxist.
    Lenin repeatedly condemned this harmful view of worshiping spontaneity. He said: "Workers cannot develop social democratic consciousness on their own. This consciousness can only be instilled from the outside." He also said:
  "Any contempt for and abandonment of the socialist ideology system is to strengthen the bourgeois ideology system. People talk about what spontaneity is. But the spontaneous development process of the workers' movement is tending to be dominated by the bourgeois ideology system..." ("What Is To Be Done?" "Selected Works of Lenin" Volume 2, pages 202, 211)
    The spontaneous development process of the workers' movement is "tending to be dominated by the bourgeois ideology system," so how can the spontaneous process of petty-bourgeois intellectuals (and this spontaneous process is defined in the incomplete "artistic practice") be able to "reach Marxism" as Hu Feng said?
    Therefore, the "subjective fighting spirit" advocated by Hu Feng is a bourgeois idealist point of view, and also a supra-political and supra-class anti-"Party spirit" point of view. The "subjective fighting spirit" he talks about has nothing in common with the Marxist "subjective initiative." Because the "subjective fighting spirit" built on the bourgeois ideology system and the "subjective initiative" built on the socialist ideology system have essential differences. Hu Feng's repeated emphasis on
  "the burning of the subjective spiritual role," etc., is not to transform the subjective and make the subjective conform to the objective laws, but to make the objective "integrate" into one's own "subjective spirit" and smear the subjective color on objective reality. Therefore, petty-bourgeois intellectuals, even if they subjectively believe in their "devotional will and benevolent heart," but he has not freed his thoughts from the bourgeois ideology system, especially when entering the period of socialist transformation, the more he beautifies this "subjective fighting spirit," the more tenacious he will become, the more he will adhere to the bourgeois ideology system, and the more he will form a confrontational state with the socialist ideology system. And Hu Feng is a clear example of using the bourgeois idealist literary point of view to resist the Marxist literary point of view and the revolutionary literary and art movement led by the Party.
    The question is: How to transform the revolutionary nature of petty-bourgeois intellectuals into the revolutionary nature of the proletariat? How to turn the possibility of the combination of petty-bourgeois intellectuals and workers, peasants, and soldiers into reality? Is it only through the road of ideological transformation indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, or through the road of "spontaneous power" as Hu Feng said? Is it to plunge into the struggle life of workers, peasants, and soldiers, rely on the collective class power, or rely on the petty-bourgeois intellectuals to adhere to their own standpoint to "demand progress" and "pursue the truth"? Hu Feng is precisely adhering to the latter standpoint to oppose the former standpoint.

    “潮流派”小集团的鬼影
    王元化
    编者按：本文原载三月六日上海“解放日报”，原题是“胡风的反马克思主义的立场观点”。本报在摘要时作了一些文字上的修改。
    胡风把根据毛泽东同志提出的文艺方向所确立的作家的立场观点问题，看做所谓“五把理论刀子”之一。
    胡风认为小资产阶级出身的革命作家的根本问题，不是学习和掌握马克思主义，参加工农兵群众的实际斗争，改变自己原有的立场观点的问题，而是所谓忠实于现实主义的问题。他用“忠实于现实主义”的虚伪口号来达到实际上抹煞作家的立场观点问题。他说：小资产阶级出身的革命作家，只要“通过现实主义就会达到马克思主义”。
    胡风借反对“拉普派的理论”之名，来取消立场观点对于文艺创作的重要作用。拉普派所提出的“唯物辩证法的创作方法”，主要是否定了生活是文艺创作的唯一的源泉，叫人根据书本上的理论进行创作，这就产生了严重的脱离生活脱离实际的不良后果，因而违反了社会主义现实主义的原则，这是必须反对的。但是反对“唯物辩证法的创作方法”是不能容许丝毫减弱立场观点对于文艺创作的重要作用的。在苏联文学史上，借反对拉普派而抹煞立场观点的重要性的“理论”，是不乏先例的。这是喜欢引证苏联文艺界批判拉普派例子的胡风从来不愿多讲的。例如在一九四○年左右被苏联文艺界所清算的以里夫希兹、卢卡契等为首的潮流派小集团，就是以反对拉普派的面目出现的。他们攻击“唯物辩证法的创作方法”，同时却反对阶级分析，反对强调世界观对于文艺创作的重要作用。因而这种理论被认为是资产阶级“自由主义文学理论”的“廉价的再版”（顾尔希坦：“论文学中的人民性”）。
    潮流派为了反对阶级分析和反对强调世界观对于文艺创作的重要作用，最喜欢从巴尔札克等伟大的现实主义作家那里找寻理论根据。他们把恩格斯论巴尔札克的话加以歪曲，企图证明具有“反动世界观”的巴尔札克，也能创作伟大的作品。卢卡契就曾经明白露骨地说过：
      斯旦达尔的世界观比巴尔札克的世界观要“明显
  些和进步些”。巴尔札克是一个正统王朝主义者，斯
  旦达尔是忠实于革命的人道思想的。……有着虚伪的，
  而很反动的世界观的巴尔札克，描写了一七二九年到
  一八四八年间的时代，比他的在思想上更为明朗和更
  为进步的战友描写得更要完全和更要深刻。（卢卡
  契：“论现实主义的历史”）
    卢卡契认为“社会主义现实主义原来就是现实主义”（卢卡契：“论社会主义现实主义”），由此也就得出了反对强调世界观对文艺创作的重要作用的结论。这就是潮流派给资产阶级文学理论的“旧调信奉者”带来的“巨大的喜悦”，使他们“找到了一种恩赦，一种能让他们向后退的允许”（顾尔希坦：“论文学中的人民性”）。
    这使人不由得感到胡风的某些论点与潮流派的论点实在太类似了。但潮流派对巴尔札克等的世界观的分析是完全错误的。法捷耶夫曾经在“论文学批评的任务”中说：“因为在巴尔札克的现实主义中有着前进的浪漫主义原则，所以他的现实主义才发挥了非凡的力量。”“作为艺术家的巴尔札克之所以具有这一特点的原因，乃在于他的世界观实际上比他表面的、外在的正统王朝主义要宽广得多”。苏联文学理论家曾经证明了巴尔札克在许多地方接受了十八世纪末法国启蒙家的学说。法捷耶夫分析了其他优秀的现实主义作家后，进一步说：“当资产阶级的现实主义为进步的思想所渗透、温暖、照耀的时候，它是最健康的”“最富有血肉的”。由此可见，巴尔札克的“现实主义的胜利”，并不是由于他的“反动的世界观”，而是由于他的“世界观实际上比他表面的、外在的正统王朝主义要宽广得多”，“为进步的思想所渗透、温暖、照耀”。法捷耶夫指出：这是“已经被我们文学理论家所证明了的”。可见并不是巴尔札克虽具有“反动的世界观”，只要掌握了现实主义就可以创作伟大的作品的。相反的，这样的作家必须是一个在总的方向上具有进步思想和进步倾向的作家，而仅具有“反动的世界观”的作家却是根本不可能的。
    恩格斯说过巴尔札克有“阶级同情”和“政治偏见”，但是恩格斯并没有说，就总的方向来看，巴尔札克的世界观是“反动的”。正因为巴尔札克有着“阶级同情”和“政治偏见”，使他的世界观存在着矛盾，这就不能不给他的现实主义带来“弱点”。所以即使说现实主义的实践可以弥补作家某些观点上的缺陷，也是在一定程度和一定限度内而言的。正是因为有这种“弱点”，所以批判的现实主义与社会主义现实主义不能不有根本上的区别。
    苏联文艺界对于潮流派的清算以及“已经被苏联文学理论所证明了的”结论，我们应该去吸取有益的经验教训。但是喜欢引证苏联文学理论的胡风，却不愿意正面提到这些问题。并且，当苏联文艺界已经展开对潮流派小集团猛烈批判的时候，胡风在他主编的“七月”期刊上发表了卢卡契的论文“叙述与描写”，还在同一期“七月”的“编校后记”中予以介绍，认为这篇论文“提出了一些在文艺创作方法上是很重要的原则问题”，“是非常宝贵的文献”（“剑、文艺、人民”二六四页）。他也附带地提到了关于批判潮流派的“论争”说：
      在苏联，现在正爆发了一个文艺论争，论争底主
  要内容听说是针对着以卢卡契为首的“潮流派”底理
  论家们抹煞了世界观在创作过程中的主导作用这一理
  论倾向的。但看看这一篇，与其说是抹煞了世界观在
  创作过程中的作用，毋宁说是加强地指出了它的作
  用。问题也许不在于抹煞了世界观底作用，而是在于
  怎样解释了世界观底作用，或者说，是在于具体地从
  文艺史上怎样地理解了世界观底作用罢。（二六四页）胡风这样说不是没有缘故的，因为直到今天，胡风仍旧在他的“对文艺问题的意见”中，在某些问题上重复着潮流派的旧调。胡风也是同样地在攻击“唯物辩证法的创作方法”的借口下，反对阶级分析，反对强调世界观对于文艺创作的重要作用。胡风也是同样地否认批判现实主义与社会主义现实主义之间存在着根本区别，否认批判的现实主义作家由于世界观的缺陷而限制了他们对现实的认识。胡风也是同样地为了反对强调世界观对于文艺创作的重要作用，最喜欢从巴尔札克等伟大的现实主义作家寻找理论根据。
    胡风以忠实于现实主义的借口来抹煞立场观点的重要性，其结果就不能不走进唯心论。胡风认为巴尔札克和托尔斯泰的“世界观不但有缺陷和限制，而且是反动的”，但由于他们的“现实主义的实践”，他们成了伟大的现实主义者。胡风认为在文艺创作中有一种“感受世界”。胡风虽然不得不承认说现实主义“即唯物主义认识论在艺术认识上的特殊方法”，这似乎是承认了世界观对于文艺创作的重要作用了。但胡风却杜撰了“观念世界”和“感受世界”分离的说法，不仅把二者对立起来，而且夸大了“感受世界”的特殊作用。根据胡风的推论，
  “世界观不但有缺陷和限制，而且是反动的”的巴尔札克等，由于现实主义的实践“推动了他们的感受世界底扩大和深入，变成了他们寻求美学立场的力量”了（“胡风对文艺问题的意见”二八页）。
    胡风把“观念世界”和“感受世界”对立起来，实际上正是违反了辩证唯物主义的认识论。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中指出：
      感性和理性二者的性质不同，但又不是互相分离
  的，它们在实践的基础上统一起来了。我们的实践证
  明：感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理
  解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。
    毛泽东同志深刻地解决了感性和理性之间的相互关系问题，同样地也可以帮助我们解决文艺创作上的许多基本问题。当然文艺创作是不能离开“感性活动”的。但要承认：这种“感性活动”不但不排斥理性，而且是被理性所充实、所提高的。因为一个作者不是去描写没有经过理解、仅仅是“感觉到了的东西”，而是要写出经过了理解的“更深刻的感觉”。根据毛泽东同志的正确说法，我们就可以更明确地看出：资产阶级唯心论者把文艺创作的“感性活动”，夸大为排斥理性的“下意识的活动”或“直觉地活动”之类，是如何错误的了。胡风说巴尔札克等的世界观“不但有缺陷和限制，而且是反动的”，但由于现实主义的实践“推动了他们的感受世界底扩大和深入，变成了他们寻求美学立场的力量”，这种说法也正是一种资产阶级唯心主义的文学观点。
    胡风以为一个作家可以不问他有什么立场观点，可以不问他忠实于什么阶级的“艺术”，只要有了所谓“忠实于艺术”的“艺术良心”，通过现实主义的实践，就会“补足作家生活经验的不足和世界观上的缺陷”。他甚至说：“忠实于艺术”就是“忠于现实”，有了“艺术良心”就是有了“党性”。照胡风看来，号召小资产阶级出身的革命作家学习马克思主义的理论，参加工农兵群众的实际斗争，完全是不必要的，并对这种号召加以尽情的嘲笑。这次他在“对文艺问题的意见”中更明显地暴露了这个意图：
      如果不通过艺术实践，无论是从学习得来的或者
  从群众生活和群众斗争中得来的，对于作家说，都是
  “不生产的资本”。
    记得别林斯基也说过“不生产的资本”这句话。但是他所指的是：“读到或听到”的“思想”，如果这种思想没有经过自己地“融化”，变成自己的“自觉的思想”，那么就成为“不生产的资本”。别林斯基的话是对的，而胡风却把别林斯基说的“读到或听到”的“思想”，“改造”成“无论是从学习得来的或者从群众生活和群众斗争中得来的”，以致变得面目全非，完全不同的两回事了。根据胡风的说法，对于一个作家来说，学习马克思主义理论和参加群众生活、斗争得来的都是没有用的“不生产的资本”，因此胡风并不是真正叫人“达到马克思主义”，他的这种议论恰恰是和马克思主义敌对的。
    实际上，胡风所说的“主观战斗精神”是建筑在对小资产阶级的自发性的崇拜上。胡风认为小资产阶级的主观精神会自发地“自我扩张”或“自我斗争”，据胡风说这就是“思想改造”。这样胡风就用“自发的力量”取消了思想改造。对于自发性的崇拜不但与马克思主义没有丝毫共同之处，而且是反马克思主义的。
    列宁不止一次斥责了这种崇拜自发性的有害观点。他说：“工人本来也就不能发生社会民主主义的意识。这种意识只能从外面灌输进来。”又说：
  “对于社会主义思想体系的任何轻视与任何离弃，都是加强资产阶级思想体系的。人们谈论什么自发性。但工人运动自发的发展过程，正是趋向于受资产阶级思想体系支配……”（“做什么？”“列宁文选”二卷集二○二、二一一页）
    工人运动自发的发展过程，尚且是“趋向于受资产阶级思想体系支配”，那么小资产阶级知识分子的自发过程（并且这个自发过程是被规定在残破不全的“艺术实践”里面），怎么会反而像胡风所说的可以“达到马克思主义”呢？
    所以胡风所提倡的“主观战斗精神”是一种资产阶级唯心论的观点，也是一种超政治超阶级的反“党性”的观点。他所说的“主观战斗精神”与马克思主义的“主观能动作用”毫无共同之点。因为建筑在资产阶级思想体系上的“主观战斗精神”和建筑在社会主义思想体系上的“主观能动作用”是有着本质的区别的。胡风所一再强调的
  “主观精神作用的燃烧”等，都不是改造主观，使主观符合客观的规律性，而是使客观“融入”自己的“主观精神”，把主观的色彩涂抹到客观现实上面去。因此，小资产阶级知识分子，即使主观上相信自己的“献身的意志，仁爱的胸怀”，但他并没有使自己的思想从资产阶级思想体系中摆脱出来，尤其是进入到社会主义改造时期，如果他愈把这种“主观战斗精神”加以美化，就会变得愈顽强，对资产阶级思想体系愈坚持，对社会主义思想体系也就愈要形成对抗状态。而胡风就是用资产阶级唯心主义的文学观点来抵抗马克思主义文学观点和党领导的革命文艺运动的明显例子。
    问题是在于：怎样使小资产阶级知识分子的革命性变成无产阶级的革命性呢？怎样使小资产阶级知识分子和工农兵群众结合的可能性变成现实性呢？是只有经过毛泽东同志所指示的思想改造的道路，还是依照胡风所谓“自发的力量”，经过“自发性”的道路呢？是投身到工农兵群众的斗争生活中去，依靠集体主义的阶级力量，还是凭着小资产阶级知识分子坚持自己的立场去“要求进步”，去“追求真理”呢？胡风正是坚持着后一种立场观点来反对前一种立场观点的。
