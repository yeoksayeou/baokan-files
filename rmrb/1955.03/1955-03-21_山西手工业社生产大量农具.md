    Shanxi Handicraft Production Cooperatives Produce Large Quantities of Farm Tools
    Since the beginning of spring, handicraft production cooperatives in Shanxi Province have produced a large number of farm tools to support farmers in spring plowing. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen counties and cities, including Changzhi, more than 100 kinds of farm tools, such as plowshares, seedling transplanters, and close-planting hoes, totaling more than 210,000 pieces, have been produced and supplied to farmers. In addition, more than 10,000 pieces of farm tools have been repaired for farmers.
    Since the fourth quarter of 1954, more than a dozen counties and cities throughout the province have held production and sales integration meetings between grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperative organizations, and agricultural production cooperatives. At the meetings, handicraft cooperative organizations displayed various farm tools, introduced the specifications, quality, uses, and prices of the products in detail, and solicited opinions from representatives of agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives. Finally, handicraft cooperative organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives signed contracts on raw material supply and product sales at the meetings. Through these meetings, handicraft production cooperatives have gained a better understanding of the needs of farmers, and the farm tools produced are more suitable for the needs of farmers. In order to facilitate farmers in repairing farm tools, handicraft production cooperatives in some areas have established farm tool repair stations in areas where agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams are concentrated. Some handicraft production cooperatives have also sent people to carry stoves to mountainous areas or remote rural areas to make and repair farm tools for farmers. These practices have been welcomed by farmers.

    山西手工业社生产大量农具
    入春以来，山西省手工业生产合作社生产了大量农具，支持农民进行春耕生产。据长治等十七个县市的不完全统计，目前已经生产并供应给农民的农具有犁铧、移苗器、密植锄等一百多种，共二十一万多件。另外，还替农民修理了一万多件农具。
    从一九五四年第四季度以来，全省有十几个县市举行了基层供销合作社、手工业合作组织和农业生产合作社的产销结合会议。会上，手工业合作组织陈列出各种农具，详细介绍产品的规格、质量、用途和价钱，征求农业生产合作社和供销合作社代表们的意见；最后，手工业合作组织和供销合作社在会上签订一些原料供应和产品推销等合同。通过这些会议，手工业生产合作社更好地了解了农民的要求，生产出来的农具更加适合了农民的需要。有些地区的手工业生产合作社为了便利农民修补农具，在农业生产合作社和互助组集中的地区建立了农具修配站。有的手工业生产合作社还派人担炉到山区或偏僻的农村，为农民打制和修补农具。这些作法都受到了农民的欢迎。
