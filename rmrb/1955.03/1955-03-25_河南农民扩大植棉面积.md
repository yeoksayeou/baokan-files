Henan Farmers Expand Cotton Planting Area

Many farmers in Henan Province are expanding their cotton fields according to the national plan. The cotton farmers in the fertile Yellow River irrigation area are making spring production arrangements centered around expanding cotton field acreage. In 1954, Qiliying Township used Yellow River water to irrigate cotton for the first time and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Now, all eight agricultural production cooperatives in the township have formulated plans to expand cotton fields. The Second Agricultural Production Cooperative's cotton planting area accounted for 77 percent of its cultivated land in 1954. In 1955, it plans to expand to 86 percent and guarantees a 20 percent increase in spring cotton production and a 10 percent increase in wheat stubble cotton production. After the Third District of Taikang County understood the principle that "the farmers' small plans must be subordinate to the state's grand plan" at a meeting of agricultural production cooperative leaders, mutual aid team leaders, and agricultural labor models, the district's 1955 cotton planting plan increased by more than 15,000 mu compared to the figure assigned by the higher authorities. The Luoyang Special District recently convened a meeting of cotton farmer representatives from seven cotton-producing counties, including Lingbao. At the meeting, the important significance of obeying the national plan was discussed, and technical experiences were exchanged. The 246 agricultural production cooperatives and 47 mutual aid teams present at the meeting revised their cotton field and production increase plans, expanding by 32.36 percent in 1955 compared to 1954, with an average increase of about 41 percent in unit area yield per mu. At the meeting, the representatives also issued a letter of challenge to all cotton-producing areas in the province to increase cotton production. (Our correspondent in Zhengzhou)

    河南农民扩大植棉面积
    河南省很多农民正在按照国家计划扩大棉田，富饶的引黄灌溉区的棉农们正在围绕着扩大棉田面积安排春季生产，七里营乡一九五四年第一次用黄水灌溉棉花，获得了空前丰收，现在全乡八个农业生产合作社都订出了扩大棉田计划，第二农业生产合作社一九五四年植棉面积占耕地面积百分之七十七，一九五五年计划扩大至百分之八十六，并保证春棉花增产二成，麦茬棉花增产一成。太康县三区在农业生产合作社长、互助组长和农业劳动模范会议上弄通了“农民的小计划必须服从国家的大计划”的道理后，全区一九五五年植棉计划比上级分配的数字增加了一万五千多亩。洛阳专区最近召开了灵宝等七个产棉县的棉农代表会议，会上讨论了服从国家计划的重要意义，交流了技术经验，到会的二百四十六个农业生产合作社和四十七个互助组都修订了棉田与增产计划，一九五五比一九五四年扩大了百分之三十二点三六，单位面积产量平均每亩也提高百分之四十一左右。会上代表们还向全省各产棉区发出了增产棉花的挑战书。（本报驻郑州记者）
