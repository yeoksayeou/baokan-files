    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 12th: Saigon dispatch: The political crisis in South Vietnam continues to develop.
    The Associated Press reported that, in addition to opposition from the Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Binh Xuyen sects, Ngo Dinh Diem is also opposed by the Dai Viet Party. The Dai Viet Party's armed forces are currently in conflict with Ngo Dinh Diem's troops, who are attempting to attack them, in Quang Tri Province in central Vietnam. The Dai Viet Party accuses Ngo Dinh Diem of being "like a dictator" and demands the establishment of a "National Assembly" and a "Secret Revolutionary Committee" to curb the Ngo Dinh Diem regime.
    "France Soir" reported that the "suppression campaign" launched by Ngo Dinh Diem's troops in central Vietnam and the Mekong River Delta region is not progressing well. In Quang Tri Province in central Vietnam, two of the nine battalions of troops sent by Ngo Dinh Diem to carry out the "suppression" have already "mutinied." In the Ca Mau region, Ngo Dinh Diem deployed thirty-two battalions, but failed to defeat the 10,000 troops of the Hoa Hao sect. In a recent ambush, the latter killed and wounded 200 of Ngo Dinh Diem's troops and are currently besieging Sa Dec city in the Mekong River Delta.
    "France Soir" pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem's situation is "serious" because he has put his entire army into battle, leaving no reserves. The Associated Press reported that the sectarian troops near Saigon may block Saigon's rice supply and cut off Ngo Dinh Diem's connection with his troops in the Ca Mau region. Saigon is very empty, so Ngo Dinh Diem has issued an emergency order to transfer 12,000 Nung mercenary troops to Saigon to protect him.

    南越的政治危机继续发展
    【新华社河内十二日电】西贡消息：南越政治危机继续发展。
    美联社报道，吴庭艳除了遭到高台教、和好教和平川派的反对外，还遭到大越党的反对。大越党的武装目前正在中越广治省和企图进攻他们的吴庭艳军队发生冲突。大越党指责吴庭艳“像一个独裁者”，要求成立“国民议会”和“秘密革命委员会”，对吴庭艳政权进行箝制。
    “法兰西晚报”报道，吴庭艳军队在中越和湄公河南岸地区发动的“镇压运动”进行得很不顺利。在中越广治省，吴庭艳派去进行“镇压”的九营军队中已经有两个营“哗变”。在金瓯地区，吴庭艳出动了三十二个营，但未能打败和好教的一万名军队。后者在最近的一次伏击战中打死打伤了吴庭艳军队二百人，目前正在围攻湄公河南岸的沙沥市。
    “法兰西晚报”指出，吴庭艳的情况是“严重”的，因为他把整个军队都投入战斗，没有留下后备力量。美联社报道，西贡附近的教派军队可能封锁西贡的大米供应，割断吴庭艳和他在金瓯地区的军队的连系。西贡很空虚，因此吴庭艳已经下紧急命令抽调一万二千名侬族伪军到西贡去保护他。
