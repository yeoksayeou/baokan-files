Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 19th (TASS): The American "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" recently published an article by its Manila correspondent, exposing the obstructionist measures taken by the United States and its "allies" against ships sailing to the People's Republic of China.

The article writes: "The United States and its allies have long colluded to obstruct ships sailing to China. As soon as ships enter Hong Kong, Manila, and other ports in the Far East, captains and officers' conversations usually detail how the ships will be obstructed. ... The first step in implementing the blockade is: obtaining economic intelligence, mainly from European ports."

The article continues that then "U.S. diplomatic representatives and other intelligence personnel" report in detail to Washington about the planned activities of any cargo ship bound for China. Subsequently, the matter is communicated to Britain and other allies. Thereupon, cargo ships bound for China begin to encounter various obstacles. The article writes, "Once a cargo ship passes Singapore or the Indonesian archipelago, it begins to be tracked. ... When the cargo ship passes through the South China Sea or the East China Sea, every possible method is used, including utilizing reconnaissance aircraft from the U.S. Navy air squadrons in the West Pacific to report the ship's sailing position."

The article points out that Chiang Kai-shek elements, with American support, have hijacked many ships, and besides providing other various forms of assistance, the United States "has supplied Chiang Kai-shek elements with some warships and has formulated naval training programs for them." Part of the construction and repair costs of the Chiang Kai-shek group's ships is derived from the sale of goods that the Chiang Kai-shek elements hijacked en route to China.

    透露美国用海盗手段阻挠来中国的船只
   【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十九日讯：美国“圣路易邮报”最近刊载驻马尼拉记者的文章。文章揭发了美国和它的“盟国”对开往中华人民共和国的船只所采取的阻挠手段。
    文章写道：“美国和它的盟国早就串通一气阻挠开往中国的船只。船只一开进香港、马尼拉和远东其他港口，船长和军官们的谈话资料通常就是船只会怎样被阻挠。……进行封锁的第一步骤是：主要从欧洲港口获得经济谍报。
    文章继续写道，然后“美国外交代表和其他谍报人员”向华盛顿详细报告有关开往中国的任何一艘货船预定的活动。接着，将这件事通知英国和其他盟国。于是，开往中国的货船就开始受到各种阻挠。文章写道，“当一艘货船驶过新加坡或者印度尼西亚群岛以后，它就开始被追踪。……当货船经过中国南海或中国东海的时候，有人用尽各种方法，包括利用在西太平洋的美国海军飞机队的侦察机来报告货船的航行位置。”
    文章指出，蒋介石分子在美国支持下劫夺了许多船只，美国除给予其他各种帮助外，“又已供给蒋介石分子一些军舰，并且替他们制订了训练海军的计划”。蒋介石集团的船只的一部分建造费和修理费是依靠售卖被蒋介石分子劫夺运往中国的货物所得的钱。
