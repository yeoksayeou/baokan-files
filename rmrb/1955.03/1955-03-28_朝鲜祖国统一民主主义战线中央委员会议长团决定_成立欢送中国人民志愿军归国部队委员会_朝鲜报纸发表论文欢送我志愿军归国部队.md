　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 27th: The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland held a meeting on the 26th and decided to establish a committee to welcome home returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops, headed by Li Young, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea. The committee will be responsible for preparing to hold a welcoming rally and organizing delegations of people from all walks of life to visit the locations where the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops are stationed to express their condolences and bid farewell.
    Delegations of people from all walks of life will soon depart with gifts such as banners and commemorative badges; and art troupes will accompany them to hold farewell performances at the locations where the returning troops are stationed. Several delegations will be led by Li Song-un, Prosecutor General of the Supreme Procuratorate, Bai Nam-un, Minister of Education, Kim Ik-seon, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Vocational Trade Union, and Kim Cheon-hae, Chairman of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland, respectively.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 27th: Major Korean newspapers published editorials on the 27th, expressing welcome and reluctance to part with the commanders and fighters of the six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who are about to return home.

　　"Rodong Sinmun" said in its editorial: The continued withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops from Korea once again demonstrates the sincerity and conviction of the Chinese people in peacefully resolving the Korean issue and easing international tensions. This sincerity and conviction has further encouraged the Korean people's victorious confidence in fighting for the restoration and construction of the national economy after the war and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

　　The editorial said: The Korean people regard the name of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army as the guardians of peace and the most beloved people who defend our freedom and honor together with us. As our comrades-in-arms—the six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—are about to return home, the Korean people once again express their warm gratitude and supreme honor to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the entire Chinese people.

　　The editorial pointed out: The reason why the Korean issue has not yet been resolved peacefully is entirely due to the United States' repeated obstruction. The United States army continues to occupy South Korea, constantly expanding the Rhee Syngman puppet army, and conspiring to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. The editorial emphasized: The Korean people firmly demand that the United States army withdraw from Korea.

　　"Democratic Korea" wrote in its editorial: The withdrawal of six more divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Korea is another clear manifestation of the Chinese people's firm position of wishing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease international tensions. This is fully in line with the spirit of the Korean Armistice Agreement and conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. All the Korean people would like to express their deep reluctance to part with our benevolent and righteous friends—the returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　The editorial of "Korean People's Army News" said: The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army shed noble blood on the Korean battlefield and established immortal and great feats, and their noble qualities will always be respected and loved by the Korean people. All officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army sincerely wish the commanders and fighters of the returning Chinese People's Volunteer Army greater achievements in carrying out the great task of maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia.

   【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会议长团在二十六日举行会议，决定成立以朝鲜最高人民会议议长李英为首的欢送中国人民志愿军归国部队委员会。委员会将负责筹备举行欢送大会和组织各界人民代表团前往中国人民志愿军归国部队驻地进行慰问和送别等事宜。
    各界人民代表团即将携带锦旗和纪念章等礼物陆续出发；并且将有艺术队随行，在归国部队驻地举行送别演出。几个代表团将分别由最高检察所检察总长李松云、教育相白南云、朝鲜职业总同盟中央委员会委员长金翊善、朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会议长团议长金天海等率领。
   【新华社平壤二十七日电】朝鲜各主要报纸在二十七日发表社论，对即将班师回国的中国人民志愿军六个师的指挥员和战斗员们，表示欢送和惜别之情。
    “劳动新闻”在社论中说：中国人民志愿军部队继续从朝鲜撤退，又一次表明了中国人民和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和国际紧张局势的诚意和信念。这种诚意和信念，更加鼓舞了朝鲜人民为战后国民经济的恢复建设和祖国的和平统一而斗争的胜利信心。
    社论说：朝鲜人民把中国人民志愿军的名字看成是和平的保卫者和同我们一起捍卫着我国自由和荣誉的最可爱的人的名字。在我们的战友——中国人民志愿军的六个师就要归国的时候，朝鲜人民再一次向中国人民志愿军和全中国人民致以热烈的感谢和无上的荣誉。
    社论指出：朝鲜问题之所以至今还不能和平解决，完全是由于美国的百般阻挠。美国军队继续强占着南朝鲜，不断地扩充李承晚伪军，阴谋破坏朝鲜停战协定。社论强调说：朝鲜人民坚决要求美国军队从朝鲜撤走。
    “民主朝鲜报”在社论中写道：中国人民志愿军又从朝鲜撤出六个师，是中国人民愿望和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和国际紧张局势的坚定立场的又一个明白表现。这完全符合于朝鲜停战协定的精神，有助于朝鲜问题的和平解决。全体朝鲜人民谨向我们的仁义之友——中国人民志愿军归国部队深表惜别之情。
    “朝鲜人民军报”社论说：中国人民志愿军指挥员、战斗员们在朝鲜战场上流了高贵的鲜血，建立了不朽的伟大功勋，他们的崇高品质将永远受到朝鲜人民的敬爱。朝鲜人民军全体将士谨祝中国人民志愿军归国部队指挥员、战斗员们在执行维护和巩固亚洲和平的伟大任务中取得更大的成就。
