Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Saigon News: The South Vietnamese political crisis, reflecting the power struggle between American and French colonialists, has been further intensified by the "ultimatum" issued by various South Vietnamese sects to the Ngo Dinh Diem group.

In a joint "ultimatum" given to Ngo Dinh Diem on the 21st, the South Vietnamese sects demanded that he reorganize his cabinet within five days and form a government approved by all sects.

According to reports, Ngo Dinh Diem rejected the demands of the sects that evening. In a radio broadcast, he stated that he would continue to implement the American policy of excluding pro-French forces. He said that he was "determined to unify the national army and disband the armed forces of the sects," and would use force if necessary.

On the evening of the 22nd, Ngo Dinh Diem convened an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss how to deal with the serious unstable situation caused by the "ultimatum" presented to him by the South Vietnamese sects. The ministers in Ngo Dinh Diem's cabinet who belonged to the various sects, including Tran Van Soai, the commander-in-chief of the Hoa Hao army, and Nguyen Thanh Phuong, the commander-in-chief of the Cao Dai army, did not attend the meeting. These sect leaders, who controlled armies, held another meeting on the same day to discuss what action to take if Ngo Dinh Diem refused their demands. According to Agence France-Presse, Ngo Dinh Diem remained tough at the cabinet meeting. He stated that he would insist on merging the sect armies and "forming a unified national army."

Ngo Dinh Diem's tough stance is due to American support. United Press reporters made no secret of the fact that "Ngo Dinh Diem is firmly relying on the solid support he has consistently received from the American authorities in South Vietnam." On the other hand, Reuters reported that "Vietnamese suspect that France is secretly supporting private armies (referring to the sect armies)."

    南越政治危机更形尖锐化
    南越教派下最后通牒要吴庭艳改组政府
    据新华社讯：西贡消息：反映美国的和法国的殖民者明争暗斗的南越政治危机已因南越各教派致吴庭艳集团的“最后通牒”而更形尖锐化。
    南越各教派在二十一日联合给吴庭艳一个“最后通牒”中，要他在五天之内改组他的内阁，成立一个由各教派同意的政府。
    据消息说，吴庭艳当晚拒绝了各教派的要求。他在电台上发表广播，表示要继续执行美国排除亲法势力的政策。他说，他“决心统一国家军队和解散教派的武装”，必要时就使用武力。
    二十二日晚上，吴庭艳召开了一次内阁紧急会议，研究如何应付由于南越各教派向他提出“最后通牒”而造成的严重不稳局势。吴庭艳内阁中属于各教派的部长，其中包括和好教军队总司令陈文帅和高台教军队总司令阮盛芳，都没有参加这次会议。这些拥有军队的教派首脑在同一天举行了另一个会议，商讨如果吴庭艳拒绝他们的要求时将采取什么行动。据法国新闻社消息说，吴庭艳在内阁会议上态度仍然强硬。他表示要坚持并吞教派的军队，而
  “成立一支统一指挥的国民军”。
    吴庭艳采取强硬态度，是由于有美国的支持。合众社记者并不隐讳：“吴庭艳在强固地依靠他一直从南越的美国当局那里获得的稳固的支持”。另一方面，路透社记者报道说：“越南人怀疑法国在秘密地支持私有军队（指教派军队）”。
