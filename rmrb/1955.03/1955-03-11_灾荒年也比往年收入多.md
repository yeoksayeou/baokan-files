Even in a Year of Disaster, Income Exceeded Previous Years
By Our Correspondent Gao Changren

The Shibei Township in Xishui County, Hubei Province, is close to the Xishui River. Last summer, severe floods brought serious disasters to this township. However, the "Tomorrow" Agricultural Production Cooperative, a newly established cooperative in the township, overcame this disaster, increased the income of its members, and demonstrated the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives to nearby farmers.

The "Tomorrow" Agricultural Production Cooperative was organized by eighteen peasant households before the Spring Festival in 1954. On the fourth day after the Spring Festival, the members braved the cold to dig pond mud and carried manure and bought cake fertilizer from the city. During the spring plowing, the base fertilizer in the fields was sufficient, the farm tools were well repaired, and the land was cultivated better than any previous year. Everyone hoped for a bumper harvest in the fall to increase income. Who knew that after transplanting the seedlings, due to continuous heavy rains, the Xishui River flooded eighteen times, each time more severe than the last, and seventy percent of the cooperative's more than 140 mu of farmland was submerged. At that time, the floodwaters sealed the doors, and the fields were a vast expanse of white. The members had no choice but to sit anxiously at home. Xu Xianjie, a member, was the most distressed. He had little land but a large family. He thought, if the cooperative had no harvest, how would his family live? In those days, the members were all worried about how to survive this famine year.

Wang Guoqing, the director of the cooperative, was even more anxious than the members. He was also the deputy secretary of the Shibei Township Party Branch. He also felt that the lives of the members and himself were threatened. If this problem could not be solved, the cooperative would collapse.

The sense of responsibility to the Party and to all the members spurred Wang Guoqing. He knew that in this difficult time, the members were all looking to the cooperative's cadres. He often convened cooperative affairs committees and visited members. He said to the cooperative cadres: "We must be strong. If we are also pessimistic, what will the members do?" He comforted the members by saying: "It's okay, there is a solution, take it slowly." But at that time, he still lacked a way to overcome the disaster.

When the disaster became a certainty, and everyone's thinking was very chaotic, the higher-level Party committee and the government issued a call for production self-reliance and fighting against the floods. The district's leading organs put forward specific instructions to the disaster-stricken agricultural cooperatives: each cooperative should make preparations, and as soon as the water receded, they should rush to plant vegetables and late autumn crops. The district Party secretary said to Wang Guoqing: "The more difficult it is, the more necessary it is to give play to the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. As long as the late autumn crops are planted well, it is still possible to make up for the losses caused by the disaster."

The words of the district Party secretary pointed Wang Guoqing in the right direction. He returned to the cooperative and convened a cooperative affairs committee and a members' meeting to mobilize everyone to step up preparations for rushing to plant late autumn crops, strive for an extra harvest, and overcome the famine. At this time, the government also provided them with a loan of 900,000 old currency units to solve the immediate living difficulties of several members. With a clear solution and the assistance of the government, the members of the cooperative affairs committee strengthened their confidence, and the emotions of the members also began to stabilize. By the beginning of August, the floodwaters had receded, and some of the farmland began to be exposed. They planned to rush to plant late autumn crops.

The newly receding farmland could not be worked on for a while. Weeds grew densely, and in a few days, the farmland became a grassy lawn. To rush to plant late autumn crops for an extra harvest, the first thing to do was to plow these fields once.

This was a heavy field labor. The members, who had long been accustomed to cultivating their own small plots of land, were all frightened by this large area of wasteland. They had great doubts about the possibility of planting late autumn crops.

Wang Guoqing said at the mobilization meeting for rushing to plant late autumn crops: "Many people have great strength. We shouldn't be frightened by this grassy lawn. If individual households were to cultivate it, it would certainly be very difficult. But we are a cooperative, we have a lot of labor, we can divide the work and cooperate, and in a few days we will turn it over!" Some members said: "That would kill people!" Wang Guoqing said: "It's tiring, but is it better for us to be a little tired now and plant all these fields with late autumn crops for an extra harvest? Or is it better for us to leave the fields empty now, let them grow weeds, and then go out to escape the famine in the future?" This stabilized everyone's determination. The members said: "Let's do it, as long as we can harvest grain, what's a little tiredness!"

At this time, the plan formulated by the cooperative affairs committee was approved. They would first plant radishes and vegetables on the three mu of dry land that had dried, and plow the weedy fields once before deciding what late autumn crops to plant.

The day after the meeting, all the members took action. The men plowed the fields, the women picked up weeds, and planting radishes and vegetables and planting crops were carried out simultaneously. The cooperative's three oxen were too busy, so they rented other people's idle oxen for three days. The weather was still hot at this time. Working under the sun was tiring for both people and oxen. Later, the members came up with a solution: they rested at noon and, in the afternoon, opened several compartments in the fields first, and then came out to plow the fields in the moonlight at midnight. Indeed, many people have great strength. In less than ten days, the grassy lawn was all plowed, and the radishes and vegetables on the three mu of land also grew into a lush green patch.

The cooperative affairs committee decided to plant buckwheat and Huangmei sticky rice (i.e., second-season rice) on the plowed fields, but the members had concerns, fearing that the buckwheat would not withstand the frost and that the yield of second-season rice would not be high. The cooperative cadres used the example of Wang Guoqing's harvest of four dan of buckwheat from more than one mu of land in 1951 to educate everyone, and used the principle of "every grain harvested is a grain" to explain that planting second-season rice was still worthwhile. Most of the members agreed, but there was a shortage of buckwheat seeds. It just so happened that the district loaned out a large batch of buckwheat seeds supported by other provinces. Immediately afterwards, they nervously transplanted second-season rice and sowed buckwheat.

At this time, the cooperative affairs committee considered that buckwheat and second-season rice were staple foods and that more should be planted, so they expanded the original planting plan from forty mu to eighty mu; they vacated the forty mu of land originally intended for vegetables to plant buckwheat and second-season rice, and planted the vegetables in the dry land, and reduced the vegetable area. After the vegetables were harvested, late buckwheat could still be planted.

The plan to rush to plant late autumn crops was encouraged by the higher authorities. The district Party secretary said to Wang Guoqing: "If you do it this way, your cooperative will still have a certain income in the fall; if you do it well, you will even increase your income." In early September, it was the tense moment of sowing late autumn crops. Their first batch of vegetables came out of the garden and were taken to the street, selling for 3 million old currency units.

The income from planting vegetables further boosted the labor enthusiasm of the members. The cooperative affairs committee also put forward a method of awarding extra labor points. As a result, all the members became more energetic. Zhang Xiubin and Zhang Xiuyou worked hard from dawn to dusk in those tense days, earning fifteen points every day (usually only ten points a day), and even members who were afraid of being tired in the past became active. By early October, more than one hundred mu of farmland flooded by the whole cooperative was covered with robust late autumn crops. In order to cultivate these crops, the members also carried out tense labor such as water-wheeling to fight drought and weeding.

In the period after rushing to plant late autumn crops, in order to increase income, the cooperative also extracted manpower to carry out sideline production such as transportation, handicrafts, pig raising, and fishing. Fishing alone brought in 1.33 million old currency units.

By late autumn and early winter, the Tomorrow Agricultural Cooperative began to harvest the fruits of their hard work. When the members saw the buckwheat and second-season rice with full grains, some said: "At that time, I still had conservative ideas about planting buckwheat, I really shouldn't have." Some said: "If it weren't for the superiority of our cooperative, how could we eat buckwheat and Huangmei sticky rice!" Xu Xianchun, a member, said to the director with gratitude: "It is still necessary for the government to support and the cadres to lead. If you hadn't been firm at that time, we would have gone out to escape the famine."

In the case of 70 percent of the farmland being flooded, the Tomorrow Agricultural Cooperative still harvested more than 27,000 jin of grain in agriculture due to rushing to plant late autumn crops, of which late autumn accounted for 70 percent. The total income from agricultural and sideline industries reached 31.74 million old currency units. At the end of the year, the average income of each member household was higher than the income of the mutual aid group last year. The members not only had enough to eat, burn, and use, but also paid 4,000 jin of grain in agricultural tax and sold 3,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

While the Tomorrow Agricultural Cooperative was rushing to plant late autumn crops, it also带动 (dàidòng - spurred, motivated) a part of the mutual aid groups. A mutual aid group named Zhang Fangzao also planted 20 mu of buckwheat. However, the mutual aid group was ultimately not as good as the agricultural cooperative. Everyone was afraid of not receiving grain for their labor points, so they did not dare to invest too much in late autumn crops. Everyone wanted to rush ahead in arranging work, so they did not plant all the empty land with late autumn crops. Individual farmers encountered even greater difficulties when faced with such natural disasters. The fact that the Tomorrow Agricultural Cooperative overcame natural disasters and increased income made the surrounding farmers clearly see the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. Last winter, several surrounding mutual aid groups asked to join the Tomorrow Agricultural Cooperative. Xu Xianlin, a middle peasant in Yijiahekou, Shijia Township, was a well-known expert in planting crops, with complete farm tools and strong labor. Last spring, he was not convinced by the agricultural cooperative and wanted to compete with it secretly. But when the flood came, Xu Xianlin's farmland was also flooded. Later, the agricultural cooperative rushed to plant late autumn crops in a vigorous manner, but Xu Xianlin was too busy to take care of everything and could do nothing but worry. Xu Xianfu, a poor peasant member, had a much harder life than Xu Xianlin before joining the cooperative, but this winter, Xu Xianfu had surplus grain to sell, while Xu Xianlin became a grain-deficient household. After the agricultural cooperative finished harvesting late autumn crops, Xu Xianlin saw that he could not withstand natural disasters on his own. After thinking about it for a long time, he finally went to Wang Guoqing and asked to join the cooperative.

After the Tomorrow Agricultural Cooperative overcame the flood, more and more farmers around asked to join the cooperative. Around New Year's Day this year, this agricultural cooperative absorbed another fifteen new members.

    灾荒年也比往年收入多
    本报记者  高长任
    湖北省浠水县石河乡靠近浠水河。去年夏天，凶猛的洪水给这个乡带来了严重的灾害。但是，这个乡一个新建立起来的名叫“明天”的农业生产合作社却战胜了这次灾害，给社员增加了收入，向附近农民们显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。一
    “明天”农业生产合作社是由十八户农民在一九五四年春节前组织起来的。春节后的第四天，社员们就冒寒打塘泥，到城里挑粪、买饼肥。春耕时，田里的底肥下得足足的，农具修理得好好的，田地耕得比哪一年都好。大家都盼望着秋天能多打粮食，增加收入。谁知插秧之后，由于连续降大雨，浠水河发了十八次洪水，洪水一次比一次大，全社一百四十多亩田地的百分之七十被洪水吞没了。那时，大水封门，田里是白茫茫的一片，社员们只得焦急地坐在家里。社员徐贤杰最苦恼，他田少；劳动力多，他一想，社里如果没有收成，他的一家怎么生活呢？那几天，社员们都在忧虑着怎么能渡过这个荒年。
    社长汪国卿比社员们更焦急。他是石河乡党支部副书记。他也感觉到社员和自己的生活受到威胁，如果不能解决这个问题，社就要垮台。
    对党负责，对全体社员负责的责任感督促着汪国卿。他知道在这困难的时候，社员们都在看着社的干部们。他经常召开社务委员会，访问社员。他对社干部说：“我们要坚强起来，如果我们也悲观，社员怎么办呢？”对社员就安慰说：“不要紧，有办法，慢慢来。”可是当时他还缺乏战胜灾害的办法。
    当灾情已成定局，大家的思想上也非常混乱的时候，上级党委和政府发出了生产自救、和水灾作斗争的号召。区的领导机关对受灾的农业社更提出了具体的指示：要各社做好准备，水一退，就抢种蔬菜和晚秋作物。区委书记对汪国卿说：“越是在这个困难的时候，就越要发挥农业生产合作社的优越性，只要把晚秋作物种好，还是可以弥补灾害造成的损失的。”
    区委书记的话给汪国卿指出了方向。他回到社里就召开社委会和社员大会，动员大家加紧准备抢种晚秋作物，争取多收一季，战胜灾荒。这时政府又贷给他们旧币九十万元的贷款，先解决几户社员眼前的生活困难。有了明确的办法，又得到政府的扶助，社务委员们坚定了信心，社员们的情绪也开始稳定了。到八月初，洪水下降，部分田地开始露出来，他们就筹划抢种晚秋作物了。二
    刚退水的田地，一时干不了。野草密密麻麻地长出来，不几天，田地就变成个荒草坪子了。要抢种晚秋作物多收一季，首先就得把这些田地翻耕一遍。
    这是一场繁重的田间劳动，长期习惯在自己一小块土地耕作的社员们，都为这一大片荒地吓住了。他们对播种晚秋作物的可能有着很大的怀疑。
    汪国卿在抢种晚秋作物的动员大会上说：“人多力量大，我们不要光看这一片草坪子吓人。要是单干户来耕它，那当然很困难；但我们是合作社，劳动力多，分工合作，不几天就会把它翻过来的！”有的社员说：“那就要把人累死了！”汪国卿说：
  “累是累，可是，我们是现在累一点，把这些田地都种上晚秋，多收一季好呢？还是现在让田地空着，让它长草，而我们将来出外逃荒好呢？”这一说，把大家的决心稳定了。社员们说：“还是干，只要能收到粮食，累一点怕什么！”
    这时，社务委员会拟定的计划通过了，他们要把已干的三亩旱地先种上萝卜菜，有草的田先翻耕一遍再决定种什么晚秋。
    开完会的第二天，全体社员就行动起来。男的犁地，妇女捡草，种萝卜菜和种庄稼同时进行。社内的三头牛忙不过来，又租了别人的闲牛用了三天。这时天气还热，在太阳下干活，人累，牛也累。后来社员们想出办法：中午休息，下午在田里先开几个厢，到半夜乘着月光，出来犁田。的确人多力量大，不上十天，那荒草坪都被翻耕过来，那三亩地的萝卜菜也长成嫩绿的一片。
    社务委员会决定在翻耕过来的田地上种荞麦和黄梅粘（即二季稻），但社员们有顾虑，怕荞麦经不起霜打，二季稻产量不高。社干部拿汪国卿在一九五一年种一亩多田荞麦收四石的事例教育大家，用“多收一粒是一粒”的道理说明种二季稻还是合算。大部分社员都同意了，但缺少荞麦种籽。恰好这时区里贷下大批外省支援的荞麦种。紧接着，他们就紧张地插二季稻和播种荞麦。
    这时，社务委员会考虑到荞麦和二季稻是主粮，要多种一些，就将原来的四十亩的播种计划，扩大为八十亩；把原来准备种蔬菜的四十亩田腾出来种荞麦和二季稻，而把蔬菜种到旱地里去，并缩小蔬菜面积，等收了蔬菜，还可种迟荞麦。
    抢种晚秋作物的计划受到上级的鼓励。区委书记对汪国卿说：“照这样干，你们社到秋后还会有一定的收入；搞的好，还会增加收入。”九月初，正是播种晚秋作物的紧张时刻。他们的第一批蔬菜出园了，挑到街上去，卖了旧币三百万元。
    种蔬菜的收入，更鼓舞了社员们的劳动热情。社务委员会又提出了超额奖励劳动工分的办法。这样一来，全体社员劲头更大了。张修斌、张修友在那紧张的几天，起早摸黑地干，每天都评到十五分
  （一般一天只十分），过去怕累的社员也积极起来。到十月初，全社被淹的一百多亩田地、都长出茁壮的晚秋作物。为了培养这些庄稼，社员们还进行了车水抗旱，锄草等紧张的劳动。
    在抢种晚秋作物后的一段时间，为了增加收入，合作社又抽出人力，进行了运输、手工业，养猪、捕鱼等副业生产。其中仅捕鱼一项，就收入旧币一百三十三万元。三
    到了秋末冬初，明天农业社开始收获他们辛勤劳动的果实。当社员们看到长得籽粒饱满的荞麦和二季稻时，有的说：“那时候我对种荞麦还有保守思想，真不应该。”有的说：“不是我们合作社有优越性，哪能吃到荞麦和黄梅粘！”社员徐贤春怀着感激的心情对社长说：“还是要政府扶持，干部领导，你在那时要是不坚决，我们早就出门逃荒了。”
    在百分之七十的田地被淹的情况下，明天农业社由于抢种了晚秋作物，农业方面还收到两万七千多斤粮食，其中晚秋占百分之七十。农副业总收入达到旧币三千一百七十四万元。年终分配的时候，平均每户社员比起去年在互助组的收入多一些。社员们不但吃的、烧的、用的都够了，而且全社还交纳了四千斤粮食的农业税，卖给了国家三千斤余粮。
        四
    在明天农业社抢种晚秋作物的时候，也带动了一部分互助组。有个张芳造互助组也种了二十亩田的荞麦。可是互助组毕竟赶不上农业社，他们大家都怕出了工分收不到粮，不敢在晚秋作物上多投资，排工上谁都想抢先，这样，就没有把空地全部种上晚秋作物。单干农民在遇到这样天灾的时候，困难更大。明天农业社战胜天灾、增加收入的事实，使周围的农民都清清楚楚地看到了农业生产合作社的优越性。去年冬天，周围几个互助组都要求参加明天农业社。有个中农徐贤林，是石家乡易家河口有名的种庄稼能手，农具齐全，劳动力也强。去年春天他对农业社不服气，想暗地和它比赛。可是水灾一来，徐贤林的田地也被淹光。农业社后来轰轰烈烈地抢种晚秋，徐贤林却忙了这头顾不上那一头，干着急也没办法。社员徐贤甫是贫农，入社前生活比徐贤林苦的多，可是这一年冬天，徐贤甫有余粮卖，徐贤林却成了缺粮户。在农业社收完晚秋作物之后，徐贤林看到自己单人独马抗不住天灾，他考虑了好久，终于去找汪国卿要求入社。
    明天农业社战胜水灾之后，周围的农民要求入社的越来越多。今年元旦前后，这个农业社又吸收了十五户新社员。
