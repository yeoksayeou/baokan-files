    Glorious Support
    By our reporter Liu Xi
    Last August, Guizhou Province organized a medical team to support the disaster area in Hubei. The members of the medical team enthusiastically served the people in the disaster area and were loved by the local people. They were honorably rated as a first-class model unit by the local government. Five of the six members were rated as second-class individual models.
    After this medical team arrived in Hubei, they were assigned to work in Guangji County. At that time, dysentery, malaria and other diseases were prevalent among the disaster victims in this area. Under the leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Government, they actively carried out epidemic prevention and treatment work together with local medical workers, and rescued critically injured patients with dysentery, appendicitis, and bladder rupture. They also successively established heavy patient reception stations and operating rooms. They worked day and night to treat patients regardless of sunny or rainy weather. Some team members stayed with patients in their homes all night, not resting even when they had a cold. Because they were few in number and assigned to several locations, doctors and nurses in the critically ill patient reception station often performed various tasks on their own. Sometimes they even fed patients and took care of their bowel movements. Medical assistant Long Rumei cared for nineteen patients alone, persisting for three days and three nights. Although the work was very hard, the team members were all happy and in high spirits. They loved the patients. Some patients didn't have quilts, so they gave their own quilts to the patients; when patients wanted to eat, they gave them the eggs they had bought. Huo Jinwen, a twenty-year-old female lab technician, not only finished her outpatient work every day, but also took a boat to the Longping heavy patient reception station to test the patients' blood. Sometimes, she even helped other medical staff take care of patients at night.
    Initially, when the medical team members went back and forth across the river from the district health center to the heavy patient reception station, farmers rowed them across. Later, when the flood receded, the disaster victims began to rebuild their homes. In order not to delay the disaster victims from working, they rowed the boat themselves. One day in October, Huo Jinwen tested the blood of patients at the heavy patient reception station. A doctor was rowing the boat to take her back to the district health center. Because he wasn't good at rowing, the boat started to sway in the middle of the river. The doctor rowed harder, and the boat swayed even more violently. The doctor shouted, "Sit tight! Sit tight!" Just then, the boat lurched, and Huo Jinwen fell into the water. She drank several mouthfuls of water. "My support to the disaster area depends entirely on the microscope. If I lose it, I won't be able to test the patients' blood. It would be a disgrace to live." This thought made her clench the microscope in her hand. She floated to the surface again and again, shouted, and then sank again. When she was rescued, she was extremely dizzy and vomiting, but the microscope and glass slides in her hand were not damaged at all.
    The next day, she had diarrhea. Other medical staff gave her medicine and told her to rest. She was afraid that the microscope would not be accurate if it was soaked in water, so she carefully wiped it with a cloth and pricked her finger to draw blood for testing.
    The Guizhou medical team worked in Guangji County, Hubei for more than four months, and treated more than 15,000 people just through outpatient visits, mobile treatment, laboratory tests, and routine surgical dressing changes. Before they left Guangji County, some patients who had recovered and were discharged from the hospital went back to see them, and some left their names and mailing addresses. The disaster area people's love for them made them realize the glory of being a people's medical worker even more.

    光荣的支援
    本报记者　刘希
    去年八月，贵州省组织了医疗队支援湖北灾区。医疗队的队员们，热心为灾区人民服务，受到了当地灾区人民的爱戴，光荣地被当地政府评为一等模范单位。在六个队员中有五个被评为二等个人模范。
    这支医疗队到湖北后，被分配到广济县工作。那时，在这一带的灾民中，流行着痢疾、虐疾等疾病。他们在当地党委和人民政府的领导下，同本地的医务工作者一道积极展开防疫和治疗工作，救护了患痢疾、阑尾炎、膀胱破裂等重伤病人。他们还先后分别建立了重病人收容站和手术室。他们在工作中不分晴天下雨，日日夜夜地给患者治病。有的队员到病人家里整夜看守着病人，自己感冒了也不休息。因为他们的人少，又分到几处工作，所以在重病人收容站里，不论医生、护士常常是一个人做着各种各样的工作。有时还喂病人吃饭，照顾病人大小便。医士龙汝梅一个人看护十九个病人，坚持了三天三夜。虽然工作很艰苦，可是队员们的精神都很愉快，情绪很高。他们热爱病人，有的病人没被子，他们把自己的被子给病人盖；病人要吃东西，他们就把自己买的鸡蛋给病人吃。二十岁的女化验员霍锦文，每天做完了门诊工作，还要坐船到龙坪重病人收容站给病人化验血，有时在夜里还帮助别的医务人员看护病人。
    最初，医疗队的队员从区卫生所到重病人收容站，来回过河有农民给他们划船。后来洪水退了，灾民开始重建家园。他们为了不耽误灾民做活，就自己划船。十月的一天，霍锦文给重病人收容站的病人验了血，坐船回区卫生所，划船的是个医生。因为他划不好船，船行到河中间摇晃起来了。医生用力划，船晃荡得更厉害了。医生喊着：“坐稳！坐稳！”就在这时候，船猛一颠，霍锦文落水了。她一连喝了几口水。“我来支援灾区就全靠显微镜，丢了它就无法给病人验血，自己活着也是耻辱。”这想法使她握紧了手里的显微镜。她一次又一次地从水里漂上来，喊一声，又沉下去。当她被救上来的时候，头晕得不行，光呕吐，但手里的显微镜和玻璃却没有一点损坏。
    第二天，她拉肚子。别的医务人员给她吃了药，要她睡下，她怕显微镜浸了水化验不准确，用布仔细地把它擦了一遍，并把自己的手指扎破取出血来化验。
    贵州医疗队在湖北广济县工作了四个多月，单是门诊、巡回治疗、化验及普通的外科换药就治疗了一万五千多人次。他们离开广济县以前，有些病愈出院的病人又回去看他们，有的留下了他们的姓名和通信地址。灾区人民对他们的爱戴，更使他们体会到作一个人民的医务工作者的光荣。
