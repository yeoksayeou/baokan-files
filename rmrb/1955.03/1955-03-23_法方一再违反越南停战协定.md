    French Side Repeatedly Violates Vietnamese Armistice Agreement
    Violations of Agreement Exceeded Two Thousand by End of January
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 22] According to a Vietnam News Agency report on March 21, the French Union forces have been incessantly violating the armistice agreement. According to incomplete statistics, from the date of the ceasefire to January 31, 1955, the French Union forces had violated the Geneva Accords 2,300 times within their temporary regrouping zones. Among these incidents, 822 people were killed, 3,742 were injured, and 13,459 were arrested.
    The Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission has repeatedly expressed its opinions regarding the French side's violations of the armistice agreement. For example, when the International Commission dealt with the cases of the Me Tri massacre, the Vinh Xuan massacre, and the Binh Thanh massacre, it reached the same conclusion: the French Union forces violated the provisions of Article 14, Paragraph C of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement.
    In addition, after investigating the incidents in Ai Nghia, Ha Lam, Xa Doc, Tam Ky, and Ngan Son, the International Commission also reached concrete conclusions regarding the French Union forces' infringement upon people's lives and democratic freedoms.
    The Vietnamese people condemn the French Union forces' increasing actions of undermining the Geneva Accords to the world, and demand that the French Union forces immediately cease such atrocities.

    法方一再违反越南停战协定
    到一月底违反协定事件达二千多起
    【新华社河内二十二日电】据越南通讯社二十一日报道，法兰西联邦部队违反停战协定的事件层出不穷。据不完全统计，从停战日到一九五五年一月三十一日止，法兰西联邦部队在他们的临时集结区内违反日内瓦协定的事件已达二千三百起。在这些事件中，有八百二十二人被杀害，三千七百四十二人受伤，一万三千四百五十九人被逮捕。
    越南国际监督和监察委员会对于法方违反停战协定的行为曾多次提出意见。例如，国际委员会在处理楳棋屠杀案、永春屠杀案和平成屠杀案时，都得出同样的结论：法兰西联邦部队违犯了越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条丙款的规定。
    此外，国际委员会在调查了爱义、河林、泽德、三歧、银山的事件后，也作出了关于法兰西联邦部队曾侵害人民生命和民主自由的具体结论。
    越南人民向世界谴责法兰西联邦部队日益增多的破坏日内瓦协定的行动，并且要求法兰西联邦部队立刻停止这种暴行。
