Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the first National Trade Union Labor Protection Work Conference in Beijing from March 8th to 19th, determining the guidelines and tasks for trade union labor protection work. The conference believed that over the past few years, the state has been very concerned about labor protection for workers, and the state's appropriations for improving safety and health equipment in enterprises have increased every year. In 1954 alone, according to incomplete statistics, enterprises across the country spent 39.6 million yuan (new currency) on labor protection. As a result, the working conditions of employees in enterprises have improved significantly, and industrial injuries and occupational diseases are decreasing year by year. However, labor protection work still cannot meet the needs of national construction and production development. In enterprises in the coal mining, construction, non-ferrous metals, and transportation sectors, the situation of casualties and occupational diseases remains very serious. At the same time, due to the lack of mass supervision in labor protection work, bureaucracy that neglects the safety and health of workers still exists, and there is also a lot of waste in the use of labor protection funds.

After discussion, the conference determined that trade union organizations must value and strengthen labor protection work. The basic tasks of trade unions in labor protection work at present are: to establish and improve mass labor protection work from top to bottom in terms of ideology, organization, and daily work, in order to assist and supervise enterprise administration, earnestly implement the policy of safe production, and ensure the safety and health of employees in production. The conference believed that trade union organizations must establish full-time labor protection institutions from top to bottom in a step-by-step manner, especially in trade union grassroots organizations, to establish labor protection work committees and labor protection inspectors in trade union groups, in order to mobilize and organize the vast number of activists to assist and supervise enterprise administration in complying with labor protection laws and regulations and improving working conditions. Secondly, trade union organizations should focus on promoting the experience of signing labor protection agreements in order to improve safety and health facilities in enterprises in a planned way and avoid wasting labor protection funds. At the same time, trade union organizations should assist enterprise administration in strengthening enterprise management and technical management in order to reduce or eliminate casualties.

The conference believed that trade union organizations must strengthen labor protection work in private enterprises, care about the special protection of female workers and juvenile workers, and continue to carry out seasonal labor protection work.

During the conference, Xu Daben, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry, Jin Zhifu, Chairman of the National Committee of the Coal Miners' Union, and Lai Jifa, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, reported to the conference on the situation of casualties in the coal mining industry and the heavy industry sector, as well as the issues of improving working conditions in the future. Ge.K. Latygin, Deputy Director of the Labor Protection Department of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, who was invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to lecture in China, and A.A. Koshkin, Advisor to the Ministry of Labor of the People's Republic of China and Soviet labor protection expert, reported to the conference on the experience of Soviet labor protection work. Representatives from various regions also exchanged experiences on labor protection work carried out by trade union grassroots organizations at the meeting.

A total of 194 representatives from various industrial trade unions, provincial (municipal) federations of trade unions, and grassroots organizations of factory and mine trade unions attended and participated in the conference. Cadres from the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, and various industrial departments responsible for labor protection work of the People's Republic of China also participated in the conference. Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Mao Qihua, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Labor, reported to the conference on labor protection work.

    全国总工会召开劳动保护工作会议
    确定工会组织要重视和加强劳动保护工作
    【新华社二十一日讯】中华全国总工会在三月八日到十九日在北京召开第一次全国工会劳动保护工作会议，确定了工会劳动保护工作的方针和任务。会议认为：几年来，国家对工人的劳动保护是十分关心的，国家用于改善企业中的安全卫生设备的拨款每年都有增加。单是一九五四年不完全的统计，全国各企业用于劳动保护的经费就有三千九百六十万元（新币）。因此，企业中职工劳动条件已有显著改善，工伤事故与职业病正在逐年降低。但是，劳动保护工作还不能满足国家建设与生产发展的需要。在煤矿、建筑、有色金属与运输部门的企业中，伤亡事故与职业病情况依然十分严重。同时，由于劳动保护工作缺乏群众性的监督，忽视工人安全健康的官僚主义还是存在，劳动保护经费的使用也有不少浪费。
    会议经过讨论确定：工会组织必须重视与加强劳动保护工作。当前工会在劳动保护工作方面的基本任务是：自上而下地在思想上、组织上和日常工作中，把群众劳动保护工作建立与健全起来，以协助与监督企业行政，切实贯彻安全生产的方针，保障生产中职工的安全与健康。会议认为工会组织必须自上而下地、有步骤地建立劳动保护专职机构，特别是要在工会基层组织中，建立劳动保护工作委员会与工会小组劳动保护检查员，以便动员和组织广大积极分子，协助与监督企业行政遵守劳动保护法令和改善劳动条件。其次，工会组织要有重点地推广签订劳动保护协议书的经验，以便有计划地改进企业中的安全卫生设施，避免浪费劳动保护资金的现象。同时，工会组织要协助企业行政加强企业管理与技术管理，以减少或消除伤亡事故。
    会议认为：工会组织必须加强私营企业中的劳动保护工作，关心女工及未成年工的特殊保护，并继续开展季节性的劳动保护工作。
    会议期间，燃料工业部副部长徐达本，煤矿工会全国委员会主席金直夫和重工业部副部长赖际发，向大会作了煤矿工业与重工业方面伤亡事故情况及今后改善劳动条件问题的报告。应中华全国总工会邀请来中国讲学的苏联工会中央理事会劳动保护部副部长格·柯·拉蒂金及中华人民共和国劳动部顾问、苏联劳动保护专家阿·阿·柯希金向大会报告了有关苏联劳动保护工作的经验。各地代表还在会上交流了工会基层组织进行劳动保护工作的经验。
    出席和列席这次会议的有各产业工会、各省（市）工会联合会和厂矿工会基层组织的代表共一百九十四人。中华人民共和国劳动部、卫生部和各工业部门负责劳动保护工作的干部也参加了这次会议。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚和劳动部副部长毛齐华向会议作了有关劳动保护工作的报告。
