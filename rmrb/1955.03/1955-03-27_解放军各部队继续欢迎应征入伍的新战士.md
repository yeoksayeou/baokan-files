Xinhua News Agency, March 26th:

    The various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army continue to welcome newly enlisted soldiers.
    Before the arrival of the new soldiers, veteran soldiers in the Northeast Military Region cleaned the barracks and put up welcome slogans. Many companies published special welcome editions of their wall newspapers and blackboards. An air force unit even specially arranged a "Hall of Glory," displaying the deeds of heroes and meritorious individuals in the unit. Soldiers of a certain infantry unit braved ice and snow a month ago to carry earth and dig mud to build warm kangs, waiting for new comrades to live in them. When the new soldiers arrived at the unit's station, the welcoming teams organized by the units beat gongs and drums to welcome the new soldiers into the barracks. The units universally held welcoming meetings for the new soldiers. Some units also held get-togethers, entertainment evenings, or discussion forums. Many veteran soldiers gave the new soldiers gifts such as toothpaste and soap that they had prepared long ago. Some even bought notebooks and copied their past political and cultural study notes to give to their new comrades.
    Every company in the Northwest Military Region units rehearsed literary and artistic programs, published blackboards and wall newspapers welcoming "new comrades," and organized welcoming teams. On the day the new soldiers arrived at a certain unit, all the officers and soldiers rushed to the station to greet them before dawn. The cooks were busy boiling water for the new soldiers to wash their faces and preparing meals, while others scrambled to clean the houses where the new soldiers would live and lit the stoves. After the newly enlisted soldiers arrived at the units, each unit held welcome evenings and performed many wonderful programs.
    The units of the North China Military Region have also warmly welcomed new soldiers into the army recently. When the new soldiers arrived at a certain unit, the welcoming line stretched from the gate of the barracks all the way to the station, and the new soldiers walked towards the barracks amidst the sound of gongs and drums and cheers. The leaders of the unit also greeted them and shook hands with the new soldiers one by one cordially. The new soldiers said with emotion: It really feels like coming home.
    The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army guarding the Southeast coastal defense front immediately ran seven or eight miles from their station to welcome the new soldiers when they heard they were coming. The veteran soldiers and new soldiers shook hands and greeted each other warmly upon meeting. After arriving at the station, the veteran soldiers enthusiastically invited the new soldiers to take a bath and get a haircut, and a welcome party was held in the evening, where the new and veteran soldiers performed many wonderful programs together.
