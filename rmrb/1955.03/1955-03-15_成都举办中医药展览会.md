After seeing the Traditional Chinese Medicine Exhibition in Chengdu, people deeply felt the richness of the motherland's medical heritage.

The exhibition displayed over 350 kinds of classic Chinese medicine works from past dynasties, including "Neijing" (Huangdi Neijing), "Nanjing" (Classic of Difficulties), "Shanghan Lun" (Treatise on Cold Damage), "Jinkui Yaolüe" (Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber), "Ben Cao Gang Mu" (Compendium of Materia Medica), and "Chan Bao" (Obstetric Treasure). The exhibition also displayed more than 400 kinds of commonly used Chinese medicines and medical records and photos of intractable diseases cured after the exchange of experience between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. He Mingen, a patient at the Chengdu First People's Hospital, suffered from severe cirrhosis of the liver. After consultation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine practitioners, he was rescued with traditional Chinese medicine, and the effect was very good.

The last part of the exhibition displayed articles from newspapers and magazines before liberation in which the Kuomintang reactionary government slandered traditional Chinese medicine and advocated banning traditional Chinese medicine. The exhibition also used charts, materials, and photos to show the Communist Party and the People's Government's support for the cause of traditional Chinese medicine after liberation. From these exhibits, it can be seen that after liberation, more than 1,200 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Chengdu participated in prevention, medical treatment, and other work, and 99 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were rated as municipal and district-level health models.

This exhibition was jointly organized by the Chengdu Municipal Health Bureau, the Cultural Bureau, the Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Popularization Association, and the Sichuan Provincial Library. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    成都举办中医药展览会
    看了成都市的中医药展览会，人们深深感觉到祖国医学遗产的丰富。
    这个展览会里陈列着我国历代的中医药经典著作三百五十多种。其中有“内经”、“难经”、“伤寒论”、“金匮要略”、“本草纲目”和“产宝”等。展览会还展览出了四百多种常用的中药，陈列了中西医交流经验后治好的疑难疾病的医案和照片。成都市第一人民医院病人何鸣恩患严重肝硬化症，经中西医会诊，用中药抢救，效果很好。
    展览会的最后一部分，陈列着解放前国民党反动政府在报章杂志上污蔑中医和主张取缔中医中药的文章。展览会并通过图表、资料和照片显示了解放后共产党和人民政府扶植中医中药事业的情况。从这些展览品可以看到：解放后成都市有一千二百多名中医参加了预防、医疗等工作，有九十九名中医曾被评为市、区两级卫生模范。
    这个展览会是由成都市卫生局、文化局、四川省科学技术普及协会和四川省图书馆联合举办的。     （据新华社讯）
