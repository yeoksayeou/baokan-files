    Sichuan Holds Folk Music and Dance Selection Performance

    Sichuan Province held its second Folk Music and Dance Selection Performance from February 21st to 24th. More than 160 performers from nine special districts, including Nanchong and Wenjiang, performed 37 folk music and dance programs in 18 forms at the event.

    The majority of the performers were farmers. The "Sitting Song Hall" performed by ten rural women from Nanchong Special District, the "E'e Lantern" performed by the rural amateur troupe from Deyang County, and the "Mountain Songs" performed by elderly farmers Peng Daxing and Zhang Yunsong, both over seventy years old, from Wenjiang Special District, were all warmly praised by the audience.

    Many long-lost folk art programs also participated in the performance. Zhang Julin, a bamboo and hemp worker from Qionglai County, and others, whose "Bamboo and Hemp Work Songs" had not been sung for many years before liberation, also participated in the performance, and their singing was unanimously praised.

    四川举行民间音乐舞蹈选拔会演
    四川省从二月二十一日到二十四日举行了第二届民间音乐舞蹈选拔会演。来自南充、温江等九个专区的一百六十多个演员，在会上演出了十八种形式的三十七个民间音乐舞蹈节目。
    演员们绝大部分是农民。南充专区十个农村妇女演唱的“坐歌堂”，德阳县农村业余剧团演出的“蛾蛾灯”，温江专区七十多岁的老农民彭大兴、张云松等演唱的“山歌”等节目都受到观众热烈赞赏。
    参加会演的还有许多失传已久的民间艺术节目。邛崃县竹麻工人张举林等在解放前多年不唱的“竹麻号子”，这次也参加了会演，他们的演唱受到了一致好评。               （新华社）
