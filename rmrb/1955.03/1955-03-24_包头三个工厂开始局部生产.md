Partial production has begun at the newly built Auto Repair Factory, Woodworking Factory, and the expanded Refractory Material Factory in Baotou in 1954.

	Inside the main factory building of the Baotou Auto Repair Factory, dozens of new machines are running, and furnaces are burning; workers from Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang and other places are busy inspecting and repairing automobile parts.

	A 250-ton down-draft kiln built in 1954 at the Baotou Refractory Material Factory was put into production in January 1955. Before production, the kiln underwent a baking test, which proved the good quality of the kiln. The new kiln has a high production capacity, about four times larger than the original round kiln, and can fire high-grade clay bricks.

	The main factory building of the Baotou Woodworking Factory will be built in 1955. However, in order to meet the needs of construction, the factory has already started production in temporary factory buildings. In early March, more than ten new machines, such as band saws, boring machines, and automatic planers, were put into production. More than two hundred workers from Beijing, Jinzhou, and other places are manufacturing wooden furniture such as beds, tables, chairs, and cabinets.

    包头三个工厂开始局部生产
    一九五四年在包头新建的汽车修配厂、木器厂和扩建的耐火器材厂已局部开工生产。
    在包头汽车修配厂主体厂房里，数十台新机器开动着，烘炉燃烧起来；来自北京、天津、沈阳等地的工人们，正忙着检查和修配汽车机件。
    包头耐火器材厂在一九五四年建设的一座二百五十吨倒焰式的大圆窑，已在一九五五年一月间投入生产。这座窑在生产前曾进行了烤窑试烧，结果证明窑的质量良好。新窑的生产能力很高，比原有圆窑的生产能力约大四倍，并且可以烧制高级粘土质火砖。
    包头木器厂的主要厂房将在一九五五年兴建。但这个厂为适应建设需要，已在临时厂房里开始生产。三月初，有带锯、打眼机、自动刨等十多台新机器投入生产。二百多名来自北京、锦州等地的工人们，承制着床、桌、椅、柜等木器家具。
