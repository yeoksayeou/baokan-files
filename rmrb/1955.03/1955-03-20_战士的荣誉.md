    On the Fujian front, I visited many cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, all of whom believe that standing on the front lines of liberating Taiwan and defending the motherland is the greatest honor the motherland has bestowed upon them; they maintain this honor with boundless loyalty in their respective positions.

    Wang Wenjin, a second-class hero of the East China Air Defense Force and a anti-aircraft gunner, discovered an enemy artillery shell fired by the Chiang bandit troops' ground artillery during an air defense operation. Wang Wenjin immediately pounced on the cannon, using his chest to protect the cannon's eyes—the sight. I asked him if he had thought about his own safety at the time. He said, "The motherland sent me to this glorious post, and I cannot only care about my own safety. Defending the safety of the motherland and the happy lives of the people is the honor of a people's soldier, and a soldier's honor is more precious than life!" He opened a notebook with many addresses of people who had sent him letters of condolence. He said, "In order not to forget the people's entrustment, I write down the address after reading each letter of condolence. Every time I open the notebook, I feel that millions of pairs of eyes are watching me, as if asking: How is the task entrusted to you being completed? My heart beats faster and my blood surges. I thought, if I let the Chiang bandit planes slip past the cannon and run wild over the heads of my relatives, what kind of anti-aircraft gunner would I be?" In this way, since last September, Wang Wenjin and his comrades in the company have shot down or damaged twelve Chiang bandit planes, using their victorious battles to maintain the honor of the soldier.

    I also talked about the honor of a soldier with Cai E, a well-known combat hero and battalion commander of a certain unit. He attended the National Congress of Combat Heroes. He said, "When I saw Chairman Mao in Huairen Hall, and when I received flowers and cheers from people, I felt that this was a great honor and happiness; but when I thought that the motherland's territory of Taiwan had not yet been liberated and my own task had not yet been completed, I felt ashamed and my heart was burning and I could not calm down." The regimental political commissar told me that Cai E became even more motivated every time he returned from a conference. In order to master the commanding art of modern warfare and train his subordinates well, Cai E spent countless sleepless nights. Sometimes, in order to formulate a military training plan, he often wrote until the middle of the night; during the day, he would take the lesson plan and combat regulations, training outlines, and run to the field to conduct on-the-spot research and contemplation, even issuing lessons to imaginary teams in the wilderness. Cai E said, "Strive to do everything well, resolutely complete the historical task of liberating Taiwan, and defend the security of the motherland. This is the greatest honor of the people's soldiers." It is this noble sense of honor that inspires the soldiers to create admirable heroic deeds in the struggle, and inspires the soldiers to prepare day and night to dedicate everything they have to the liberation of Taiwan!

    战士的荣誉
    新华社记者  谢丁
    在福建前线，我访问了人民解放军的很多干部和战士，他们都认为站在解放台湾、保卫祖国的最前线，是祖国人民给予自己的最大荣誉；他们在各自的岗位上，以无限的忠诚，维护着这种荣誉。
    华东防空部队二级英雄高射炮手王文进，在一次对空作战中，发现蒋贼军地面炮兵射来一颗炮弹，王文进立刻扑到大炮上，用自己的胸膛保护了大炮的眼睛——瞄准器。我问他，当时他是否也想到自己的安全，他说：“祖国让我到这个光荣的岗位上，我不能只顾自己的安全，保卫祖国的安全和人民的幸福生活，这是一个人民战士的荣誉，而战士的荣誉比生命贵重得多！”他打开一个笔记本，上面抄写了许多他收到的写慰问信的人的通讯地址，他说：“为了不忘人民的嘱托，我读完一封慰问信就把地址记下来；每次翻开笔记本，我就觉得人们的千万双眼睛都在望着我，好像是问：交给你的任务完成得怎么样了？我的心就砰砰地跳动，热血直往上涌。我想，如果让蒋贼飞机从大炮上空溜过去，飞到亲人头上撒野，我还算个什么样的高射炮兵呀？”就是这样，从去年九月以来，王文进和他所在连队的战友们先后击落击伤蒋贼飞机十二架，他们用胜利的战斗维护着战士的荣誉。
    我也曾和著名的战斗英雄、某部营长蔡萼谈起战士的荣誉。他出席过全国战斗英雄代表会议，他说：“在怀仁堂看见毛主席的时候，在接受人们献花欢呼的时候，固然感到这是很大的荣誉和幸福；但一想起祖国的领土台湾还没有解放，自己的任务还没有完成，我就感到羞耻，心里火辣辣地无法平静下来。”团政治委员告诉我，蔡萼每次参加大会回来，就更加奋发前进。蔡萼为了掌握现代化战争的指挥艺术，训练好部属，蔡萼不知度过了多少不眠之夜。他有时为制订一个军训教案，经常写到半夜三更；白天还拿起教案和战斗条令、训练大纲，跑到野外去实地研究、沉思，甚至对着旷野中想像的队伍下达课目。蔡萼说：“努力做好一切准备，坚决完成解放台湾的历史任务，保卫祖国安全，这就是人民战士的最大荣誉。”正是这种崇高荣誉感鼓舞着战士们在斗争中创造出可歌可泣的英雄业迹，鼓舞着战士们日夜不息地准备为解放台湾而献出自己的一切！
