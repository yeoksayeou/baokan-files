    Shanghai Batch of Skilled Workers Participate in Key Construction Projects
    On March 11th, approximately 600 more metalworking technicians from Shanghai departed for enterprises such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant to participate in key national basic construction work.

    This is the final batch of technicians in the third phase of Shanghai's mobilization of metalworking technicians to participate in key national construction projects. This effort began at the end of 1954 and has now concluded. A total of more than 11,000 technicians signed up, and approximately 2,200 were approved. They are all Class 4 or higher skilled workers in machining, fitting, milling, grinding, electric welding, and instrumentation. In early February 1955, 860 technicians arrived at enterprises such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The 700 plus technicians assigned to the tractor factory, ball bearing factory, and oil refinery first went to the Shanghai Motor Factory, Shanghai Refinery, and other units to study and work, and will go to participate in production after the tractor factory and other factories are completed.

    Currently, relevant units in Shanghai are planning the next phase of mobilizing metalworking technicians to support key construction projects, and related factories and enterprises are also actively cultivating, training, and improving the skills of workers to ensure a continuous supply of skilled workers and the development of national construction.

    上海一批技工参加重点建设
    三月十一日，上海市又有约六百名五金技工分赴第一汽车制造厂等企业，参加国家重点基本建设工作。
    这是上海市第三批动员五金技工参加国家重点建设工作中的最末一批技工。这一工作从一九五四年年底开始，到现在已告结束，报名参加的技工共有一万一千多名，被批准的约二千二百多名，他们都是技术在四级以上的车工、钳工、铣工、磨工、电焊工和仪表技工。一九五五年二月初曾有八百六十名技工到达第一汽车制造厂等企业；分配到拖拉机厂、滚珠轴承厂和炼油厂工作的七百多名技工，也于二月中旬先到上海电机厂、上海炼油厂等单位学习和工作，等拖拉机厂等工厂建成后再前往参加生产。
    目前，上海市有关单位正在筹划下一批动员五金技工支援重点建设的计划和任务，有关的工厂企业也在积极培养训练和提高工人的技术，保证不断地输送技术工人，发展国家建设事业。（葛明）
