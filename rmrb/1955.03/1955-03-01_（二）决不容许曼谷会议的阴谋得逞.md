　　(II) Absolutely Not Allow the Bangkok Conference Conspiracy to Succeed

　　The Manila Treaty, signed in September 1954 by the United States, Britain, France, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan, is a treaty preparing for war and expanding aggression, a treaty attempting to strangle the Asian national liberation movement and enslave the Asian people. The Southeast Asia military alliance established under this treaty has become an important tool for the United States to pursue its aggressive and war policies in the Far East. To further the service of this military alliance to the aggressive and war policies of the United States, especially to further undermine the Geneva Accords, the United States and its followers recently held a three-day Bangkok conference.

　　As everyone knows, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, which not only brought an end to the eight-year-long Indochina War but also created conditions for further easing tensions in the Far East and establishing a peaceful region in Asia. In order to undermine the Geneva Accords, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and create new tensions in Asia, the United States organized the Southeast Asia military alliance with the People's Republic of China as its main target.

　　The Manila Treaty includes Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai Vietnam into its protected area, which is a blatant indication of the deliberate undermining of the Geneva Accords by the United States and its followers. The development of the situation after the signing of the Manila Treaty proves that the United States is adopting various steps and methods to interfere in the internal affairs of the three Indochina countries, trying to drag Laos, Cambodia, and Bao Dai Vietnam into the Southeast Asia group to oppose China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The United States has directly controlled the troops of Bao Dai Vietnam. The United States and France are stepping up discussions on plans to train Cambodian troops, and the United States has signed an agreement with the Cambodian government to build a so-called "modernized port" that is actually an American naval base. The United States not only supports the armed forces of Laos with airdropped war materials to attack the gathering areas of the Lao Patriotic Forces, but also expresses its intention to "strengthen the strength of the government" by "supplying large amounts of equipment." The United States not only openly instructs Ngo Dinh Diem to obstruct and undermine the elections in Vietnam, but also instigates Laos and Cambodia through its followers, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand, to become members of the Southeast Asia military alliance directly or indirectly. This seriously violates the principles of the Geneva Accords on resolving the political issues of Indochina and violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords that the three Indochina countries shall not participate in any military alliances and shall not be allowed to be used to resume hostile actions or serve aggressive policies.

　　Dulles openly declared at the Bangkok conference that the United States would use "hundreds of millions of dollars annually as military support for the defense forces of free Vietnam (Bao Dai Vietnam), Laos, and Cambodia." Dulles also went to Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam for conspiratorial activities after the Bangkok conference. All this fully exposes the sinister attempt of the United States to further undermine the Geneva Accords. Therefore, it can be expected that the United States will not only expand its interference in the internal affairs of the three Indochina countries, but also try to constantly create incidents in order to achieve the goal of undermining peace in Indochina. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the activities of the United States to further undermine the Geneva Accords not only seriously threaten peace in Indochina, but also seriously threaten the security of China. This cannot but arouse the serious attention of the Chinese people, the people of the three Indochina countries, and the people of all peace-loving Asian countries.

　　The participants of the Bangkok conference said in the communiqué of the meeting that they "hate war" and are determined to "maintain and strengthen peace." They also said that there is a "threat of armed aggression" in the "treaty area" and that "it is essential for member governments to take steps to consolidate common defense." Everyone knows that the current threat to peace and security in the Far East comes from none other than the United States itself. According to Dulles himself, "the strength of the U.S. Pacific forces, now equipped with atomic weapons, is greater than the strength during the most intense period of World War II in 1945." Deploying such "strong" forces is certainly not because of "hatred of war," but to prepare for war; certainly not to "maintain and strengthen peace," but to threaten and undermine peace. Dulles also admitted that the United States is carrying out "extensive military assistance" in various parts of the Far East, and includes China's Taiwan, South Korea, and the three Indochina countries into its "defense line." Such "military arrangements" are certainly not for "defense," but for aggression. The military organization established by the Bangkok conference is precisely an agency for implementing the U.S. military aggression plan, and the United States will use this military organization to subordinate the military forces of the Manila Treaty member states to the U.S. war machine. As the "Indian Times" pointed out: The Manila Treaty is "a brazen application of the simplistic theory that security can be obtained by amassing military power." The "Rangoon Daily" also pointed out that "in fact, the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty is just a tool for the United States to invade Asia, and the so-called security of the Southeast Asia region is the United States creating war in Southeast Asia in order to seize profits."

　　The participants of the Bangkok conference also touted the "objectives" of their so-called "Pacific Charter," saying that they were to "maintain" the "equal rights and self-determination rights" of the people of all countries, and that they were to "promote and guarantee" the "autonomy and independence" of all countries. They attempted to make people believe that it was not they themselves who were interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, but some "subversive activities" "directed from the outside." However, as everyone knows, the Manila Treaty itself is first and foremost something that stands in opposition to the principles of national independence, sovereignty, and national rights, and this treaty is for the benefit of colonialism. As Mr. Menon of India said in the Federal Assembly debate: "Small-scale conventions, including those of backward countries, have the characteristics of colonialism, and there is always the danger that the territories of these backward countries will be used to achieve the purposes of these conventions." Today, in many parts of Asia, who is interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and supporting puppet regimes, if not the United States and its followers? The Bangkok conference decided to establish a so-called "anti-subversive activities" organization to "strengthen cooperation in anti-subversive and infiltration activities." This shows that the United States and its followers will strengthen the suppression of the national liberation movement and the peaceful democratic movement of the people of Asian countries, and will send special agents, create incidents, and undermine peace in the region under the pretext of "anti-subversive activities." However, this conspiracy cannot escape the condemnation of public opinion. "Indonesian News" said: "The Bangkok conference will plan to establish military headquarters and intelligence centers to expand Western power in Asia in order to control Asia. This is direct interference in Asian countries."

　　In order to cover up the aggressive, war-like, and colonial nature of the Manila Treaty military alliance, the Bangkok conference also passed a highly hypocritical "resolution on the Asian-African Conference," hoping that the member states participating in the Asian-African Conference would "share" the "tasks of the Pacific Charter." However, the task of the Asian-African Conference is to promote friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence between Asian and African countries, and to discuss common issues of particular interest to the people of Asian and African countries, such as issues related to national sovereignty and colonialism. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru appropriately pointed out in the People's Assembly that the Asian-African Conference is not to "establish a group hostile to others," but "an experiment in implementing coexistence." This is completely different from the hostile Manila Treaty military alliance and the tasks of the Bangkok conference. The purpose of the participants of the Bangkok conference in doing so is obviously to undermine the Asian-African Conference. As the Indonesian "People's Daily" said: "The purpose of the Bangkok conference is war, while the purpose of the Asian-African conference is world peace. The former attempts to expand military treaties, while the latter advocates expanding peaceful regions."

　　The results of the Bangkok conference expose the major conspiracies of the United States to further undermine the Geneva Accords, expand the aggressive bloc, and more recklessly interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries and enslave the Asian people. This is a threat to peace in Indochina and a threat to peace in Asia. This is resolutely opposed by the peace-loving and anti-colonial Asian people.

　　The results of the Bangkok conference show that the U.S. policy of undermining the Geneva Accords has received the support of Britain and the consent of France. It should be pointed out that the United States and its followers must bear full responsibility for all the consequences that may arise from their further undermining of the various agreements of the Geneva Conference.

    （二）决不容许曼谷会议的阴谋得逞
    一九五四年九月间由美国、英国、法国、新西兰、澳大利亚、菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦签订的马尼拉条约，是一个准备战争和扩大侵略的条约，是企图扼杀亚洲民族解放运动和奴役亚洲人民的条约。根据这个条约建立起来的东南亚军事同盟，已经成为美国在远东推行其侵略政策和战争政策的重要工具。为了使这个军事同盟进一步为美国的侵略政策和战争政策服务，特别是为了进一步破坏日内瓦协议，美国和它的追随者最近举行了历时三天的曼谷会议。
    大家知道，日内瓦会议达成关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，不仅使延续了八年之久的印度支那战争能够停止下来，并为进一步缓和远东的紧张局势和在亚洲建立和平地区创造了条件。美国为了破坏日内瓦协议、干涉亚洲国家的内政，在亚洲制造新的紧张局势，便组织了以中华人民共和国为主要敌对目标的东南亚军事同盟。
    马尼拉条约把老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南划入它的保护区域，这是美国和它的追随者蓄意破坏日内瓦协议的露骨表示。马尼拉条约签订后事态的发展证明，美国采用各种步骤和方法来干涉印度支那三国的内政，力图把老挝、柬埔寨和保大越南拖入东南亚集团，来反对中国和越南民主共和国。美国已经直接控制了保大越南的部队。美国和法国正在加紧讨论训练柬埔寨军队的计划，美国已经同柬埔寨政府签订了建筑一个实际上是美国海军基地的所谓“现代化港口”的协定。美国不仅以飞机空投作战物资来支持老挝的武装部队进攻寮国抗战部队的集结地区，并且表示要在“供应大量装备的情况下”，“加强该地政府的力量”。美国不仅公然指使吴庭艳阻挠和破坏越南的选举，并且通过澳大利亚、菲律宾和泰国这些追随者策动老挝和柬埔寨直接地或间接地变成东南亚军事同盟的成员国。这就严重地违反了日内瓦协议关于解决印度支那政治问题的原则，违反了日内瓦协议关于印度支那三国不得参加任何军事同盟，不容许利用来恢复敌对行动或服务于侵略政策的规定。
    杜勒斯在曼谷会议上公然宣称，美国每年要用“数亿美元来作为对自由越南（保大越南）、老挝和柬埔寨的国防部队的军事支援”。杜勒斯并且在曼谷会议以后去老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部进行阴谋活动。这一切都充分暴露了美国要进一步破坏日内瓦协议的罪恶企图。因此，可以预料，美国不仅要扩大干涉印度支那三国的内政，并且还企图不断制造事端，以达到破坏印度支那和平的目的。同时必须指出，美国进一步破坏日内瓦协议的活动，不仅严重地威胁着印度支那的和平，并且也将严重地威胁到中国的安全。这就不能不引起中国人民、印度支那三国人民和所有爱好和平的亚洲各国人民的严重注意。
    曼谷会议的参加者们在会议的公报中说，他们“憎恨战争”，决心“维护和加强和平”。他们又说，在“条约地区”内存在着“武装侵略的威胁”，“成员国政府十分有必要采取步骤来巩固共同防御”。任何人都知道，目前威胁着远东的和平和安全的，不是别人，正是美国自己。据杜勒斯自己宣布，“现在配备着原子武器的美国驻太平洋部队的兵力，比一九四五年第二次世界大战最剧烈的时候的兵力还要强大”。调遣这样“强大”的兵力当然不是因为“憎恨战争”，而是为了准备战争，当然不是为了“维护和加强和平”，而是为了威胁和破坏和平。杜勒斯还承认，美国在远东各地进行“广泛军事援助”，而把中国的台湾、朝鲜南部和印度支那三国都划入它的“防御线”内。这样的“军事安排”当然不是为了“防御”，而是为了侵略。曼谷会议成立的军事组织，正是执行美国军事侵略计划的机构，美国将通过这个军事组织，使马尼拉条约成员国的军事力量从属于美国的战争机器。正如“印度时报”指出：马尼拉条约是“对安全能够靠聚集军事力量来获得的这种简单理论的无耻的应用”。“仰光日报”也指出，“实际上所谓东南亚防务条约只是美国侵略亚洲的工具，所谓东南亚地区的安全，就是美国为了攫取利润在东南亚制造战争。”
    曼谷会议的参加者还标榜他们的所谓“太平洋宪章”的“目的”，说他们是要“维护”各国人民的“平等权利和自决权”的，说他们是要“促进和保证”一切国家的“自治和独立”的。他们企图使人们相信，干涉别国内政的，好像不是他们自己，而是什么“受外界指挥”的“颠覆活动”。然而，尽人皆知，马尼拉条约本身首先就是一个同国家独立主权和民族权利的原则相对立的东西，这个条约就是为了殖民主义的利益的。正如印度梅农先生在联邦院辩论时所说：“包括落后国家在内的小规模公约含有殖民主义的特性，并总是存在着这种危险：这些落后国家的领土将被利用来实现这些公约的目的。”今天在亚洲许多地方干涉别国内政，扶植傀儡政权的，不正是美国和它的追随者吗？曼谷会议决定要成立一个所谓“反颠覆活动”组织，“加强在反颠覆和渗透活动方面的合作办法”。这说明美国和它的追随者将加强镇压亚洲国家的民族解放运动和各国人民的和平民主运动，将在“反颠覆活动”的借口下，派遣特务，制造事端，破坏这个地区的和平。但是，这个阴谋是不能逃避公众舆论的谴责的。“印度尼西亚新闻”说：“曼谷会议将计划建立军事总部和情报中心来扩大西方在亚洲的势力，以便控制亚洲。这是对亚洲国家的直接干涉。”
    为了掩盖马尼拉条约军事同盟的侵略性质、战争性质和殖民主义性质，曼谷会议还极端虚伪地通过了一项“关于亚非会议的决议”，希望参加亚非会议的成员国“分担”什么“太平洋宪章的任务”。但是，亚非会议的任务是要促进亚非各国间的友好合作，和平共处，讨论对亚非国家人民具有特别利害关系的共同问题，例如有关民族主权和殖民主义的问题。最近印度总理尼赫鲁在人民院中恰当地指出，亚非会议不是要“成立一个同他人敌对的集团”，而是“实行共处方面的一种实验”。这同敌对性的马尼拉条约军事同盟和曼谷会议的任务是毫无相同之处的。曼谷会议的参加者这样做的目的，显然是为了破坏亚非会议。正如印度尼西亚“人民日报”所说：“曼谷会议的目的在于战争，而亚非会议的目的在于世界和平。前者企图扩大军事条约，后者主张扩大和平地区。”
    曼谷会议的结果暴露了美国企图进一步破坏日内瓦协议、扩大侵略集团和更加肆无忌惮干涉亚洲各国内政和奴役亚洲人民的重大阴谋。这是对于印度支那和平的威胁，对于亚洲和平的威胁。这是爱好和平、反对殖民主义的亚洲各国人民所坚决反对的。
    曼谷会议的结果表明，美国破坏日内瓦协议的政策是得到了英国的支持和法国的同意的。应该指出，美国和它的追随者必须对它们进一步破坏日内瓦会议各项协议所可能引起的一切后果，担负完全的责任。
