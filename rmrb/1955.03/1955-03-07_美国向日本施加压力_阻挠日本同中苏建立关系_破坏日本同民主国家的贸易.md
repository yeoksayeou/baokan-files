Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 6th: Tokyo dispatch: Following the news that the United States government decided to invite Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama or Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu to Washington, Shigemitsu told reporters on the 4th that he supported sending a high-ranking government official, if possible the Foreign Minister, to the United States to try to communicate opinions between Japan and the United States. According to Agence France-Presse, citing sources close to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, this step by the Japanese government is mainly aimed at obtaining the "understanding and support" of the United States before starting negotiations with the Soviet Union.

It has been previously reported that the United States is trying to exert pressure on Japan in an attempt to prevent Japan from establishing normal relations with China and the Soviet Union. According to Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Washington, Iwadate, on the 5th, the United States government welcomed Shigemitsu's remarks. The reporter said that the United States government "always has some uneasiness about the future attitude of the Japanese government. Although the Hatoyama government said it would base its policy on cooperation with the United States, it actively put forward the slogan of approaching China and the Soviet Union during the election and won the victory. Therefore, the United States government hopes that Prime Minister Hatoyama's two-sided diplomacy will greatly return to the path of cooperation with the United States after the election."

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 6th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported on the 6th that the United States is preparing a plan to restrict Japan from expanding trade with countries in the peaceful democratic camp.

The United States is threatening and intimidating Japanese traders. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that, according to Japanese government sources, if Japanese companies with branches in the United States send trade representatives to peaceful democratic countries, the United States government may freeze the assets of these Japanese companies in the United States.

The newspaper also said that it appears the United States has notified Japan that products obtained by Japan from peaceful democratic countries are not allowed to be exported to the United States and Okinawa.

    破坏日本同民主国家的贸易
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：在美国政府决定邀请日本首相鸠山一郎或外务相重光葵到华盛顿去的消息传出后，重光葵四日向记者说：他赞成让一位政府高级官员，如果可能的话，让外务相到美国去设法沟通日美两国之间的意见。据法新社引日本接近外务省人士的话透露，日本政府的这一步骤主要是想在同苏联开始谈判前获得美国的“谅解和支持”。
    前已报道，美国正在设法向日本施加压力，企图阻挠日本同中国和苏联建立正常关系。据共同社驻华盛顿记者岩馆五日报道，美国政府对重光的谈话表示欢迎。记者说，美国政府“对日本政府今后的态度总有一些不安的感觉。鸠山政府虽然说要以对美合作政策为基础，但在大选时又积极提出接近中、苏的口号，而获得了胜利。因此，美国政府希望首相鸠山的两面外交在大选完毕后的今天，重新大大地转回到对美合作的路线上来。”
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：日本“读卖新闻”六日报道说，美国正在准备箝制日本扩大同和平民主阵营国家的贸易的计划。
    美国正在对日本贸易商进行威胁和恫吓。“读卖新闻”说，据日本政府人士说，如果在美国设有分公司的日本公司派贸易代表到和平民主国家去的话，美国政府可能冻结这些日本公司在美国的财产。
    这家报纸还说，看来，美国已经通知过日本，日本从和平民主国家得来的产品，不准出口到美国和冲绳岛去。
