Why Establish a State-Led Rural Grain Market
Kang Weizhong

One of the effective ways to organize the surplus grain of society and adjust the variety of grains after the completion of the unified purchase and sale of grain is to run state-owned grain markets well. Since the spring of 1954, more than 30,700 grain markets have been established across the country. Most of these markets were suspended after the unified purchase and sale campaign of autumn 1954. Now, they have been gradually restored, recovering to 30% to 50% of the original markets in 1954. The current problem is that about 50% to 70% of the grain markets have not been restored, and those that have been restored have not fully played their due role because the grain on the market is sometimes abundant and sometimes scarce, sometimes available and sometimes not. At present, it is the busy season for spring plowing, and the broad masses of farmers, due to the needs of production and life, hope to conduct grain transactions and adjust grain varieties. The already restored grain markets, both in quantity and quality, are far from meeting the needs of the farmers.

Restoring and running state-owned grain markets well is by no means an easy task. There are many ideological obstacles to be removed among cadres and the masses. As far as the cadres are concerned, some believe that with the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, there is no need to organize grain markets; others believe that after the unified purchase, there is no surplus grain in the countryside at all, and organizing the market will not have any regulatory effect. Village cadres have more concerns: they are afraid that after the grain is put on the market, the higher authorities will criticize the incomplete unified purchase of grain; they are afraid that the farmers will sell out the grain and then ask the cadres for supply. Some farmers, after selling their surplus grain, said that they had no more surplus grain. Some farmers said that they lacked food rations during the unified sale, and now they are embarrassed to go to the market to sell grain or adjust grain varieties. Some wealthy farmers are afraid to sell grain in the market, lest the task be increased during the unified purchase in the future. All this shows that many cadres and farmers lack a correct understanding of the nature and role of the state grain market. Therefore, in light of their ideological situation, explaining the necessity of restoring and running the state grain market well is an important task.

Restoring and running the state grain market well is a necessary supplementary form for carrying out the unified purchase and sale of grain both at present and for a long time to come. Many farmers still have varying amounts of surplus grain to sell after the unified purchase of grain is completed. Some farmers must carry out cyclical adjustments due to production and living needs. After the unified purchase of grain, although the amount of food rations retained by farmers is roughly the same, due to the different consumption amounts of each household, different living standards, different sideline businesses, and special reasons such as population increase and transfer, weddings and funerals, the grain in hand will still be lacking or surplus, requiring buying and selling. These demands of farmers must be met. Establishing a state grain market can meet the demands of farmers. The implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain only abolished the free grain market and brought the supply and marketing and circulation of grain into the state plan, but it never excludes the exchange of grain between farmers to meet each other's needs. At present, the vast majority of farmers in the country are still individual farmers, and they need to trade on the state grain market. Even when the collective ownership of farmers replaces small private ownership, and the production and supply and marketing of farmers are basically incorporated into the state plan, the state still allows and organizes commodity exchanges between agricultural cooperatives and farmers. After the unified purchase and sale of grain, it is completely legal for farmers to buy and sell grain on the state grain market. The state implements the policy of "fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sale," encouraging farmers to work hard to increase production. Those who retain more surplus grain after completing the state purchase task are of course allowed to adjust on the state grain market. We believe that as long as cadres and farmers recognize this point, it will have a great effect on restoring and running the state grain market well.

Restoring and running the state grain market well plays a great role in revitalizing the rural economy and improving farmers' enthusiasm for production. This year, many regions have arranged the unified sale of grain while conducting the unified purchase of grain, basically ensuring the needs of grain-deficient households and other aspects. However, in some areas, due to the non-universality of the establishment of state-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives, the lack of in-depth work, and the untimely supply, some sideline workshops have been forced to stop production due to lack of raw materials, and some grain-deficient farmers feel that the variety of grain supplied by the state is not entirely suitable, which has caused some psychological tension among farmers regarding the grain problem. After the establishment of the state grain market, this situation will change greatly. In the seven counties of Taihe, Nanfeng, and Jinxi in Jiangxi Province, a state grain market was established. Within half a month, about 300,000 catties of grain were put on the market, of which more than half were for farmers to exchange with each other and adjust varieties. After the establishment of the state grain market in Lucheng Town, Lushan County, Henan Province, farmers exchanged varieties with each other, and their needs were met. Many agricultural production cooperatives also bought back a large amount of feed, which solved the problem of lack of feed for livestock in the cooperatives. Many tofu workshops have purchased raw materials, ensuring continued production. The difficulties of many farmers who lack seeds have also been solved. These facts fully demonstrate that the state grain market has a significant role in revitalizing the rural economy and improving farmers' enthusiasm for production.

Restoring and running the state grain market well is also conducive to further consolidating the socialist position in the countryside on the basis of the unified purchase and sale of grain. After the unified purchase and sale of grain, grain speculation has been fatally hit. However, in some areas, because the state grain market has not been restored and run well in time, the rural grain adjustment has stagnated. Illegal grain merchants and rich peasant elements have used the farmers' urgent desire for grain adjustment to create black markets, speculate, exploit farmers, and undermine the state grain policy. Restoring and running the state grain market well can more forcefully eliminate the illegal activities of grain merchants in the countryside, help farmers get rid of the exploitation and influence of speculators, stabilize grain prices, and consolidate the socialist position in the countryside.

The state-led rural grain market is a completely new type of market, with many new systems, which farmers are not accustomed to; most cadres also lack experience. Therefore, the county and district leading organs should strengthen the leadership and management of the state grain market, and should not let it go its own way and let it fend for itself. Under the unified leadership of the district government, the market management committee should be composed of industry and commerce, grain, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments to jointly participate in the leadership and designate special personnel to lead the exchange's business. The grain market should be set up according to the law of commodity circulation and the habit of mass gathering and distribution, and should be closely integrated with other markets to drive the exchange of other materials. In terms of market management, we should currently prevent the phenomenon of tight management. Some regions once universally issued grain purchase certificates, stipulating that all grain transactions must be registered, and that farmers are only allowed to adjust varieties and not to exchange with each other. These practices are inappropriate and should be corrected.

Correctly grasping the price policy is important for promoting the vitality of the grain market. The principle of mastering the grain market price is: it should not only obey the state's unified grain purchase price, but also facilitate the people's adjustment of surplus and deficiency. Therefore, in addition to some minor miscellaneous grains that are allowed to be sold by the masses at a price slightly higher than the state's unified purchase price, the price of grain that falls within the scope of the state's unified purchase should generally be between the state's unified purchase and unified sale prices. In this way, it not only conforms to the state's grain price policy, but is also easily accepted by the masses.

The rural grain market should be combined with the rural primary market. If the grain market is run well, it can activate other commodity markets; if the exchange and supply of other commodities is done well, it will further promote the vitality of the grain market. In some areas of Shanxi Province, grain markets have been set up in the original rural fairs, which is convenient for farmers to purchase production and living materials after selling grain. This practice is very popular among farmers.

It is permissible for farmers to buy and sell grain on the state grain market, and it is also permissible to directly exchange with each other or lend and adjust with each other in rural areas. In the past, some areas, in the management of the grain market, did not distinguish between vendors and farmers, and forced them to enter the market for trading, attempting to have the state grain market take over all rural grain adjustment activities. This is impossible and unnecessary. Interfering with the freedom of farmers to store and adjust grain after the unified purchase is a violation of the state's grain policy. The result of doing so is only to control the farmers and facilitate speculative merchants, resulting in an unnecessary atmosphere of grain tension in the countryside. Obviously, this practice is inappropriate.

When carrying out the unified sale of grain in conjunction with spring plowing production, all localities should seize the opportunity to quickly restore and run the state grain market well, and strive to support spring plowing production.

    为什么要建立国家领导的农村粮食市场
    康伟中
    在粮食统购统销结束以后，组织社会余粮和粮食品种调剂周转的有效办法之一，就是办好国家粮食市场。从一九五四年春季开始，全国各地陆续建立了三万零七百多个粮食市场。这些市场在一九五四年秋季粮食统购统销运动开展后，大部分都停顿了。现在，它们已陆续恢复起来，恢复到一九五四年原有市场的百分之三十到五十。目前存在的问题是：约有百分之五十到七十的粮食市场还没有恢复，已经恢复的因为上市的粮食时多时少，时有时无，也没有充分发挥应有的作用。在目前正是春耕生产的繁忙季节，广大农民由于生产、生活上的需要，希望进行粮食买卖和粮种间的调剂；已经恢复的粮食市场，无论数量和质量，都远远不能满足农民的要求。
    恢复和办好国家粮食市场，决不是一件容易的事。在干部和群众中，都有许多思想阻力需要排除。就干部来说，有的认为实行粮食统购统销，已没有组织粮食市场的必要；有的认为统购以后，农村根本没有余粮了，组织市场也不会有什么调剂作用。乡村干部的顾虑更多：他们怕粮食上市后，上级批评统购粮食不彻底；怕农民把粮食卖完了，又来找干部要求供应。有些农民在卖出余粮后，曾说自己再没有余粮了，有些农民在统销时曾说过缺少口粮，现在都不好意思到市场卖粮或调剂粮食品种；有些富裕农民怕到市场卖粮，将来统购时会增加任务。所有这些，都说明许多干部和农民对于国家粮食市场的性质和作用还缺乏正确的理解。因此，针对他们的思想情况，说明恢复和办好国家粮食市场的必要性乃是一项重要的任务。
    恢复和办好国家粮食市场，是目前和今后长时期内进行粮食统销必不可少的补充形式。有不少农民在粮食统购结束后，还有多少不等的余粮需要出卖。有些农民由于生产生活的需要，必须进行周转性的调剂。在粮食统购以后，农民的口粮留量虽大致相同，但由于各户消费量大小不一，生活水平高低不同，经营的副业也不一样以及人口增加转移、婚丧喜庆等特殊原因，手中的粮食仍然会有缺有余，需要买进卖出。农民的这些要求必须得到满足。建立国家粮食市场，就可以满足农民的要求。实行粮食统购统销，只是取消了粮食自由市场，把粮食的供销和流转纳入国家的计划以内，但是，它绝不排除农民之间的互通有无的粮食交换。现在全国农民的绝大多数还是个体农民，他们需要在国家粮食市场上进行贸易；即便在农民的集体所有制代替了小私有制，农民的生产和供销基本上纳入国家计划轨道的时候，国家还是允许并组织农庄之间和农民之间的商品交换。在粮食统购统销之后，农民在国家粮食市场上购售粮食，是完全合法的。国家实行“定产、定购、定销”的政策，鼓励农民努力增加生产，在完成国家统购任务后，留有较多余粮的人，当然是允许他们在国家粮食市场上去调剂的。我们相信，只要让干部和农民认识了这一点，对于恢复和办好国家粮食市场就会发生很大的作用。
    恢复和办好国家粮食市场，对于活跃农村经济，提高农民的生产积极性有很大作用。今年许多地区在粮食统购的同时，都安排了粮食统销工作，基本上保证了缺粮户和其他方面的需要。但是，有些地区由于国营粮食部门、供销合作社的机构设置不普遍，工作不深入，供应不及时，以致某些副业作坊因原料缺乏而停工歇业，有些缺粮农民感到国家供应的粮食的品种不尽合适，这就使农民对粮食问题产生了一些紧张心理。建立国家粮食市场以后，这种情况就会发生很大的变化。江西省泰和、南丰、金溪等七个县建立了国家粮食市场，在半个月时间内，上市粮食有三十万斤左右，其中农民互通有无和调剂品种的就有一半以上。河南省鲁山城关镇建立国家粮食市场后，农民互相进行品种调剂，他们的需要都满足了；很多农业生产合作社也买回大批饲料，解决了社内牲畜缺乏饲料的问题。许多豆腐坊买到了原料，保证了继续生产。许多农民缺乏种籽的困难也解决了。这些事实，充分说明了国家粮食市场对活跃农村经济，提高农民生产积极性具有重大的作用。
    恢复和办好国家粮食市场，还有利于在粮食统购统销的基础上进一步巩固社会主义在农村的阵地。粮食统购统销以后，粮食投机行为已经遭到了致命的打击。但有些地区由于没有及时恢复和办好国家粮食市场，农村粮食调剂陷于停滞状态，不法粮商和富农分子利用农民迫切要求进行粮食调剂的心理，制造黑市，进行投机，剥削农民，破坏国家粮食政策。恢复和办好了国家粮食市场，就可以更有力地排除粮商在农村的非法活动，帮助农民摆脱投机者的剥削和影响，稳定粮价，巩固社会主义在农村的阵地。
    国家领导的农村粮食市场是完全新型的市场，其中有许多新的制度，农民是不习惯的；多数干部也缺乏经验。因此，县区领导机关应该加强对国家粮食市场的领导和管理，不能放任自流，使它自生自灭。应该在区政府的统一领导下，由工商、粮食、供销合作等部门组成市场管理委员会，共同参加领导，并指定专人领导交易所的业务。粮食市场要根据商品流转规律和群众的集散习惯来设立，并和其他市场密切结合起来，以便带动其他物资交流。在市场管理方面，目前应该防止管理偏紧的现象。个别地区曾经普遍制发购粮证，规定买卖粮食都要登记，只准农民进行品种调剂，不准互通有无；这些做法都是不妥当的，应该纠正。
    正确掌握价格政策，对促进粮食市场的活跃具有着重要作用。掌握粮食市场价格的原则是：既应服从国家粮食统购价格，又要便利群众的有无调剂。因此，除了某些小宗杂粮允许群众按略高于国家统购牌价自行议价出售外，属于国家统购范围的粮食价格，一般应介于国家规定的统购、统销价格之间。这样，既符合国家的粮食价格政策，又容易为群众所接受。
    农村粮食市场应该和农村初级市场相结合。粮食市场办好了，可以使其他商品市场活跃起来；其他商品的交流、供应工作做好了，也会进一步促进粮食市场的活跃。山西省有些地区在原有集市上，设立了粮食市场，便利农民卖粮后购置生产、生活资料，这种做法很受农民欢迎。
    农民在国家粮食市场上买卖粮食是可以的，在农村直接互通有无或互相借贷调剂也是允许的。过去，有些地区在粮食市场的管理上，不分商贩、农民，一律强迫入场交易，企图把农村的粮食调剂活动全部由国家粮食市场包下来，这是不可能的，也是不需要的。干涉农民在统购后储存、调剂粮食的自由，是违反国家粮食政策的行为；这样做的结果，徒然管制了农民，便利了投机商贩，结果造成农村不应有的粮食紧张空气。显然，这种做法是不妥当的。
    各地在结合春耕生产进行粮食统销工作的时候，应抓紧时机，迅速恢复和办好国家粮食市场，为支持春耕生产而努力。
