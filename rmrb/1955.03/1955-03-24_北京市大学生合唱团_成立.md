To improve the musical level of student singing activists and further promote student singing activities in Beijing's universities, the Beijing Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Central Song and Dance Troupe jointly organized the "Beijing University Student Chorus."

The chorus held enrollment exams on March 13th, and more than 400 students signed up to take the exam. As the results were generally very good, a total of 171 students were admitted (originally planned for 120), including students from ten universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, Beijing Medical College, and Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology.

The chorus is advised by Soviet expert Domashev from the Central Song and Dance Troupe, with Situ Han and Ren Ce serving as conductors. It was officially established on March 20th.
