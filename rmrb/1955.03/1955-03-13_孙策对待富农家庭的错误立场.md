Sun Ce's Erroneous Stance Towards Wealthy Peasant Families
To the Editor:

    Let us expose an incident where a military cadre, Sun Ce, coerced village cadres into changing his family's wealthy peasant status.

    Sun Ce is the Secretary of the Political Department of the Hunan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and a native of Xinsheng Township, Shenxiang District, He County, Anhui Province. His family is classified as wealthy peasants. In the winter of 1954, Sun Ce returned home from Hunan. On the evening of December 2nd, the wealthy peasant Sun Bangshan (Sun Ce's elder brother) took Sun Ce's bodyguard (Xiao Xu) to the township government, asking the township head, Yu Longyue, to go to his house, saying: "My second brother has something to talk to you about." At the time, the township head was busy with work and did not go. The next morning, the wealthy peasant Sun Bangshan invited ten peasants, and Xiao Xu also called the township head. Sun Ce spoke, saying: "Township head, my family doesn't qualify as wealthy peasants! I hate writing 'wealthy peasant status' every time I fill out a form! It's not your fault that it was classified wrong before. Land reform is a nationwide movement, and it's inevitable to go 'too far left' or 'too far right.' Today, I've invited everyone to discuss my family's situation and clarify my family's status." Then Sun Ce started calculating on his own, arguing that his family's exploitation only accounted for 17.4 percent of the total income. Seeing his calculation method, the township head found it inconvenient to deal with it at the time and asked him to appeal according to the law. Sun Ce said: "Why appeal according to the law? I can go to the county tomorrow."

    The next day, Sun Ce had an elementary school teacher write a certificate for changing his status and asked Sun Bangshan to take it to the township head for a seal. The township head did not agree, so he sent his bodyguard to call the township head over and questioned him face to face. The township head was forced to say, "Wait until the evening to hold a cadre meeting for research." After the township head returned, he first held a Party branch meeting for research. At the meeting, everyone unanimously said that Sun Ce's family's wealthy peasant status was not misclassified. Soon after the meeting started, Sun Ce arrived with his bodyguard. Sun Ce insisted at the meeting that his family's status had been misclassified, saying that his family had four laborers (actually only two and a half laborers), and said: "The family only hires two-thirds of a long-term worker and no short-term workers." At this time, Party member Tong Xiuyuan couldn't bear it anymore and said: "Chief Sun, your family also hired fifty or sixty short-term workers." Sun Ce rolled his eyes and asked, "What's your surname?" Tong Xiuyuan was stunned for a moment and said, "My surname is Tong." Sun Ce asked again, "What's your name?" Tong Xiuyuan was so frightened that he dared not speak. After a while, Party member Lang Yede (a demobilized soldier) said: "His name is Tong Xiuyuan." Sun Ce loudly said to Tong: "Cadres must be responsible for their words, and can't talk nonsense!" At this time, Zhang Xueqing, a veteran, became angry and said: "Chief Sun, since you asked us to give opinions, why are you scolding people? We came to the meeting, and we dare to be responsible for what we say. Could we speak if we weren't responsible?" Seeing that the situation was not right, Sun Ce repeatedly said: "Nonsense! Nonsense! I won't talk to you." He turned around and left.

    Two days later, Sun Ce took Sun Bangshan into the city. On the way, he ran into the township instructor of Xinsheng Township, Liu Guojin, who was studying in the county, and asked Liu Guojin to change his family's status. Liu Guojin said: "Your family's status has not been misclassified. It was reviewed when the land reform ended. If it was wrong, it should have been corrected at that time. Now I don't have the right to change your family's status. If you want to change it, you must go through legal procedures." Seeing that it wouldn't work, Sun Ce went to Sun Xianshu, the deputy secretary of the county party committee, saying that "he was stimulated by local cadres when he returned home this time," and so on.

    What is Sun Ce's family situation really like? His family has a total of 24.1 mu of land, cultivating 20.04 mu themselves, which can harvest 132.6 shi of rice. They rent out 3.7 mu, collecting 12.9 shi of rice in rent. They hire two-thirds of a long-term worker and 55 short-term workers each year. In addition, they also lend out a portion of money with a 5% monthly interest rate. Exploitation income exceeds 25% of the total income. After the land reform, Sun's family's political attitude was also very bad. For example, during the winter water conservancy project in 1952, his family relied on being a military dependent to unreasonably demand the reduction and exemption of earthwork. The then-instructor Hong refused, and Sun Ce's father scolded the instructor severely. When the unified grain purchase work began, the masses assessed that his family should sell 20 dan of surplus grain. After several mobilizations and education by the cadres, they only sold 12 dan.

    Sun Ce is a Communist Party member and a fairly responsible cadre in the military. After years of education by the Party, especially after the education of the general line, he should have actively educated his family to work hard, abide by all government laws, abandon wealthy peasant exploitation, and strive to gradually transform into working people. However, Sun Ce violated Party discipline and attempted to use his authority to force village cadres to change his family's wealthy peasant status. This behavior is very wrong, and we hope that relevant departments will educate and deal with him.

    孙策对待富农家庭的错误立场编辑同志：
    让我们揭发一件部队干部孙策威逼乡干部改变他家富农成份的事情。
    孙策是中国人民解放军湖南军区政治部秘书科长，安徽省和县沈巷区新生乡人，家里是富农成份。一九五四年冬天孙策由湖南回家，在十二月二日那天晚上，富农孙邦山（孙策的哥哥）带着孙策的警卫员（小徐）到乡政府，叫乡长余龙月到他家去，说是：我家老二有话和你谈谈。当时，乡长因工作忙，没有去。第二天上午，富农孙邦山去邀来了十个农民，小徐又去叫来了乡长，由孙策讲话，孙策说：“乡长，我家是够不上富农的！我每次填表写上‘富农成份’就讨厌！以前划错了不怪你们，土地改革是全国性的大运动，过‘左’过‘右’是难免的，今天请大家来谈谈我家的情况，把我家的成份弄清楚。”接着孙策就自说自算，认为他家的剥削份量只占总收入的百分之十七点四。乡长见他这样算法，当时不便处理，就请他去依法申诉。孙策说：
  “干啥要依法申诉，我明天到县里去就行了。”
    第二天，孙策让一个小学教员给他写好了一份改变成份的证明书，叫孙邦山拿去叫乡长盖章；乡长没有答应，他又派警卫员把乡长叫去，当面责问，乡长被逼得没法，只好说：“等晚上召开干部会议进行研究。”乡长回去后，他先召开党支部会进行研究，会上大家一致说孙策家的富农成份没有划错。会刚开了不久，孙策就带着警卫员来了。孙策在会上硬说他家的成份划错了，说他家里有四个劳动力（实际上只有两个半劳动力），又说：
  “家里只雇三分之二的长工，没有雇短工。”这时，党员童修元实在忍不住了，就说：“孙首长，你家还雇了五六十个短工。”孙策当时把眼睛一翻问道：“你姓什么？”童修元愣了一下，说：我姓“童”。孙策又问：“你叫什么名字？”童修元吓得不敢作声。过了一会，党员郎业德（复员军人）说：“他叫童修元”。孙策大声地对童说：“干部说话要负责，不能放屁！”这时，转业军人张学庆生气了，说：“孙首长，你既然叫我们提意见，为什么又要骂人？我们来开会，讲话就敢负责，不负责的话我们就能讲了吗？”孙策见情势不对，连声说：“放屁！放屁！我不和你们讲。”扭转身就走了。
    过了两天，孙策带着孙邦山进城去了，路上碰到乡长还说：“乡长，你把我家情况调查好，告诉你，我两天后就回来。”孙策进城后，碰见了在县里学习的新生乡指导员刘国金，又叫刘国金替他家改成份，刘国金说：“你家成份没有划错，土地改革结束的时候都审查过的，如果是错的话，那时就该纠正了。现在我没有权利替你家改成份，要改的话，须经法律手续。”孙策看不行，就去找县委副书记孙贤树，说是“这次回家受了地方干部的刺激”等等。
    孙策的家庭情况究竟是怎样的呢？他家共有田二十四亩一分，自耕二十亩零四分，可收稻谷一百三十二石六斗，出租三亩七分，收租稻十二石九斗；每年雇长工三分之二个，短工五十五个；另外还放出一部分加五利息的债。剥削收入超过总收入的百分之二十五。土地改革后，孙家的政治态度也很不好，如一九五二年冬修时，他家倚仗着自己是军属，无理要求减免土方，当时的洪指导员不答应，孙策的父亲就把指导员大骂了一顿。粮食统购工作开始，群众评他家应卖余粮二十担稻谷，经干部数次动员教育，只卖出十二担。
    孙策是一个共产党员，又是部队中一个相当负责的干部，经过党的多年教育，特别是经过总路线的教育，照理说应当积极教育自己的家庭好好劳动，遵守政府的一切法令，放弃富农的剥削，争取逐步改造成为劳动人民。但是，孙策竟违反党纪，企图假借自己的威势来逼迫乡干部给自己家庭改掉富农成份，这种行为是非常错误的，希望有关部门对他进行教育和处理。
