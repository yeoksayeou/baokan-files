    CPPCC Shanxi and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committees Hold Meetings
    The First Plenary Session of the First Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Shanxi Province Committee was held in Taiyuan from February 25 to 28.

Wang Zifeng, Commander of the Shanxi Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, made a report on the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)."

    The meeting discussed these reports. Finally, it unanimously adopted the resolution on launching publicity and discussion of the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)," the resolution on supporting the "Order of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on Issuing New Renminbi and Recalling Existing Renminbi," and the resolution of the First Committee of the CPPCC Shanxi Province Committee on the work in 1955.

    The First Plenary Session of the First Committee of the CPPCC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee was held in Hohhot from February 22 to 26. In their speeches, the committee members all angrily denounced the crimes of U.S. imperialism in occupying our territory of Taiwan and plotting to launch a war of aggression, and firmly stated: The Chinese people must liberate their territory of Taiwan. The meeting considered that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has now shifted from a period focusing on promoting regional autonomy to a period focusing on building the autonomous region. During this period, following the general task of the country's transition period, the task of construction facing the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is very arduous. The committee members present expressed that they would vigorously assist the Autonomous Region People's Government in mobilizing the masses to actively carry out various production and construction work in industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. At present, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to actively subscribe to the 1955 National Construction Bonds, do a good job in publicizing the issuance of new Renminbi, widely launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons in the whole region, and actively participate in various work and struggles to support the liberation of Taiwan. The meeting elected Yang Zhilin as Chairman of the First Committee of the CPPCC Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee by secret ballot, and elected Ji Yatai, Sun Lanfeng, Temuerbagen, and Chen Bingqian as Vice Chairmen. It also elected the Secretary-General of the Committee and 27 Standing Committee members. (Our Correspondent in Hohhot)
