    Some cadres believe that their responsibility to their children is only to take care of their lives. As long as the children's faces are rosy and they grow up plump, there is no need to worry. As for the children's studies and moral education, it seems that it is only a matter for the school and has nothing to do with them.

    Therefore, when some parents of students in cadre children's schools visit their children, they only pay attention to the thickness of their clothes and the quality of their meals, but do not bother to inquire about their children's learning situation or ask about their daily behavior. Precisely because of this, they have no interest in attending parent-teacher conferences to study children's education issues. At the parent-teacher conference held by the Zhengzhou Railway Workers' Children's Third Elementary School, more workers came, fewer section chiefs came, and even fewer department heads came. Among the twenty-three student parents at or above the department head level, only one or two attended the parent-teacher conference. It is no wonder that some students with bad behavior are the children of certain department heads and section chiefs. A student at the Zhengzhou Railway Workers' Children's Third Elementary School, who did not abide by discipline, bullied female classmates, and called himself "The Four Heavenly Kings," did not allow teachers to discipline him, and said very impolitely to the teacher: "What are you doing, daring to discipline me? My father is in charge of you." The father of the child who said this was the Director of the Education Department of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, and the mother was the Section Chief of the General Education Section. However, these two parents who were doing educational work did not properly educate their children.

    As parents, they naturally want their children to grow up strong and healthy, and it is wrong not to care about their children's lives. But we should also think about the fact that the reason why we want to cultivate a strong next generation is to enable them to better shoulder the responsibility of building and defending the motherland. If we only pay attention to the children's lives and do not care about their moral education, so that when the children grow up, they do not even have the necessary qualities, then it is difficult for them to become good laborers, workers, and defenders of the motherland. In this way, we have not only failed to fulfill our responsibility to our children, but also to society.

    Unfortunately, some cadres do not understand this point. Although their care for their children is conscientious and thoughtful, it does not have a clear purpose, it is just care for the sake of care.

    Some comrades say that they are too busy with work and really do not have time to educate their children. This is not entirely true. Cadres are generally busy with their work, but it is an exaggeration to say that they do not even have time to educate their children. We often see some comrades who are very busy, running around, going to the market every two or three days to buy this and that for their children. They can spend half an hour picking and choosing for the color and style of a piece of clothing, and it cannot be said that they use very little brainpower. However, they do not have time to sit down and think about their children's moral education, and have some educational conversations with their children. This easily leads others to wonder: Is it really a lack of time, or is there something wrong with their brains?

    不能只是在孩子的生活上操心
    秦亢
    在一些干部看来，他们对子女的责任只是生活上的照顾，只要孩子脸红红的，长得胖胖的，也就勿须操心了。至于孩子的学习，孩子的道德教育，好像那只是学校的事情，同他们无关。
    所以，有些干部子弟学校的学生家长，当他们到学校看望孩子的时候，就只注意孩子衣服的厚薄，伙食的好坏，却不去打听打听孩子的学习状况，问问孩子的日常行为。也正因为这样，如果学校要开家长会，研究孩子们的教育问题，他们是没有什么兴趣的。郑州铁路职工子弟第三小学召开的家长会，工人来的多，科长来的少，处长来的更少，在处长级以上的二十三个学生家长当中，也只不过一两个人参加家长会。这也就难怪，有些品行不好的学生，正是某些处长、科长的子女了。郑州铁路职工子弟第三小学的一个学生，不守纪律，欺侮女同学，自称“四大金刚”，不许老师管教，很不礼貌地对老师说：“你们是干什么的，敢来管我？我爸爸是专管你们的。”说这话的孩子，他父亲是郑州铁路管理局的教育处长，母亲是普通教育科科长。然而这两个作教育工作的家长，却没有好好教育孩子。
    作父母的自然都希望孩子长得结结实实的，不关心孩子的生活是不对的。但也应当想一想，我们所以要培养体格强健的后一代，是为了使他们更好地担当起建设祖国和保卫祖国的责任。如果只注意孩子的生活，不管孩子的道德教育，以致孩子长大成人，连必要的品质修养也没有，那他们是很难成为好的劳动者、工作者、祖国保卫者的。这样，我们就不仅没有对孩子，而且没有对社会尽到责任。
    可惜，有些干部并不了解这一点，他们对孩子的照顾，虽然是尽心周到的，但并没有什么明确的目的，只是为照顾而照顾罢了。
    有些同志说，工作太忙了，实在没有时间去教育孩子。这话说的并不完全，干部的工作一般是忙的，但是要说连教育孩子的时间也没有，那就太夸张了。常常看到一些工作很忙的同志，东跑西颠，三天两头地到市场上给孩子买这买那，为了一件衣服的颜色、样式，可以花上半个钟头，挑来拣去，脑筋不能说是用的很少的；然而他们却没有时间坐下来想一想孩子的品德教育，同孩子作些教育性的谈话。这就容易叫别人发生疑问了：究竟是时间不够，还是脑筋有毛病呢？
