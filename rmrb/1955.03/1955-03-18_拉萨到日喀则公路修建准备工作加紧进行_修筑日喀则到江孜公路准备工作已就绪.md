Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 17th: Preparatory work for the construction of the Lhasa-Shigatse highway is being intensified. Two reconnaissance teams dispatched by the General Bureau of Highways of the Ministry of Communications have started reconnaissance work on two comparative routes from Yangbajing to Shigatse since the beginning of February. The advance personnel of two survey and design teams of the First Design Sub-bureau have arrived in Lhasa and will conduct surveying and design westward from Yangbajing. More than 2,500 road construction workers and technicians of the First Engineering Office of the First Engineering Bureau of the General Bureau of Highways are participating in the improvement project of the Kangzang Highway while preparing for the construction of the Lhasa-Shigatse highway construction site.

In the past two months, the transportation and supply departments of the First Engineering Bureau have transported more than 300,000 jin of staple and non-staple foods and more than 80 tons of road construction materials to Lhasa, and have also successively transported spring and summer supplies such as single clothing, towels, and soap. Warehouse management personnel are inspecting road construction equipment and tools, drying materials, and packaging them. Transportation and supply personnel have departed to Yangbajing to inspect the site selection and prepare to transport road construction materials from Lhasa to the construction site before the rainy season. The Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee are also preparing to support road construction matters.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 17th: The preparatory work for the construction of the Shigatse-Gyantse highway has been basically completed. Survey personnel have completed the alignment and surveying of the entire 90-plus kilometers. A construction leadership organ, with officials from the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee participating, has been established and has held its first road construction preparation meeting. Currently, specific matters such as wages and benefits for the laborers are being studied and decided. At present, the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army is transferring cadres to prepare to work at the construction site. More than 4,000 Tibetan people from Shigatse, Gyantse, and Baihao have enthusiastically signed up to participate in road construction and will go to the construction site after spring plowing and sowing are completed. Some of the laborers have already gathered, and trial construction will begin in mid-March to accumulate experience for full-scale construction.

The earth and stone tools needed for construction have long been fully prepared. The construction site supply department has prepared enough rice, highland barley, and salt for the laborers to eat during the construction period. Daily necessities and firewood are now being prepared for the laborers. The construction site clinic has also prepared medical equipment and is about to move to the construction site. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Gyantse and the literary and art work team and film projection team of the Panchen Kanpo Conference Hall Committee are also preparing to go to the construction site for touring performances and screenings.

The construction of the Shigatse-Gyantse highway will employ the method of "work-for-relief" to provide relief to the Tibetan people in the Nyang Chu River basin who suffered from floods last year. The construction leadership organ has decided that the vast majority of laborers' wages will be paid in kind. It is estimated that each laborer can earn five and a half jin of rice or nine jin of highland barley for every two cubic meters of ordinary earthwork they complete per day.

    【新华社拉萨十七日电】修建拉萨到日喀则公路的准备工作正加紧进行。交通部公路总局派出的两个踏勘队，从二月初起，已开始从羊八井到日喀则间两条比较线的踏勘工作。第一设计分局的两个测设队先头人员已到达拉萨，将从羊八井向西进行测量设计。公路总局第一工程局所属第一工程处的两千五百多名筑路工人和技术人员，正一面参加康藏公路改善工程，一面进行到拉萨、日喀则间公路工地施工的准备工作。
    近两个月来，第一工程局的运输、供应部门，已把三十多万斤主副食品和八十多吨筑路料具运到拉萨，还陆续运来了单衣、毛巾、肥皂等春夏季用品。仓库管理人员正检查筑路器材工具，翻晒物资，进行包装。运输、供应人员已出发到羊八井察看设站地址，准备在雨季前把筑路物资从拉萨运到工地。西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会也正准备支援筑路事宜。
    【新华社拉萨十七日电】修筑日喀则到江孜的公路的准备工作已基本就绪。勘察人员已完成了全线九十多公里的定线和测量工作。有西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会官员参加的施工领导机关，已经成立，并开过了第一次修路准备会议。现在正研究决定民工工资福利等各项具体事宜。目前，人民解放军西藏军区正抽调干部准备到工地工作。日喀则、江孜和白浩等地的藏民已有四千多人踊跃报名参加修路，等春耕播种完毕就赴工地。部分民工已经集结，在本月中旬动工试修，给全面动工积累经验。
    施工中所需要的土、石方工具，早已准备齐全。工地供应部门已经给民工准备了足够施工期间食用的大米、青稞和食盐。现在正给民工准备日用品和烧柴。工地医疗所也准备好了医药器材，即将搬往工地。人民解放军驻江孜部队和班禅堪布会议厅委员会的文艺工作队，电影放映队，也正准备到工地作巡回演出和放映。
    日喀则到江孜公路的修筑，采用以工代赈救济去年年楚河沿岸受水灾的藏民。施工领导机关已决定绝大部分民工工资发给实物。预计每个民工一天作两公方普通土，就可以得到五斤半大米或九斤青稞。
