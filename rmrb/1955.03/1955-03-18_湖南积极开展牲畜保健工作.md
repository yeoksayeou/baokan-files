    Hunan Actively Carries Out Livestock Health Care Work
    In order to reduce the death of farmers' livestock due to disease, Hunan Province is actively carrying out livestock health care work. In 1954, more than fifty counties in Hunan Province carried out the work of signing livestock health care contracts. Local veterinarians contracted with farmers for more than 142,000 heads of cattle and pigs. Due to the cooperation between livestock owners and veterinarians, not only were feeding and management methods improved, but also the health of livestock was regularly checked, and diseases could be detected and treated in a timely manner. This greatly reduced the incidence and death of livestock. In Fangmingting and two other townships in Qiyang County, 34 cattle died in 1953. After the implementation of livestock health care contracts in 1954, not a single cow died in a year. In 1955, Hunan Province plans to insure more than 1.2 million heads of cattle and pigs. In order to smoothly carry out this work, the Provincial Department of Agriculture allocated a large amount of funds and trained more than 7,400 traditional Chinese veterinarians and agricultural producers' cooperative keepers. At present, local primary-level veterinary personnel are combining the protection of draft cattle with inspection, treatment, and other tasks to comprehensively carry out the signing of health care contracts for cattle and pigs.

    湖南积极开展牲畜保健工作
    湖南省为了减少农民牲畜疾病死亡，积极开展牲畜保健工作。一九五四年，湖南省有五十多个县开展了签订牲畜保健合同工作，各地兽医共向农民承保了十四万二千多头牛、猪。由于畜主和兽医的合作，不仅改善了饲养管理方法，同时还定期检查牲畜健康，有病也能及时发现和医治。大大减少了牲畜的发病和死亡。祁阳县芳名亭等三个乡一九五三年曾死了三十四头牛，一九五四年推行牲畜保健合同后，一年未死一头牛。一九五五年，湖南省计划承保一百二十多万头牛、猪。为了顺利开展这项工作，省农业厅拨了大批经费，并训练了七千四百多名中兽医和农业生产合作社饲养员。现在，各地基层兽医人员正结合检查、治疗等项保护耕牛工作，全面开展签订牛、猪保健合同工作。  （晏纪常）
