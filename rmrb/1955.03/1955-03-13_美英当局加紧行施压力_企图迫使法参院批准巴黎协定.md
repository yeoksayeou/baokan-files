    US, British Authorities Intensify Pressure
    Attempting to Force French Senate to Approve Paris Agreements
    【Xinhua News Agency, March 11th】 American and British authorities are intensifying pressure on the French Council of the Republic (Senate) to push for the ratification of the Paris Agreements.
    US President Eisenhower sent a special letter on the 10th to the prime ministers of the seven countries participating in the so-called “Western European Union,” reiterating the US-insisted policy of rearming West Germany, while "guaranteeing" that after the Paris Agreements are ratified, the US will continue to station armed forces in Europe, including West Germany. Eisenhower also indicated that the US is prepared to consult with the "Western European Union Arms Control Agency" to assist it in "monitoring the armaments of union members." As everyone knows, French supporters of the Paris Agreements are using deceitful arguments, claiming that these kinds of "guarantees" from the US can prevent the threat of German militarism to France, to deceive public opinion.
    Following the publication of Eisenhower’s letter, British officials immediately expressed their support. A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that they were “very satisfied” and that Eisenhower’s “guarantee” had “great value” for Western Europe. “We also welcome the US’s determination to cooperate closely with the Western European Union.”
    The French authorities are treating Eisenhower’s statement as an important tool to entice the Council of the Republic to ratify the Paris Agreements. According to Reuters, official sources in Paris believe that this statement will "help the government in its efforts to persuade the Council of the Republic to complete the ratification process." The report pointed out that Eisenhower's move constituted an "intervention" in the French government's campaign to get the Paris Agreements approved.
    With the support and urging of the US and British authorities, the French Faure government has launched an offensive against wavering French senators according to a pre-determined so-called "battle plan." On the same day that Eisenhower's letter was published, Faure's Foreign Minister Pinay spent three hours in the Council of the Republic's Foreign Affairs Committee, doing his utmost to threaten the committee members not to add any new conditions or delaying clauses and to quickly ratify the Paris Agreements. Pinay cited a letter written by British Prime Minister Churchill to former Prime Minister Mendès-France in January of this year, intimidating the senators that if they did not ratify the Paris Agreements, France would lose its "international status." According to Reuters, Churchill's letter threatened that if France did not ratify, the US and Britain would take "new steps" to rearm West Germany and would hold talks excluding France, so that France's seat at international conferences would be in danger of being occupied by "another country." Pinay also emphasized in his speech that France needs to rely on the United States, using shameless language, saying: "The Americans do not need Europe, but we do need the Americans." At the same time, Pinay also repeated the deceptive cliché that approving the Paris Agreements would not affect negotiations with the Soviet Union.
    Reports from Paris indicate that the Faure government, in coordination with the pressure from the US and British authorities, will continue to carry out intensive activities to prevent the Council of the Republic from proposing amendments to the Paris Agreements that would lead to the entire agreement being returned to the National Assembly for renewed discussion. According to Reuters, Faure and Pinay are scheduled to make a series of speeches to the senators in order to "prepare" for the Council of the Republic's debate which is to begin on March 22nd.

### 美英当局加紧行施压力  企图迫使法参院批准巴黎协定

    美英当局加紧行施压力
    企图迫使法参院批准巴黎协定
    【新华社十一日讯】　美国和英国当局正加紧对法国共和国参议院施加压力，以促使批准巴黎协定。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔十日向参加所谓“西欧联盟”的七国总理发出一项特别信件，重申美国所坚持的重新武装西德政策，同时“保证”在巴黎协定获得批准以后，美国将继续以武装部队驻扎在欧洲，包括西德在内。艾森豪威尔还表示美国准备同“西欧联盟军备监督机构”磋商，以协助它“监督联盟成员国军备”。大家知道，巴黎协定的法国支持者正是用所谓美国的这一类“保证”可以防止德国军国主义对法国的威胁的欺骗论调来蒙混舆论的。
    艾森豪威尔的信发表以后，英国官方立即表示响应。英国外交部发言人表示“非常满意”，并且说，艾森豪威尔的“保证”对西欧有“极大的价值”，“我们对美国决心要和西欧联盟密切合作也表示欢迎”。
    法国当局把艾森豪威尔的声明当作诱骗共和国参议院批准巴黎协定的重要工具。据路透社消息，巴黎官方人士认为这个声明将“有助于政府为说服共和国参议院完成批准手续所作的努力”。消息指出，艾森豪威尔采取这一举动，就“干预”了法国政府促使巴黎协定获得批准的运动。
    在美、英当局的支持和督促之下，法国富尔政府已根据一项预先制定的所谓“战斗计划”，向动摇不定的法国参议员们展开进攻。就在艾森豪威尔的信件发表的同一天，富尔政府的外交部长比内在共和国参议院外交委员会中花费了三小时的时间，竭力威胁外交委员会的委员们不要附加任何新条件或延期条款而迅速批准巴黎协定。比内引证英国首相邱吉尔在今年一月写给前总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯的一封信，恫吓议员们如果不批准巴黎协定，法国就会丧失它的“国际地位”。据路透社报道，邱吉尔的这封信威胁说，如果法国不批准，英美两国就要采取重新武装西德的“新步骤”，并将举行把法国排斥在外的会谈，这样，法国在国际会议上的席位就有被“另外某个国家”占据的危险。比内还在他的发言中强调法国需要依靠美国，他用厚颜无耻的口吻说：“美国人并不需要欧洲而我们确是需要美国人。”比内同时又重复所谓批准巴黎协定不会影响同苏联谈判的骗人的滥调。
    来自巴黎的消息表明，富尔政府配合美英当局的压力，将继续展开紧张的活动，以防止共和国参议院对巴黎协定提出修正从而导致全部协定退回国民议会重新讨论。据路透社报道，富尔和比内已预定要向参议员们作一系列的发言，以便为三月二十二日开始的共和国参议院的辩论“作好准备工作”。
