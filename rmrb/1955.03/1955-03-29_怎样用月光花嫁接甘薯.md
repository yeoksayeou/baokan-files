How to Graft Sweet Potatoes with Moonflower

I. Seedling Cultivation:

    (1) Scion: Fifty to sixty days before grafting, sow moonflower seeds in paper tubes with a diameter of 1-2 *cun* (Chinese inch, same below) and a height of 3-4 *cun*. Fill the tubes with a loose mixture of soil, plant ash, and compost, sowing at a depth of 0.5 *cun*. After sowing, water frequently to maintain adequate moisture. Keep in a warm place when the temperature is too cold. When the seedlings grow to 1 *cun* high, transplant them into the field. When they reach 1 *chi* high, use bamboo frames as supports. After they are 3-4 *chi* high, continuously pinch off the top buds to promote the growth of lush, short, and strong side branches. Moonflower with a growth period of fifty days can be used as scions for grafting.

    (2) Rootstock: Select local high-yielding, disease- and pest-free sweet potato tubers to cultivate seedlings. Among the cultivated seedlings, select the short, strong, and neat five-leaf first section as the rootstock (8 *cun* for short internodes, 1 *chi* for long internodes). Transplant these seedlings used as rootstock onto flat raised beds 5 *cun* high and 3 *chi* wide, with a spacing of 2 *cun* between plants and rows, at a depth of 3 *cun*, planting them at an angle, and water them frequently. After rooting (about a week), build a movable shade棚 (棚 meaning a type of simple shed structure) and then grafting can be carried out (for small-scale grafting, paper tubes can be used to cultivate rootstocks, with ten paper tubes in each flower pot). After the graft takes (about a week), dig them out with the roots and soil for transplanting.

II. Grafting Technique:

    Use a blade to cut off 2 *cun* from the top end of the rootstock (cut at the lower part of the node), and make a split in the middle about 0.5 *cun* long. Insert a paper tube rolled up from paper, the tube should be slightly thicker than the rootstock. Then, bevel both sides of the cut end of the scion into a smooth wedge shape with a cut surface length of about 0.5 *cun*. Insert it into the crack of the rootstock, so that the cambium layers connect with each other. Then tighten the paper tube upwards, which can make the scion and rootstock connect firmly. The newly grafted rootstock can also not be immediately covered with a paper ring, but immediately carry out the second grafting, so that the milky sap flowing out of the cut upper section of the rootstock drips onto the interface of the previous plant to promote healing, and then cover with a paper ring.

    Sweet potatoes that have been grafted tend to have an extended growing season and later tuber formation, generally requiring more than 150 days to harvest. Therefore, the cutting period should be advanced as much as possible. Although the method of grafting sweet potatoes with moonflower is more labor-intensive than ordinary sweet potato cultivation and requires certain techniques, farmers still welcome this method because it has a yield increase of several times.

    怎样用月光花嫁接甘薯
    戴农
    一、育苗：
    （1）接穗：在嫁接前五、六十天将月光花种子种在直径一至二寸（市尺，下同），高三至四寸的纸筒里，里面装入松碎的泥土、草木灰、堆肥的混合物，播种深度五分。播种后勤淋清水，保持适当的湿润。气温过冷时放在暖处。苗长至一寸高时移植田间，一尺高时用竹架做支柱，三四尺高后不断摘去顶芽，促使长出繁茂短壮的侧枝；有五十天生长期的月光花便可以用作接穗，进行嫁接。
    （2）砧木：选取当地丰产无病虫害的甘薯种块育成薯苗，在育成的薯苗中，选取短壮五叶齐整的第一段作为砧木（节间短的以八寸为度，节间长的以一尺为度）。把这些作砧木用的薯苗分栽在五寸高、三尺宽的平畦上，株行距各二寸，深三寸，斜植，并经常淋水。生根后（约一星期），搭上活动的遮荫棚就可进行嫁接（小规模的可以用纸筒培育砧木，每个花盆可以放十个纸筒）。接活后（约一星期）便连根带土挖出定植。
  二、嫁接技术：
    用刀片将砧木顶端割去二寸（在节的下部割），于中破一裂缝约五分长，套入用纸卷成的纸筒，筒要比砧木稍粗。然后再把接穗的割口两边斜削成平滑的楔形，切面长约五分，插入砧木的裂缝中，使皮层互接，再将纸筒向上套紧，就可使接穗和砧木连固。刚接好的砧木还可以不立即套上纸圈，而马上进行第二株的嫁接，以便把割下的砧木上截所流出的乳汁滴在前一株的接口上，促进愈合，然后套上纸圈。
    经嫁接后的甘薯，有生长期延长结薯较晚的趋势，一般约在一百五十天以上才能收获，因此应尽量提早扦插时期。月光花嫁接甘薯的办法虽然比一般的甘薯栽培费工，并需一定的技术，但是由于它具有几倍以上的增产效果，农民对这个办法还是很欢迎的。
