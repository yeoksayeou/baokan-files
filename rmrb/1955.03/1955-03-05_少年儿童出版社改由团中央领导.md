The Children's Publishing House will be directly led by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League from this year onwards.

In the two years since its establishment, the Children's Publishing House has published 287 new books and 228 revised and reprinted books, with a total circulation of approximately 26 million copies. Generally, these publications have been well-received by the majority of children, with some books selling over 100,000 copies. The "Children" bi-monthly magazine published by the Children's Publishing House has a circulation of over 170,000 copies per issue, while the "Children's Literature" monthly magazine has a circulation of over 130,000 copies per issue.

In the future, the Children's Publishing House will publish reading materials suitable for children based on the principles of communist education. A selection plan for 1955 to 1957 has been drafted, including picture books and illustrated stories for young children and lower grades, as well as literary works, popular science works, learning materials, activity books, and supplementary exercises for middle-grade and older children and teenagers. In 1955, the Children's Publishing House plans to publish 220 new books and reprint 596 books. (Xinhua News Agency)
