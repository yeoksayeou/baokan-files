Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 8th: Keisan, a representative of the Supreme Command of the Laotian Fighting Forces, issued a statement on March 6th, strongly protesting the infiltration of northern Laos by remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang bandits under the instigation of the United States. Approximately three thousand Kuomintang troops invaded northern Laos from three directions, established military strongholds there, and plundered local residents, seriously infringing upon the national sovereignty of Laos.

	The first group of Kuomintang bandits, numbering about five hundred, sneaked into Kanglong Township, a rallying area for the Laotian Fighting Forces in Phongsaly Province, and then occupied Malidao, Unu, and Wuxi. This army had been trained by French instructors, one of whom was a French officer named Bookerova.

	The second group also numbered approximately five hundred. This group had sneaked into Laos from Burma as early as January 1955 and had already established many strongholds along the Mekong River and the Laos-Burma border. The headquarters of these Kuomintang bandits were located in Mengxin, Huay Xai Province. At the end of January 1955, the Minister of Defense of the Lao Royal Government, accompanied by several military officers and many foreigners, inspected the Mengxin area, after which thirty-five tons of salt were transported to the area. Subsequently, a lieutenant named Fang was dispatched to Mengxin to serve as a representative of the French and Lao forces stationed at the Kuomintang bandit headquarters.

	The third group of Kuomintang bandits numbered approximately two thousand, having sneaked into Laos from Burma as early as the end of 1954. They occupied the Nam Tha River area west of Luang Prabang. They are now maintaining close contact with the Kuomintang bandits who invaded Mengxin and Malidao.

	Thus, the total number of Kuomintang bandits in these areas is approximately three thousand. It is reported that they are now preparing to attack Pongte, within the Phongsaly assembly area of the Laotian Fighting Forces. The "New Times of Burma" reported on February 20th that by the end of January, twenty-seven transport planes had transported Kuomintang troops to the Mengxin airport.

	Representative Keisan of the Supreme Command of the Laotian Fighting Forces, after condemning the infiltration of Kuomintang bandits into Laotian territory, stated that this is not only a serious violation of the Geneva Accords and a shameless infringement on Laotian sovereignty, but also an active preparation by the US imperialists to re-ignite the war in this country and use Laos as a base for provoking war with other neighboring countries.

	Keisan revealed that the Lao Royal Government, the French colonial elements who were undermining the ceasefire, and the Thai government, under the direction of US imperialism, were colluding with the Kuomintang bandit headquarters to turn Laos into a military base.

	Keisan, on behalf of the Laotian Fighting Forces, resolutely protested the infiltration of the Kuomintang bandits, protested the French and Lao sides for receiving and supplying these Kuomintang bandits and allowing them to openly station themselves on Laotian territory, and protested the French and Lao sides for condoning the attacks of the Kuomintang bandits against the Laotian Fighting Forces.

	Keisan pointed out: We demand that the Supreme Command of the Lao Royal Forces and the Supreme Command of the French Federation Forces in Indochina take timely and resolute measures to force the aforementioned Kuomintang bandits to withdraw from Laos.

	Keisan concluded by saying: The Laotian Fighting Forces have been fighting for the past seven or eight years to win peace, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity for their motherland. They will resolutely struggle with all the Laotian people to defend peace and independence, and resolutely oppose the US imperialists' conspiracy to turn Laos into their war base.

    寮国战斗部队总司令部代表发表声明
    强硬抗议美国指使蒋贼残匪侵入老挝北部
    【新华社八日讯】越南通讯社河内八日讯：寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山在三月六日发表声明，强硬抗议蒋介石国民党残匪在美国指使下渗入老挝北部地区。国民党军队约三千名从三个方向侵入老挝北部，在那里建立了军事据点，并且劫掠当地居民，严重地侵犯了老挝的国家主权。
    第一股国民党残匪约五百名，窜到丰沙里省的寮国战斗部队集结区岗龙镇驻扎，然后侵占了马里刀、乌怒和乌西。这支军队曾受过法国教官的训练，其中有一个法国军官名叫布克洛瓦。
    第二股人数大约也有五百名。这一股早在一九五五年一月就从缅甸窜到老挝，并且已经在湄公河沿岸和老挝—缅甸边境建立了许多据点。这些国民党残匪的司令部设在会晒省的孟新。在一九五五年一月底，老挝王国政府的国防大臣偕同若干军官和许多外国人一起视察了孟新地区，在这以后运了三十五吨盐到这个地区。随后，一个叫方的中尉被派遣到孟新充当法国和老挝部队驻在国民党残匪司令部的代表。
    第三股国民党残匪人数大约二千名，早在一九五四年底就从缅甸窜入老挝，他们侵占了琅勃剌邦以西的南达河地区。他们现在正同侵入孟新和马里刀的国民党残匪保持着密切联系。
    这样，在这些地区的国民党残匪总数已约有三千人。据悉，他们现在正在准备进攻寮国战斗部队丰沙里集结区内的磅待。“缅甸新时代报”二月二十日报道：到一月底，已经有二十七架运输机把国民党军队运到孟新的飞机场。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部代表凯山在谴责了国民党残匪渗入老挝领土后说，这不仅是一个严重违反日内瓦协定的行动和无耻地侵犯老挝主权的行动，而且是美帝国主义者要想在这个国家重新挑起战争并利用老挝作为一个挑起同其他邻国的战争的基地的积极准备工作。
    凯山揭露了老挝王国政府、破坏停战的法国殖民分子和泰国政府在美帝国主义的指示下，和国民党残匪司令部共谋把老挝变成一个军事基地。
    凯山代表寮国战斗部队坚决抗议国民党残匪的渗入，抗议法国和老挝方面接待、供应这些国民党残匪和让他们公然驻扎在老挝领土上，抗议法国和老挝方面纵容国民党残匪对寮国战斗部队的进攻。
    凯山指出：我们要求老挝王国部队总司令部和印度支那法兰西联邦部队总司令部及时地采取坚决的措施，迫使上述国民党残匪退出老挝。
    凯山最后说：寮国战斗部队在过去七八年中间一直在进行战斗，以争取祖国的和平、独立、主权和领土的完整。他们将和全体老挝人民坚决地进行斗争，以保卫和平和独立，坚决反对美帝国主义者把老挝变成他们的战争基地的阴谋。
