Introducing Two Books on Communist Morality

*“On Communist Morality” by Kolbanovsky, translated by Kang Ding, published by Sanlian Bookstore*
*“Lenin and Stalin on Communist Moral Education” by Bodelev, translated by Nan Zhishan, published by Fifties Publishing House*

To conduct communist moral education for the working people and to oppose the erosion of bourgeois ideology is one of the important tasks in our country's transition period. Our socialist construction and socialist transformation should not only change the socio-economic landscape according to socialist principles, but also change the moral outlook of the people. Over the past five years, due to the establishment and development of socialist relations of production and the strengthening of the Party's education of the people, a new moral atmosphere is growing in our country. Moreover, with the intensification of the struggle between socialism and capitalism in the moral sphere, people are increasingly concerned about establishing a new moral atmosphere and opposing bourgeois morality.

So, what is morality? What is the difference between communist morality and bourgeois morality? What is the essence and basic characteristics of communist morality? These are all questions we need to understand.

The two books, "On Communist Morality" and "Lenin and Stalin on Communist Moral Education," provide clear answers to these questions.

The bourgeoisie has made the concept of morality extremely mysterious. According to them, morality is inherent in human nature. People are born with so-called moral principles in their "hearts," so morality is "eternal" and "unchanging." Is there such a thing as "eternal" and "unchanging" morality in the world? Of course not. Because in the eyes of Marxists-Leninists, morality is nothing more than a social ideology. Like all other social ideologies, morality is a reflection of social existence, and it changes with the changes of society. In class society, morality always has a class nature. When Engels refuted Dühring's reactionary philosophy of "eternal morality," he pointed out: "Any moral theory, until now, is ultimately the product of the economic conditions of the society at the time. And because society has always developed through class antagonism, morality has always been the morality of a class: it either defends the rule and interests of the ruling class, or, when the oppressed class is powerful enough, it expresses resistance to this rule and upholds the future interests of the oppressed."

In explaining the origin and essence of morality, "On Communist Morality" points out that morality as a social ideology is determined by the nature of social existence and the mode of production, and it belongs to the superstructure of society. Since morality belongs to the superstructure of a certain society, it, like other superstructures, does not merely reflect the base, nor is it passive, neutral, and indifferent to the fate of its base and the fate of its class. On the contrary, once it appears, it becomes a great positive force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of its base. It is precisely because of this that "Communist morality can greatly strengthen the speed of development of our society and can multiply the source of power of our motherland." "Communist morality gives our people tremendous strength to fight against everything reactionary and contrary to our thinking." ("Lenin and Stalin on Communist Moral Education") From this, it can be seen that those who believe that moral issues are "irrelevant" to politics and socialist construction are completely at odds with Marxism-Leninism.

These two books, especially "On Communist Morality," devote a special chapter to analyzing bourgeois morality. The book points out that the essence of bourgeois morality is determined by the capitalist private ownership system and the principle of man exploiting man. Although bourgeois scholars promote the so-called "eternal morality" and "morality of all mankind," in fact, this is a trick used to fool and poison workers and peasants for the benefit of landlords and capitalists. As the book points out, in the era of capitalist primitive accumulation, the history of the bourgeoisie, which rose by blood and fire, ruthlessly plundering peasants and handicraftsmen has revealed the ugly face of bourgeois morality. "The law of the jungle," "man is wolf to man," "everyone for himself, and God for us all"—these are the principles of bourgeois morality. Lenin made the following description of the principles of bourgeois morality at the Third National Congress of the Communist Youth League: "Either you plunder others, or others plunder you; either you work for others, or others work for you; you are either a slave owner, or a slave. Obviously, anyone who is brought up in this society can be said to have been infected with such a mentality, habits, and views from the time they were breastfed—either to be a slave owner, or a slave, or a small private owner, a small clerk, a small bureaucrat, an intellectual, in short, to be someone who only cares about himself and ignores others." Therefore, individualism and egoism have become the criteria for being a person in the bourgeoisie.

Although the bourgeois apologists talk about "permanent virtues and universal eternal justice," they themselves do not necessarily abide by the principles they proclaim. "They will rudely trample on them at any time as long as it is beneficial to them." A popular American proverb quoted in the book says it well: "If you steal a loaf of bread, you will be jailed for ten years; if you steal a railway, you will be elected to the Senate." This sentence powerfully exposes all the hypocrisy of bourgeois morality.

In the era of imperialism, the morality of the bourgeoisie is even more degenerate. In order to pursue maximum profits, the imperialist bourgeoisie cruelly suppresses strikes, arrests and kills communists and progressive people, advocates war and atomic weapons, and promotes racial hatred and pornography. In the United States, even university presidents openly advocate murder. For example, the book cites Nays, the president of an American university, who shamelessly advocated: "We must conduct comprehensive training according to the law of power. Everyone must learn the art of killing. I don't think war should be limited to land, sea, and air forces, or limited in terms of killing weapons and methods. I am in favor of germ warfare and the use of poison gas, atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and intercontinental rockets. I do not agree with any consideration for hospitals, churches, schools, or any residential areas." This is the true portrayal of the so-called "American way of life" in the "free world" promoted by imperialism.

Communist morality is fundamentally opposed to bourgeois morality. The bourgeoisie says that "Communists deny all morality," which is malicious slander. Communists oppose the morality of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, but advocate communist morality. What is communist morality? According to Lenin's instructions: "The struggle to consolidate and complete the communist cause is the foundation of communist morality." That is to say, all actions that can promote the destruction of the decadent social system and the establishment of a new, socialist communist society are moral. Conversely, all actions that hinder the construction of socialist communism are immoral. "Lenin and Stalin on Communist Moral Education" points out: "The highest standard of communist morality is the struggle to build communism. The moral person we understand is those who contribute all their strength and energy to the struggle to build a new, communist society."

Both books tell us that the establishment of communist morality is not a spontaneous process, but is established by the proletariat in the struggle against capitalism based on the needs and interests of the proletarian struggle. It is the result of the Communist Party's enormous education of the people.

The book "On Communist Morality" uses considerable space to give a detailed explanation of this with the struggle examples of the Bolshevik Party. The book also points out that every victory of the social revolution is accompanied by the upsurge of the ideology and morality of the revolutionary masses. As for "those morally unstable weaklings who accidentally entered the party during the period of the highest revolutionary wave, but were later frightened by the difficulties of construction and struggle, were eliminated from the party ranks." "Those who wanted to take advantage of the position of the ruling party to pursue certain interests and satisfy personal ambitions and tried to sneak into the vanguard of the proletariat met with the same fate."

The task of communist moral education is to cultivate people's love for their motherland, cultivate proletarian internationalism, cultivate a communist attitude towards labor and public property, cultivate collectivism and the spirit of mutual assistance among comrades, cultivate socialist humanism and socialist family relations, as well as moral qualities such as loyalty and honesty. Both books list examples and make detailed analyses and explanations on these issues.

How to educate the people to cultivate communist moral qualities? The book "Lenin and Stalin on Communist Moral Education" has a special chapter answering this question. The book points out that the school is a central link in carrying out communist moral education for young people. Because "schools arm students with knowledge, cultivate their world outlook and character, and temper their will." However, limiting communist moral education to within schools and separating it from the vigorous social life will not have good results. Therefore, the book explains that the Communist Youth League, the Young Pioneers, extra-curricular education institutions, and families play a huge role in the communist moral education of young people and children. "This guarantees the unity of educational influences on students and promotes the completion of the task of communist moral education for the younger generation." Those who believe that educating the next generation is "anyway, the state is responsible" and "raising children without educating them" are completely wrong.

Actively participating in the revolutionary struggle, arming the people with the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and constantly carrying out criticism and self-criticism are the basic methods for carrying out communist moral education. The theory of Marxism-Leninism is the most important weapon for realizing socialism and communism. When people master the theory of Marxism-Leninism, they can raise their communist consciousness and form a communist world outlook. However, studying the theory of Marxism-Leninism does not mean rigidly sticking to books, detaching oneself from reality, and leaving actual struggle. On the contrary, it must be combined with actual struggle, as Lenin said in the book: "Without work, without struggle, then the knowledge of communism on books obtained only from communist pamphlets and writings can be said to be worthless." That is to say, only "using your work and abilities to serve the public cause. This is the essence of communist education. Only in such a work process can young men and women be cultivated into true communists."

    介绍两本谈共产主义道德的书
    王城
    “论共产主义道德”柯尔巴诺夫斯基著　康丁译　三联书店出版
    “列宁斯大林论共产主义道德教育”包德列夫著　南致善译　五十年代出版社出版
    向劳动人民进行共产主义道德教育，反对资产阶级思想的侵蚀，乃是我国过渡时期的重要任务之一。我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业不仅要按社会主义原则改变社会经济的面貌，而且也要改变人们的道德面貌。五年以来，由于社会主义生产关系的确立和发展，以及党对人民群众教育的加强，我国人民新的道德风气正在成长。而且随着道德领域内社会主义同资本主义斗争的尖锐化，人们越来越关心树立新的道德风气和反对资产阶级道德的问题。
  那末，道德是什么？共产主义道德和资产阶级的道德有什么区别？共产主义道德的本质及其基本特征是什么？这都是我们需要了解的一些问题。
  “论共产主义道德”、“列宁斯大林论共产主义道德教育”两本书，对于这些问题，作了明白的解答。
    资产阶级把道德的概念，闹得非常玄虚。据他们讲，道德是人类本性所固有的，人出娘胎的时候，“心灵”里就有所谓道德原则，因而道德是“永恒的”和“不变的”。世界上有没有“永恒的”和
  “不变的”道德呢？当然是没有的。因为在马克思列宁主义者看来，道德不是别的，而是一种社会意识形态。和其他一切社会意识形态一样，道德是社会存在的反映，它随着社会的变化而变化；在阶级社会里，道德总是有阶级性的。恩格斯在驳斥杜林关于“永恒的道德”的反动哲学时指出：“任何道德理论，直到现在，归根到底总是当时社会经济状况的产物。而因为直到现在社会总是发展于阶级对立之中，所以道德总是阶级的道德：它或是为统治阶级的统治及利益辩护，或是当被压迫阶级充分有力之时，它表现对于这个统治的反抗，而拥护被压迫者的将来的利益。”
    “论共产主义道德”一书在说明道德的起源和本质时指出，作为社会意识形态的道德决定于社会存在的性质和生产方式，它属于社会的上层建筑。道德既然属于一定社会的上层建筑，它便和别的上层建筑一样，不是只反映基础，不是消极地、中立地，对自己基础的命运和对自己阶级的命运漠不关心。相反地，它一经出现，就要成为极大的积极力量，积极帮助自己基础的形成和巩固。正因为如此，“共产主义道德能够大大加强我们社会的发展速度，并且能使我们祖国威力的源泉倍增起来。”“共产主义道德给我们人民以巨大力量，去和一切反动的、与我们思想相反的东西进行斗争。”（“列宁斯大林论共产主义道德教育”）由此可见，那些认为道德问题与政治和社会主义建设事业“无关”的论点，是和马克思列宁主义毫无共同之点的。
    这两本书，特别是“论共产主义道德”一书，有专章剖析资产阶级的道德。书中指出，资产阶级道德的本质，决定于资本主义私有制和人剥削人的原则，资产阶级学者虽然宣传所谓“永恒的道德”和“全人类的道德”，其实，这是为了地主和资本家的利益而用来愚弄和毒害工农的伎俩。如书中所指出，在资本主义原始积累时代，靠血和火起家的资产阶级残酷无情地剥夺农民和手工业者的历史，已昭然若揭地表现出资产阶级道德的丑恶面貌。“弱肉强食”“人对人如同狼对狼”“人人为自己，只有上帝为大家”，这就是资产阶级道德的原则。列宁在共产主义青年团第三次全国代表大会上对资产阶级道德的原则作了如下的表述：“不是你去掠夺别人，便是别人来掠夺你；不是你替别人作工，便是别人替你作工；你或是当一个奴隶主，或是当一个奴隶。显然，凡是在这个社会里教养出来的人，可以说从吃奶的时候就染上了这样一种心理，习惯和观点——不是当奴隶主，就是当奴隶，或者是当一个小私有者，小职员，小官僚，知识份子，总之是当一个只关心自己而不顾及旁人的人。”因此，个人主义、利己主义，便成了资产阶级做人的准则。
    资产阶级的御用学者，虽然大谈什么“永久的美德和普遍永恒的正义”，但他们本身并不一定要遵守他们所宣布的原则。“只要对他们有利，他们会随时粗暴地加以践踏。”书中引用的一句美国流行的谚语说得好：“假如你偷了一个面包，你会坐牢十年；假如你窃取了铁道，你将被选入参议院”。这句话有力地揭穿了资产阶级道德的全部虚伪性。
    在帝国主义时代，资产阶级的道德更为堕落。帝国主义资产阶级为了追求最大限度的利润，他们残酷地镇压罢工，逮捕和杀害共产党员和进步人士，鼓吹战争和原子武器，宣扬种族仇视和色情淫乱。在美国，甚至当大学校长的，竟公然宣传杀人。例如书中引证的美国一个大学校长奈斯就无耻地主张：“我们必须根据强权法则进行全面训练。每一个人都必须学会杀人的艺术。我不以为战争应当限于陆、海、空军，或在杀人的武器和方法上有所限制。我赞成细菌战和使用毒气、原子弹、氢弹和过洋火箭。我不赞成对病院、教堂、学校或任何居民区采取什么顾惜的态度。”这就是帝国主义宣扬的所谓“自由世界”中“美国生活方式”的真实写照。
    共产主义道德和资产阶级道德根本对立。资产阶级说“共产党人否认一切道德”，这是恶意的诽谤。共产党人反对资产阶级等一切剥削阶级的道德，但主张共产主义的道德。什么是共产主义道德呢？按照列宁的指示：“巩固与完成共产主义事业的斗争是共产主义道德底基础。”也就是说，凡是能够促使腐朽没落的社会制度的消灭和新的、社会主义共产主义社会的建成的一切行为，都是道德的。反之，凡是阻碍社会主义共产主义建成的行为，都是不道德的。“列宁斯大林论共产主义道德教育”一书指出：“共产主义道德的最高标准，是争取建成共产主义的斗争。我们所理解的有道德的人，是那些把自己的一切力量和精力贡献给为建成新的、共产主义社会而斗争的人。”
    两本书都告诉我们，共产主义道德的建立，并不是自发的过程，而是无产阶级在反对资本主义斗争中，根据无产阶级斗争的要求和利益而树立起来的。它是共产党对人民群众进行巨大教育的结果。
  “论共产主义道德”一书，用了相当多的篇幅，以布尔什维克党的斗争事例对此作了详细的说明。书中并指出，社会革命每一次胜利，都伴随着革命群众的思想和道德的高涨。至于“那些在革命浪潮最高涨的时期偶然进入党内，后来又被建设和斗争的困难吓倒了的，道德上动摇不定的软弱分子，都从党的队伍中淘汰出去了。”“那些想利用执政党的地位，追求某种利益，满足个人野心而设法混进无产阶级先锋队的人们，也遇到了同样的命运”。
    共产主义道德教育的任务，在于培养人民热爱自己的祖国，培养无产阶级的国际主义，培养对待劳动和公共财产的共产主义态度，培养集体主义和同志互助精神，培养社会主义人道主义和社会主义的家庭关系，以及忠诚老实等道德品质。两书对于这些问题，都分别列举事例，作了详细的分析和说明。
    怎样教育人民培养共产主义道德品质呢？“列宁斯大林论共产主义道德教育”一书有专章回答这个问题。书中指出，学校是对青年进行共产主义道德教育的一个中心环节。因为“学校以知识来武装学生，培养他们的世界观和性格，锻炼他们的意志。”但是，把共产主义道德教育局限于学校以内，而与蓬勃的社会生活脱离，是不会有良好效果的。因此书中说明，共青团、少先队、校外的教育机关以及家庭等，在青年和儿童的共产主义道德教育中起着巨大的作用。“这一点，保证了对于学生进行的教育影响的统一，并促进了青年一代共产主义道德教育任务的完成。”那些认为教育后代“反正有国家负责”，对子女“养而不教”的观点是十分错误的。
    积极参加革命斗争，以马克思列宁主义的理论武装人民，并不断地开展批评和自我批评，乃是进行共产主义道德教育的基本方法。马克思列宁主义的理论，是实现社会主义和共产主义最重要的武器。人们掌握了马克思列宁主义的理论，就能提高共产主义的意识，形成共产主义的世界观。但是，学习马克思列宁主义的理论，并不是死啃书本，脱离实际和离开实际斗争，恰恰相反，它一定要与实际斗争结合起来，正如书中引证列宁的话所说的那样：“没有工作，没有斗争，那末单从共产主义小册子和著作中求得的书本上的共产主义知识，可以说是一文钱不值”。也就是说，只有“把自己的工作和能力用去为公共事业服务。这就是共产主义教育的实质。只有在这样的工作过程中，青年男女才能培养成为真正的共产主义者。”
