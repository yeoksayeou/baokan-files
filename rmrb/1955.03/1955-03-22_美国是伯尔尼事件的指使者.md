The armed attack on the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic in Switzerland on February 14th by a group of fascist bandits is an unprecedented and shocking event in international relations in recent years. It has aroused the indignation and condemnation of the Chinese people and progressive public opinion around the world.

The participants in this attack were a group of fascist elements who were abandoned by the Romanian people and fled abroad. Among them, Fergescu and Niculescu had organized the reactionary "Free Romania League" in Switzerland, and had consistently engaged in activities against the Romanian People's Republic. According to Reuters, some of the bandits who participated in the attack traveled from West Germany to Bern in a U.S. military vehicle stationed in West Germany.

The Swiss government's allowing foreign fascist organizations to exist within its territory and allowing them and a group of armed bandits crossing the border to act freely without being stopped directly shows that the Swiss government has not only failed to provide practical protection for the inviolability of diplomatic envoys, but has also created favorable conditions for such criminal acts.

From the beginning of the attack, the Romanian government repeatedly demanded that the Swiss government stop it, but the Swiss government did not take any effective measures, so the bandits were able to occupy the embassy for two full days and nights without any restraint, destroying the embassy, stealing documents, and beating the embassy driver, Aurilla Setu, to death. Afterwards, the Swiss government, disregarding the basic principles of international law, tried its best to shirk its universally recognized obligation to protect the privileges of diplomatic missions.

Now that more than a month has passed, the Swiss government, ignoring the protests of the Romanian People's Republic government and the accusations of world public opinion, refuses to seriously deal with this incident. On the contrary, it secretly released the two fascist elements, Fergescu and Niculescu, who had been arrested for participating in the attack, and allowed them to publicly issue statements in Geneva defending the attack, threatening the Romanian People's Republic, and preparing to carry out new provocations.

Everyone knows that this attack was instigated and organized by U.S. imperialism. This group of provocateurs has always been subsidized by the notorious U.S. "Mutual Security Act" funds, and the incident was carefully planned beforehand. According to the French newspaper "L'Aurore," on February 2nd, U.S. intelligence personnel and Romanian fascist leaders such as Fergescu held a secret meeting in Paris to arrange the incident. Afterwards, according to Agence France-Presse, the documents stolen by the bandits have been sent to Washington.

The reason why the United States launched this robber-like attack on the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic was to carry out new slanders and provocations against the world's peace and democracy camp, to attempt to divert European and world public opinion from condemning and opposing the Paris Agreements, and to worsen the European situation. After the attack, the U.S. United Press immediately fabricated and spread various lies about the so-called "subversive activities" of the Romanian Embassy in Bern, and even went so far as to slander the embassy driver as a "communist spy." The U.S. "New York Post" actually praised this heinous attack as one of the "greatest" actions in the "Cold War." Here, the "New York Post" unintentionally revealed the following truth: this attack is just one of a series of provocative incidents by U.S. imperialism against the entire world peace and democracy camp and all peace-loving countries and peoples. Last December, the military attache of the Czechoslovak Republic in Switzerland was unreasonably expelled by the Swiss government; in mid-January of this year, when the Romanian song and dance troupe visited Paris, it was also disrupted by Romanian exiled fascist bandits. Robert Gray, a U.S. official in Austria, attempted to induce Narivolko, the director of the consular department of the Soviet Embassy in Austria, to defect this February, but failed.

The above facts show that U.S. imperialism's shameless provocative behavior, which violates the most basic principles of international law in order to worsen international relations and create tension, has long become an important component of U.S. foreign policy. We, the Chinese people, believe that these bankrupt conspiracies will not only fail to achieve the purpose of confusing public opinion and deceiving the people, but will also make the people of the world more clearly recognize the ugly face of U.S. imperialism.

Under the pressure of U.S. imperialism, the Swiss government allowed this provocative act to occur in its own capital, which is not a glorious thing for Switzerland. The Swiss government bears an inescapable responsibility for this provocative incident. The Chinese people fully support the reasonable demands of the Romanian People's Republic government that the fascist bandits who attacked the embassy must be severely punished and that the Swiss government must compensate the Romanian embassy and embassy personnel for their losses. This is required to maintain the sacred inviolability of diplomatic envoys, and it is also necessary to maintain normal diplomatic relations between countries and to safeguard world peace.

    美国是伯尔尼事件的指使者
    舒鸥
    二月十四日，罗马尼亚人民共和国驻瑞士公使馆遭到了武装的法西斯匪徒的袭击，这是近年来国际关系中一件空前未有的、骇人听闻的事件。它已引起了中国人民和全世界进步舆论的愤慨和指责。
    这次袭击的参加者是一群被罗马尼亚人民唾弃后逃亡国外的法西斯分子。其中费尔盖山努和尼古列斯古两人曾在瑞士境内组织了反动的“自由罗马尼亚联盟”，一贯进行着反对罗马尼亚人民共和国的勾当。据路透社消息，参加这次袭击的某些匪徒是乘坐一辆驻西德的美军汽车从西德越境到伯尔尼的。
    瑞士政府允许外国法西斯组织在其境内存在，并让他们和一批越境的武装匪徒自由行动而不被制止，这就直接说明了瑞士政府对外交使节的不可侵犯性不仅未予以实际的保障，而且还为这种犯罪行为造成了方便的条件。
    袭击事件一开始，罗马尼亚政府就向瑞士政府一再提出制止的要求，但瑞士政府并未采取任何有效措施，因而匪徒们得以毫无顾忌地强占使馆达两天两夜之久，捣毁使馆，盗劫文件，把使馆司机奥里拉·塞图殴伤致死。事后瑞士政府又不顾国际法的基本准则，竭力推卸众所公认的保护外交使团特权所应尽的义务。
    现在事情已过去一个多月了，瑞士政府仍不顾罗马尼亚人民共和国政府的抗议和世界正义舆论的指责，拒绝对这个事件作认真的处理，相反的却把已经逮捕的参与这次袭击事件的费尔盖山努和尼古列斯古两名法西斯分子偷偷释放，并允许他们在日内瓦公开发表声明为这次袭击事件辩护，威胁罗马尼亚人民共和国，准备进行新的挑衅。
    这次袭击事件大家都知道是美帝国主义所策动和组织的。这批挑衅分子一向受到臭名昭著的美国“共同安全法案”经费的津贴，事件发生前是有周密计划的。据法国“震旦报”消息，二月二日美国情报机关人员和费尔盖山努等罗马尼亚法西斯首脑曾在巴黎举行秘密会议，对这次事件作了布置。事后，匪徒所盗劫到的文件，据法新社称，已经送到华盛顿。
    美国所以要对罗马尼亚人民共和国公使馆发动这次强盗式的袭击，是为了对世界和平民主阵营进行新的诬蔑和挑衅，企图转移欧洲和世界舆论对谴责和反对巴黎协定的注意，恶化欧洲局势。袭击事件发生后，美国环球通讯社随即捏造和散布各种关于在伯尔尼的罗马尼亚公使馆的所谓“颠覆活动”的谎言，甚至极端放肆地诬蔑使馆司机为“共产主义间谍”。美国“纽约邮报”居然称颂这次罪恶的袭击为“冷战”中的“最伟大”的行动之一。这里，
  “纽约邮报”无意中道出了如下的真理，这就是：这次袭击仅仅是美帝国主义对整个世界和平民主阵营和一切爱好和平的国家和人民一系列挑衅事件中的一个。去年十二月份捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻瑞士武官被瑞士政府无理驱逐出境；今年一月中旬罗马尼亚歌舞团访问巴黎时，也曾遭到罗马尼亚亡命的法西斯匪徒的捣乱。美国驻奥地利当局人员劳勃·葛莱在今年二月曾企图诱骗苏联驻奥使馆领事部主任纳里伏柯叛变未遂。
    上述事实说明，美帝国主义为了恶化国际关系，制造紧张局势，违反起码的国际法准则的无耻挑衅行为早已成为美国外交政策的重要组成部分。我们中国人民相信这种早已破产了的阴谋诡计不但达不到迷惑舆论、欺骗人民的目的，而且使世界人民愈加认清了美帝国主义的丑恶面貌。
    瑞士政府在美帝国主义的压力下允许这次挑衅行为发生在自己的首都，这对瑞士来说并不是一件光彩的事情。瑞士政府对这次挑衅事件是负有难以推卸的责任的。中国人民完全支持罗马尼亚人民共和国政府的合理要求，袭击公使馆的法西斯匪徒必须受到严厉的惩罚，瑞士政府必须赔偿罗马尼亚公使馆以及公使馆人员的损失。这是维护外交使节的神圣不可侵犯性所要求的，也是为维持国际间正常的外交关系和维护世界和平所必需的。
