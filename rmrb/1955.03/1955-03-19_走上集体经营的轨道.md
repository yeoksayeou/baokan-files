    Embarking on the Track of Collective Management
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Qu Yifan
    Recently, I visited the Jingming Agricultural Production Cooperative, newly established in Fangfan Township, Lidian District, Xishui County, Hubei Province. This cooperative formulated its production increase plan for this year at the end of February. Now, the preparations for plowing, such as repairing ponds, accumulating fertilizer, and spring sowing seeds, have been basically completed according to the original plan. In recent days, they have also invited blacksmiths to help the cooperative repair agricultural tools, striving to start spring plowing early. The cooperative's spring-harvest crops, such as wheat and rapeseed, have also been hoed two to three times, and most have been top-dressed with fertilizer once.
    One day, cooperative member Chen Jialin and I passed by a wheat field. He excitedly pointed and said, "Look! The best-growing wheat seedlings are from our cooperative!" However, according to Zhou Changhuan, the leader of the second production team, old man Chen Jialin wanted to withdraw from the cooperative not long ago and often engaged in passive resistance and emotional outbursts in production.
    The Jingming Cooperative was established last October under the leadership of the local Communist Party branch. At that time, it was the busy season for winter plowing and planting. In the beginning, the cooperative members went to the fields with smiles and laughter. After about half a month, the original enthusiasm of the cooperative members gradually diminished, and production slackened. Due to the unreasonable labor evaluation system in the cooperative, the lack of experience in production management, and the failure to establish a "treating the cooperative as home" mentality and collective production habits among the cooperative members, phenomena such as production chaos, no one being responsible, absenteeism, and wasting time occurred. Active and hardworking people felt they were suffering losses, while a few lazy people took advantage. Some cooperative members, seeing the chaotic situation in the cooperative, doubted the superiority of collective management and felt "stuck between a rock and a hard place."
    In November, the Lidian District Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the directors of newly established cooperatives in the district to review and summarize the work of the newly established cooperatives and introduced the experience of old cooperatives in strengthening production management and implementing the contracting system last year. Li Sipu, the director of the Jingming Cooperative, returned to the cooperative and conveyed what he had learned in the district to the cooperative members, and everyone's enthusiasm was boosted again. Some people said, "In the past, we only saw that the situation in the cooperative was not right, but we didn't know what the problem was. Now we understand." After full discussion among the cooperative members, it was agreed that the cooperative should first formulate a short-term production plan, and then it would be easier to do things; secondly, the old method of "rigidly dividing and flexibly recording" work points should be changed, and a small-scale contracting system should be implemented. At the same time, through the implementation of the contracting system, an education on distribution according to work and love for the cooperative should be universally carried out among the cooperative members. Therefore, the cooperative formulated a spring production plan and discussed a new method of contracting by piece based on this plan.
    After the implementation of the contracting system, the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members greatly increased, and some people who had been passively resistant began to change. However, new problems arose after a while. Some people only cared about earning more work points, and only pursued quantity in their work, regardless of quality. Although the slogan "contracting with quality guaranteed" had been put forward during the implementation of the contracting system, the quality standards for various productions were not clearly defined at that time, nor was a production inspection system established. In particular, some cooperative members were still half-convinced about whether they could "increase production and increase income" after joining the cooperative, and they could not muster the energy to work. Chen Jialin was such a person. He was the only individual farmer before the organization of the cooperative. He had more than nine mu of paddy fields, and in the past, relying solely on one person's labor, working from dawn till dusk, he could never grow crops well, and the grain he harvested every year was not enough to eat. He heard that labor model Li Sipu was leading the establishment of the cooperative, so he took the initiative to request to join the cooperative. However, after joining the cooperative, on the one hand, he could not get used to the transition from individual farming to collective production at once. At the same time, he was constantly worried about whether he could increase his income this year, fearing that the cooperative was large and had too many people, and that it would not be done well. Therefore, he felt listless when working, perfunctory, and often wasted time or was late. Once, the production team leader assigned him to make furrow ridges in the field. He only cared about working quickly to earn more work points, and the furrow ridges he made were too narrow and shallow, and had to be reworked. When the cooperative held a meeting of cooperative members, everyone criticized this "shoddy work" phenomenon. Some said, "If we continue to do this, the cooperative will not be able to increase production. No matter how many work points you earn, where will you exchange them for money!"
    Whether agricultural production cooperatives can guarantee increased production and guarantee increased income for cooperative members, the cooperative members all wanted to have a clear understanding and hoped to formulate the cooperative's annual production increase plan as soon as possible. In late February, the working group of the Xishui County Committee of the Communist Party of China arrived in Fangfan Township to help the five agricultural production cooperatives in the township and the farmers of the whole township formulate this year's production plan. The Jingming Cooperative mobilized all cooperative members to explore production potential and find ways to increase production. After more than ten days of deliberation and discussion, the annual production increase plan was formulated. Based on the specific situation of the cooperative having a large population, little land, and surplus labor, the production increase plan particularly emphasized several main aspects of increasing production, such as increasing the multiple cropping area of the land, intensive farming, and developing diversified operations. After calculation, the total output of the cooperative's paddy fields can be increased by more than 30% compared with last year, and the output of Daizi cotton planted on dry land can also be increased compared with last year. The 138 ridges and 33 field edges in the cooperative are also used to plant miscellaneous grain crops. In terms of developing diversified operations, plans are made to raise fish and lotus roots in ponds, and to engage in transportation, pig farming and other sideline production, which is also a considerable amount of income. Based on the cooperative's production plan, the cooperative members have also formulated their own household production plans, integrating the interests of the cooperative and their own families. Chen Jialin's household plan is: the couple plans to do 250 workdays in the cooperative this year, plus the remuneration they should get for the land they invested in the cooperative, and this year's actual income will increase by more than ten shi (140 jin per shi) of rice compared with last year.

    走上集体经营的轨道
    新华社记者  曲一凡
    最近，记者访问了湖北省浠水县里店区方畈乡新建的精明农业生产合作社。这个社在二月底制订了今年的增产计划，现在社里的修塘、积肥、春播种籽等备耕工作基本上完成了原订计划。近日来又邀来了铁匠，帮助社里整修农具，争取提早进行春耕。合作社的小麦和油菜等春收作物，也都锄过了两遍到三遍，大都已施了一遍追肥。
    一天，社员陈家林同记者经过一片麦田，他兴奋地指划着说：“你看！哪一片麦苗儿长的好，那就是我们社里的。”但是，据第二生产队队长周长焕告诉我：陈家林老头，不久以前还要退社，在生产上时常消极怠工闹情绪哩。
    精明社是去年十月间在本乡中共支部领导下办起来的。当时正是冬耕冬种的繁忙季节，开头几天，社员们都有说有笑地下地去了。大约过了半个月，社员们的原来的一股热情却一天天减退，生产也松劲了。由于社里的劳动评分不合理，生产管理缺乏经验，社员中还没有树立起“以社为家”的思想和集体生产习惯，产生了生产混乱、无人负责、旷工窝工等现象。积极肯干的人嫌吃亏，少数偷懒耍滑的人讨便宜。有些社员看到社里生产混乱的情景，对合作社集体经营的优越性发生怀疑，感到“进退两难”。
    十一月间，中共里店区委员会召集全区的新建社社长开会，检查总结了新建社的工作，介绍了去年的老社加强生产管理和实行包工制的经验。精明社社长李斯普回到社里，把他在区上学的东西向社员一传达，大家的劲头又鼓起来啦。有人说：“过去光看到社里的情形不对头，就是不晓得毛病出在哪里？这一下弄明白了。”经过社员们充分讨论，认为首先社里要订一个短期的生产计划，有了计划才好办事；其次要把“死分活记”评工的老办法改一改，实行小包工制，同时通过实行包工制，向社员普遍进行一次按劳取酬和爱社的教育。于是，社里订出了春季生产计划，又根据这个计划讨论了按件包工的新办法。
    实行包工制以后，社员的劳动积极性大大提高了，有些消极怠工的人也开始有了转变。过了不久，却又发生了新的问题。有些人光顾着多挣工分，干活只求数量，不管质量。实行包工制的时候，虽然也曾提出“包工定质”的口号，但当时对各项生产的质量标准没有明确规定，也没有建立生产检查制度。特别是有些社员对于入社后，究竟能不能
  “增加生产，增加收入”还是半信半疑的，干活提不起精神。陈家林就是这样的人。他是组织合作社前唯一的单干农民。他有九亩多的水田，过去光靠一个人劳动，起早搭黑的，庄稼总是种不好，年年打的粮食不够吃。他听说劳动模范李斯普领导建社，就主动要求入社。可是进社后，一方面刚由单干转到集体生产一时过不惯，同时时刻担心今年能不能增加收入，怕合作社人多家大搞不好，所以干起活来浑身没劲，潦潦草草，经常窝工、迟到。有一回，生产队长分派他去田里起墒沟，他只顾快干多挣一些工分，起的墒沟又窄又浅，还得重新返工。当社里召开社员大会时，大家对这种“偷工减料”现象提出了批评，有的说：“这样搞下去社里不能增产，凭你挣的工分再多，到哪里兑钱去！”
    农业生产合作社究竟能不能保证增加生产，保证社员增加收入，社员们都要求心里有个底，盼望尽早把社里一年的增产计划订出来。二月下旬，中共浠水县委员会工作组到了方畈乡，帮助全乡五个农业生产合作社和全乡农民制订今年的生产计划。精明社发动全体社员挖掘生产潜力，找出增产窍门，经过了十多天的酝酿讨论，全年的增产计划订好了。他们根据社内人多、田地少、劳动力有余的具体情况，在增产计划中特别强调增加田地的复种面积，精耕细作，和发展多种经营等几个主要增产环节。全社的水田经计算总产量可比去年增产三成以上，旱地种岱字棉产量也可比去年增多。社里有一百三十八条田埂和三十三块地边，也利用起来种上杂粮作物。在发展多种经营方面，计划在水塘里养鱼，种藕，并从事运输、养猪等副业生产，也是一笔数目很可观的收入。社员们根据社里的生产计划，又分别订出了自己的家庭生产计划，把社的利益和自家的利益结合一体。陈家林订的家庭计划是：夫妻两口今年打算在社里做二百五十个劳动日，加上入社土地应得的报酬，今年的实际收入将比去年增加十多石（每石一百四十斤）的稻谷。
