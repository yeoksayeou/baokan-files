Supplying Rural Areas with Large Quantities of Prepared Medicines
Prepared medicines are already commodities with large sales volume in the rural areas of Zhejiang Province. In carrying out the work of bringing prepared medicines to the countryside, the state-owned pharmaceutical companies in various parts of Zhejiang Province actively assist the cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned department stores to learn the usage, ingredients, and storage methods of prepared medicines, helping them to dispel their ideological concerns of "fear of making mistakes, fear of trouble, and fear of stockpiles." Now, department stores in many counties throughout the province and more than a thousand supply and marketing cooperatives are operating prepared medicines.

The state-owned pharmaceutical companies supply a large quantity of prepared medicines to the rural areas, changing the situation in the past where "authentic prescriptions were spoken, but fake medicines were sold" and "gold had a price, but medicine was priceless." For example, in the first quarter of last year, the price of penicillin eye ointment sold by state-owned pharmaceutical companies in Lishui and other places was 1,700 yuan (old currency) per tube, while the price sold by private merchants in the countryside was 3,500 yuan (old currency) per tube; now, after a large number of prepared medicines have been distributed to the countryside, the price of prepared medicines sold by private merchants is already the same as the price of the local supply and marketing cooperatives. Zhang Manniu, a member of the Gaotian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qiubin Township, Jinhua County, said: "In the past, we suffered from the deception of illegal private merchants and itinerant peddlers, who even sold us cow dung and straw shoe ash as medicine; today, the People's Government transports prepared medicines to the countryside for us, and we will no longer be exploited by illegal private merchants." Jin Shaoxiang, a member of the Gong Zhuhong mutual aid group in Xiguan Village, Jinhua County, said: "In the past, when we were producing in the fields, we had to endure headaches and fever; now, the supply and marketing cooperative has medicines for sale, and the production team has also prepared commonly used prepared medicines to carry with them, so small ailments will not delay production."

    供应农村大批成药
    成药已经是浙江省农村中销路很大的商品。浙江省各地国营医药公司在开展成药下乡的工作中，积极协助供销合作社和国营百货商店的干部学习成药的用法、成分和贮藏方法等业务知识，帮助他们解除了“怕差错、怕麻烦、怕积压”的思想顾虑。现在，全省许多县的百货商店和一千多个供销合作社都经营了成药。
    国营医药公司供应农村大量成药，改变了以前农村中“说真方，卖假药”“黄金有价药无价”的情形。例如去年第一季度丽水等地国营医药公司出售配尼西林眼药膏的价格是一千七百元（旧币）一支，乡间私商的售价却是三千五百元（旧币）一支；现在，成药大量下乡以后，私商出卖成药的价格已经同当地供销合作社的价格一样了。金华县秋滨乡高田村农业生产合作社社员张蛮牛说：“过去我们受尽了不法私商和江湖郎中的欺骗，连牛粪和草鞋灰也当药卖给我们；今天人民政府把成药给我们运到乡下，我们再也不受不法私商的剥削了。”金华县西关村龚珠洪互助组组员金绍乡说：“过去我们在田间生产，遇到头痛脑热只好勉强支持；现在供销合作社有药卖，生产小组又准备了常用成药随身携带，有点小毛病就不会耽误生产了。”（邬烈京）
