Central government organ leaders are all emphasizing the work of food conservation. Xie Juezai, Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and leading comrades from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications have already made mobilization reports to their cadres on conserving food. After making his report, Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, frequently visits the cafeteria to inspect. Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, specifically arranged this work at a ministry meeting, and Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister, personally presided over the formulation of a food conservation plan.

Thanks to the support of the leaders, food conservation work in various organs is progressing smoothly. Especially in the Ministry of Culture, Vice Minister Zhang Zhixiang cited typical examples of wasting food at a meeting of all staff members of the General Office, calling on everyone to oppose this behavior, which greatly educated comrades. Later, the Ministry of Culture cafeteria still found instances of leftover half-eaten steamed buns or half-bowls of rice, so criticisms were made, and these leftovers were put on display. After that, this phenomenon greatly decreased. In addition, after the various departments and bureaus under the Ministry of Culture submitted food conservation plans, Vice Minister Zhang Zhixiang specifically analyzed these plans. At a meeting of the directors of the offices of each department and bureau on March 12, he criticized the perfunctory attitude of not being specific and realistic when formulating the plans, and required the responsible comrades of each department and bureau to go to each unit to inspect, so that the plans could be made practical and feasible. By March 19, the School Affairs Department, the Film Bureau, the Publishing Administration, and other units had formulated relatively practical plans.

    Using Beet Pulp to Replace Feed

Beet (sugar radish) is the raw material for sugar production. After the sugar factory extracts the sugar it contains, it becomes beet pulp. This pulp contains rich nutrients such as protein, fat, calcium, phosphorus, and some sugar, making it an excellent feed.

Heilongjiang Province is China's main sugar beet processing industrial area. The province discharges a total of 680,000 tons of beet pulp every year. If all of it is used to replace grain feed, it can save 20,000 tons of grain. In the past, because no attention was paid to its utilization, a large amount of excellent feed was washed away by the Songhua River. Last winter, when Soviet experts visited the Harbin Sugar Factory and saw this waste, they said that in the Soviet Union, this phenomenon would be considered a crime.

The Soviet experts' opinions aroused the attention of the leaders of Harbin City, who immediately instructed the relevant departments to conduct research and experiments. The experimental results proved that beet pulp is an excellent feed for livestock such as pigs, cattle, horses, and chickens. The Harbin Local State-owned Livestock Farm uses beet pulp to feed dairy cows. Each dairy cow is fed 27 catties of beet pulp every day, which can save 3 catties of grain feed and some succulent feed, without affecting the yield and quality of milk. If all the dairy cows in the city use beet pulp as feed, at least 15,000 catties of grain feed can be saved every day. The Harbin Local State-owned Pig Farm fed more than 30,000 catties of beet pulp in three months, saving more than 4,000 catties of rice bran and soybean cake.

Now the relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province are vigorously organizing the use of beet pulp as feed. Farmers near the Harbin Sugar Factory, Heping Sugar Factory, Acheng Sugar Factory, and Hongguang Sugar Factory have successively taken beet pulp back to feed pigs and cattle. In the Majia Village of the suburbs of Harbin City, six agricultural production cooperatives have begun to use beet pulp to feed pigs. The use of beet pulp has especially solved the difficulty of insufficient feed in cities. For example, Harbin City has 5,000 dairy cows, 70,000 pigs, and 80,000 chickens, requiring a large amount of feed. Now it can get a large supply of beet pulp.

In order to solve the problems of beet pulp having too much water, large volume, and difficult transportation, the Harbin Sugar Factory will restore its old drying equipment this year, and the Heping Sugar Factory will establish mechanical pressing equipment, so that beet pulp can be fully utilized. The Provincial Department of Agriculture also plans to establish four larger-scale pig farms near the four sugar factories this year, each pig farm will raise more than 4,000 pigs, using beet pulp as feed nearby, to save grain and increase the production of hogs.

    Producing 240,000 More Catties of Flour

In the first few months of this year, eight flour mills in Shanghai have produced more than 240,000 catties of flour for the country. These flours still maintain the original standard specifications.

Since January of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Grain Bureau has formulated a unified average advanced quota standard based on the quality and variety of wheat and the technical equipment conditions of each factory. It also convened technology exchange meetings for factory directors, technicians, inspectors, workers, etc., and introduced advanced experience. After improving its equipment, the state-owned Shanghai Flour Mill has broken through the quota standard. The jointly owned Hua Feng Flour Mill also exceeded the quota standard in February.

    Formulating Specific Measures to Conserve Grain

Various organs, organizations, schools, and enterprises in Jingdezhen City, Jiangxi Province, are actively taking specific measures to conserve grain. According to statistics from the plans of 78 units, more than 38,000 catties of rice will be saved in March compared to February.

In early March, the Secretary of the Jingdezhen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Mayor of Jingdezhen City made reports to the city's party members and government department cadres on cherishing grain and opposing wasting grain. The responsible cadres of each unit personally led inspections of grain waste and formulated specific measures to conserve grain. After all teachers and students of Jingdezhen Normal School inspected and criticized the phenomenon of wasting grain, it is estimated that more than 200 catties of rice can be saved every day. All 168 cadres of the Municipal People's Committee have made assurances to cherish and conserve grain.

    Inspecting Grain Storage Work

In order to reduce grain losses and ensure the safe storage of grain through the summer, the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized inspection teams to inspect the grain storage work of various warehouses of the grain department from February 18 to March 10. During the inspection, it was found that some grain bins were not up to standard and were in danger of collapsing, and some had already collapsed; some warehouses had grain with too much moisture or impurities, which could easily become moldy; and many warehouses had shortcomings such as unsound systems. After the inspection, the Grain Bureau took many measures to strengthen grain storage work. Unsafe grain bins were renovated, emptied, or repaired according to their degree of danger, and workers were mobilized to determine the specifications of the bins. For grain with high moisture content, timely inspection and handling were carried out, and systems such as grain storage and sanitation were revised, and new systems such as "Prevention and Control Laboratory Operating Procedures" and "Acceptance of Bins" were formulated.

    Changing from Scooping Rice to Steaming Rice Prevents Rice from Being Lost in the Pot

The food service workers of the Tianjin First Workers' Sanatorium actively use their brains to avoid wasting grain. In the past, the cooks used to scoop rice when making rice, and there were always rice grains that could not be completely scooped out of the rice pot. Over time, the amount of grain wasted was also very large, so they switched to steaming rice in enamel basins. The steamed rice is no longer loaded into large wooden buckets, but directly carried to the dining hall in the original basins, avoiding the waste of grain.

Many sanatorium patients also pay attention to saving grain and supervise each other. Once, a sanatorium patient who had just been admitted took a bowl of rice, ate a few mouthfuls and left some. The sanatorium patient next to him, Ma Xitian, a worker from the Tianjin Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, said on the spot: Comrade! If the peasant brothers see you wasting grain like this, how would you feel? This incident was known to everyone in the dining hall, and everyone's eyes were on this sanatorium patient who was wasting grain. Since then, that sanatorium patient no longer wasted rice.

    Promoting the "Raw Rice Steaming Method"

After the Nanjing Xinhua Daily introduced the "Raw Rice Steaming Method" of Changzhou Normal School on February 7, Nanjing No. 8 Middle School combined it with the school's situation to conduct research and experiments. It has now been basically successful, and can save more than 100 catties of rice every day.

No. 8 Middle School implemented the "Raw Rice Steaming Method" on the original equipment, only adding a kind of "iron steamer." This "iron steamer" is made of thin iron sheet, circular in shape, with many small holes on it, and placed in the pot. Each time when steaming rice, add water to the pot, pour the rice into the pot and steam for about 30 minutes. When the pot emits circular steam, put the rice into a wooden bucket, add boiling water and simmer for about 20 minutes. After the rice absorbs the water, pour it into the pot again and steam for about an hour, and it becomes rice that is not burnt and has a suitable consistency.

Originally, cooking rice would yield about 2.5 catties of cooked rice per catty of raw rice, but now steaming rice yields more than 2.13 catties of cooked rice per catty of raw rice. According to the experiments in the last ten days or so, under the same conditions of dishes, weather, and dining time, steaming rice can save more than 100 catties of rice per day compared to cooking rice. In this way, more than 30,000 catties of grain can be saved for the country in a year.

Teachers, students, and staff all like to eat this rice, especially the elderly teachers. School doctor Zhou Cuqiu said: Steamed rice is loose and soft, which is good for the intestines and stomach, and can promote the intestines and stomach to absorb nutrients. The nutritional value of steamed rice is also better than that of cooked rice.

    Cigarette Factories Save Paste

Recently, the paste used in the packaging workshop of the state-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 5 has been reduced by one-third compared with the past. Each time packaging more than 600 packs of cigarettes can save paste made from half a catty of grain. According to the factory's current output, the flour and miscellaneous grains saved in a year can feed nearly 200 people for a month. The experience of this factory in saving paste has aroused the attention of many cigarette factories that previously believed that saving paste was not of much value.

The method of saving paste was first researched and implemented by the Zhang Chunfeng packaging team of this factory. When pasting the packaging paper of each pack of cigarettes, the paste is applied evenly and thinly, and the tax票 on the cigarettes is changed from pasting all over to pasting on both ends. Workers also use various methods to prevent the loss of paste due to air drying. In early March, the number of packs of cigarettes packaged by the Zhang Chunfeng team with one catty of paste increased from more than 600 to more than 840. People in the factory said that less paste is used, and moisture is easy to dry out, which can also prevent the cigarettes from becoming moldy during the plum rain season. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中央各机关领导同志重视节约粮食工作
    中央各机关领导同志都很重视节约粮食的工作。内务部谢觉哉部长和交通部、粮食部、邮电部的领导同志，已向干部作了节约粮食的动员报告。高等教育部杨秀峰部长在作了报告以后，还经常到食堂检查。文化部钱俊瑞副部长在部务会议上专门布置了这一工作，张致祥副部长还亲自主持制订节约粮食的计划。
    由于领导同志的支持，各机关节约粮食的工作正在顺利地进行。特别是文化部，因为张致祥副部长在办公厅全体工作人员会议上举出一些糟蹋粮食的典型事例，号召大家反对这种行为，对同志们的教育很大。后来文化部食堂仍发现剩半个馒头或半碗饭的现象，大家就进行批评，并把这些剩饭剩馒头拿去展览，以后这种现象便大大减少。此外，文化部所属各司、局在提出节约粮食的计划以后，张致祥副部长又具体地分析了这些计划，在三月十二日各司、局办公室主任会上，他批判了订计划时不具体和不实际的应付态度，要求各司、局负责同志到各单位去检查，使计划订得切实可行。到三月十九日，学校司、电影局、出版事业管理局等单位都已订出比较实际的计划。
    用甜菜渣代替饲料
    甜菜（糖萝卜）是制糖的原料，它经过糖厂取出了所含糖分以后就变成为甜菜渣子。这种渣子含有丰富的蛋白质和脂肪质、钙质、燐质以及部分糖分的营养物，是一种优良的饲料。
    黑龙江省是我国主要的甜菜制糖工业区，全省每年排出的甜菜渣子总共有六十八万吨，如全部被利用代替粮食饲料，将可节约粮食二万吨。过去因为没有注意利用，因此大量优良的饲料就随着松花江的流水白白流去了。去年冬天，苏联专家去哈尔滨糖厂参观，看到这种浪费的情况时说，在苏联，这种现象被认为是犯罪的行为。
    苏联专家的意见引起了哈尔滨市领导人员的重视，马上责成有关部门研究试验。试验结果证明，甜菜渣是猪、牛、马、鸡等牲畜的优良饲料。哈尔滨地方国营畜牧场利用甜菜渣喂养奶牛，每头奶牛每天饲喂二十七斤甜菜渣，即可节省三斤粮食饲料和部分多汁饲料，对奶的产量和质量并无影响。如全市奶牛都利用甜菜渣做饲料，每天至少可节约一万五千斤粮食饲料。哈尔滨地方国营养猪场在三个月中喂甜菜渣三万余斤，节约稻糠、豆饼四千多斤。
    现在黑龙江省有关部门正在大力组织利用甜菜渣作饲料。哈尔滨糖厂、和平糖厂、阿城糖厂、红光糖厂附近的农民纷纷将甜菜渣拉回去喂养猪牛。哈尔滨市郊区马家村已有六个农业生产合作社开始利用甜菜渣来喂猪了。利用甜菜渣特别解决了城市饲料不足的困难。如哈尔滨市有奶牛五千头、猪七万头、鸡八万只，需要大量饲料，现在可以得到大量的甜菜渣的供应了。
    为解决甜菜渣水分多，体积大，运输困难等问题，今年哈尔滨糖厂要恢复旧有的干燥设备，和平糖厂要建立机械压榨设备，以便使甜菜渣得到充分利用。省农业厅也计划今年在四个糖厂附近建立四个规模较大的养猪场，每个猪场将饲养四千多头猪，就近利用甜菜渣作饲料，以节约粮食并增加毛猪的生产。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
    多产面粉二十四万多斤
    上海市八个面粉加工厂今年头几个月已为国家多生产了二十四万多斤面粉。这些面粉仍然保持了原有的标准规格。
    上海市粮食局从今年一月份起根据小麦的质量、品种和各厂的技术设备条件，制订出统一的平均先进定额标准。并召集各厂厂长、技师、检验员、工人等开了技术交流会，介绍了先进经验。国营上海面粉厂改进设备情况后，已突破了定额标准。公私合营华丰面粉厂二月份也超过了定额标准。（新华社）
    订出具体办法节约粮食
    江西省景德镇市各机关、团体、学校、企业积极采取具体办法，节约粮食。根据七十八个单位的计划统计，三月份将比二月份节约三万八千多斤大米。
    三月初，中共景德镇市委书记，景德镇市市长分别向全市党员和政府部门的干部作了爱惜粮食、反对浪费粮食的报告。各单位的负责干部都亲自领导进行了粮食浪费的检查，订出了节约粮食的具体办法。景德镇师范学校经全体师生检查批评浪费粮食的现象以后，估计每天可以节约大米二百多斤。市人民委员会的一百六十八个干部都提出保证，要爱惜和节约粮食。
    检查粮食保管工作
    为了减少粮食损耗，保证存粮安全渡过夏天，中共包头市委员会等组织检查组，从二月十八日到三月十日，到粮食部门各仓库检查了粮食保管工作。检查中发现，部分粮囤不合规格，有倒塌的危险，有的已经倒塌；有些仓库粮食所含水分或杂质较多，容易霉坏；不少仓库存在着制度不健全等缺点。经过检查以后，粮食局采取了许多措施，加强粮食保管工作。对不安全的粮囤，都按照它的危险程度进行改囤、倒囤或整修，并发动工人确定了囤垛的规格。对于水分高的粮食，及时进行检查处理同时还修订了粮食保管、清洁卫生等制度，订立了“防治化验室操作规程”、“囤垛验收”等新制度。（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
    捞饭改蒸饭锅里不丢米
    天津市第一工人疗养院的伙食员们积极开动脑筋，避免粮食的浪费。过去炊事员们做米饭时是捞饭，煮米锅里总有捞不干净的米粒，日子多了，浪费的粮食数量也很多，所以他们就改用搪瓷盆蒸饭。蒸好的饭，也不用再向大木桶里装，直接用原盆向饭厅里端，避免了浪费粮食的现象。
    许多疗养员也注意节约粮食，并且互相监督。一次有一个刚入院的疗养员盛了一碗稻米饭，吃了几口就剩下了，旁边的疗养员、天津第四棉纺织厂工人马锡田当场就说：同志！你这样浪费粮食，要是让农民弟兄看见，怎么好意思呢？这件事被全饭厅里的人都知道了，大家的眼睛都看着这个浪费粮食的疗养员。自此以后，那个疗养员就不再浪费饭了。
    推行“生米蒸饭法”
    南京新华日报在二月七日介绍了常州师范的
  “生米蒸饭法”以后，南京市第八中学便结合学校情况进行研究试验，现已基本成功，每天能节约大米一百多斤。
    第八中学实行“生米蒸饭法”是在原有的设备上进行的，只添了一种“铁蒸子”。这种“铁蒸子”是用薄的铁皮做的，圆形，上面很多细孔，放在锅里。每次蒸饭时，锅里加好了水，把米倒入锅里约蒸三十分钟左右，到锅上冒圆气时，把米放入木桶，掺开水焖二十分钟左右，等米把水吸干，再倒入锅里约蒸一小时，就成为没有锅巴软硬适宜的饭。
    原来煮饭每斤米出饭二斤半左右，现在蒸饭每斤米出饭二斤十三两多。根据最近十几天的试验，在同样的菜、同样的天气、同样用膳时间等条件下，蒸饭比煮饭每天能节约一百多斤米。这样，一年就可替国家节约三万多斤粮食。
    这种饭，师生、员工都喜欢吃，尤其受到老年老师的欢迎。校医周促秋说：蒸饭又松又软，对肠、胃有好处，并能促使肠、胃吸收营养，蒸饭的营养价值也比煮的饭好。
    卷烟工厂节约浆糊
    最近，国营上海卷烟五厂包装车间用的浆糊比过去节省了三分之一，每次包装六百多条香烟，可以节省用半斤粮食做成的浆糊。按照这个厂目前的产量，一年节约的面粉和杂粮，可以供近两百人吃一个月。这个厂节省浆糊的经验，已经引起许多过去认为节约浆糊价值不大的卷烟厂的重视。
    节约浆糊的方法是这个厂的张春凤包装小组首先研究实行的。他们在贴每条香烟的包装纸时，浆糊涂得平薄均匀，香烟上的税票也由过去的全部涂浆改为两端涂浆。工人们还采用各种方法防止浆糊的风干损失。三月上旬，张春凤小组用一斤浆糊包装的香烟从六百多条增加到八百四十多条。厂里的人们说，浆用得少，水分容易干，在黄梅季节还可以防止香烟发霉。（新华社）
