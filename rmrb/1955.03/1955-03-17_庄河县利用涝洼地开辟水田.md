Zhuanghe County, Liaoning Province plans to reclaim 1,500 hectares of paddy fields from waterlogged lowlands this year, an increase of 650 hectares over the actual area of paddy fields opened last year.

Zhuanghe County has many rivers, and the waterlogged lowlands along the banks account for about 13 percent of the county's total cultivated land area. These lands generally yield only three or four *dou* of grain (approximately 45 *jin* per *dou*) in normal years, and often no grain at all when there is heavy rain in summer and autumn.

In the spring of 1954, Zhuanghe County summarized the experiences of Liu Hechang of Linhang Village and Wang Youjiang of Diyinhe Village in the Third District regarding "dry sowing and water irrigation of rice." Their experience was: in the dry spring, the rice seeds are sown dry, then water is introduced for irrigation. In the summer, with abundant rainfall, the rice seedlings grow vigorously and the yield is high. Last spring, this experience was widely publicized and promoted throughout the county, and a total of 850 hectares of paddy fields were opened. After the autumn harvest, these paddy fields generally achieved bumper harvests, with unit area yields generally increasing by 1.5 to 3 times, and some increasing by more than 5 times.

Encouraged by last year's bumper harvest, farmers in the waterlogged areas of the county are generally demanding the opening of paddy fields. Currently, farmers in 96 villages, including Guiyunhua and Fengtun, have drawn up plans to open paddy fields and are requesting technical assistance from the government. The Zhuanghe County People's Government has transferred water conservancy cadres from eight districts to cooperate with the County Water Conservancy Survey Team to go deep into six districts, including Qingduizi, to assist in surveying, construction, and material preparation. Rice cultivation technology training classes are also being set up in Qingduizi and Tongling to help farmers learn rice cultivation techniques.

    庄河县利用涝洼地开辟水田
    辽宁省庄河县今年计划利用涝洼地开水田一千五百垧，比去年实开水田面积增加六百五十垧。
    庄河县境内河流很多，沿河两岸的涝洼地约占全县总耕地面积的百分之十三左右。这些地，一般年景只打三、四斗粮（每斗约四十五斤），遇到夏秋雨多常常收不到粮食。
    一九五四年春天，庄河县总结了三区林航村刘和昌、地窨河村王有江的“水稻旱播水灌”的经验。他们的经验是：春天干旱，把稻种干播下，然后引水灌溉，夏季雨水充沛，稻苗生长兴旺，产量很高。去年春天，在全县普遍宣传了这个经验，并重点推广，全县共开八百五十垧水田。秋后，这些水田普遍获得了丰收，单位面积产量一般都提高一倍半到三倍，有的增产五倍以上。
    在去年丰收的鼓舞下，全县涝洼地区的农民普遍要求开水田，目前已有桂云花、冯屯等九十六个村的农民订出了开水田的计划，并要求政府给予技术扶助。庄河县人民政府已抽调八个区的水利干部，配合县水利勘测队深入青堆子等六个区，帮助进行勘测、施工和备料工作。并在青堆子和佟岭两地开办水稻技术训练班，帮助农民学习种水田技术。
