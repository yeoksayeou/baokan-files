American Colonialism

In international affairs, American imperialists often disguise themselves as "friends" of the people in backward regions. For example, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once proclaimed: "It is in the nature of the United States to help colonial peoples win national independence." Recently, spokespersons for American foreign policy and their propaganda machines have tirelessly repeated this argument, trying to make people believe that the United States has always been "anti-colonialist."

What does this American propaganda actually demonstrate? It can only have one explanation: due to the rise of national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the strong opposition of people around the world to colonialism, American imperialism has encountered increasing difficulties in pursuing its policies of aggression and expansion. This makes it necessary to adorn itself with all kinds of masks.

However, these American lies and disguises cannot cover up history and facts after all.

People know that in American history, there are many facts of interference and plunder against foreign countries. In order to invade and conquer the people of various countries in the Americas, the United States has waged more than a hundred wars. The Monroe Doctrine, declared in 1823, was a signboard used by American colonists, in the name of "protection" of the Americas, to place the Americas under their colonial rule. At the end of the nineteenth century, when world capitalism began to enter the stage of imperialism, the United States, like other imperialist countries, embarked on the road of seizing colonies around the world. At that time, the United States provoked an imperialist war to re-divide colonies, seizing the Philippine colony from Spain.

On January 4, 1900, Senator Albert Beveridge, a famous spokesman for American imperialism at the time, brazenly declared in Congress: "The Pacific is our ocean. The power that rules the Pacific will rule the world." He also said: "We want to establish strongholds for developing trade all over the world, and around these strongholds there should be large colonies, and our flag should fly in these colonies. Behind our flag follows our way of life. American law, American order, American civilization, and the American flag will be fixed on those lands."

For half a century, American imperialist colonists have been pursuing this arrogant dream. Between the two world wars, the United States took advantage of the exhaustion of other imperialist powers to expand its overseas influence on a large scale. Especially after the Second World War, the American monopoly capital groups, which had grown fat due to the war and profiteering, could no longer be satisfied with merely re-dividing or plundering individual colonies. They tried to establish their rule everywhere, encompassing the entire world into an unprecedentedly vast American empire.

Dulles himself could not help but write: "Great Britain was the leader of the world in the nineteenth century, but the two world wars have created a completely new situation. The United States has largely assumed the leadership responsibilities that were previously shared by several countries." (U.S. "Foreign Affairs Quarterly," April 1954 issue) James Burnham, a Wall Street mercenary writer who openly advocated the establishment of an American colonial empire, wrote in his book "The Struggle for the World": "The American Empire... although it does not have a true global formal boundary, it can exercise effective global control." Former New York Governor and Republican Party leader Dewey gave a new interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, revealing even more blatantly the ambition of the United States to establish world hegemony after the war. He said: "The scope of the Monroe Doctrine will include the entire world!"

In accordance with this policy, the power of American monopoly capital not only invaded and disintegrated Britain's colonies and spheres of influence in Asia and Africa, but also fiercely squeezed Britain's economic positions in the entire capitalist world market, and gradually replaced them. The important raw material producing areas and sales markets of other capitalist countries are also invariably touched or occupied by American monopoly capital.

Countless facts in the past and present prove that American imperialism barbarously infringes on the national independence and sovereignty of various countries, and viciously suppresses the national liberation movements of colonial peoples. It has become the darkest fortress of the increasingly disintegrating colonial system. Wherever there is a national liberation struggle, there is American intervention and even armed aggression. We only need to mention the American suppression of the Greek people, the war of aggression launched against the Korean people, the intervention in Indochina, and the acts of aggression committed and being carried out in Iran, Egypt, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and other places, to explain everything. U.S. Senator Mellon also admitted: "We are supporting colonial slavery everywhere in the Far East, Africa, and the Mediterranean region... We are rapidly turning people into our enemies."

The American ruling clique often clamors that the United States has granted the Philippines "independence," trying to show that American imperialism has nothing to do with colonialism. However, this propaganda at least admits that the United States maintained colonial rule in the Philippines for a very long period in the past. And in fact, although the Philippines has now gained "independence" granted by the United States, it has been burdened with new shackles. U.S. Senator Tydings put it bluntly: "If the Philippines is forever economically dependent on us... then we will have the whip, and they will follow us, and will not be independent, absolutely, without a single mistake."

Therefore, in any sense, American colonialism is no different from other colonialisms. If there is any difference, it is that American imperialists appeared on the international colonial stage later, and facing the vigorous national liberation movements around the world, the United States adopted more insidious and vicious methods in order to facilitate the expansion of its own colonialist forces. British Labor Party MP Ian Mikardo commented on the American-manufactured military conspiracy against the democratic government of Guatemala, saying: "The war waged by the United States to establish the United Fruit Company in Guatemala is exactly the same in nature as the war that Britain once waged to establish the East India Company in India. …The difference is that the United States disguises itself more cunningly, more shamelessly, and more hypocritically."

One of the insidious and vicious methods of aggression used by American colonists is to attempt to control a country's economic lifeline and its sovereignty under the guise of "economic aid," gradually turning it into a U.S. colony. The "Truman Doctrine," the "Marshall Plan," the "Point Four Program" implemented by the United States after the war, and the "Asian Economic Aid" plan that is being planned are tools for implementing this colonialism.

In recent years, American monopoly capital groups, taking advantage of their superior economic strength, have poured their commodities and capital into various colonial and semi-colonial countries, plundered their resources, manipulated their trade, and carried out extremely brutal colonial exploitation of these countries. In the first five years after the war alone, American companies made profits of 7.5 billion U.S. dollars from foreign investments (mainly in backward countries). From 1945 to 1952, American capitalists invested 2.03 billion U.S. dollars in Latin America, and during the same period, they obtained profits of 5.28 billion U.S. dollars. American companies earned about seven times the cost in profits from oil production in the Middle East. The Brazilian progressive newspaper "Workers' Voice" stated in an article titled "How the United States Plunders Brazil" that "every dollar invested by the United States in Brazil can earn nearly nine dollars in profit."

Today, the vast people of colonial and semi-colonial countries understand that every dollar that penetrates their country is a bloodless knife used by the United States to extract the blood and sweat of the people, and is a shameful symbol of the United States' barbarous infringement of other countries' national interests and sovereignty.

American colonial policy is also closely linked to its war policy. In order to expand colonial rule, imperialism cannot do without war. Based on American official figures alone, the United States has 950 army, navy, and air force bases in foreign countries, and has troops stationed in 49 countries. U.S. "Newsweek" wrote shamelessly: "Even during the most powerful period of the British Empire, it was not able to deploy such a powerful armed force in so many regions at the same time." The United States relies on these military bases and troops, under the slogans of "military aid" and "common defense," to put other countries under its control.

An important tool for the United States to pursue its colonial and war policies is to put together various military blocs with the United States as the leader. The "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," which the United States recently cobbled together with eight countries in Manila, is a blatant colonialist aggressive alliance. According to this treaty, the United States can arbitrarily create excuses to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and suppress national independence movements. According to this treaty, the United States can arbitrarily create tensions and provoke wars in Asia in order to realize its conspiracy to "use Asians to fight Asians." At the same time, this treaty also facilitates the United States to squeeze out other colonial countries in order to expand American colonial power over Asian countries.

While actively expanding its colonial rule in Asia, the United States regards aggression against China as its main policy. The Chinese people have established an independent country and are pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence and opposition to aggression, which cannot but become a major obstacle to American imperialism's pursuit of colonial policies in Asia. Therefore, American colonists painstakingly antagonize the Chinese people and do their best to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that has been spurned by the Chinese people. It openly occupies China's territory of Taiwan, armed interference in China's internal affairs, and vainly attempts to use Taiwan as the main base to overthrow our country's people's democratic regime and restore American colonial rule over China. This act of aggression by the United States is destined to fail. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is to defend the motherland and defend peace. This cause must be carried through to the end.

Because this colonial policy of the United States is a product of the further sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism, it cannot but increasingly expose its fundamental weaknesses. Because this policy is in sharp conflict with the national interests of various countries, it cannot but suffer more and more failures.

The clear fact today is that in Asia, the people of vast regions have broken free from colonial shackles and gained their own independence; in Africa, national awakening is also rapidly increasing. The convening of the Asian-African Conference reflects the general desire of the people of Asia and Africa to demand freedom and independence and to oppose imperialist colonial rule and interference. At the same time, the movement for national independence is also developing in Latin America. No matter what disguise American colonialists create, no matter what vicious methods they use, they will absolutely not be able to stop the victory of the people's national independence movement.

    美国的殖民主义
    崔奇
    在国际事务中，美帝国主义者常常把自己打扮成落后地区人民的“朋友”模样。例如，美国国务卿杜勒斯就曾经宣扬过：“美国的天性就是要帮助殖民地人民赢得民族独立。”近来，美国外交政策的发言人及其宣传机器又不厌其烦地重弹这种论调，想要使人相信美国一向是“反殖民主义”的。
    美国这些宣传究竟说明什么呢？它只能有一个解释：由于殖民地半殖民地人民民族解放运动的高涨，殖民主义遭到世界各国人民的强烈反对，美帝国主义推行侵略和扩张政策遇到了越来越大的困难，这就使得它有必要用各种各样的假面具来装饰自己。
    但是，美国的这些谎言和伪装，毕竟是掩盖不了历史和事实的。
    人们知道，在美国的历史上，充满着对外国进行干涉和掠夺的史实。为了侵犯和征服美洲大陆各国人民，美国曾经进行一百次以上的战争。一八二三年宣布的门罗主义，就是美国殖民者以“保护”美洲为名要把美洲放在自己的殖民统治下的一块招牌。在世界资本主义开始进入帝国主义阶段的十九世纪末叶，美国更和其他帝国主义国家一样地走上了向全世界争夺殖民地的道路。那时候，美国就曾挑起再分割殖民地的帝国主义战争，从西班牙手中夺取了菲律宾殖民地。
    一九○○年一月四日，当时美帝国主义的著名代言人、参议员阿贝特·贝维利治，曾在国会上狂妄地宣称：“太平洋是我们的海洋。统治太平洋的强国，将要统治世界。”他并且还说过：“我们要建立在全世界发展贸易的据点，在这些据点的周围要有大块的殖民地，在这些殖民地将要飘扬起我们的国旗。在我们的国旗之后紧随着我们的生活方式。美国法律、美国秩序、美国文明和美国旗帜将要固定在那些土地之上。”
    半世纪以来，美帝国主义殖民者一直都在追求着这种狂妄的梦想。在两次世界大战中间，美国趁其他帝国主义打得精疲力竭的机会，大规模地扩展了它的海外势力。特别是在第二次世界大战以后，由于战争和趁火打劫而长肥了的美国垄断资本集团，已经不能满足于仅仅重新瓜分或掠夺个别的殖民地了。他们力图在所有的地方建立他们的统治，把全世界囊括成为一个空前庞大的美利坚帝国。
    杜勒斯本人就情不自禁地这样写道：“英国在十九世纪是世界的领导者，但两次世界大战造成了一种完全新的局势。美国在很大程度上已经担负了过去由几个国家分担的领导责任。”（美国“外交季刊”一九五四年四月号）公开宣扬建立美利坚殖民帝国的华尔街雇佣文丐詹姆斯·伯纳姆在其“为世界而斗争”一书中写道：“美利坚帝国……虽然没有真正的全世界范围的正式疆界，但是它可以实行有效的世界性的控制。”前纽约州长、共和党的要人杜威把门罗主义作了一个新的解释，更露骨地表现了美国在战后企图建立世界霸权的野心。他说：“门罗主义的范围将包括整个世界！”
    本着这一方针，美国垄断资本的势力不仅侵入和瓦解着英国在亚洲和非洲的殖民地和势力范围，而且在整个资本主义世界市场上，猛烈地排挤着英国的经济阵地，并一步一步地取而代之。其他资本主义国家的重要原料产地和销售市场，也无处不为美国垄断资本所染指或侵占。
    过去和现在的无数事实都证明，美帝国主义横暴地侵犯各国民族独立和主权，凶恶地镇压殖民地人民民族解放运动。它已经成为日益瓦解的殖民制度的最黑暗的堡垒。那里有民族解放斗争，那里就有美国的干涉以至武装侵略。我们只要提到美国对希腊人民的镇压、对朝鲜人民发动的侵略战争，对印度支那的干涉，以及在伊朗、埃及、危地马拉、哥斯达黎加等地所干过的和正在进行的侵略罪行，就足以说明一切。美国参议员梅隆也承认：“我们在远东、非洲和地中海区域，到处支持着殖民地奴隶制度……我们迅速使人们变为我们的敌人。”
    美国统治集团经常喧嚷说，美国已经让菲律宾
  “独立”了，想借以表明美帝国主义和殖民主义无缘。但是，这一宣传至少承认了美国在过去很长一个时期里是在菲律宾维持了殖民统治的，而且事实上，菲律宾现在虽然获得了美国所给予的“独立”，却背上了新的枷锁。美国参议员泰丁斯说得一针见血：“如果菲律宾在经济上永远附属于我们……那末我们便抓住了鞭子，他们便要跟着我们走，而不会独立，千真万确，百无一误。”
    因此，从任何意义上说，美国的殖民主义和其他的殖民主义并无二致。如果有任何不同，那就是美帝国主义者在国际殖民舞台上出现得较晚，而面对的是世界各地蓬勃的民族解放运动，为了便利于扩展自己的殖民主义势力，美国采取了更阴险、更恶毒的方式。英国工党议员伊安·米卡多在评论美国制造的反危地马拉民主政府的军事阴谋时说：“美国为了在危地马拉设立联合果品公司而进行的战争，和英国为了在印度设立东印度公司而曾一度进行过的战争，完全是同一性质的。……不同的是美国伪装得更狡猾，更无耻和更伪善。”
    美国殖民者使用的阴险和毒辣的侵略方式之一，就是企图用“经济援助”的幌子控制一个国家的经济命脉及其主权，一步一步地把它沦为美国的殖民地。美国战后所实行的“杜鲁门主义”、“马歇尔计划”、“第四点计划”以及正在策划中的
  “亚洲经济援助”计划，就是实施这种殖民主义的工具。
    近年来，美国垄断资本集团挟其优势的经济力量，把自己的商品和资本打入各个殖民地半殖民地国家，掠夺其资源，操纵其贸易，对这些国家进行着极端残酷的殖民剥削。仅战后的头五年中，美国公司就从国外投资（主要在落后国家）中，获利七十五亿美元。从一九四五年到一九五二年，美国资本家对拉丁美洲的投资为二十亿三千万美元，在同时期中，他们所获得的利润达五十二亿八千万美元。美国公司在中东的石油生产中所获利润为成本的七倍左右。巴西进步报纸“工人呼声报”在一篇题为“美国怎样掠夺巴西”的文章中称，“美国在巴西的每一美元的投资，便可以获得将近九美元的利润”。
    今天，殖民地半殖民地的广大人民懂得，渗入他们国家的每一块美元都是美国榨取人民血汗的杀人不见血的刀子，是美国横暴地侵犯他国民族利益和主权的可耻标记。
    美国的殖民政策又是和它的战争政策密切地连在一起的。为了扩大殖民统治，帝国主义是离不了战争的。仅仅根据美国官方数字，美国在外国有九百五十个陆、海、空军基地，并在四十九个国家中驻有军队。美国“新闻周刊”曾无耻地写道：
  “即使在大英帝国最强盛的时期，它也没有能在同一时候把这样强大的武装部队分布在这样多的地区上。”美国就是依靠这些军事基地和驻军，在“军事援助”和“共同防御”的口号下，把别的国家放到自己的控制之下。
    美国推行殖民政策和战争政策的重要工具，是拼凑以美国为盟主的各种各样的军事集团。不久以前美国纠集八个国家在马尼拉所缔结的“东南亚集体防务条约”，就是一个露骨的殖民主义者的侵略同盟。根据这个条约，美国可以任意制造借口干涉东南亚各国的内政，镇压民族独立运动。根据这个条约，美国可以任意制造紧张局势和挑拨亚洲的战争，以实现其“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的阴谋。同时，这个条约也就便利了美国排挤其他殖民国家，以扩大美国对亚洲国家的殖民势力。
  美国在积极扩展它在亚洲的殖民统治时，把侵略中国作为它的主要方针。中国人民建立起独立的国家，并推行着和平共处、反对侵略的政策，这不能不成为美帝国主义在亚洲推行殖民政策的重大障碍。因此，美国殖民者处心积虑地同中国人民为敌，竭力扶持为中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团。它公然霸占中国领土台湾，武装干涉中国内政，并妄想以台湾为主要基地来推翻我国的人民民主政权，恢复美国对中国的殖民统治。美国的这种侵略行为是注定了要失败的。中国人民解放台湾是为了保卫祖国、保卫和平。这个事业是必须进行到底的。
    由于美国的这种殖民主义政策，是进一步尖锐化了的资本主义总危机的产物，因此它不能不日益明显地暴露出它的根本弱点。由于这种政策和各国人民的民族利益发生尖锐的冲突，因此它不能不遭到越来越多的失败。
    今天鲜明的事实是，在亚洲，有广大地区的人民已经挣脱了殖民枷锁，获得了自己的独立；在非洲，民族觉醒也在迅速提高。亚非会议的召开，就反映了亚洲和非洲人民要求自由和独立，反对帝国主义殖民统治和干涉的普遍愿望。同时，争取民族独立的运动，也在拉丁美洲发展中。美国殖民主义者不论制造什么伪装，不论使用什么毒辣的手段，都绝对不可能阻止人民民族独立运动的胜利。
