The Shanghai People's Court, on March 13th, according to the law, sentenced Yu Zhengqin, Fang Zhen and thirteen other hooligans and bandits to death, imprisonment, or exemption from criminal punishment.

The defendants Yu Zhengqin and Fang Zhen were originally counter-revolutionary secret agents who had committed serious crimes endangering the state and the people in the past. After liberation, they continued to engage in sabotage activities, either repeatedly raping young girls, or luring and poisoning young people to engage in hooligan crimes, harming the interests of the people, disrupting social order, and undermining revolutionary order. The defendants Su Haimin, Wang Kaisheng, Zhou Ruifu, Shen Xiaoti, Wang Guide, and Zhan Qingguo were all hooligans, habitual thieves, swindlers, and military rabble, and were all habitual offenders who had long been incorrigible and resisted reform. They consistently lured and poisoned young people, insulted and raped women, some even repeatedly raping young girls, abusing children, ganging up to fight, stealing and swindling, or plotting to commit robbery, disrupting social order, and undermining revolutionary order. The defendant Rong Fengshan repeatedly participated in hooligan criminal activities and incited children to commit crimes, and resisted supervision after being arrested. The defendant Ding Daosheng secretly organized "blackout dances," luring young people to be absent from work and school, leading them to depravity and corruption, and insulting and raping women. The defendant Mo Zhihui actively participated in hooligan activities, luring and raping women. Although the defendant Ma Xiaoyan was seduced and fell into depravity, she herself had become a criminal. The defendant Zang Shikui insulted women and disturbed social order.

This group of criminals who disrupted social order and undermined revolutionary order, after being prosecuted by the Shanghai People's Procuratorate on February 25th, underwent preliminary trials and two public trials by the Shanghai People's Court in accordance with the law. During the trial, lawyers and defenders defended the defendants.

At the conclusion of the trial on March 13th, the Shanghai People's Court, according to the circumstances of the defendants' crimes, ruled as follows: the defendants Yu Zhengqin, Fang Zhen, Su Haimin, Wang Kaisheng, Zhou Ruifu, Shen Xiaoti, Wang Guide, and Zhan Qingguo were all sentenced to death; the defendant Rong Fengshan was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment; the defendant Ding Daosheng was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment; the defendants Mo Zhihui and Ma Xiaoyan were also given criminal punishments respectively; the defendant Zang Shikui was exempted from criminal punishment.
