Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama's remarks at a foreign press conference on the 14th, stating that he did not object to the United States storing atomic weapons in Japan, have provoked vehement criticism from Japanese public opinion.

The Japanese Leftist Socialist Party issued a statement on the 15th demanding that Ichiro Hatoyama retract his statement, and also demanding that Ichiro Hatoyama retract his statement regarding allowing the United States to use military bases in Japan to conduct aggressive wars against China. The statement said: Ichiro Hatoyama's argument clearly shows that he wants to actively cooperate with the United States' warmongering policies, placing Japan in an extremely dangerous situation. This kind of statement will hinder the implementation of a peaceful diplomatic policy and severely affect Japan's international relations. The statement pointed out: Ichiro Hatoyama's remarks violated the guarantees he made during the general election regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Rightist Socialist Party also criticized Hatoyama's remarks and will raise questions when the Diet convenes.

"Asahi Shimbun," one of Japan's largest circulation newspapers, published an editorial stating that Hatoyama "should reconsider his statement - it is too inconsistent with the will of the people." "Asahi Shimbun" said: "What right does Mr. Hatoyama have to make such an absurd statement? His statement gives the impression that Japan is preparing to provide military bases for storing atomic bombs. Japan is determined to oppose atomic warfare."

"Yomiuri Shimbun" said: Before making such a statement, Ichiro Hatoyama should carefully consider the serious consequences in the future. Having experienced the terrible experiences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, as well as the Bikini Atoll hydrogen bomb test in 1954, Japan should be very clear about the dangers of atomic warfare.

    日本舆论猛烈抨击鸠山的谈话
    反对使日本成为美国原子弹基地
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎十四日在外国记者招待会上表示他不反对美国在日本储存原子武器的谈话，引起了日本舆论猛烈的抨击。
    日本左派社会党十五日发表声明要求鸠山一郎撤消他的这个谈话，且要求鸠山一郎撤消他关于准许美国利用在日本的军事基地对中国进行侵略战争的发言。声明说：鸠山一郎的论调清楚地表明他要积极地和美国的好战政策合作而使日本陷入极端危险的境地。这种言论将阻碍和平外交政策的实施，使日本的国际关系受到严重影响。声明指出：鸠山一郎的谈话违背了他在大选时所作的关于禁止原子武器的保证，右派社会党也抨击鸠山的谈话，并且将在国会开会时提出质问。
    日本发行量最大报纸之一“朝日新闻”发表社论说，鸠山“应该重新考虑他的声明——它是太不符合民心了”。“朝日新闻”说：“鸠山先生有什么权利来发表这种荒唐的声明呢？他的这种声明给人以这种印象：日本准备提供储存原子弹的军事基地。日本是誓死反对原子战争的。”
    “读卖新闻”说：鸠山一郎在发表这种谈话以前，应该再三考虑将来的严重后果。日本在经受了第二次世界大战时广岛和长崎以及一九五四年比基尼岛氢弹试验的可怕经验后，应该很清楚地知道原子战争的危险。
