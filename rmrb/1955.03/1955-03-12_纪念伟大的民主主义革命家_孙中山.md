　　Today is the 30th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great democratic revolutionary activist in modern China, and his lifelong career was of utmost importance to the Chinese people's struggle to remove the oppression of imperialism and feudalism and strive for independence and freedom.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Mr. Sun Yat-sen is great not only because he led the great Revolution of 1911 (although it was a democratic revolution of the old period), but also because he was able to 'adapt to the trend of the world and meet the needs of the people,' putting forward the three major revolutionary policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers, gave a new interpretation to the Three People's Principles, and established the New Three People's Principles with the three major policies." From Comrade Mao Zedong's commentary, we can understand that Mr. Sun Yat-sen experienced two periods in his life. His greatness lies in the fact that in the first period, he first revealed the ideal of a bourgeois democratic republic and carried out a resolute struggle for the realization of this ideal; and in the second period, he abandoned the proposition of a bourgeois democratic republic, accepted the program of a people's democratic republic, and carried out a resolute struggle for its realization.

　　Mr. Sun Yat-sen first revealed the ideal of a bourgeois democratic republic at the beginning of his revolutionary activities. This ideal brought about a tremendous change in the Chinese intellectual world at that time. Before this, people either thought that the purpose of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty was to revive the Han empire, or that constitutionalism under the rule of the Qing Dynasty was the only way to save China. After this, people began to realize more and more clearly that it was impossible to revive the Han empire or implement constitutionalism under the rule of the Qing Dynasty. It was precisely because of this change that the spontaneous resistance movements of the masses after the Opium War converged into a huge torrent of democratic revolution. It was also because of this change that the achievements of the Revolution of 1911 were not only the end of the Qing Dynasty, but also the final collapse of the feudal monarchy in China, which had lasted for more than two thousand years. Admittedly, the Revolution of 1911 did not establish an independent and consolidated democratic republic, but the destruction of the feudal monarchy after all opened up the road to liberation. This is why Lenin was still very optimistic about China's future during the extremely chaotic period after the Revolution of 1911 and said: "No matter what the fate of the great Republic of China, which is now being sharpened by various 'civilized' jackals, there is absolutely no force in the world that can restore the old serf system in Asia, nor can it eradicate the heroic democratic spirit of the masses in Asian countries." The rise of the democratic spirit was a direct result of the Revolution of 1911. As a result of experiencing this upsurge, people were ideologically liberated. After the Revolution of 1911, all the remnants of the feudal monarchy, whether it was Yuan Shikai supported by British imperialism or Zhang Xun supported by German imperialism, their foolish attempts to restore the monarchy could not but be thoroughly defeated. Although the obstruction of imperialism and feudalism to China's progress was serious, after the Revolution of 1911, the overcoming of this obstruction was inevitable.

　　Mr. Sun Yat-sen abandoned the proposition of a bourgeois democratic republic in the last few years of his life and accepted the program of a people's democratic republic. Just as he first revealed the ideal of a bourgeois democratic republic, it was a great step for him to abandon this ideal, which had been proven impossible to realize, and accept the program of a people's democratic republic. This was a practical conclusion drawn by Mr. Sun Yat-sen after summarizing his nearly forty years of experience. The bourgeoisie did not get a republic after the Revolution of 1911. The so-called Republic of China was a world of large and small warlords supported by imperialism. At that time, the general bourgeois activists had neither the power to establish a bourgeois democratic republic, nor did they oppose the people's democratic republic advocated by the Communists, and thus fell into a completely incapable situation. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's greatness lies in the fact that he was able to resolutely adopt the policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers at this time, and in 1924, on the advice of the Communists, reorganized the Kuomintang into an organization of a united front of workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie. He re-interpreted the Three People's Principles that he founded: nationalism with opposition to imperialism as the main content, democracy with the people's democracy as the main content, and the people's livelihood with land to the tiller and the regulation of capital as the main content. This new interpretation of the Three People's Principles shows that after adopting the policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers, Mr. Sun Yat-sen has abandoned the program of establishing a bourgeois republic and accepted the program of a people's democratic republic put forward by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's new policies have brought unprecedented development to the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "The Three People's Principles before the Kuomintang's reorganization in 1924 were the Three People's Principles of the old category, which were outdated. If it is not developed to the New Three People's Principles, the Kuomintang cannot move forward. The intelligent Sun Yat-sen saw this, received the help of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, re-interpreted the Three People's Principles, and obtained new historical characteristics, established the united front of the Three People's Principles and Communism, established the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, won the sympathy of the people of the whole country, and held the revolution from 1924 to 1927."

　　Sun Yat-sen was a sincere patriot. Since his revolutionary activities were at odds with the interests of imperialism from the very beginning, imperialism tried its best to undermine them. He could not but suffer a series of failures as a result. When he finally confirmed this fact, he immediately declared that imperialism was the enemy of the Chinese revolution. In order to oppose this enemy, regardless of the stubborn opposition of all right-wing elements within the Kuomintang, he resolutely adopted a policy consistent with the domestic and international workers' movement, declared that he was a friend of socialism, and warned that "The revolution in the future will not be accomplished without taking Russia as a teacher." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit shows that he decided his policies according to the needs of China's national independence and freedom, not according to the interests of a few people. In contrast to Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries based their policy decisions not on the needs of national independence and freedom but on the interests of a small group. They began to betray his propositions shortly after Sun Yat-sen's death, and thoroughly betrayed the revolution in the victorious progress of the 1927 revolution. In order to oppose the Soviet Union and communism, they shamelessly abandoned large tracts of their homeland during the Ten-Year Civil War and the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they have always been the faithful running dogs of American imperialism. In the great Chinese People's Liberation War, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek was spurned by the people of the whole country. Although the Chiang bandits are still entrenched in Taiwan under the protection of the American aggressors, with the victorious progress of the struggle of the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan, his final demise is also approaching day by day.

　　Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a great friend of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union. Thirty years ago, in his letter to the Soviet Union on his deathbed, he stated his confidence in the future of his motherland: "Dear comrades! At this time of farewell, I would like to express my ardent hope that dawn will soon break, when the Soviet Union will welcome a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally, and the two countries will join hands in the great war for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory." This ardent wish has been realized through the efforts of the Chinese Communist Party and the people of the whole country. Our great motherland is not only an independent and strong country, but is also advancing towards a socialist society; our country and the Soviet Union have formed an unbreakable alliance and become a strong fortress for world peace. The Chinese working class is the true heir to all the outstanding heritage of the motherland, and it has also inherited and greatly promoted the legacy of the great democratic revolutionary activist, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The achievements of the Chinese people have exceeded Mr. Sun Yat-sen's expectations thirty years ago. The power of the victorious Chinese people is unlimited, and under the leadership of the working class, they will unite as one and fight for strengthening socialist construction and socialist transformation, for the liberation of Taiwan, and for defending Asian and world peace until the final victory.

    纪念伟大的民主主义革命家——孙中山
    今天是孙中山先生逝世的三十周年纪念日。孙中山先生是近代中国的伟大的民主主义革命活动家，他的毕生事业对于中国人民为解除帝国主义和封建主义的压迫，争取独立和自由的斗争具有极其重要的意义。
    毛泽东同志指出：“孙中山先生之所以伟大，不但因为他领导了伟大的辛亥革命（虽然是旧时期的民主革命），而且因为他能够“适乎世界之潮流，合乎人群之需要”，提出了联俄、联共、扶助农工三大革命政策，对三民主义作了新的解释，树立了三大政策的新三民主义。”从毛泽东同志的这个评论，我们可以得到这样的理解，即：孙中山先生一生经历了两个时期，他的所以伟大，就在于他在前一个时期首先揭出了资产阶级民主共和国的理想，并且为了这个理想的实现进行了坚决的斗争；而在后一个时期他放弃资产阶级民主共和国的主张，接受了人民的民主共和国的纲领，并且为了它的实现进行了坚决的斗争。
    孙中山先生首先揭出资产阶级民主共和国的理想是在他开始革命活动的初期。这种理想使当时的中国思想界发生了一个绝大的变化。在此以前，人们或者以为推翻满清帝国的目的在于复兴汉族帝国，或者以为在满清帝国统治下实行立宪是救中国的唯一途径。而在此以后，人们开始越来越清楚地觉悟到，无论复兴汉族帝国或在满清帝国统治下实行立宪都是不可能的。正是因为有了这个变化，人民群众在鸦片战争以后的自发的反抗运动汇成了民主革命的巨流。也正是因为有了这个变化，辛亥革命所达到的就不止是满清统治的结束，而是中国的延长二千多年的封建帝制的最后崩溃。诚然，辛亥革命没有建立独立的巩固的民主共和国，但是封建帝制的摧毁毕竟打开了解放的大路。这就是为什么列宁在辛亥革命以后的极端混乱的时期中仍然对中国的前途感到非常乐观，并且说：“不管各种‘文明’豺狼现在所磨牙欲噬的伟大中华民国的命运如何，但世界上决没有一种力量能在亚洲恢复旧有的农奴制度，能铲除亚洲国家中人民群众底英勇的民主精神。”民主精神的高涨是辛亥革命的直接的结果。由于经历了这种高涨，人们在思想上获得了解放。在辛亥革命以后，封建帝制的一切余孽，不管他是有英帝国主义支持的袁世凯也好，有德帝国主义支持的张勋也好，他们的任何恢复帝制的愚蠢的企图都不能不遭受到彻底的失败。帝国主义和封建主义对于中国的进步的阻碍尽管是严重的，但是在辛亥革命以后，这种阻碍之被克服是必然的。
    孙中山先生在他的一生的最后几年放弃了资产阶级民主共和国的主张，而接受了人民的民主共和国的纲领。正如同他首先揭出资产阶级民主共和国的理想一样，他放弃这个已被证明不可能实现的理想并接受人民的民主共和国的纲领，是一个伟大的步骤。这是孙中山先生在总结了他的将近四十年的经验以后得出的合乎实际的结论。资产阶级在辛亥革命以后并没有得到共和国，所谓中华民国是帝国主义支持下的大小军阀的世界。当时一般资产阶级的活动家既没有力量建立资产阶级的民主共和国，却又反对共产党人所主张的人民的民主共和国，因而陷入完全不能有所作为的境地。孙中山先生的伟大在于他能在这时毅然决然地采取了联俄、联共和扶助农工的政策，并在一九二四年根据共产党人的建议改组国民党为工人、农民、小资产阶级和资产阶级的统一战线的组织。他重新解释了他所创导的三民主义：民族主义以反对帝国主义为主要内容，民权主义以人民的民主为主要内容，民生主义以耕者有其田和节制资本为主要内容。三民主义的这种新的解释表明孙中山先生在采取联俄、联共和扶助农工的政策以后，已经放弃了建立资产阶级共和国的纲领而接受了中国共产党提出的人民的民主共和国的纲领。孙中山先生的新政策使中国革命获得了空前的发展。毛泽东同志指出，“一九二四年国民党改组以前的三民主义，乃是旧范畴的三民主义，乃是过时了的三民主义。如不把它发展到新三民主义，国民党就不能前进。聪明的孙中山看到了这一点，得了苏联和中国共产党的助力，把三民主义重新作了解释，遂获得了新的历史特点，建立了三民主义同共产主义的统一战线，建立了第一次国共合作，取得了全国人民的同情，举行了一九二四年至一九二七年的革命。”
    孙中山是真诚的爱国者。由于他的革命活动一开始就同帝国主义的利益相违反，帝国主义便竭力加以破坏。他不能不因此遭到一连串的失败。当他最后确定这个事实时，他立即宣布帝国主义是中国革命的敌人。为了反对这个敌人，他不顾国民党内部一切右派分子的顽强的反对，坚决地采取了和国内和国际工人运动相一致的政策，宣布他是社会主义的朋友，并且警告说：“今后之革命，非以俄为师，断无成就”。孙中山先生的这种精神表明他是按照中国民族独立和自由的需要而不是按照少数人的利益来决定政策的。和孙中山先生相反，蒋介石反动派决定政策的根据不是民族独立和自由的需要而是一个小集团的利益。他们在孙中山逝世以后不久就开始背叛他的主张，并在一九二七年革命的胜利进展中彻底地背叛了革命。为了反苏反共，他们在十年内战时期和抗日战争时期毫不知耻地大片大片地抛弃祖国的领土。在抗日战争结束以后，他们始终做着美帝国主义的忠实走狗。在伟大的中国人民解放战争中，蒋介石卖国贼受到了全国人民的唾弃。蒋贼虽然还在美国侵略者保护下盘据着台湾，但随着全国人民解放台湾的斗争的胜利进展，他的最后灭亡也日见逼近了。
    孙中山先生是伟大社会主义国家苏联的伟大的友人。三十年前，他在他临终之际写信给苏联，申述他对于祖国前途的信心说：“亲爱的同志！当此与你们诀别之际，我愿表示我热烈的希望，希望不久即将破晓，斯时苏联以良友及盟国而欢迎强盛独立之中国，两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”这个热诚的愿望已经因中国共产党和全国人民的努力而实现了。我们伟大的祖国已不仅是一个独立和强盛的国家，而且正在向社会主义社会前进；我国和苏联已结成牢不可破的联盟，成为世界和平的坚强的堡垒。中国工人阶级是祖国一切优秀遗产的真正继承者，它也继承和大大地发扬了伟大的民主主义革命活动家孙中山先生的遗产。中国人民的成就已超过了孙中山先生三十年前的想望。胜利了的中国人民的力量是不可限量的，他们将在工人阶级领导之下，团结一致，为加强社会主义建设和社会主义改造、为解放台湾、保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争到最后的胜利。
