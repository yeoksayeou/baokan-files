Successful Trial Production of Gunny Sacks Using Banana Stem Fiber

The Guangzhou Municipal State-owned Guangdong Gunny Sack Factory has successfully trial-produced gunny sacks using a mixture of banana stem fiber and jute. In the past, farmers in various parts of Guangdong Province discarded large quantities of banana stems as waste after the banana harvest. In the future, the fibers from these banana stems will be used as a partial substitute for jute. The cost of weaving gunny sacks can also be greatly reduced. Once this advanced experience is promoted to jute textile factories throughout the country, it will create a substantial amount of wealth for the nation each year.

After receiving instructions from the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Industry Bureau in November of last year to trial-weave gunny sacks using banana stem fiber as a substitute, the Guangdong Gunny Sack Factory immediately organized technicians and workers to actively conduct technical research on trial spinning and weaving. During the Spring Festival holiday, engineer Pan Changyuan and the technicians continued to actively study and prepare for the trial spinning and weaving work. Through the efforts of the workers, gunny sacks were woven on the second day after the Spring Festival. After inspection, the results were good. Although the weft yarn spun from a mixture of banana stem fiber and jute has slightly lower strength and more fluff, the quality of the gunny sacks still meets the specified quality standards.

Currently, the factory is researching a natural degumming method for banana stem fiber and preparing to improve the softening method in order to reduce fiber impurities and increase the tensile strength of the yarn, so as to weave better gunny sacks.

    用香蕉茎纤维试制麻袋成功
    广州市地方国营广东麻袋厂试用香蕉茎纤维和黄麻混合织造麻袋成功。过去，广东省各地农民在香蕉收割后，都把大量的香蕉茎作为废物丢弃；今后，这些香蕉茎的纤维将被用作部分黄麻的代用品。织造麻袋的成本也可大大降低。这一先进经验为各地麻纺织厂推广后，每年将为国家创造大量财富。
      广东麻袋厂于去年十一月间接到中共广州市委员会和广州市人民政府工业局关于采用香蕉茎纤维作代用品试织麻袋的指示后，即组织技术人员和工人们积极进行试纺试织的技术研究工作。春节假期中，工程师潘长源和技术员们仍积极研究和准备试纺试织工作。经过工人们的努力，春节后第二天便织成了麻袋。经过检验，情况良好。用香蕉茎纤维与黄麻混合纺出的纬纱，虽然强力稍差，毛茸较多，但麻袋的质量仍能达到规定的质量规格标准。
      目前，该厂正研究香蕉茎纤维的天然脱胶法和准备改进软麻方法，以减少纤维杂质，加强麻纱的拉力，以便织出更好的麻袋。
