The CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee recently issued an "Instruction on Learning from the Socialist Labor Attitude of the Xing Shouyuan Group, Creating Advanced Quotas, and Improving Labor Productivity." The instruction stated that the Xing Shouyuan Group, due to establishing a socialist labor attitude, continuously broke through outdated quotas, created newer and higher quotas, and, based on the improvement of labor productivity, twice automatically revised backward work-hour quotas, generally reducing work-hour quotas by one-third to one-half. After the Xing Shouyuan Group's advanced example was introduced in the newspapers, it caused a great response among the province's employees. In order to learn from the Xing Shouyuan Group more comprehensively, the instruction particularly emphasized learning from four aspects: learning their socialist labor attitude; learning their efforts to study technology, improve technical skills, and continuously improve labor productivity; learning their promotion of the spirit of collectivism; and learning their profound understanding of the unity of national interests and personal interests, and their initiative in consciously and willingly changing backward quotas into advanced quotas. The instruction believes that deeply and vividly publicizing and organizing employees to learn the advanced ideas and advanced deeds of the Xing Shouyuan Group in the province's factories and mines will promote the continuous improvement of labor productivity and provide a more reliable guarantee for completing and overfulfilling the state plan. Therefore, it requires all enterprises to list the promotion of the advanced ideas and advanced experiences of the Xing Shouyuan Group as one of the important tasks this year.

    中共黑龙江省委号召全省职工
    学习邢守元小组的社会主义劳动态度
    中共黑龙江省委，最近发出了“学习邢守元小组社会主义劳动态度，创造先进定额，提高劳动生产率”的指示。指示说，邢守元小组由于树立了社会主义劳动态度，不断突破陈旧的定额，创造了更新更高的定额，并在劳动生产率提高的基础上，两次自动修改了落后的工时定额，普遍降低工时定额三分之一到二分之一。邢守元小组的先进榜样在报纸上介绍后，在全省职工中引起了很大的反响。为了更全面地学习邢守元小组，指示特别强调要从四个方面来学习：学习他们的社会主义劳动态度；学习他们努力学习技术，提高技术水平，不断提高劳动生产率；学习他们发扬集体主义的精神；学习他们深刻认识国家利益和个人利益一致的精神，自觉自愿地改变落后定额为先进定额的创举。指示认为在全省工矿中深入而生动地宣传和组织职工学习邢守元小组的先进思想和先进事迹，就会促使劳动生产率的不断提高，为完成和超额完成国家计划提供更可靠的保证。因此，要求各企业把宣传邢守元小组的先进思想、先进经验列为今年的重要工作之一。
