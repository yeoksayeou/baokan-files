Actively Utilize and Transform Rural Private Merchants

There are currently four forms of trade in China's rural areas: state-owned trade, cooperative trade, private trade, and farmer trade. During the transition period, with the advancement of socialist construction and socialist transformation, state-owned trade will, through different means, increasingly strengthen its leading role in rural trade; cooperative trade will continuously expand its trade positions in rural areas; private trade will inevitably continue to shrink its positions, change its nature, and eventually transform into socialist commerce; and farmer trade, with the continuous development of agricultural and sideline production, will be a long-term form of trade, but it will also continuously reduce its commodity trafficking component. This change is an inevitable trend and is beneficial to organizing commodity circulation and better serving society and socialist construction.

In the past six months, various regions have made arrangements and transformations of varying degrees for rural private merchants and have achieved considerable results. As of the end of 1954, approximately 200,000 rural private merchants nationwide had been transformed through various forms, and some regions had carried out comprehensive transformations and arrangements for certain industries. This work has played a huge role in enlivening rural economic life. However, due to insufficient understanding among the vast majority of rural commercial cadres regarding the arduousness of transforming non-socialist economies and the complexity of commodity exchange during the transition period, coupled with impatience in dealing with rural private merchants, some areas' supply and marketing cooperatives only focused on expanding their own business operations and did not pay enough attention to comprehensively arranging and transforming rural private merchants, and blindly mobilized some rural private merchants to change their professions; some, although making some arrangements for private merchants, did not provide them with adequate care. As a result, on the one hand, many rural private merchants had no way to change their professions and experienced difficulties in life; on the other hand, some blockages occurred in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

The exchange of goods between urban and rural areas needs to be realized through thousands of lines, which have been formed naturally over many years, and rural private merchants play a certain role in enlivening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In order to further improve the work of integrating urban and rural commodities and to facilitate the purchasing and selling needs of the masses, it is necessary, under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, to organize the rural private trade well so that it can serve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Currently, those engaged in private trade activities in rural areas are mainly small vendors, commercial capitalists, and rich peasants engaged in both farming and commerce. Small vendors should be organized through forms such as distributorships, business groups, cooperative groups or cooperative stores, and agency sales to carry out transformation; commercial capitalists should be transformed through state capitalist forms such as distributorships and joint ventures; rich peasants engaged in both farming and commerce should generally be gradually transitioned to farming, but for those with special circumstances, such as those who have been engaged in business for a long time or have certain business skills needed by society, or those who have difficulties in changing professions, appropriate arrangements and transformations should still be made. This requires, in accordance with the policy of overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, and active transformation, and under the principle of ensuring the continuous growth of socialist commerce in rural areas, the supply and marketing cooperatives to arrange and transform rural private merchants according to their different situations, so that their personnel, funds, equipment, and technology can better serve society.

Rural private commerce still plays a certain role in enlivening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This is first reflected in the fact that they currently undertake about 30% of the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and more than 40% of the sales in rural retail. Secondly, they have a huge commercial network. Currently, rural private merchants account for 80% of the commercial personnel in rural China. Therefore, it is necessary to fully value and utilize this force to serve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In some areas, due to insufficient utilization of rural private merchants, on the one hand, the purchasing and selling tasks undertaken by the supply and marketing cooperatives are too heavy, and they are unable to cope; on the other hand, the farmers find it very inconvenient to buy and sell goods. In many areas, the various commercial forces are well organized, and the situation is very different. For example, in Qiaodong Town, Fengcheng County, Jiangxi Province, the supply and marketing cooperative's retail department used to be crowded and queuing up every market day. It was calculated that the farmers wasted 5,400 hours per month queuing to buy daily necessities; later, by utilizing three small vendors and organizing an oil supply group to deliver oil to the countryside specifically for the supply and marketing cooperative, the labor force of the entire district traveling to buy oil was greatly saved, and the entire district could save 2,638 workdays per month.

The vast majority of rural private merchants are small vendors. Because they carry loads on their shoulders and call out sales, they can go deep into remote villages. They not only undertake the role of purchasing and commodity distribution, but also play a role in short-distance transportation. This role is even more important in China's rural areas, which are scattered and have inconvenient transportation. Since liberation, with the development of the rural economy, the farmers' need for commodity purchases and sales has increased day by day, and the rural commodities are originally very complex, requiring both the purchase of large industrial products and the purchase of sporadic daily necessities; requiring both the sale of major agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, and the gradual sale of livestock, hides, wild grass, wild fruits, scrap copper, scrap iron, and even pig bristles and chicken feathers and other sporadic items. The existing retail network of supply and marketing cooperatives and the strength of mobile supply and marketing teams are still insufficient. It is necessary to fully utilize the characteristics of rural private merchants roaming the countryside to purchase many sporadic items that the supply and marketing cooperatives are unable to purchase and to sell many commodities needed by the farmers in small quantities, expand the sales of industrial products, and enliven the rural economy. The Ninth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Feicheng County, Shandong Province, was unable to deliver goods to the countryside regularly, resulting in the long-term backlog of many household utensils and women's and children's products. Last autumn, five peddlers were used to sell 510 hair combs that had been backlogged for more than three years, 650 pairs of women's embroidered shoe uppers that had been backlogged for more than a year, and 144 bars of Dove soap within 20 days. The Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Guan County, Shandong Province, used ten small vendors for agency purchases and sales. In November last year, the agency purchases of daylily accounted for 60% of the total purchases of the Fourth District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, apricot kernels accounted for 50%, scrap iron accounted for 90%, scrap tin accounted for 35%, scrap copper accounted for 60%, and miscellaneous bones accounted for 28%. There are many such examples in various places.

Facts have proved that utilizing and transforming rural private merchants through various forms is not only necessary for the current needs of rural market purchasing and selling, but also necessary for the future development of rural market purchasing and selling. Because with the development of China's socialist construction and socialist transformation and the increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural people, the supply and marketing business of the rural market will also expand day by day; rural transportation is inconvenient, the variety of commodities is complex, and there is a need for many commercial personnel. For example, if three to five cooperative retail departments are set up in large and medium-sized market towns, two or three are set up in small market towns, and each department has an average of three people, then 36,000 market towns nationwide will need 275,000 people; setting up a distribution point in every one or two townships will require more than 260,000 people; commercial cooperative groups will need 1.4 million people; if there is an average of one peddler for every two townships or so, 100,000 people will be needed; in addition to residents near market towns, at least 20,000 people will be needed to deliver oil to the countryside with one oil carrier for every 10,000 people or so; plus other agricultural and sideline product collection stations and rural collection points and peddlers about 500,000 people, the above total is 2.55 million people. If we include the grassroots societies of supply and marketing cooperatives for wholesale, processing, administrative personnel, and commercial personnel in county towns with a population of less than 20,000, a total of about 3.6 million people are needed. From this, it can be seen that it is necessary and possible to fully utilize the personnel, institutions, funds, and equipment of rural private commerce at present.

Will actively utilizing and transforming rural private merchants shrink state-owned and cooperative commerce, and shrink the socialist commercial position? No, it will not. At present, state-owned and cooperative commerce is in a leading position and has mastered the wholesale business, which is the decisive key to socialist commercial work. Under this circumstance, organizing rural private merchants around the supply and marketing cooperatives and undertaking part of the commodity circulation tasks under the leadership of the cooperatives will only expand the influence of socialist commerce in rural areas, increase the role of socialist commerce in the rural economy, and facilitate the gradual transformation of private merchants.

The rural market is the economic center of the countryside and also a bridge connecting urban and rural areas and connecting industry and agriculture. The socialist transformation of rural private merchants is an integral part of the overall task of the country's transition period. In the future, supply and marketing cooperatives must not only develop their own business, but also strengthen the organization and leadership of various commercial components in rural areas and strengthen the socialist transformation of rural private merchants. This is one of the basic tasks of the supply and marketing cooperatives during the transition period. To do this work well, it also requires that party committees and government administrative departments at all levels and mass organizations should all be concerned about changes in the rural market, strengthen leadership over the market, and especially strengthen policy education for personnel in county, district, and township, cooperative commerce, state-owned commerce, and industrial and commercial administrative departments. Only in this way can the socialist transformation of rural private merchants achieve results.

### 积极利用和改造农村私商

    积极利用和改造农村私商
    我国农村中目前存在着四种形式的贸易，即国营贸易、合作社贸易、私营贸易和农民贸易。在过渡时期中，随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的前进，国营贸易将会采取不同方式，日益加强对农村贸易的领导作用；合作社贸易将会不断扩大它在农村的贸易阵地；私营贸易必然要继续缩小它的阵地，改变它的性质，最后改变为社会主义商业；农民贸易，随着农副业生产的不断发展，将是一种长期存在的贸易形式，但同时也将不断缩小其商品贩运部分。这种变化是不可避免的趋势，也是有利于组织商品流转，更好地为社会服务、为社会主义建设服务的。
    近半年来，各地对农村私商已进行了不同程度的安排和改造，并已获得了不少成绩。截至一九五四年底，全国农村通过各种形式进行改造的私商约有二十万人，部分地区并对若干行业进行了全面的改造和安排。这个工作，对活跃农村经济生活起了巨大的作用。但由于广大农村商业干部对过渡时期非社会主义经济改造的艰巨性和商品交换的复杂性认识不足，加上在处理农村私商时的急躁情绪，有些地区的供销合作社只管扩展自营业务，没有足够注意全面安排和改造农村私商，盲目地动员一些农村私商转业；有些对私商虽然做了某些安排，但对他们的照顾也是不够的。结果一方面造成许多农村私商转业无路，生活发生困难；另一方面城乡物资交流发生了某些阻滞现象。
    城乡物资交流要经过千万条线来实现，是多少年来自然形成的，而农村私商在活跃城乡物资交流中是起着一定作用的。为了进一步把城乡商品结合工作做好，和便利群众的购销要求，就必须在供销合作社的领导之下，很好地把农村私营的贸易组织起来，使它为城乡物资交流服务。目前在农村中从事私营贸易活动的主要有小商小贩、商业资本家和富农兼商人三类。对小商小贩应通过经销、经营小组、合作小组或合作商店、代购代销等形式，把他们组织起来，进行改造；对商业资本家应通过经销、合营等国家资本主义的形式进行改造，对富农兼营商业的，一般地应逐渐使他们弃商转农，但对于情况特殊的，如本人长期经商或有一定经营技术为社会需要的，或转业有困难的，仍应适当地加以安排和改造。这就需要根据统筹兼顾、全面安排、积极改造的方针，在保证社会主义商业在农村中不断增长的原则下，分别农村私商的不同情况，由供销合作社对它们进行安排、改造，使它们的人员、资金、设备、技术更好地为社会服务。
    农村私营商业在活跃城乡物资交流中还有着一定的作用。这首先表现在它们目前还担负着农副产品商品量百分之三十左右的收购任务，和农村零售额中百分之四十以上的销售任务。其次，它们有着一个巨大的商业网。我国目前农村商业人员中，农村私商占了百分之八十，所以，必须充分重视和利用这支力量来为城乡物资交流服务。有些地区，由于对农村私商利用不够，以致一方面供销合作社担负的购销任务过于繁重，顾此失彼，不能胜任；另一方面，农民群众买卖商品也感到非常不便。有许多地区把各种商业力量组织得好，情况就有很大不同。如江西省丰城县桥东镇原来是每逢圩日，供销合作社门市部都出现拥挤排队现象，计算起来，农民群众每月因排队购买日用品，就要浪费五千四百个小时；后来利用了三个小商贩、组织供油小组，专为供销合作社送油下乡，就大大节省了全区人民往返购油的劳动力，全区全月就可节省二千六百三十八个工作日。
    农村私商中的极大多数是小商小贩。由于他们肩挑叫卖，能够深入到偏僻的乡村，他们不但担负着收购和商品分配的作用，并且还起着短距离运输的作用。这种作用，在我国农村分散、交通不便的情况下，更有着它的重要性。解放以后，随着农村经济的发展，农民的商品购销需要日益增加，而农村的商品本来又是很复杂的，既需要购买大宗的工业品，又需要购买零星琐细的日用品；既需要出售粮食、棉花、油料等主要农副产品，也需要陆续出售家畜、兽皮、野草、野果、废铜、烂铁以至猪毛、鸡毛等零星物品。现有的供销合作社的零售网和流动供销组的力量还是不够用的，应该充分利用农村私商串乡叫卖的特点，收购供销合作社无力收购的许多零星物品，和代销许多为农民群众零星需要的商品，扩大工业品销路，活跃农村经济。山东省肥城县九区供销合作社平时不能经常送货下乡，使得许多家庭小用具及妇女、儿童用品长期积压；去年秋季利用了五个货郎担子，在二十天的时间内，就把积压三年多的梳头篦子五一○张，积压一年多的妇女花鞋头六五○张，鹅牌香皂一四四块全部销光了。山东省冠县四区供销合作社利用了十个小商贩代购代销，去年十一月份代购黄花菜占四区供销合作社收购总数的百分之六十，杏核仁占百分之五十，废铁占百分之九十，废锡占百分之三十五，废铜占百分之六十，杂骨占百分之二十八。像这样的例子各地还有很多。
    事实证明，通过各种形式利用和改造农村私商，不仅是为了当前农村市场购销业务的需要，也为今后农村市场购销业务的发展所必需。因为随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展、城乡人民购买力的提高，农村市场的供销业务也将随着日益扩大起来；农村中交通不便，商品品种复杂，需要的商业人员是很多的。例如合作社零售门市部在大中集镇设立三至五个，小集镇设两、三个，每个门市部平均三个人，全国三万六千个集镇就需要二十七万五千人；每一、二个乡设立一个分销点，又需要二十六万多人；商业合作小组需要一百四十万人；平均每两个乡左右如果有一个货郎担子，也需十万人；除集镇附近居民外，每一万人左右的地区一个油挑子，至少需要两万人串乡送油；加上其他农副产品收购站及乡村收购点以及货郎担子约五十万人，以上共计为二百五十五万人。如果连同供销合作社基层社做批发、加工、行政人员及两万人口以下县城商业人员，共需三百六十万人左右。由此可见目前充分利用农村私营商业的人员、机构、资金及设备是必要的和可能的。
    积极利用和改造农村私商，是不是会缩小国营和合作社营的商业、缩小社会主义的商业阵地呢？不会的。目前，国营和合作社商业已居于领导地位，掌握了批发业务，这是社会主义商业工作的决定关键。在这种情况下，把农村私商分别组织在供销合作社周围，在合作社领导下担负一部分商品流转任务，这只会扩大社会主义商业在农村的影响，增加社会主义商业在农村经济中的作用，并便利于逐步对私商进行改造。
    农村市场是农村的经济中心，也是城乡结合、工农结合的桥梁，对农村私商的社会主义改造是国家过渡时期总任务的一个组成部分。供销合作社今后不但要发展自己的业务，而且还必须加强对农村各种商业成分的组织和领导，加强对农村私商的社会主义改造。这是供销合作社在过渡时期的基本任务之一。要作好这一工作，同时也要求各级党委和政府行政部门以及各群众团体大家要关心农村市场的变化，加强对市场的领导，特别要对县、区、乡，合作社商业、国营商业、工商行政部门工作人员加强政策教育。只有这样，对农村私商的社会主义改造才能取得成绩。
