Chongqing's local industries will trial produce more new products this year than in previous years. A total of 175 new products are planned for trial production this year, including acid-resistant ceramics, water glass, high-pressure mercury lamps, and current-transforming welding transformers for the use of state-owned industries and basic construction; animal-powered disc harrows, animal-powered seeders, and Soviet-style corn threshers to support agricultural production; and silk-wool-linen blended fabrics, pure wool gabardine, hemp yarn mosquito nets, and sheepskin jackets to meet the growing demands of the people's living standards.

    Currently, many factories have already started trial production. The local state-owned Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory originally planned to trial produce high-pressure mercury lamps in June, but thanks to the efforts of technicians and workers, they successfully trial produced them in early February.

    重庆地方工业将试制新产品
    重庆市地方工业今年将比往年试制更多的新产品。今年计划试制的新产品共有一百七十五种，其中有供应国营工业和基本建设需用的耐酸陶器、水玻璃、高压水银灯、变流电焊变压器等；有支援农业生产的畜力圆盘耙、畜力播种机、苏式玉米脱粒机等农具；也有适应人民生活水平日益增长要求的丝毛麻交织品、纯毛华达呢、麻纱帐子、羊皮夹克等。
    目前许多工厂已开始了试制工作。地方国营重庆电工器材厂原计划在六月份试制高压水银灯，经过技术人员和工人们的努力，在二月初即已试制成功。     （本报集体通讯员重庆日报编辑部讯）
