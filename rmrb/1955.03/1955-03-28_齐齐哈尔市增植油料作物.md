Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province: Organizations, schools, groups, and suburban farmers are actively planning for seeds and selecting locations to increase the planting of oil crops. Various units plan to fully utilize vacant land in front of and behind houses, along field edges and roadsides, as well as reclaim wasteland, to plant 881 hectares of sunflower seeds, hemp seeds, and other oil crops. The above seeds are exchanged among state-owned farms, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and mutual aid teams to share resources, or supplied by the state-owned native produce company.
