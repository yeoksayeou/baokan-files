The "Gansu Province Mineral Resources Exhibition" opened in Lanzhou in early February. This exhibition demonstrates the mineral resources contained within Gansu Province.

Coal is found in fifty-two locations in twenty-six counties of Gansu Province. Among them, the Aganzhen Coalfield is an excellent coalfield supplying fuel and industrial coal to counties and cities near Lanzhou. The Tianzhu Coalfield in Xizheng has complete and abundant deposits, and the coal quality is excellent. In the past two years, people have been mining it to supply the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. After exploration, the Yaojie Coal Mine discovered that the new coal mine is five times larger than before, with thick coal seams and high calorific value, making it an ideal industrial coal. Preliminary survey data shows that the coal reserves and quality of the Jingtai Coalfield can be compared with the Weibei Coalfield in Shaanxi. Last year, exploration proved that the Sandan Coalfield has a larger area, more reserves, and stronger coking properties, making it suitable for the iron and steel smelting industry. This coalfield will begin construction of vertical shafts and power plants this year, and will soon begin mechanized mining.

Yumen Oilfield, the motherland's first petroleum base, is also located in Gansu Province. Yumen Oilfield can produce sixteen or seventeen kinds of oil liquids with different colors and uses. In addition to Yumen Oilfield, the oil storage areas and oil shale distribution areas are also very wide, and more precise exploration is yet to be carried out.

Gansu has abundant hydropower resources. Along the Yellow River, which runs through Gansu for more than 1,000 kilometers, there are thirteen large and small valleys that can be used for power generation. Among them, the larger Liujiaxia has begun preparations for the construction of a hydropower hub. After the completion of this project, it will effectively prevent floods from threatening Lanzhou, expand the irrigation area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and create a huge hydropower station.

Gansu Province is home to a variety of metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. These include marble, mica, asbestos, talc; limestone and gypsum that can be used to make cement; and oil shale, barite, sulfur, alkali, diamonds, mirabilite, saltpeter, etc., which are chemical raw materials. In the vast Yaburai Salt Lake, there is an inexhaustible supply of natural salt. In addition, there are twelve major salt production areas such as Chahan Pool and Jilantai. The abundant salt production guarantees the resources necessary for food, preservation, and the manufacture of hydrochloric acid, soda, bleaching powder, and agricultural fertilizers. There are also raw materials indispensable for ceramics, glass, and refractory materials, such as crystal, glass sand, fluorite, quartz, feldspar, and dolomite.

This exhibition shows that Gansu has very superior material conditions to become a new industrial base for the motherland. (Excerpted from Gansu Daily)

    甘肃省的矿藏和水力
    二月上旬，“甘肃省矿产资源展览会”在兰州开幕了。这个展览会表明了甘肃省境内蕴藏着的矿产资源。
    甘肃省二十六个县里有五十二个地方有煤。其中阿干镇煤田是供应兰州附近县市的燃料及工业用煤的优良煤田。西郑的天祝煤田，矿床完整丰富，煤质优良，近两年来，人们已经开采它来供应兰新铁路使用。窑街煤矿，勘探后发现新的煤矿比以前增大五倍，煤层厚，发热量高，是理想的工业用煤。普查资料说明：景泰煤田的煤藏量和品质，可以跟陕西渭北煤田相媲美。去年勘探证明山丹煤田面积更大，藏量更多，煤质胶结更强，适用于钢铁冶炼工业。这个煤田，今年开始建设竖井、修建电厂，不久将开始全部用机械化开采。
    祖国的第一个石油基地——玉门油矿也在甘肃境内。玉门油矿能生产出十六、七种不同色彩、不同用途的油液。除了玉门油矿以外，石油储藏地区和油母页岩分布的地区还很广，正有待于进行更精确的勘探。
    甘肃有丰富的水力资源。在横贯甘肃境内一千多公里的黄河沿岸，就有十三个可供发电的大小谷峡。其中较大的刘家峡，已开始筹建水力枢纽了，这项工程建成后，将有效地防止洪水对兰州市的威胁，将扩大黄河中游的灌溉面积，并将出现一座巨大的水力电站。
    甘肃省分布着各种金属矿藏和非金属矿藏。其中有大理石、云母、石棉、滑石；有可以制造水泥的石灰石和石膏；属于化工原料的有油母页岩、重晶石、硫磺、碱、金钢石、芒硝、火硝等。在广阔的雅布赖盐池内，有着取之不尽的天然盐。此外，还有擦汉池、吉兰泰等十二个主要的产盐区。丰富的盐产，保证了食用、防腐和制造盐酸、苏打、漂白粉、农田肥料等工业必须的资源。还有陶瓷、玻璃、耐火材料所不可缺少的原料，如水晶、玻璃砂、氟石、石英、长石、白云石等。
    这个展览会说明，甘肃要变成祖国一个新的工业基地，是具有非常优越的物质条件的。  （摘编自甘肃日报）
