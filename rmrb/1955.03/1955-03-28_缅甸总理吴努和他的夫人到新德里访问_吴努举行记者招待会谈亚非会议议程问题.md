Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 26th. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu and his wife arrived in New Delhi by plane on the 25th for a visit. Welcoming them at the airport were Indian Prime Minister Nehru and his daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, among others.

U Nu will stay in New Delhi for two days. He will then visit Buddhist sites such as Benares, Gaya, and Lumbini.

Prior to this, upon arriving in Calcutta, U Nu told reporters that the concept of Asian co-existence has "almost gained universal support." He said, "I am extremely opposed to the idea that the 'Five Principles' embodying the co-existence of nations are a violation of the United Nations Charter."

Referring to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, he said that Burma "made it very clear from the beginning that we are against the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, who is currently visiting India, held a press conference in New Delhi on the 26th.

U Nu told reporters that he and Indian Prime Minister Nehru had discussed the procedures for the upcoming Asian-African Conference. He said that the scope of the agenda for the Asian-African Conference would not exceed the objectives formulated by the five prime ministers of South Asia at the Bogor Conference. According to the communique issued by the five South Asian prime ministers after the Bogor Conference, the purpose of the Asian-African Conference is to promote goodwill and cooperation among Asian and African countries, to discuss issues of particular interest to the peoples of Asian and African countries such as national sovereignty and colonialism, and the contributions that Asian and African countries can make to promoting world peace and cooperation.

When a reporter asked whether the participation of countries with different ideologies would undermine the Asian-African Conference, U Nu replied, "I don't see how the conference could be undermined by the presence of people with different ideologies. Precisely because there are so many people attending the conference, they will be able to make their own contributions to the resolution of international problems."

A reporter said that some Western countries believe that the Asian-African Conference is anti-Western in nature. U Nu said, "If we discuss the issue of colonialism, we will inevitably say some things against those colonial countries. Unfortunately, we may have to say some condemnatory words." He added, "Apart from that, I doubt there is any reason to call it an anti-Western conference."

When a reporter asked whether the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence would be raised at the Asian-African Conference, U Nu said, "Personally, I don't particularly intend to discuss these five principles there. However, if someone wants to talk about it, I am very prepared to participate in the discussion."

U Nu also said that he would visit the United States in June of this year.

    吴努举行记者招待会谈亚非会议议程问题
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】缅甸总理吴努和他的夫人在二十五日乘飞机到达新德里访问。在机场上欢迎的有印度总理尼赫鲁和他的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人等。
    吴努将在新德里逗留两天。然后他将访问贝拿勒斯、加雅和蓝毗尼等佛教胜地。
    在这以前，吴努在到达加尔各答时对记者们说，亚洲的共处的概念“几乎得到普遍的拥护”。他说，“我极其强烈地反对这种说法：体现各国共处的‘五项原则’是违反联合国宪章的。”
    在谈到东南亚条约组织时，他说，缅甸在“一开始就清清楚楚地表明过，我们是反对东南亚条约组织的”。
    【新华社新德里二十七日电】正在印度访问的缅甸总理吴努二十六日在新德里举行了记者招待会。
    吴努对记者们说，他和印度总理尼赫鲁讨论了即将举行的亚非会议的议事程序。他说，亚非会议的议程范围不会超出南亚五国总理在茂物会议上拟订的目标。根据南亚五国总理在茂物会议后发表的公报，亚非会议的目的是促进亚非国家间的亲善和合作，讨论有关民族主权和殖民主义等对亚非国家人民具有特别利害关系的问题，以及亚非国家对于促进世界和平和合作所能作出的贡献。
    有记者问，具有不同观念形态的国家的参加是否会破坏亚非会议，吴努回答说，“我看不出会议怎么会因为有具有不同观念形态的人们出席而遭到破坏。正因为出席会议的人非常多，他们能够对国际问题的解决作出他们自己的贡献。”
    有记者说，有些西方国家认为，亚非会议在性质上是反西方的会议。吴努说，“如果我们讨论殖民主义问题时，我们将免不了说一些反对那些殖民国家的话。不幸的是，也许我们不得不说一些谴责性的话。”他又说，“除此以外，我怀疑是否有任何理由把它称作反西方的会议。”
    有记者问，在亚非会议上是否提出和平共处的五项原则，吴努说，“就我个人来说，我并不特别打算在那里讨论这五项原则。但是，如果有人愿意谈它，我是很有准备来参加讨论的”。
    吴努还说，他将在今年六月间去美国访问。
