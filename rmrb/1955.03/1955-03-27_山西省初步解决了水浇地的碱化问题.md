Alkalization of land is currently a major technical reason hindering the expansion of irrigated areas. Many farmers, seeing their irrigated land gradually alkalizing, and yields slowly decreasing, even to the point of being lower than dry land, are unwilling to dig wells and canals to convert dry land into irrigated land. Now, with the help of Soviet agricultural and hydraulic experts, this problem has begun to be solved in Shanxi Province.

Shanxi Province has 7.94 million mu of irrigated land, of which 2.4 million mu are alkaline land. These alkaline lands are distributed in 24 counties including Yuncheng and Anyi in southern Shanxi, Pingyao and Fenyang in central Shanxi, Xinxian and Dingxiang in northern Shanxi, and Shuoxian and Yanggao in Yanbei. Taking the Fen River irrigation area in central Shanxi as an example, in 1954, the alkalization of land in Pingyao, Jiexiu, Xiaoyi, Fenyang, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, Qingxu, Qixian, and Taiyuan reached 178,000 mu, accounting for about 14 percent of the total cultivated land in the irrigation area. The alkalized areas are also constantly increasing. For example, in Dongshanhu Village, Qixian County, alkaline land increased from 706 mu in 1951 to 1,200 mu in 1953, accounting for 33 percent of the village's cultivated land. Due to soil alkalization, there has also been a serious reduction in grain production. In the Fen River irrigation area, the entire irrigation area loses more than 15 million jin of grain annually. At the same time, the wheat field area has also been greatly reduced. According to a survey of 36 villages, before the land was alkalized, the wheat field area accounted for 50 to 80 percent of the total cultivated land, but now it is only about 10 percent. Cadres and farmers in the Fen River irrigation area are unclear about the causes of soil alkalization, and therefore cannot find a solution. Some farmers have used methods such as "scraping alkaline soil" and "padding with sand" to fight against alkaline land, but none of these can fundamentally solve the problem of land alkalization.

In the autumn of 1953, the relevant departments of the North China Administrative Committee and the Shanxi Provincial People's Government began to conduct preliminary investigations and research on the alkalization of land in the irrigation area. In early 1954, further observations and analysis of soil and groundwater levels were carried out in two base point villages, Beiying Village in Pingyao County and Xiejiazhai Village in Wenshui County, and some experiences of the masses in preventing and combating alkalinity were collected. In May 1954, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government formed an inspection team, and absorbed relevant departments of the North China Agricultural Science Institute and Shanxi Province, as well as responsible cadres from prefectures and counties, to conduct on-site inspections in Pingyao, Fenyang, Jiaocheng, Wenshui, and Qingxu with the help of Soviet agricultural expert Buniak and hydraulic expert Voronin.

There are two reasons for soil alkalization in the Fen River irrigation area: One is the extremely unreasonable irrigation method of large-scale, uncontrolled flooding in history, and the flooding of the Fen River, which raised the saline groundwater and brought the salt to the surface through capillary action and topsoil evaporation. This is the main reason for land alkalization in the area. The other is that the soil structure in this irrigation area is poor and lacks organic matter; the farming methods are crude and backward. This has caused the spread of land alkalization.

How should alkaline land be improved? The most important thing is to level the land, reorganize the irrigation canal system, and change the irrigation method, and determine the irrigation quota in a balanced way according to the water demand. With a reasonable irrigation quota and a complete irrigation canal system, it will be possible to prevent the groundwater level from rising further. However, in areas where the existing groundwater level is already very high, if this level is maintained, the soil will continue to alkalize. Therefore, it is also necessary to establish a good drainage system to lower the groundwater level, which is the fundamental way to prevent land alkalization. For land that has already been alkalized, even if the groundwater level drops below the critical water depth, the excessive salts in the soil will still remain, and if they are not reduced, it will still be alkaline soil. This requires salt leaching, that is, using an appropriate amount of water to dissolve the salts contained in the soil, and then allow them to seep into the ground, and then be discharged by the groundwater drainage system. At the same time, after salt leaching is carried out on heavily alkaline land, it must be combined with agricultural measures: such as early spring harrowing and the application of organic fertilizers such as farmyard manure. Land taking these measures can be planted with spring crops such as barley, corn, and sorghum. However, in order to consolidate the results of salt leaching and obtain better yields, it is best to sow alfalfa first. After two years (excluding the current year), when the soil has a granular structure, it can be plowed and planted with wheat, cotton, etc., to obtain high yields.

After this inspection, in 1954, more than 40 agricultural and water conservancy cadres were transferred from the central to local governments to stay in the two base point villages of Xiejiazhai Village in Wenshui County and Beiying Village in Pingyao County to help farmers test the improvement of alkaline land. When using floodwater for irrigation, the water quota was controlled to not exceed two decimeters, and the practice of deep irrigation in low-lying areas and forced irrigation in high-lying areas was stopped. At the same time, the masses were also organized and led to actively carry out land leveling work. In the month before the flood irrigation alone, 207 branch canals were repaired and 3,145 new embankments were built in 48 villages including Ba Kuai in Qingxu and Yulin in Wenshui, and several hundred mu of large embankments were changed to 30 to 40 mu. More than 70,000 mu of autumn seedlings were irrigated with floodwater, and the groundwater level rose much less than in previous years when floodwater was used for irrigation, effectively preventing the rise of the groundwater level. In October 1954, salt leaching experiments were also carried out on 164 mu of land. Although only two salt leachings were carried out due to the impact of autumn waterlogging (originally planned for four times), the salt content of the leached land was greatly reduced. If it can be rinsed again this year, these alkaline lands can be turned into fertile fields. Beiying Village, Pingyao, which has always been considered to have no way to treat alkaline land, with more than 1,000 mu of heavily alkaline land where seedlings do not grow, after the masses carried out anti-alkaline struggles using new methods, the crops in 1954 grew very well, and in the case of waterlogging disasters, they also obtained unprecedented alkaline land yields. This further encouraged the masses' confidence in preventing and combating alkalinity.

At present, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee has made a detailed implementation plan for the improvement of alkaline land in the Fen River irrigation area, including the construction of reservoirs in the upper reaches, planning and construction of rivers and canals, leveling cultivated land, and carrying out a series of agricultural measures. After the implementation of this plan, the improved alkaline land can increase grain production by more than 33 million jin. With the improvement of alkaline land on both sides of the Fen River, the 2.4 million mu of alkaline beaches in Shanxi Province will gradually become fertile fields producing cotton and wheat.

    山西省初步解决了水浇地的碱化问题
    阎明祥
    土地碱化，是目前阻碍水地面积扩大的一个主要技术原因。许多农民看到水地慢慢碱化，产量慢慢降低，甚至低到还赶不上旱地。在这种情况下，他们就不愿意挖井开渠，把旱地变成水地。现在这个问题，在苏联农业专家和水利专家的帮助下，在山西省已开始得到解决。
    山西省的水地有七百九十四万亩，其中碱地即达二百四十万亩。这些碱地分布在晋南的运城、安邑，晋中的平遥、汾阳，晋北的忻县、定襄，和雁北的朔县、阳高等二十四个县份。以晋中汾河灌区为例，一九五四年平遥、介休、孝义、汾阳、交城、文水、清徐、祁县和太原市土地碱化达十七万八千亩，占灌区总耕地面积的百分之十四左右。碱化地区并且在不断增加。如祁县东山湖村，一九五一年有碱地七百零六亩，一九五三年就增至一千二百亩，碱地已占全村耕地的百分之三十三。由于耕地土壤碱化，还造成严重的粮食减产，以汾河灌区说，全灌区每年即减产粮食一千五百多万斤。同时麦田面积也大为缩小，据三十六个村的调查，在土地未碱化前，麦田面积占总耕地面积的百分之五十至八十，目前仅有百分之十左右。汾河灌区的干部和农民都摸不清楚土壤碱化的原因，因此，也就找不到解决的办法。有些农民用“刮碱土”“垫沙”等许多办法同碱地抗争，结果都不能从根本上解决土地碱化的问题。
    一九五三年秋天，华北行政委员会和山西省人民政府的有关部门开始对灌区土地碱化情况做了初步调查研究。一九五四年初又在平遥县北营和文水县谢家寨两个基点村进一步做了土壤和地下水位的观察分析工作，并搜集了一些群众防碱抗碱的斗争经验。一九五四年五月间，中央人民政府农业部、水利部组成考察组，并吸收华北农业科学研究所、山西省的有关部门和专、县负责干部参加，在苏联农业专家布尼亚克和水利专家沃洛宁的帮助下，在平遥、汾阳、交城、文水、清徐一带进行了实地考察。
    汾河灌区土壤碱化的原因有两个：一个是：历史上大水倒甲漫灌的极不合理灌溉方法和汾河泛滥把含盐的地下水提高，并经毛细管作用和表土蒸发作用，把盐分带到表层。这是该区土地碱化的主要原因。另一个是：这个灌区土壤结构不良，缺乏有机质；耕作方法粗放落后。这样就造成土地碱化的蔓延。
    应怎样来改良碱地呢？最主要的是要平整土地，整顿灌溉渠系和改变灌溉方法，根据需水量来平衡确定灌水定额。有了合理的灌水定额和完善的灌溉渠系，就能制止地下水位不再升高，但现有地下水位已经很高的地区，如果保持这种水位，土壤就会继续碱化，因此还要建立良好的排水系统，降低地下水位，这是防止土地碱化的根本办法。对已经碱化了的土地，即使地下水位降至临界水深以下，而土壤中过多的盐类仍然存在，如果不使它减少，就依然是碱化土壤。这就要进行洗碱，就是用适当的水量，把土壤中含的盐类溶解后，并使之渗入地下，再由排除地下水的系统中排走。同时，在重碱地上进行洗碱后，还必须配合农业措施：如进行早春耙地和施入有机质肥料如厩肥等。采取这些措施的土地，可种大麦、玉米、高粱等春季作物。但为巩固洗碱成果及获得更好的产量，最好先播种苜蓿，两年后（不包括当年）土壤有了团粒结构，再翻耕种植小麦、棉花等，能获得高额产量。
    经过这次考察后，一九五四年从中央到地方各级政府抽调了农业、水利干部四十多人，长驻文水县谢家寨和平遥县北营两个基点村，帮助农民试验碱地的改良工作。在利用洪水浇地时，控制用水定额不超过二公寸，停止了洼地深浇和逼浇高地的做法。同时还组织领导群众积极进行了田面整理工作，仅在洪浇前一个月的时间内，清徐拔奎和文水榆林等四十八村就修好了斗毛渠二百零七条，新做甲埝三千一百四十五条，把数百亩大的甲埝改成了三、四十亩。引洪水灌秋苗七万余亩，地下水位已比往年用洪水浇地时少升高许多，有效地防止了地下水位的提高。一九五四年十月在一百六十四亩土地上还进行了洗碱实验。虽因秋涝积水影响，只洗碱两次（原计划四次）；但经洗碱的土地含盐量大大减少。今年如能再次冲洗，这些碱地就可以变为肥沃良田。一向认为碱地没办法治理的平遥北营村一千多亩不长苗的重碱地，经过群众用新的方法进行抗碱斗争，一九五四年的庄稼长得很好，在水涝灾害的情况，还获得了未曾有过的碱地产量。进一步鼓舞了群众防碱抗碱的信心。
    目前山西省人民委员会已做出汾河灌区碱地改良的详细实施方案，包括上游兴修水库，河渠规划修建，平整耕地和进行一系列的农业措施。这个方案实现后，改良的碱地可增产粮食三千三百多万斤。随着汾河两岸的碱地改良，山西全省的二百四十万亩碱滩都将逐渐成为盛产棉麦的沃野。
