China's Sugar Production and Consumption
Zhang Kaizhong

Sugar is a popular non-staple food that is also nutritious. The raw materials for sugar production include sugarcane, sugar beets, coconuts, and grains. Sugarcane is the primary raw material for sugar production in China, with a wide distribution of production areas. The provinces with the largest output are Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Yunnan, and Zhejiang, followed by Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Xikang, Guizhou, Anhui, and Shaanxi. However, in the past, due to the ruthless exploitation by the reactionary ruling class and the monopoly of comprador capital by the Kuomintang's four major families, the broad masses of working people could not afford sugar, and the sugar-making raw materials they produced were worthless. Therefore, sugarcane farmers were unwilling to grow sugarcane, which severely affected the development of sugar production. In addition, the unrestricted large-scale dumping of foreign sugar was also an important reason for the long-term backwardness and stagnation of domestic sugar production before liberation.

After liberation, in addition to providing sugarcane farmers with substantial assistance in terms of fertilizers, seeds, agricultural loans, and production technology, the state also stipulated more reasonable purchase prices for sugarcane and sugar beets, adjusted the sugar-grain price ratio (e.g., in Tianjin in 1937, one jin of sugar could be exchanged for 2.72 jin of grain; in 1954, one jin of sugar could be exchanged for 3.81 jin of grain), formulated effective market management measures, eliminated speculative merchants who drove down prices and exploited farmers, and gradually promoted pre-purchase work, effectively promoting the development of sugar crops and sugar production. Taking 1949 as 100, the national sugar output (excluding native sugar) was 252 in 1953, exceeding the highest annual output before liberation by 21 percent. Taking Guangdong Province as an example, the planting area of sugar crops has exceeded the highest planting area before liberation by 46 percent. In particular, due to the government's promotion and the expansion of planting areas, the production volume of beet sugar has been rising sharply in recent years, and it has now exceeded more than four times the initial period after liberation. In recent years, the government has continued to expand the planting area in Northeast China, North China, Northwest China, Inner Mongolia and other areas suitable for planting sugar beets, and has expanded and built many sugar factories, laying the foundation for the further development of beet sugar in China.

The planting area of sugar crops has expanded, and the production of the sugar industry has developed. However, since 1953, the supply of sugar has seemed less sufficient than before. What is the reason for this? This is mainly because the growth rate of sugar production is fast, but the growth rate of sugar consumption is even faster. The recent growth of sugar production nationwide is as follows: taking 1952 as 100, then 1953 was 108, and 1954 was 132. However, the growth rate of consumption is not commensurate with this. Looking at the consumption growth statistics of only seven provinces and cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi: taking 1952 as 100, then 1953 was 178. The reason for this is that the country entered a period of large-scale economic construction in 1953, with the development of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in people's purchasing power. In particular, the consumption volume in the vast rural areas and border areas and ethnic minority areas, which used to be very small, has now increased significantly. Not only has the quantity increased, but the variety has also changed greatly. In the past, only a few people could afford white sugar, and most working people could only eat low-quality and inexpensive native brown sugar. After liberation, the proportion of white sugar consumption has been rising year by year.

China is a large country, and even a slight increase in per capita consumption adds up to a very large number. If everyone eats just one or two more liang (50-100 grams) of sugar per month, the national consumption of sugar will increase by more than 200,000 tons. To produce more than 200,000 tons of sugar requires more than 2 million tons of sugarcane raw materials. To plant more than 2 million tons of sugarcane raw materials requires more than 1 million mu (approx. 66,667 hectares) of arable land. At the same time, the vast majority of our current sugar supply is produced domestically, with a very small portion imported from fraternal countries, and the amount of imports accounts for only 13 percent of the pre-war level.

Some people say, "Since the supply of sugar is not enough now, can we expand imports?" This idea is wrong. Because the central task of the people of the whole country at present is to quickly realize the country's socialist industrialization, many of the basic construction projects we are undertaking still cannot be manufactured by ourselves and must be imported from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. In order to achieve the country's socialist industrialization as soon as possible, we must use foreign exchange to buy the most urgently needed industrial construction equipment, and we must not buy sugar without restriction.

Some people say, "Since importing sugar without restriction will affect the early realization of industrialization, let's expand the planting area of sugar crops as much as possible to increase sugar production!" This idea is also wrong. Because the central task of our current agricultural production is to increase grain production as the main task, the expansion of the sugar crop area can only be carried out in a planned and focused manner proportionally (as mentioned above, we have been doing this in recent years). If the planting area of sugar crops is expanded without restriction, it will inevitably affect the increase in grain production, which will be very detrimental to national construction and people's lives.

Since we cannot import sugar without restriction, nor can we expand the planting area of sugar crops without restriction, how can we meet the people's needs for sugar as much as possible?

The solution must first be to actively increase production, and it is necessary to regard improving the unit area yield of sugar crops and gradually improving the sugar manufacturing process as an important link in increasing sugar production. In recent years, although some major producing areas have used intensive cultivation, promoted improved seeds, and increased the application of fertilizers and other methods, the unit area yield has generally increased by 50 to 100 percent, but because the unit area yield varies greatly from place to place, the potential for increasing production is still very large. For example, in terms of improving sugarcane varieties, only some major producing areas are promoting them. The unit area yield of these sugarcane varieties is about 40 to 70 percent lower than that of improved sugarcane varieties, and the sugar content is about 30 to 50 percent lower. The difference between high and low yields is more than doubled. Therefore, all localities should actively and universally promote improved varieties, improve cultivation and fertilization in accordance with soil, climate and other conditions.

In addition, because China's sugar industry has a weak foundation, handicrafts account for a large proportion. Handicraft manufacturing methods are simple, and the pressing capacity is very low, so the sugar content cannot be completely squeezed out, and the quality is poor. If we can organize the exchange of advanced experience in the manufacturing methods of native sugar, the output and quality of native sugar can also be greatly improved. China has a long history of native sugar production, and the vast sugarcane farmers have rich experience. For example, in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other places, every 100 jin of sugarcane can produce 10 to 12 jin of native sugar, while in some areas it produces 6 or 7 jin. Therefore, improving the manufacturing process of sugar, especially native sugar, is also one of the important ways to increase sugar production.

Although increasing production is the best way to meet the needs of the people, if the state does not do a good job in purchasing and sales after production increases, speculative merchants will inevitably carry out large-scale activities, causing market chaos and price fluctuations. Therefore, state-owned commerce doing a good job in purchasing and supply is also an important link in promoting reasonable consumption and solving the problem of domestic sugar supply.

In recent years, state-owned commerce has basically stabilized the sugar market and supplied the people's needs more rationally, but there are still many shortcomings. For example, the purchasing power between urban and rural areas in our country is unbalanced, new industrial zones are developing rapidly, and sugar consumption habits vary greatly between the north and the south, but state-owned commerce does not have a clear understanding of these situations. Especially after the implementation of planned supply of several daily consumer goods, there was insufficient foresight on the large increase in sugar consumption in the vast rural areas. Therefore, in 1954, sugar was not enough to sell in some areas, and sugar could not be sold according to the plan in some areas. In addition, some state-owned commercial workers believed that sugar was a commodity in short supply, and the idea of "selling less is better than selling more" artificially aggravated the tension in the sugar supply. These all require state-owned commerce to better grasp the source of goods, and further improve unified distribution, unified scheduling, and reasonable regulation.

Finally, because sugar is not a staple food, the flexibility of eating sugar is very large. You can eat a little more or a little less. As long as the people of the whole country can adhere to the principle of thrift and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, the phenomenon of insufficient sugar supply can also be relatively reduced.

    我国食糖的生产和消费
    张开中
    糖是人人都喜欢吃的副食品，对人的身体也富有营养价值。制糖的原料有甘蔗、甜菜、椰子和谷物等。甘蔗是我国制糖的主要原料，生产地区的分布很广，其中以台湾、广东、广西、四川、福建、云南、浙江等省的产量为最大，其次是江西、湖南、湖北、西康、贵州、安徽、陕西等地。但是，过去由于反动统治阶级的残酷剥削和国民党四大家族买办资本的垄断，广大劳动人民不仅买不起食糖，其所生产的制糖原料也不值钱。所以蔗农都不愿种植甘蔗，严重地影响食糖生产的发展。另外，当时外糖无限制的大量倾销，也是造成解放前国内食糖生产长期处在落后和停滞状态的重要原因之一。
    解放后，国家除在肥料、种子、农贷和生产技术方面给蔗农以大量帮助外，并规定了比较合理的甘蔗和甜菜的收购价格，调整了糖粮比价（如天津在一九三七年时，一斤糖可换二点七二斤粮；一九五四年时，一斤糖可换三点八一斤粮），制订了有效的市场管理办法，取缔了杀价剥削的投机商人，逐步推行预购工作，有效地促进了糖料作物和食糖生产的发展。全国食糖产量（不包括土糖）以一九四九年为一百，则一九五三年为二百五十二，超过解放前最高年产量的百分之二一。糖料作物种植面积如以广东省为例，则已超过解放前最高播种面积百分之四十六。特别是甜菜糖，由于政府的提倡，种植面积的扩大，几年来的生产量更是直线上升，目前已超过解放初期的四倍以上。近年来，政府又在东北、华北、西北、内蒙古等适宜种植甜菜的地区，继续扩大种植面积，并扩建和新建了许多制糖厂，为我国甜菜糖的进一步发展奠定了基础。
    糖料作物的种植面积扩大了，制糖工业的生产发展了，但自一九五三年以来，食糖的供应反而使人感到似乎不如以前充足了，什么原因呢？这主要是因为食糖生产的增长速度虽快，但食糖消费增长的速度更快。最近几年来全国食糖生产的增长情况：如以一九五二年为一百，则一九五三年为一零八，一九五四年为一百三十二。而消费增长的速度是和这不相适应的，仅就北京、天津、河北、山西、湖南、江西、陕西等七个省市的消费增长统计数字来看：如以一九五二年为一百，则一九五三年为一百七十八，这种情况的出现，是因为一九五三年国家进入了大规模经济建设时期，工农业生产的发展和人民购买力的提高。特别是过去消费量极少的广大农村和边疆及少数民族地区，现在消费量也大大增加了。不仅是数量的增加，而且品种也有了很大的改变。过去只有少数人能吃得起白糖，大多数劳动人民只能食用质量较次而价格低廉的土制红糖，解放后，白糖的消费比重也逐年都在上升。
    我国是一个大国，只要每个人的消费量稍稍提高一点，合起来就是一个很庞大的数字。如果每人每月多吃一两糖，全国就增加了二十多万吨食糖的消费。要生产二十多万吨食糖，就需要二百多万吨甘蔗原料。要种植二百多万吨甘蔗原料，就需要一百多万亩耕地。同时，我们现在的食糖来源，绝大部分是自己生产的，极少部分是从兄弟国家进口的，而进口的数量仅占战前的百分之十三。
    有人说：“现在食糖不够供应，是否可以扩大进口？”这种想法是不对的。因为目前全国人民的中心任务是迅速实现国家社会主义工业化，我们所进行的若干基本建设工程尚有许多机器还不能自己制造，必须从苏联和人民民主国家进口。为了早日实现国家社会主义工业化，就必须用外汇去买最迫切需要的工业建设器材，决不能无限制地去买食糖。
    有人说：“无限制地进口食糖既然影响工业化早日实现，我们就尽量扩大糖料作物的种植面积来增产食糖吧！”这种想法也是不对的。因为我国当前农业生产的中心任务是以增产粮食为主的，糖料作物面积的扩大，只能是有计划有重点按比例地进行（如前所述，几年来我们也是这样作的）。如果无限制地扩大糖料作物的种植面积，必将影响粮食的增产，对国家建设对人民生活都是很大的不利。
    既然不能无限制地进口食糖，又不能无限制地扩大糖料作物的种植面积，那么如何尽量满足人民对食糖的需要呢？
    解决的办法首先必须积极增加生产，而且必须以提高糖料作物单位面积产量和逐步改善食糖制造过程作为增产食糖的重要环节。几年来，虽然一些主要产区运用精耕细作、推广优良种子，增施肥料等方法，一般都提高了单位面积产量百分之五十到百分之一百，但是由于各地单位面积产量相差悬殊，所以增产潜力仍然很大。如在改良蔗种方面，只有部分主要产区正在推广。这些蔗种的单位面积产量较改良蔗种约低百分之四十到百分之七十，含糖分约低百分之三十到百分之五十。有的产量高低的差额竟达两倍以上。因此，各地要按照土壤、气候等条件积极而普遍地推广良种，改进耕作和施肥。
    另外，由于我国制糖工业基础薄弱，手工业生产占很大比重。手工业制造方法简单，压榨能力很低，因而糖分不能全部被榨净，同时质量还差。如果在土糖的制造方法上，能组织交流先进经验，也可使土糖的产量和质量有很大提高。我国土法制糖的历史悠久，广大蔗民有丰富经验。如广东、广西、福建等地每百斤甘蔗可产土糖十斤到十二斤，而有些地区则产六、七斤。因此，改善食糖，特别是土糖的制造过程也是增产食糖的重要方法之一。
    增加生产虽然是满足人民需要的最好方法，但生产增加以后，国家如不作好购、销工作，投机商人必然要大肆活动，引起市场的混乱与价格的波动，所以，国营商业作好收购和供应工作，也是促进合理消费，解决国内食糖供应问题的重要环节。
    几年来，国营商业基本上稳定了食糖市场，较合理地供应了人民需要，但仍有不少缺点。如我国城乡之间购买力不平衡，新的工业区日益迅速发展，食糖的消费习惯南北差异很大，但国营商业对这些情况掌握得不够清楚，尤其在若干日用消费品实行计划供应以后，对广大农村食糖消费大量增加的这一情况预见不够，因此一九五四年就发生部分地区食糖不够卖，部分地区又未能将食糖按计划卖出去，加上部分国营商业工作人员认为食糖是供应不足的商品，产生“少销比多销好”的思想，更人为地加重了食糖供应的紧张局面。这些都要求国营商业更好地掌握货源，进一步做好统一分配，统一调度、合理调剂等工作。
    最后，因为食糖不是主食，所以吃糖的伸缩性很大，可以多吃一点，也可以少吃一点，只要全国人民都能本着节约的原则和发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，也可以相对减少食糖供应不足的现象。
