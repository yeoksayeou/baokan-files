    Handicraft Cooperatives Help Peasants Improve Farm Tools
    In Jiaxing Special District, Zhejiang Province, more than 200 handicraft production cooperatives have been organized, with more than 6,000 members. Party committees at all levels have paid attention to leading these handicraft production cooperatives to conscientiously implement the policy of serving agricultural production, and have achieved considerable success in helping peasants improve farm tools. In the second half of last year, the Supply and Marketing Handicraft Cooperation Department of the CPC Jiaxing District Committee held several meetings to study the manufacture of new-style rice threshers and deep plows and other new agricultural implements. At the same time, it held a district-wide handicraft technology innovation exhibition to organize the exchange of experience. At present, the farm tools improved and manufactured by handicraft production cooperatives throughout the district include new-style rice threshers, automatic steering windmills, deep plows, single-person pedal waterwheels, and more. The automatic steering windmill manufactured by the Xitang Woodware Production Cooperative in Jiashan County has a water lifting capacity that is more than 84% higher than the old-style windmills. The deep plows reformed by the woodware production cooperatives in Lin'an, Pinghu, and other counties plow more than two inches deeper than the original paddy field plows. The single-person pedal waterwheels reformed by Yu Hang, Jiashan, and other counties have the same efficiency as the original four-person pedal waterwheels, saving three laborers. These improved farm tools are welcomed by the broad masses of peasants. After the new-style rice thresher produced by the Weitang Town Ironware Production Cooperative in Jiashan County was promoted throughout the district, more than 1,700 units were produced and sold by more than 20 iron and wood production cooperatives in more than ten counties last autumn.

    手工业社帮助农民改良农具
    浙江省嘉兴专区已经组织了二百多个手工业生产合作社，社员有六千多人。各级党委注意领导这些手工业生产合作社认真贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，在帮助农民改进农具方面取得不少成绩。去年下半年，中共嘉兴地委供销手工业合作部曾经召开多次会议，研究制造新式打稻机和深耕犁等新农具；同时，举办了全区手工业技术革新展览会，组织交流经验。现在，全区手工业生产合作社改进制成的农具，有新式打稻机、自动转向风力水车、深耕犁、单人脚踏水车等多种。嘉善县西塘木器生产合作社制造的自动转向风力水车，戽水能力比旧式风力水车提高百分之八十四以上。临安、平湖等县木器生产合作社改制的深耕犁比原来的水田犁深耕二寸多。余杭、嘉善等县改制的单人脚踏水车，效力相当于原来四人踏的水车，可节约三个劳动力。这些改良后的农具受到广大农民欢迎。嘉善县魏塘镇铁器生产合作社制成的新式打稻机在全区推广以后，去年秋天十多个县二十多个铁、木业生产合作社就生产和销出一千七百多部。　（洪国炜）
