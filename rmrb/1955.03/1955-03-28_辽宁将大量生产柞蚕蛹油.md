Liaoning to Mass Produce Tussah Silkworm Pupa Oil

The Liaoning Tussah Silk Company will mass produce tussah silkworm pupa oil this year.

Liaoning Province has a large output of tussah silkworm cocoons. The silkworm pupae left over from silk reeling each year amount to more than 6 million jin, which can produce about 1.4 million jin of pupa oil. However, in the past, most silkworm pupae were used as agricultural fertilizer, with only 30% being used as food.

In 1954, the Liaoning Tussah Silk Company dispatched engineers and technicians to the Suzhou No. 1 Silk Reeling Factory twice to learn the pupa oil extraction method created by Zhang Jingxian, and successfully tested the use of tussah silkworm pupae to extract oil. Judging from the test results, the quality of tussah silkworm pupa oil is even better than mulberry silkworm pupa oil, with a bright color, making it more suitable for industrial use.

This company will establish three pupa oil production workshops this year, which are expected to be fully operational by the end of the year. These three workshops can produce 518,400 jin of oil annually, worth more than 200,000 yuan.

    辽宁将大量生产柞蚕蛹油
    辽宁柞蚕丝绸公司今年将大量生产柞蚕蛹油。
    辽宁省柞蚕茧产量很大，每年缫丝剩下来的蚕蛹约有六百多万斤，可产蛹油一百四十万斤左右。但是过去大部分蚕蛹被当作农业肥料，只有百分之三十作为食料。
    辽宁柞蚕丝绸公司在一九五四年，先后两次派遣工程师、技术员，去苏州第一缫丝厂学习张景贤创造的蛹油浸出法，并试验用柞蚕蛹浸油成功。从试验情形来看，柞蚕蛹油的质量较桑蚕蛹油还好，色泽鲜明，更适合工业方面使用。
    这个公司在今年将建立三个蛹油生产车间，预计到年底可全部开工生产。这三个车间每年可产油五十一万八千四百斤，价值二十余万元。
