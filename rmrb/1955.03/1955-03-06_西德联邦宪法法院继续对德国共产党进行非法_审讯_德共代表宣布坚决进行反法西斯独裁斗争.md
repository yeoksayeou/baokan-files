Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: The West German Federal Constitutional Court continued its nineteenth illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party (DKP) on the 2nd. The DKP's plenipotentiary representatives, Reisch and Ledwin, who are being illegally detained, appeared in court for the first time to participate in the debate. Their presence was welcomed by the DKP delegation, and the worker delegations and masses in the audience expressed their respect to them.

During the "trial" on the 2nd, both sides continued to debate the "evidence" presented by the Bonn government. In the early stages of the "trial," the Bonn authorities attempted to smear the DKP with fabricated charges such as so-called "internal aggression" to accuse the DKP of being unconstitutional. However, the DKP's struggle for German peaceful reunification and against militarism foiled this conspiracy. Now, the strategy of the Bonn ruling group is to avoid discussing the actual policies of the DKP.

DKP Plenipotentiary Representative Fischer made a statement in court on the 2nd, explaining the relationship between the DKP's ultimate goal of establishing a socialist society and its specific goals in West Germany at present. Fischer said that the DKP has led the resolute struggle against fascist dictatorship, against the deprivation of democratic rights, and for the establishment of an anti-fascist democratic order. The DKP believes that defending democratic freedoms is its current fundamental task, especially at a time when a military dictatorship system is being prepared to seize power in the Federal Republic. Fischer said, "We advocate the abolition of privileged status, the realization of equal rights for women, the democratization of electoral laws, and the restriction of the abuse of economic power. In the current period, we will fight to defend bourgeois forms of democracy in order to prevent barbarism and regression."

Fischer's speech was repeatedly interrupted by representatives of the Bonn government and judges. The court finally, at the request of the Bonn government representative, even prevented Fischer from continuing to speak.

The debate adjourned at 1:30 PM and will resume on the 3rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: The West German Federal Constitutional Court conducted its twentieth illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party on March 3rd. During this trial, DKP legal representative Wissig, on behalf of the DKP delegation, protested in court against the Adenauer police's investigation of people's delegations and audience members from all over West Germany.

The detained DKP plenipotentiary representatives, Reisch and Ledwin, continued to appear in court on the 3rd to participate in the debate. A workers' delegation paid their respects to them during a break in the "trial."

During the "trial" on the 3rd, DKP legal representative Krüger continued to refute the so-called "evidence" presented by the Bonn government representatives to accuse the DKP. At 4 PM, the court announced that it would adjourn until March 8th.

    西德联邦宪法法院继续对德国共产党进行非法“审讯”
    德共代表宣布坚决进行反法西斯独裁斗争
    据新华社柏林讯：西德联邦宪法法院二日继续进行对德国共产党的第十九次非法“审讯”。被非法羁押中的德国共产党全权代表雷熙和莱德温首次出庭参加辩论。他们的出席受到德国共产党代表团的欢迎，旁听席上的工人代表团和群众也对他们表示敬意。
    在二日“审讯”中，双方继续就波恩政府提出的“证件”问题进行辩论。在“审讯”初期，波恩当局企图以所谓“内部侵略”等捏造的罪名来诬蔑德国共产党违宪，但是德国共产党为德国和平统一和为反对军国主义而斗争的事实使这种阴谋遭到失败。现在波恩统治集团的策略是避免谈到德国共产党的实际政策。
    德国共产党全权代表费希二日在法庭上发表声明，说明了德国共产党建立社会主义社会的最终目标和当前在西德的具体目标之间的关系问题。费希说，德国共产党领导了坚决反对法西斯独裁，反对剥夺民主权利和为争取建立反法西斯的民主秩序而进行的斗争。德国共产党认为保卫民主自由是它当前的基本任务，特别是在现在联邦共和国内有一种军事独裁的制度正在准备攫取政权的时候。费希说，我们主张取消特权地位、实现妇女的平等权利、选举法民主化和限制经济权力的滥用。我们在目前时期将为保卫资产阶级形式的民主而斗争，借以制止野蛮和倒退。
    费希的演说不时遭到波恩政府代表和法官的扰乱，法庭最后甚至按照波恩政府代表的要求不准费希继续发言。
    辩论到下午一时半休庭，到三日再开。
    据新华社柏林讯：在西德联邦宪法法院三月三日进行了对德国共产党的第二十次非法“审讯”。在这次审讯中，德国共产党法律代表威西格以德国共产党代表团的名义，在法庭上抗议阿登纳警察对来自西德各地的人民代表团和旁听群众进行侦查。
    被拘押中的德国共产党全权代表雷熙和莱德温三日继续出庭参加辩论。一个工人代表团在“审讯”休息时间向他们致敬。
    三日“审讯”时，德国共产党法律代表克吕格尔继续驳斥波恩政府代表提出来控告德国共产党的所谓“证件”。下午四时，法庭宣布休庭到三月八日再开。
