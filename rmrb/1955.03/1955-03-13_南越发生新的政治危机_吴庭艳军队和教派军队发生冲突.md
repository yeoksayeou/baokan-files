    New Political Crisis Erupts in South Vietnam
    Ngo Dinh Diem's Troops Clash with Sect Armies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th] Saigon News: A new political crisis has erupted in South Vietnam. Under the instruction and support of the United States, Ngo Dinh Diem has adopted measures to eliminate opposition, which has met with fierce resistance from various sects in South Vietnam that possess armies.
    On March 4th, the Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Binh Xuyen sects issued a joint statement declaring an end to their "traditional hatred" and uniting to confront Ngo Dinh Diem. According to the Paris newspaper "France Soir," these three sects have issued an "ultimatum" to Ngo Dinh Diem, demanding a reorganization of the government. At the same time, they have sent representatives to France to ask Bao Dai to return to Saigon and drive out Ngo Dinh Diem.
    The South Vietnamese authorities have prohibited the publication of the three sects' statement. Ngo Dinh Diem has deployed armored vehicles around his official residence, and roads leading to the residence have been heavily fortified. The situation in Saigon is very tense.
    According to foreign news agencies, Ngo Dinh Diem's troops and opposing armed forces have clashed in various locations. Ngo Dinh Diem sent seven battalions of troops, equipped with armored vehicles and artillery, to Quang Tri Province in central Vietnam to fight against the opposition forces. In the Ca Mau Peninsula region of South Vietnam, the Hoa Hao troops launched an attack on Ngo Dinh Diem's troops and have already captured one of the latter's strongholds.
    Sources indicate that the continuous political crises in South Vietnam are occurring against the backdrop of a struggle between the United States and France. The United States has been trying to squeeze French influence out of South Vietnam and has been vigorously supporting the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which is loyal to American interests, to eliminate all opposition forces.
    At the same time, this fierce struggle between political factions fully reflects the instability of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. Regarding this point, the "France Soir" correspondent in Saigon wrote that "American aid supports Ngo Dinh Diem like morphine," which only allows Ngo Dinh Diem to "maintain three months of calm."

    南越发生新的政治危机
    吴庭艳军队和教派军队发生冲突
    【新华社河内十日电】　西贡消息，南越又发生了新的政治危机。吴庭艳在美国的指示和支持下，采取消灭反对派的措施，遭到了拥有军队的南越各教派的激烈反抗。
    高台教、和好教、平川派在三月四日发表了一个联合声明，宣布结束他们之间的“传统仇恨”，联合起来对付吴庭艳。据巴黎“法兰西晚报”报道，这三个教派已经向吴庭艳提出了一个“最后通牒”，要求改组政府。同时，他们已经派代表到法国，要保大回西贡赶走吴庭艳。
    南越当局禁止发表三个教派的声明。吴庭艳把装甲车布置在他的官邸周围，通到官邸的道路也都加强布防。西贡的局势甚为紧张。
    据外国通讯社消息，吴庭艳军队和反对他的武装力量已在各地发生冲突。吴庭艳派了配备着装甲车和大炮的七营军队，到中越的广治省境去和反对他的军队作战。在南越的金瓯岬地区，和好教军队向吴庭艳军队发动进攻，已经攻占了后者的一个据点。
    有消息指出，在南越不断发生政治危机的背景，是美国和法国之间的斗争。美国一直在设法把法国势力从南越排挤出去并且大力支持忠于美国利益的吴庭艳集团来铲除一切反对势力。
    同时，这种政治派别之间的激烈斗争也充分反映出吴庭艳政权的不稳定的程度，关于这一点，
  “法兰西晚报”驻西贡记者写道，“美援像吗啡一样”地支持着吴庭艳，这只使得吴庭艳“维持了三个月的平静”。
