Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd:

    Workers throughout the nation's factories, mines, construction sites, and railways are actively participating in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, and are expressing their determination to oppose the use of atomic weapons with practical actions to increase production.
    By the end of February, more than 284,000 workers in Beijing had signed. In Shanghai, more than one million employees in the industrial sector signed, with some factories achieving 100% participation. In Jiangsu Province, over 500,000 workers in twelve major cities, including Nanjing, Wuxi, and Xuzhou, signed. In Xi'an, more than 100,000 employees signed. In Liaoning Province, by March 1st, a total of 773,000 workers in the six cities of Shenyang, Anshan, Lüda, Fushun, Benxi, and Fuxin had signed, with 99% of workers in Anshan Iron and Steel Complex having signed. In Jiangxi Province, employees of seven units of the Pingxiang Coal Mine held more than 20 signature rallies. From February 23rd to 25th, all employees and most of their family members signed. In the emerging industrial cities of Huangshi in Hubei Province and Zhuzhou in Hunan Province, workers were the first to sign in the signature campaign. In Zhuzhou, many workers who could not leave their posts due to production signed next to their machines during factory rallies.
    Workers at construction sites in many cities have joined the signature campaign. More than 20,000 construction workers in Tianjin signed up completely. At the construction site of Tianjin Sixth People's Hospital, more than 200 construction workers, watching the building they built brick by brick soon become a hospital to help relieve people's suffering, solemnly signed their names on the "Appeal to the People of the World." At the construction site of the People's Heroes Monument in Beijing, at the construction site of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai, and at the construction site of the Meishan Reservoir in Anhui Province, construction workers signed their names. More than one hundred units at the construction site of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant held rallies within a week, and tens of thousands of employees and their families all signed. Construction workers expressed their views when signing: We are working hard on peaceful construction, but American imperialism wants to destroy it on a large scale, we will never allow it!
    The signature campaign is also being enthusiastically carried out among the vast number of railway, salt field, machinery, metallurgy, surveying, transportation, postal and telecommunications, chemical, and seafarer workers. Railway employees across the country have universally signed. According to statistics from the Beijing Railway Administration alone, as of February 23rd to 26th, more than 59,000 employees and their families had signed. At a rally at the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Wuhan, many veteran "February 7th" workers, labor models, and employees who returned from the Korean War took the lead in signing. After more than 7,000 salt workers at the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field signed, labor competitions were immediately launched between groups to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's production plan.
    The workers who signed also included a large number of female workers in various industries. In Jiangsu Province alone, more than 70,000 female textile workers signed. Yang Gendi, a production expert at the jointly-owned Yuankang Yarn Factory in Suzhou, said at the signing rally: "I am a female worker who has suffered from the ravages of war. I want to warn those atomic war mongers, we will never allow them to act recklessly!"
    After the workers signed, production efficiency improved significantly in various places. The Jia Great Shift of the steelmaking workshop of Benxi Steel Plant shortened the steelmaking time by twelve hours and nine minutes in the three days of February 17th, 18th, and 19th, increasing the production of approximately fifteen tons of steel ingots for the country. The model group of the Xi'an Textile Factory—the Changqing Group—proposed to ensure the full realization of the production plan and has been overfulfilling the task every day. As of February 25th, the first-class products exceeded the original target by 3.6 pieces, and the second-class products exceeded the target by 7.9 pieces. After the workers in the first rolling mill workshop of the Xinhu Iron and Steel Plant signed on February 17th, they continued to break quotas. From the 18th to the 25th, they produced 121 tons of steel more than planned.

    全国工人踊跃签名反对使用原子武器
    据新华社三日讯：全国各工厂、矿山、工地和铁路的广大职工踊跃参加反对使用原子武器签名运动，并纷纷以增加生产的实际行动来表示反对使用原子武器的决心。
    到二月底止，北京市有二十八万四千多名工人签了名。上海市工业系统共有一百多万职工签名，有些工厂的工人都是百分之百地签了名。江苏省南京、无锡、徐州等十二个主要城市有五十多万工人签名。西安市签名的职工也有十多万人。辽宁省沈阳、鞍山、旅大、抚顺、本溪、阜新等六市到三月一日止，共有七十七万三千名工人签名，其中鞍钢各厂矿百分之九十九的工人都已签名。江西省萍乡煤矿七个单位的职工先后举行了二十多次签名集会，在二月二十三日到二十五日三天中，全体职工和大部职工家属都签了名。在新兴工业城市湖北省黄石市和湖南省株州市的签名运动中，领先签名的都是工人。株州各工厂举行集会时，许多因生产不能脱身的值班工人就在机器旁签了名。
    许多城市的建筑工地上的工人都投入了签名运动。天津市两万多名建筑工人全部签了名。在天津市立第六医院建筑工地上，二百多名建筑工人眼看着自己一砖一瓦建筑起来的大楼，不久就成为帮助解除人民痛苦的医院了，他们庄严地在“告全世界人民书”上签下自己的名字。在北京市的首都人民英雄纪念碑工地上，在上海市的中苏友好大厦工地上，在安徽省的梅山水库工地上，建筑工人们都签了名。长春第一汽车制造厂建筑工地上的一百多个单位，在一周内都分别举行了集会，几万个职工和家属也全部签了名。建筑工人们签名时都表示：我们正在辛勤地从事和平建设，美帝国主义却想大规模毁灭它，我们决不允许！
    签名运动也在广大的铁路、盐场、机械、冶金、勘测、运输、邮电、化学和海员工人中热烈展开。全国铁路员工已经普遍签名。仅据北京铁路管理局统计，截至二月二十三日至二十六日止，共有职工和家属五万九千多人签了名。在武汉市江岸机车车辆修理工厂的一次集会上，许多“二七”老工人、劳动模范和抗美援朝归国职工都带头签名。国营淮北盐场七千多名盐工签名后，小组和小组之间立刻开展了劳动竞赛，保证完成和超额完成今年的生产计划。
    在签名的工人中，还包括了数量众多的各业女工。仅江苏省就有七万多纺织女工签名。苏州市公私合营源康纱厂生产能手杨根弟在签名大会上说：“我是受过战争摧残的女工。我要警告那些原子战争贩子，决不允许他们胡作非为！”
    各地工人签名后，生产效率显著提高。本溪钢厂制钢车间甲大班在二月十七、十八、十九日三天共缩短炼钢时间十二小时零九分，大约给国家增产十五吨钢锭。西安纺织厂的模范组——常青小组提出保证全面实现生产计划后，每天都超额完成任务。到二月二十五日为止，一等品比原定指标超额生产三点六匹，二等品超额生产七点九匹。新沪钢铁厂第一轧钢车间的工人们在二月十七日签名后不断突破定额，从十八日到二十五日，已比计划多生产了一百二十一吨钢材。
