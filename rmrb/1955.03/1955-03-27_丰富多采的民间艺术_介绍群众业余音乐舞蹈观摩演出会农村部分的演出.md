    Rich and Colorful Folk Art
    ——Introducing the Rural Performances of the Mass Amateur Music and Dance Festival
    Zhu Shulan
    In our multi-ethnic country, we possess a rich and colorful treasure trove of folk art. The rural portion of the Mass Amateur Music and Dance Festival held in the capital from March 10th to 24th, though featuring only ninety-three programs from thirteen provinces including Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and involving only nine ethnic groups including Han, Mongolian, Hui, Zhuang, Dong, Korean, Miao, Li, and Manchu, has fully demonstrated the healthy, vigorous, lively, diverse, and distinctly local character of folk music and dance. The majority of the rural amateur performers participating in this performance are art enthusiasts and key members of rural mass amateur art activities. At the same time, most of them are also advanced individuals in agricultural production. Their various publicity efforts through artistic activities have played a certain educational role among the peasant masses, and have also enriched and enlivened the cultural and recreational life of the peasants.
    Judging from the programs in this performance, many regions have begun to attach importance to and explore the folk art heritage of various ethnic groups. Many folk artists and peasant amateur performers have participated in rural amateur art activities, making those concise and powerful musical dances, collectively created, passed down through generations, and loved by the working people, active in the cultural life of the masses, and some have even been developed. For example, the "Small Cart Dance" performed by the Heilongjiang delegation was adapted by the adapter based on the "Taiping Cart" popular in Dashiqiao area of Acheng County, combined with his own feelings in the new life, adopted the theme of "supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families," and vividly expressed the full of joyous emotions of the working people through the plot of a father and daughter delivering gifts to military families during the holidays, passing through high mountains, steep slopes, and swamps, and finally delivering the gifts to the military families.
    At the same time, from this performance, we also see the gains of professional literary and art workers learning from the people and exploring and sorting out traditional programs. For example, the dance drama "Liu Hai Plays with the Golden Toad" performed by the Anhui delegation was adapted and processed based on a mythological story dance popular in Linquan area of Anhui Province. It describes the story of the beautiful fairy Golden Toad falling in love with the kind peasant Liu Hai, giving people a beautiful, healthy, and simple impression.
    In many other dance programs, we also see performances full of life and different local flavors. The "Carrying Pole Dance" of the Zhuang people in Guangxi shows the joyful labor of farmers eager for a good harvest in the process of transplanting seedlings, drawing water, threshing, and husking rice. The various rhythms played with the carrying pole are exciting and pleasant. Another song and dance "Catching Shrimp" performed by them movingly shows the pure love of Zhuang young men and women established in common labor. The "Hand Drum Dance" of the Shandong delegation, the "Plain Drum" of the Shaanxi delegation, and the "War Drum" of the Hebei delegation all show the heroic spirit, bravery, and confidence in victory of our nation through powerful movements and vigorous dance postures. The "Celebrating the New Year" of the Shanxi delegation, the "Le Zi" of the Hebei delegation, and the "Large Yangko" of the Liaoning delegation, as well as the dragon dances of the Zhejiang and Sichuan delegations, not only have their own unique local characteristics, but also reflect the joyful and enthusiastic atmosphere of the peasant masses celebrating their happy lives during the holidays. The "Fan Dance" performed by the Korean ethnic group in Jilin shows the kindness and loveliness of the people of this ethnic group, and also depicts their cheerful mood.
    In the musical programs of this performance, in terms of vocal music, we heard folk songs and mountain songs of different regions and different styles. These beautiful songs created by the working people of past generations have been given new content in the new society, profoundly and meticulously reflecting the happy new life. The mountain songs "Cuckoo" and "The Communist Party is My Savior" sung by Liu Daoji of the Zhejiang delegation, because the singer himself is a fifteen-year-old shepherd and has a deep understanding of the old and new lives, expressed his personal feelings affectionately through his loud, crisp singing and full of emotion. Wen Yueying of the Guangdong delegation also truly expressed the respect and love of the working people for the leader in the Zijin mountain song "Singing of Chairman Mao". The Hainan Li folk song "Splitting the Mountain" sung by Fu Qixian of the Guangdong Li ethnic group, the folk song chorus "Picking Tea Song" of the Anhui delegation, and the water-drawing work song "Ha Tou" of the Zhejiang delegation all naturally and simply sing of labor. The "Singing of Chairman Mao" sung by Wu Yanmei of the Guangxi Dong ethnic group is performed in the unique storytelling form of the "Dong Pipa Song", which praises the boundless gratitude of the fraternal ethnic groups to the leader. The "Sitting in the Song Hall" performed by the Sichuan delegation is a unique folk singing form popular in northern and eastern Sichuan, depicting the pain of women's lack of freedom in marriage before liberation. The selection from "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" sung by Guo Lianying of the Heilongjiang Hui ethnic group also gave a deeper impression. In terms of instrumental music, we deeply felt the richness of folk music in various places. We not only heard some beautiful melodies, but also reflected the joyous emotions of the working people; at the same time, on the basis of the broad masses, many outstanding talents have emerged. For example, Su Ma of the Jilin Mongolian ethnic group's four-stringed zither solo "Ba Yin Bangzi" and other pieces delicately express the optimism and uninhibited emotions of the Mongolian people. Ren Qingzhi of the Henan delegation's guzheng solo, Zhang Zhiyou of the Hebei delegation's suona solo "Entering the Palace Twice", Liu Zhanrong of the Jilin delegation's "Ka Xi", Yuan Ziwen and Wei Yongtang of the Shandong delegation's transverse flute duet "Double Phoenix Harmony", the folk instrumental music performance "Ten Thousand Flower Lanterns, General's Order" of the Zhejiang delegation, and the Chaozhou large gong and drum of the Guangdong delegation, all truthfully convey the emotions of the music and have a fairly high level of skill, or have new creations in the performance. The six-year-old genius child Sun Yuxi, who started learning the erhu at the age of four, is now able to skillfully and accurately play forty or fifty pieces of nanhu and jinghu.
    In this performance, we were also excited to see the operas of the Guangxi Zhuang and Dong ethnic groups. These two ethnic operas have profound ideological content and simple forms of expression, and are valuable assets in our national opera. The Zhuang opera "Treasure Gourd" is compiled from a popular folk legend of the ethnic group, which satirizes the cunning and shameless tricks of the landlord class and the ugly deeds exposed by the working people. This is a play with a comedic flavor. The Dong opera "Qin Niangmei" is a story reflecting the struggle of Dong working women for freedom of marriage and against landlord bullies, with a tortuous and moving plot. It shows the Dong working women's love of freedom and resourcefulness and bravery; it also exposes the cruel crimes of the feudal ruling class.
    The planned exploration and sorting out of the rich and colorful musical, dance, and opera heritage of various ethnic groups, and the creation of more artistic programs on this basis, is only just beginning. This work, with the vigorous development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the increasing need of the peasant masses for cultural and artistic life, is even more important. After the cultural and artistic activities are carried out more widely and deeply in the vast rural areas, more beautiful folk arts will be discovered and created.

    丰富多采的民间艺术
    ——介绍群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会农村部分的演出
    朱树兰
    在我们这个多民族的国家里，有着丰富多采的民间艺术宝藏。三月十日至二十四日在首都举行的群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会的农村部分，虽然只有河北、辽宁、黑龙江、吉林、河南、山东、山西、陕西、安徽、四川、浙江、广东、广西等十三个省，仅包括汉、蒙、回、僮、侗、朝鲜、苗、黎、满等九个民族演出的九十三个节目，已充分地展示了民间音乐舞蹈的健康有力、活泼多样和鲜明的地方色彩。参加这次演出的大部分农村业余演员，都爱好艺术，是农村开展群众业余艺术活动的骨干分子。同时，他们大多也是农业生产中的先进分子。他们通过文艺活动进行的各种宣传工作在农民群众中起了一定的教育作用，也丰富和活跃了农民的文化娱乐生活。
    从这次演出的节目来看，很多地区已开始重视和发掘各民族的民间艺术遗产。不少民间老艺人和农民业余演员参加了农村的业余艺术活动，使那些集体创造、世代相传、并为劳动人民喜闻乐见的短小精悍的音乐舞蹈，活跃在群众的文化生活里，有的还有了发展。像黑龙江代表队演出的“小车舞”，就是改编者以老家阿城县大石桥一带盛行的“太平车”为基础，根据自己在新生活中的感受，采用了“拥军优属”的主题，通过父女俩在节日里为军属送礼，经过高山、陡坡、泥沼，最后将礼物送到军属家里的情节，生动地表现了劳动人民饱满的欢乐情绪。
    同时，从这次的演出里，我们也看到专业文艺工作者向民间学习和发掘整理传统节目的收获。如安徽代表队演出的舞剧“刘海戏金蟾”，就是根据流行于安徽省临泉一带的一个神话故事舞蹈经过整理加工的。它描述了美丽的仙女金蟾爱上了善良的农民刘海的故事，给人以优美、健康、朴实的印象。
    在其他的许多舞蹈节目中，我们也看到富有生活气息和不同地方风味的表演。广西僮族的“扁担舞”，表现了渴望丰收的农民在插秧、车水、打谷、舂米等劳动过程中的愉快劳动，用扁担打出的种种节奏令人兴奋和愉快。他们演出的另一个歌舞“捞虾”，动人地表现了僮族男女青年建立在共同劳动中的纯真爱情。山东代表队的“手鼓舞”、陕西代表队的“素鼓”、和河北代表队的“战鼓”，都是通过有力的动作、健壮的舞姿，显示着我们民族的英雄气概、勇敢精神和对胜利的信心。而山西代表队的“过大年”、河北代表队的“乐子”和辽宁代表队的“大秧歌”，以及浙江、四川两代表队的舞龙，不但各有独特的地方色彩，也都反映了农民群众在节日里庆贺自己美满生活的欢欣热烈气氛。吉林朝鲜族演出的“扇子舞”，表现了该族人民的善良、可爱，也描绘了他们生活愉快的情绪。
  　这次演出的音乐节目，在声乐方面，我们听到了不同地区、不同风格的民歌和山歌。这些为历代劳动人民所创造的优美歌曲，在新社会里被赋予了新的内容，深刻而细致地反映了幸福的新生活。浙江代表队刘道寄唱的山歌“杜鹃鸟”和“救命恩人共产党”，由于歌唱者自己是一个十五岁的牧童，对新旧生活有着很深的体会，通过他的嘹亮、清脆的歌声和饱满的感情亲切地表达了切身的感受。广东代表队温月英唱的紫金山歌“歌唱毛主席”，也真切地表现了劳动人民对领袖的尊敬和热爱。广东黎族符其贤唱的海南黎族民歌“劈山栏”、安徽代表队的民歌合唱“采茶歌”等、浙江代表队的车水号子“哈头”，都自然而朴实地歌唱了劳动。广西侗族吴岩美演唱的“歌唱毛主席”，是从本民族特有的说唱形式“侗族琵琶歌”来表演的，它歌颂了兄弟民族对领袖的无限感激。四川代表队演出的“坐歌堂”，是流行于川北、川东一带的一种特有的民间歌唱形式，描绘了解放前妇女婚姻不自由的痛苦。黑龙江回族郭莲英唱的“小二黑结婚”选曲，也给人较深的印象。器乐方面，使我们深深地感到各地民间乐曲的丰富。我们不仅听到了一些优美的曲调，更多的是反映了劳动人民的欢乐情绪；同时，在广大群众的基础上，产生了不少出色的人材。像吉林蒙族苏玛的四弦琴独奏“八音梆子”等曲，细腻地表现了蒙族人民的乐观和奔放情绪。河南代表队任清芝的古筝独奏、河北代表队张志友的唢呐独奏“二进宫”、吉林代表队刘占荣的“咔戏”、山东代表队袁子文、魏永堂的横笛二重奏“双合凤”、浙江代表队的民间器乐演奏“万花灯、将军令”、广东代表队的潮州大锣鼓等，真实地传达乐曲的感情，有着相当高的技巧水平，或在演奏上有新的创造。六岁的天才儿童孙玉玺，从四岁开始学二胡，现在能够熟练而准确地拉南胡和京胡的四、五十支曲子了。
    在这次观摩演出中，我们还兴奋地看到广西僮族和侗族的戏曲。这两种民族戏曲都具有深刻的思想内容和质朴的表现形式，是我们民族戏曲中的珍贵财产。僮戏“宝葫芦”，是以该族普遍流传的民间传说编成的，它讽刺了地主阶级奸猾无耻的诡计，被劳动人民拆穿的丑行。这是一出颇有喜剧风味的戏。侗戏“秦娘梅”是一个反映侗族劳动妇女争取婚姻自由，和向地主恶霸进行斗争的故事，情节曲折、动人。它表现了侗族劳动妇女的热爱自由和机智勇敢；也暴露了封建统治阶级的残酷罪行。
    有计划地发掘整理各民族的丰富多采的音乐、舞蹈和戏曲遗产，并在这基础上创造更多的艺术节目，现在还是开始。这项工作，随着农业互助合作运动的蓬勃发展和农民群众对文化艺术生活日益需要，更加显得重要了。在广大农村更广泛和深入一步地开展文化艺术活动以后，将会有更多的优美的民间艺术被发掘和创造出来。
