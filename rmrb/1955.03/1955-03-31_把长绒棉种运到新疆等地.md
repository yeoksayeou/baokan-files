    Long-staple cotton seeds have recently been sent from Nanjing to Xinjiang and other places by plane and train. These are the new varieties, Long-staple No. 1 and Long-staple No. 2, developed by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute over the past few years. These two new varieties have now concluded the general trial planting stage and will officially begin large-scale propagation this year. It is expected that by 1957, long-staple cotton production bases will be gradually established in several major cotton-producing areas across the country.
    Long-staple No. 1 is a superior variety selected from ordinary Delta cotton after breaking the fallacy of the bourgeois scholar Mendel that "good seeds cannot be selected from pure lines." The fiber length generally reaches 40 millimeters and continues to grow.
    Long-staple No. 2 is a hybrid variety selected from cotton seeds originally produced in the Americas and Asian cotton seeds. Large-field trials conducted in various regions last year proved that this variety not only has long fibers but also matures earlier than several representative local cotton varieties.
    Long-staple No. 3, researched and selected by the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, is also nearing success. This is a new variety domesticated from Sea Island cotton. Sea Island cotton originally grows in tropical areas, produces many bolls, and has extra-long fibers, but it is not suitable for planting in central and northern China. Agricultural scientists grafted and cultivated it with our country's existing superior variety, Daizi cotton. After four years of domestication, they finally domesticated a new cotton variety that can adapt to the climate conditions in central and northern China. Its longest fiber reaches 49 millimeters, and generally all are above 40 millimeters, while possessing all the advantages of Daizi cotton.

### 把长绒棉种运到新疆等地

    把长绒棉种运到新疆等地
    一批珍贵的棉花种籽最近自南京由飞机、火车等分别寄到新疆等地。这是华东农业科学研究所几年来研究选育出来的长绒一号和长绒二号两个新品种。这两个新品种现已结束一般试植阶段，今年正式开始大量繁殖。预计到一九五七年，全国几个重要产棉区将逐步建立起长绒棉生产基地。
    长绒一号是打破了资产阶级学者孟德尔的“纯系不能选出好种”的谬论后，从普通的德字棉中选育出来的良种，纤维长度一般达四十公厘，并且还有继续增长的趋势。
    长绒二号是把原产在美洲的棉种同亚洲棉种杂交选育出来的。去年在各地进行大田试种证明，这个品种不但纤维长，而且成熟期也比当地几个具有代表性的棉种都早。
    华东农业科学研究所研究选育的长绒三号也已接近成功，这是驯养海岛棉而成的新品种。海岛棉本来生长在热带地方，结铃多，纤维特长，但不适宜种植于我国中部和北部。农业科学工作者把它和我国现有的良种岱字棉实行嫁接教养，经过四年的驯化，终于驯养成了能适应我国中部、北部气候条件的新棉种。它的纤维最长的达四十九公厘，一般的都在四十公厘以上，同时具有岱字棉的各种优点。
