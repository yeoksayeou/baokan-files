Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 17th: Following U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' atomic war intimidation on the 15th, U.S. President Eisenhower publicly stated at a press conference on the 16th that the United States would use atomic weapons in war. He said that the United States has been manufacturing various types of atomic weapons since the end of World War II.

Eisenhower was obviously considering the strong opposition from people of all countries to the United States' attempt to use this weapon of mass destruction. He deceptively said that the United States would use so-called "tactical" atomic weapons "for purely military targets and in any combat for purely military purposes." He spoke as if atomic weapons could only be used "tactically" without killing civilians. However, people remember that Eisenhower himself admitted at a press conference on January 12th this year that there could not be a significant difference between the tactical and strategic use of atomic weapons.

Eisenhower also mentioned that there is a tendency of "awe" of atomic weapons among the American public. He said that the U.S. authorities are trying to prevent people from being alarmed and are establishing defenses against possible atomic attacks.

    艾森豪威尔主张使用原子武器
    【新华社十七日讯】华盛顿消息：紧接着美国国务卿杜勒斯十五日进行原子战争恫吓以后，美国总统艾森豪威尔十六日又在记者招待会上公然表示，美国要在战争中使用原子武器。他说，美国从第二次世界大战结束以后，一直在制造各种式样的原子武器。
    艾森豪威尔显然是考虑到各国人民对于美国企图使用这种大规模毁灭性武器的强烈反对，他欺骗说，美国将使用所谓“战术”原子武器，“用于纯粹军事目标和用于纯粹军事目的的任何战斗中”。他说得好像原子武器可以仅作“战术”上的使用，而不杀害及平民。然而，人们记得，艾森豪威尔自己在今年一月十二日记者招待会上，曾经承认原子武器的战术和战略使用方面不可能有显著的差别。
    艾森豪威尔还说到，在美国公众中有着一种对原子武器“望而生畏”的趋向。他说，美国当局正在企图使人们不要惊恐，正在建立对可能的原子袭击的防御。
