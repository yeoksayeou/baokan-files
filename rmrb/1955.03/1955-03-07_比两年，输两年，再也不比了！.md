    “Compared for Two Years, Lost for Two Years, Never Comparing Again!”
    Wang Zicun, Zhang Shikui

    On the morning of January 11th, old middle peasant He Zhongyou led a fat, sturdy brindle ox to the Fu'an Agricultural Production Cooperative and said to the stockman, Wei Ren, "Take good care of it, I'll never withdraw from the cooperative again!" This was He Zhongyou's second time joining the cooperative.

    He Zhongyou lived in Qianfangzi Village, Liuyoufang Township, Shangyi County, Hebei Province. In this village, he was considered a well-to-do household, owning 39.5 mu of high-quality irrigated land, two large oxen, and a cart. In 1952, he was a member of Chen Shangkuan's mutual aid team. In 1953, the entire team transitioned into the Fu'an Agricultural Production Cooperative. At that time, only He Zhongyou did not join. He believed that his own land was good, close to the irrigation canal, requiring no fertilizer, and a single watering could guarantee a steady yield of over ten *shi* of grain, making it better than joining the cooperative. He was determined to compete with the cooperative.

    That year, the Fu'an Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded to 145 households. With more people and unified hearts, they sowed the seeds in an organized and timely manner during the spring planting season, and adopted the scientific techniques of ditch application of fertilizer and close planting. He Zhongyou, working alone, couldn't manage both the plowing and the sowing of seeds, let alone worry about techniques. He struggled to get the land planted. When drought hit, insects also appeared; the cooperative's wheat, because of close planting and timely sowing, grew to over a foot tall. The strong seedlings were resistant to the drought, and fewer than one-tenth were killed by insects. He Zhongyou's wheat was in poor condition, not closely planted, sown late, and the seedlings were short and tender, unable to withstand the drought. More than half the seedlings were killed by insects. In the autumn, on the same land quality, separated by only a ridge, the cooperative's 39 mu of wheat yielded an average of over three *dou* per mu; He Zhongyou's ten mu of wheat yielded an average of only one *dou* and nine *sheng* per mu. Throughout the year, his 39 mu of land yielded a total of nine *shi* of grain. After paying the agricultural tax, water fees, and making cotton clothes, using five *shi* of grain, the remaining four *shi* of grain were consumed by his family of five in less than half a year. At that time, they had nothing to eat and were too embarrassed to borrow from others, so they gritted their teeth and sold an ox and a cart. Wei Bin, a member of the Fu'an cooperative, had nothing but 47 mu of poor land. However, that year the cooperative took care of paying the agricultural tax and water fees early, and he received a net distribution of over twelve *shi* of grain. Wei Bin happily said, "Before, when we worked individually, I couldn't compare to He Zhongyou; now that I've joined the cooperative, He Zhongyou can't compare to me!"

    He Zhongyou saw the benefits of the cooperative and signed up to join. But his wife disagreed. On the third day after joining the cooperative, he withdrew again, and "competed" with the cooperative for another year. This was the most painful year for He Zhongyou.

    During the spring water conservation efforts in 1954, the cooperative centralized the use of land, connecting over 3,500 mu of irrigated land into one large area, and organized a water conservation team. They watered the fields in shifts day and night, and completed all the watering early in just eighty labor days. He Zhongyou, working alone, couldn't manage both blocking the dam and cutting the water flow, and struggled to irrigate his land. Within the cooperative's first cultivated area, He Zhongyou had ten mu of interspersed land. When the members of the first production team were watering their fields, they remembered He Zhongyou selling his ox, and everyone said, "If we don't help Old He water these ten mu, the seedlings won't survive, and Old He will sell another ox in the autumn, his family's livelihood will be ruined." So, they watered his ten mu as well. The next day, He Zhongyou saw that the cooperative had thoroughly watered his ten mu, and he felt genuinely ashamed, regretting that he "didn't join the cooperative last year!"

    When the planting season arrived, He Zhongyou's wife fell ill, leaving him with no labor and a lack of farming tools. The cooperative provided a cart and a drill to help him plant his land on time. No matter what difficulties he encountered, the cooperative always enthusiastically helped him solve them; he felt even more that the cooperative was his support. His wife also realized that only by joining the cooperative could they have long-term happiness. After autumn, He Zhongyou heard that the Fu'an cooperative was planning to expand after the harvest. He found the cooperative director, Wei Yue, and said, "I shouldn't have ignored the advice of my fellow villagers. In the past three years, I've lost an ox and a cart. In these three years, I've clearly seen the cooperative. Only joining the cooperative is the broad road that we peasants should take. Will you accept me when I join the cooperative after the harvest?" Wei Yue patted him on the shoulder and said, "The cooperative members have long welcomed you to join!"

    While weeding the fields, He Zhongyou's wife became seriously ill. He couldn't manage both caring for his wife and weeding the fields, and barely managed to weed his 39 mu of land once. Unfortunately, his wife died in July, leaving behind three children, the oldest being ten years old, and the youngest being two years old. He stayed home all day taking care of the children and cooking. As the saying goes, "People deceive the land, and the land deceives people." In 1954, the entire county had a bumper harvest, with the Fu'an cooperative averaging over three *dou* per mu. He, however, still only harvested nine *shi* of grain, averaging two *dou* and four *sheng* per mu. After paying medical bills, water fees, clothing expenses, and agricultural tax, the remaining grain was still not enough for his family of four to eat for a year. Cooperative member Wang Dianzhen fell ill at the end of the spring planting season; the cooperative lent him money and introduced him to the county hospital for treatment. He didn't face difficulties because of his illness. The grain he received wasn't enough to eat, so the cooperative provided him with 500,000 old currency (equivalent to 1,000 *jin* of coarse grain), which was enough for his entire family of seven to eat.

    He Zhongyou said painfully, "I competed with the cooperative for two years, and lost for two years, I will never compete again!"

    “比两年，输两年，再也不比了！”
    王子存　张士奎
    一月十一日早晨，老中农贺中有牵着一条肥胖的大花犍牛，送到富安农业生产合作社，向饲养员魏仁说：“你好好喂吧，我再也不退社啦！”这是贺中有第二次入社了。
    贺中有在河北省尚义县刘油房乡前房子村住。在这个村，他是数一数二的人家，有三十九亩五分上等好水地，两条大犍牛、一辆大车。一九五二年，他是陈尚宽互助组的组员。到一九五三年，全组转入了富安农业生产合作社。当时只有贺中有没有入社。他认为自个地好，靠水渠近，不用上粪，浇一水，十几石粮食稳打，比入社强。他憋着劲和社比高低。
    这年，富安农业生产合作社扩大到一百四十五户，人多心齐，春播时有条不乱地按时播完了种，并且采用了开沟泼粪和密植的科学技术。贺中有一人一手的，顾了扶犁顾不了撒籽，哪顾得上技术不技术，忙忙乱乱地勉强把地种上了。遇上天旱，又起了钻心虫；社里的小麦因为实行了密植，种地又适时，苗秆长到一尺多高，苗子高了秸秆也结实，抗住了旱，虫子咬死的也不到十分之一。贺中有的小麦就差劲了，没有密植，种得又迟，苗子又矮又嫩，抗不住旱，虫子咬死的苗有一半多。秋后，同样地质隔一条地埂的地，社里三十九亩小麦平均每亩打三斗多；贺中有的十亩小麦平均每亩才打一斗九升。全年，他的三十九亩多地总共收了九石来粮食，除了缴公粮、水费、做棉衣，用去五石粮食以外，剩下的四石粮食，全家五口人不到半年就吃完了。当时没得吃，也不好意思向别人借，咬住牙卖掉一条牛、一辆大车。富安社的社员魏斌，除了四十七亩赖地，别的啥也没有。可是，这年社里没用他操心就把公粮、水费早给缴了，净分了十二石多粮食。魏斌喜欢地说：“在前咱单干时比不上贺中有；这会入了社，贺中有可比不上咱啦！”
    贺中有看到了社的好处，也报名入了社。可是他的妻子不同意。入社第三天头上，他又退了社，又和社“比”了一年。这是贺中有最痛心的一年。
    一九五四年春天汇地保墒时，社里土地集中使用，把三千五百多亩水地连成一大片，又组织了汇地组，白天黑夜轮浇，只用了八十个劳动日，全部及早浇完了。贺中有一个人顾了挡坝顾不了切水头，干忙浇不上地。社内第一耕作区内有贺中有的十亩插花地。第一生产队社员们浇地时，想起贺中有卖牛的事，大伙说：“这十亩地要是咱们不帮助老贺浇了，坐不住苗，秋后老贺再卖牛，他一家子的光景可就完了。”说着，就把他的十亩地也浇了。第二天，贺中有看社里给他把十亩地浇得湿沓沓的，心里真有些过不去，恨自己“去年为啥不入社！”
    种地的季节到了，贺中有的老婆得了病，既没劳动力，又缺少农具。社里抽出一辆大车、一张耧，帮助他按时种上了地。无论碰到什么困难，社里总是热情地帮助他解决；他更觉到社是自己的靠身了。自己老婆也体会到：只有入社才能有长远的幸福。入秋以后，贺中有听到富安社准备在秋后扩大，他找到社长魏悦说：“我不该不听乡亲劝说，如今三年的光景，我闹没了一条牛、一辆大车。这三年，我可把社看清楚了。只有入社才是咱们农民应该走的大路。秋后我入社，你们吸收不？”魏悦拍着他的肩膀说：“社员们早就欢迎你入社了！”
    正在锄地时，贺中有妻子病重了。一个人顾了服侍妻子顾不了锄地，勉强把三十九亩多地锄了一遍。不幸他妻子在七月间死去了，留下的三个小孩，顶大的十岁，还有一个两岁的。他就整天在家带孩子做饭。常言说：“人哄地，地就哄人”，一九五四年全县丰收，富安社每亩地平均打三斗多。他却仍然只打九石多粮食，每亩平均二斗四升，除了还药账、水费、穿衣、缴公粮，剩下的粮食又不足全家四口人一年吃。社员王殿珍，春播结束时就病了；社里借给他钱，介绍他到县里卫生院治病，他并没有因为有病遭到困难。他分的粮食不够吃，社里又照顾他旧币五十万元（合一千斤粗粮），全家子七口人足够吃。
    贺中有痛心地说：“我和社比了两年，输了两年，再也不比了！”
