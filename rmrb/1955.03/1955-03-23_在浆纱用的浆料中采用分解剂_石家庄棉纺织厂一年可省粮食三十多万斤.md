By using "water glass" and "caustic soda" as decomposition agents in sizing浆纱 pastes, the cotton textile factories in Shijiazhuang City have achieved successful results. Since adopting this decomposition agent in March, the amount of paste adhering to the warp during sizing has been reduced, generally below the 10% target. The state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has reduced it to 5.5%, the local state-owned Shijiazhuang Textile Factory to 7.5%, and the jointly state-private Da Xing Textile Factory to around 8%. These three factories can save more than 345,000 jin of grain annually for the state which could be used for sizing paste.

The application of "water glass" and "caustic soda" as decomposition agents in sizing pastes is an advanced Soviet experience in reducing sizing rates. After applying this method, the cotton textile factories in Shijiazhuang City not only saved a large amount of grain but also greatly reduced sizing costs. For example, the sizing cost per bolt of cloth at the jointly state-private Da Xing Textile Factory was reduced by 48.9% compared to the past; simply by eliminating tallow, they can save 34,000 yuan annually. At the same time, there are also fewer warp yarn breakages after sizing.

### 在浆纱用的浆料中采用分解剂  石家庄棉纺织厂一年可省粮食三十多万斤

    在浆纱用的浆料中采用分解剂
    石家庄棉纺织厂一年可省粮食三十多万斤
    石家庄市各棉纺织厂在浆纱用的浆料中用“水玻璃”和“火碱”作分解剂，已经试验成功。三月份，各厂采用这种分解剂以后，经纱上浆时沾在纱上的浆都减少了，一般都低于百分之十的指标。国营石家庄第一棉纺织厂已降到百分之五点五，地方国营石家庄纺织厂降低到百分之七点五，公私合营大兴纺织厂降低到百分之八左右。这三个厂全年可为国家节约作浆料用的粮食三十四万五千多斤。
    在浆纱用的浆料中应用“水玻璃”和“火碱”作分解剂，是苏联降低上浆率的先进经验。石家庄市各棉纺织厂应用这一个方法后，不但节约了大量的粮食，还大大降低了上浆成本。如公私合营大兴纺织厂每匹布的浆料费用比过去降低了百分之四十八点九，只取消牛油一种浆料，全年就可节约三万四千元。同时浆出来的经纱断头也少了。
