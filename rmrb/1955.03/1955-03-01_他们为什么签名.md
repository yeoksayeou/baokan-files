    Why They Signed
    By Our Correspondent Ge Xian
    To oppose the use of atomic weapons by American imperialism, the railway worker Ma Bin's entire family of nine signed the "Appeal to the People of the World."
    One Sunday morning, I visited this family in Fengtai. When I arrived at their home, the whole family was making mutton dumplings. While making dumplings, everyone talked about the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. In the conversation, almost everyone spoke of the suffering they had endured in the past and the happiness they now enjoy, using these personal experiences to show why they oppose the use of atomic weapons by American imperialism.
    Ma Bin is an experienced locomotive driver, now working as a locomotive duty officer at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Administration. More than two years ago, he participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea on the Korean battlefield, and he witnessed the suffering that the war brought to the Korean people. There, Ma Bin met a good Korean friend named Li Renhuan. Li Renhuan's parents, wife, and children all died in the war. He greatly envied Ma Bin's family and often told Ma Bin about his previous family life. However, this friend heroically sacrificed himself in a transportation mission. Ma Bin said, "The War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea tested me and educated my whole family." Therefore, he signed the "Appeal to the People of the World."
    Ma Bin's father is a 65-year-old retired railway worker, now retired and living at home. He started by talking about the invasion of Beijing by the "Eight-Nation Alliance." During that time, his father was killed by the imperialist army. At only nine years old, he began a life of hardship. Later, he worked on the railway, enduring hunger for more than forty years. Only after liberation was his life guaranteed. He said, "I am now enjoying my old age, and I will never let American imperialism invade us again!"
    Ma Bin's mother, a very talkative old lady, said, "We are not afraid of American imperialism using atomic bombs! However, we all hope for peaceful construction and to follow the general line to socialism." Ma Bin's wife introduced the old lady's life after liberation: she went to the Western Suburbs Park to see elephants, to the Soviet Exhibition Center to see machines, and to Tiananmen Square to watch parades on "May Day" and "National Day." She said: My mom is so happy after liberation! It is for this reason that the old lady signed her name.
    Ma Bin's wife is already the mother of two children and recently had a check-up at the railway hospital. Her third child will be born soon. For the sake of her children, she signed her name.
    Ma Bin's younger brother, sister-in-law, sister who is studying in middle school, and two children who are just starting to understand things, all signed their names for their own reasons.
    This family has suffered all kinds of hardships, and now they are enjoying happiness. They hope to live a happy socialist life in the future and realize their own hopes of becoming engineers, entering universities, and other ideals. To defend their peaceful life, all nine members of their family raced to sign their names, expressing their firm will to resolutely oppose atomic weapons.

    他们为什么签名
    本报记者　葛娴
    为了反对美帝国主义使用原子武器，铁路工人马斌全家九口人都在“告全世界人民书”上签了名。
    一个星期日的早晨，记者在丰台访问了这个家庭。当我去他家时，全家人正在包羊肉饺子。大家一边包饺子，一边谈起了反对使用原子武器签名运动的事情。在谈话中，差不多每个人都讲到过去遭受的苦难和现在享受的幸福，用这些切身的经历来表明他们是为什么反对美帝国主义使用原子武器。
    马斌是个有经验的机车司机，现在北京铁路管理局丰台机务段做机务值班员。两年多以前，他曾在朝鲜战场上参加过抗美援朝的斗争，他亲眼看见战争给朝鲜人民带来的苦难。在那里，马斌认识了一个很好的朝鲜朋友李任焕。李任焕的父母妻儿都在战争中牺牲了，他非常羡慕马斌的家庭，也经常向马斌叙述他以前的家庭生活。但是，这个朋友在一次运输中英勇牺牲了。马斌说：“抗美援朝斗争考验了我自己，也教育了我全家。”因此，他在“告全世界人民书”上签了名。
    马斌的父亲，是个六十五岁的铁路老工人，现在退休在家里养老。他从“八国联军”侵略北京讲起，那次，他的父亲被帝国主义军队打死了，只有九岁的他，便开始了苦难的生活。以后，在铁路上做工，忍饥挨饿过了四十多年。直到解放后，他的生活才有了保障。他说：“我现在养老享福了，决不让美帝国主义再来侵略我们！”
    马斌的妈妈，是个很健谈的老太太，她说：“美帝国主义打原子弹，我们才不怕！不过我们都希望和平建设，跟着总路线到社会主义。”马斌的爱人介绍了老太太在解放后的生活：一个人到西郊公园看大象，到苏联展览馆看机器，“五一”“十一”还要到天安门看游行。她说：我妈在解放后可乐啦！就是为了这个原因，老太太签了名。
    马斌的爱人已经是两个孩子的母亲，前几天才在铁路医院检查了身体，她的第三个孩子很快就要出世。为了孩子，她签了名。
    马斌的弟弟、弟媳妇、在中学读书的妹妹和两个刚懂事的孩子，都为了各自的理由，完全签了名。
    这一家人，遭受过各种苦难，现在才享受到幸福，他们更希望将来能过美满的社会主义生活，实现他们自己希望当工程师、进大学以及其他的理想。为了保卫和平生活，他们全家九口，争先签名，表示坚决反对原子武器的坚决意志。
