Continue to Promote the Enthusiasm of the Masses and Open Up New Oil Sources

To the Editor:

Recently, the work of opening up new oil sources has aroused widespread attention throughout the country, and the people of various places have provided many valuable suggestions, demonstrating their enthusiastic concern for the national construction cause. From July 1954 to February 1955, we received a total of 62 letters from various places (including those forwarded by the People's Daily and various departments) from the masses, providing 47 kinds of new oil sources. Adding the new oil source varieties discovered by the local oil companies, there are 54 kinds, most of which are wild plants, such as tung tree seeds, locust beans, ailanthus seeds, camphor tree seeds, tea tree seeds, rice bran, loofah seeds, waxberry pits, and so on. Many of these new oilseed varieties have been successfully tested and have begun to be purchased and processed. Such as: rice bran oil, camphor seed oil, silkworm pupa oil, ailanthus seed oil, knotweed seed oil, pepper seed oil, tea tree seed oil, etc. In the 1954 fiscal year, according to statistics from 14 provinces and cities including Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, oil production increased by more than 8,000 tons, worth approximately 7.7 million yuan (new currency). In 1954, Wuhan produced 1,051 tons of rice bran oil. In addition to supplying the needs of the city, more than 100 tons were transferred to Shanghai and Guangzhou, and nearly 200 tons were transferred to rural areas for lamp oil. Other products such as silkworm pupa oil in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have also solved part of the oil supply problem.

The new oil source varieties proposed in the letters from the masses are multifaceted. Some people also sent samples and introduced local methods of extracting oil from certain oilseeds. However, due to the different yields of new varieties of oilseeds in different places, and the different conditions for purchase and processing, it is necessary to conduct research based on the specific conditions of each place to determine the scope of processing. For example, rice bran oil, because rice bran is the main feed for pigs, it is not suitable for processing in some small cities and rural areas, and can only be used in cities where rice bran cannot be processed. The processing of certain varieties is also limited by processing capacity, technical conditions, and economic value. For example, watermelon seeds and pumpkin seeds, in the case of our country's current lack of hulling machines, there are various difficulties in extracting oil from melon seeds. If manual hulling is used, the cost will increase, and if oil is extracted with the skin, the oil yield will be very low.

We believe that we should continue to promote the enthusiasm of the masses in exploring new oil sources. Local oil companies should also continue to collect new oilseed varieties with the assistance of the masses, conduct careful research, select and process them, increase oil production, and improve the supply of edible and industrial oils.

    继续发扬群众的积极性，开辟新油源编辑同志：
    近来，开辟新油源的工作已经在全国范围内引起广泛的重视，各地人民群众提供了许多可贵的建议，表现了他们对国家建设事业的热忱关怀。从一九五四年七月份到一九五五年二月，我们共收到各地（包括人民日报和各部门转来的）群众来信六十二件，提供新油源的品种有四十七种。加上各地油脂公司发现的新油源品种，达五十四种，其中绝大部分是野生植物，如梧桐籽、槐树豆、椿树籽、樟树籽、茶树籽、米糠、丝瓜子、杨梅核等等。这些新的油料品种，有不少已经试验成功并且开始收购和榨制。如：米糠油、樟树籽油、蚕蛹油、椿树籽油、木蓼籽油、花椒籽油、茶叶树籽油等。在一九五四年度内，据武汉、北京、上海、浙江、江苏等十四个省市的统计，油的产量增加了八千余吨，价值约七百余万元（新币）。武汉市在一九五四年内，生产了米糠油一千零五十一吨，除了供应本市的需要外，还调出了一百多吨，供应了上海和广州，调出近二百吨，供应农村作灯油。其他如浙江、江苏两省的蚕蛹油等，也都解决了部分油的供应问题。
    群众来信中提出的新油源的品种是多方面的，有些群众还寄来样品，介绍了当地用某种油料榨油的方法。但是由于各地新品种的油料的产量不一，收购和榨制的条件也不相同，所以必须根据各地具体情况，进行研究，确定榨制的范围。如米糠油，因为米糠是喂猪的主要饲料，所以在一些小城市和农村中就不宜榨制，只能在米糠无法处理的城市中采用。还有某些品种的榨制，受到加工能力、技术条件和经济价值的限制。如西瓜子、北瓜子等，在我国目前缺乏克皮机的情况下，榨制瓜子，也有种种困难，如果利用人工克皮费用就会加大，如果带皮榨油，出油率就很低。
    我们认为应该继续发扬群众发掘新油源的积极性。各地油脂公司还应该继续在群众的协助下，搜集新的油料品种，认真研究，采择榨制，增加油的产量，改进食油和工业用油的供应状况。
