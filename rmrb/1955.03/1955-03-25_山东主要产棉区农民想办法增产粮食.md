Farmers in the Liaocheng Special District, a major cotton-producing area in Shandong Province, are taking measures such as selecting improved varieties and increasing the planting of high-yield crops to increase grain production in order to reduce the state's grain supply to the area.

This year, the cotton planting area in Liaocheng Special District is planned to expand by 560,000 mu compared to last year. Coupled with the increased planting of oil crops such as peanuts and sesame, the planting area for grain crops will decrease by more than 817,200 mu compared to last year. In order to strive for increased production of cotton, grain, and oil crops, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the special district have conducted thorough research when formulating this year's agricultural production plans. They plan to replace some of the lower-yielding sorghum and other miscellaneous grain crops with high-yielding crops such as corn, dry rice, and millet, and expand the planting area of improved grain crop varieties. Farmers in various places are now exchanging improved varieties. According to statistics from thirty-two townships in Qingping, Linqing, Boping, and Shouzhang counties, the improved varieties of various grain crops exchanged by farmers, plus the seeds selected and retained by farmers themselves, can enable the area of improved varieties in spring-sown grain crops to reach more than 80 percent. The yield of these improved varieties is generally more than 10 percent higher than local varieties.

This year, the entire special district will promote the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato on 400,000 mu and increase the planting of high-yield crops such as corn, dry rice, and millet by more than 316,800 mu. According to typical surveys in various counties, these crops produce twenty-five to one hundred and thirty jin more per mu than sorghum and other miscellaneous grain crops. It is estimated that in addition to increasing the production of ginned cotton by more than 17.1 million jin and oil by more than 21.67 million jin compared to last year, the total grain output of the entire special district can be equivalent to last year's bumper harvest level.

    山东主要产棉区农民想办法增产粮食
    山东省主要产棉区聊城专区农民，正采取选用良种、增种高产作物等办法来增产粮食，以减少国家对这个地区的粮食供应。
    今年聊城专区的植棉面积计划比去年扩大五十六万亩，加上增种花生、芝麻等油料作物，粮食作物的种植面积将比去年减少八十一万七千二百多亩。为了争取棉花、粮食、油料都能增产，这个专区的农业生产合作社和互助组在制定今年农业生产计划时都作了通盘的研究。他们计划把一部分产量较低的高粱和其他杂粮作物改种玉米、旱稻、谷子等高产作物，并扩大粮食作物良种的种植面积。现在各地农民正在互换良种。据清平、临清、博平、寿张等县三十二个乡的统计，农民互换的各种粮食作物的良种加上农民自己选留的种籽，可使春播粮食作物中良种面积达到百分之八十以上。这些良种的产量一般都高出当地品种百分之十以上。
    今年全专区将推广“胜利百号”地瓜四十万亩，增种玉米、旱稻、谷子等高产作物三十一万六千八百多亩。据各县典型调查：这些作物比高粱和其他杂粮作物每亩多产二十五斤到一百三十斤。预计全专区除了将比去年增产一千七百一十多万斤皮棉和二千一百六十七万斤油料外，粮食总产量可相当于去年的丰收水平。　　（新华社）
