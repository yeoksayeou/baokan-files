Editor's note: This article briefly discusses the significant role of the Soviet court in consolidating labor discipline, combating criminal offenses such as hooliganism and theft, protecting socialist property, and conducting socialist and legal education for the masses. China's people's courts are currently undertaking similar tasks to those of the Soviet court. To enable China's people's courts to effectively learn from the advanced experiences of the Soviet court and to allow the Chinese people to correctly understand the tasks and roles of the revolutionary court, we have excerpted and published this article.

    The Educational Role of the Soviet Court
    Soviet Union Bié Zūgéluòfū

The spiritual outlook of Soviet people is beautiful, and their moral qualities are noble. Under socialist conditions, with unbreakable spiritual and political unity and the fraternal friendship of all Soviet nationalities, Soviet people are constantly improving themselves in their labor for the benefit of the people, becoming truly new and most advanced people of modern times.

However, we must not forget that there are still some people in our society who retain remnants of bourgeois ideology in their minds. These remnants of the past, or the vestiges of capitalism as they are commonly called, include non-socialist attitudes toward labor and public property, the idea of seeking personal gain at public expense, parasitism, individualism, selfishness, indifference, lack of concern for others, alcoholism, and other shortcomings. The existence of these vestiges of capitalism hinders the progress of communist construction.

The main method of fighting the "stains" of the past is persuasion. The Communist Party tirelessly cultivates the noble moral qualities of the Soviet people. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League, and other social organizations all play a significant role in conducting communist education for the working people. Schools, newspapers, radio, film, literature, and art also serve this most important cause.

In addition to persuasion, the Soviet state also adopts coercive measures against those who are deeply affected by the vestiges of capitalism. The Soviet court is the organ that enforces coercive measures in the name of the state against those who violate the socialist legal system. The strength of the Soviet court lies primarily in its tremendous educational role for the broad masses; in that it—in contrast to bourgeois courts—helps cultivate in people a new attitude toward the state, socialist property, labor, and the family.

One of the most important tasks of the Soviet court is to fight for the consolidation of labor discipline.

There are still people (including young people) who are late for work, absent, and become those who only pursue high salaries in search of an "easy life"—running from one enterprise to another, etc. When a worker is absent from work, it can hinder the work of the entire production team, group, or workshop, preventing the plan from being completed. Because of one person, a huge collective, an entire enterprise, can suffer losses.

Once, at a certain port, the captain of a merchant ship did not go to work for several days without any legitimate reason, so the ship had to stay there and could not sail according to schedule. The cargo was left untransferred, and the sailors had to sit idle, which brought material losses to the state. Naturally, the captain's behavior was criminal and could not go unpunished.

Violations of labor discipline are often caused by alcoholism. Workers who come to factories, mines, or construction sites while still drunk often violate technical safety regulations.

People's assessors are frequent guests at various enterprises. They go to enterprises to understand working conditions, study the causes of violations of labor discipline, take measures to eliminate these causes, explain labor laws to workers, give reports, hold seminars, and participate in discussions on labor discipline issues.

Our courts play a significant role in educating Soviet people with a genuine communist attitude towards socialist property—the sacred and inviolable foundation of the socialist system. Millions of Soviet people recognize the interests of the whole people. But there are still people who seek happiness for themselves by harming the interests of the state, benefiting themselves at the expense of the people. These thieves, swindlers, and petty thieves of socialist property are enemies of the people. The Soviet court severely punishes those who infringe upon socialist property.

The court's activities are not limited to punishing criminals. After carefully studying the various materials of the case, the court determines the causes of theft—poor material registration, lack of necessary storage for goods, leniency from superiors, etc., and takes measures to eliminate these shortcomings.

For example, after the court tried a case of infringement on the property of a collective farm, it became clear that the warehouse manager Karpov was able to steal for a long time because no one cared about the accounting books of this collective farm. The court notified the district executive committee of its opinion, and the latter took measures, thereby improving the accounting work of the collective farm.

The important significance of the court's judgments in this type of case lies in its ability to help create a moral atmosphere among workers and peasants: an atmosphere that prevents theft from happening again, making it impossible for thieves and plunderers of people's wealth to survive.

In our country, people are the most valuable asset of the Party and the state. The Soviet court strictly protects the lives, health, honor, and property of citizens. To fulfill the wishes of the working people, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union formulated a decree on April 30, 1954, which allows courts to impose the death penalty on those who deliberately commit serious acts of violence. This decree once again proves that in our country, the safety of people's lives is of great concern.

In our country, socialist norms of public life have been established, filled with respect for people, for comrades, colleagues, and classmates, for their labor, rights, and property, and with warm concern for them.

But can we say that everyone abides by the socialist norms of public life very well? No, we cannot say that. Unfortunately, we can still encounter ugly phenomena such as hooliganism, which cause great harm to the lives of the Soviet people.

Hooligans hinder beneficial labor and good rest. How ugly it is for a reckless hooligan to make trouble in a residence or organization! How disgusting it is for a drunken "hero" to shamelessly harass pedestrians on the street, or to pick on young girls in parks or skating rinks!

The Soviet court treats hooliganism as a serious crime.

Twenty-three-year-old Kozlov often made trouble in residential areas, harassed pedestrians, argued with people, and sang vulgar songs. One evening, just as residents were going to the club to watch a movie, he broke into the hall while drunk, smashed light bulbs and window glass, cursed people, and beat up the audience. The movie could not be watched. A hooligan disrupted the work of the club and prevented many employees from resting—they originally planned to spend their evening at the club. Was it not correct for the court to severely punish Kozlov? Of course, it was correct.

Consolidating healthy marital and family relations is also an important task of the court. The Soviet family is a close-knit collective of people whose family interests and social interests are unified. The Soviet court, on the one hand, consolidates the marriage registration system, and at the same time resolutely prevents any rash behavior in dissolving marriage contracts.

Undeniably, some comrades are skeptical of the court's role in divorce cases, believing that going through the court is merely a formality. But life itself proves that if the court seriously handles divorce cases from the state's standpoint, then its activities can have very good results.

There was such a case: A young woman went to court to request a divorce, on the grounds that the two parties "did not get along." The husband also agreed. The court had a formal basis for approving this application. It was a very simple matter to make such a decision. But not granting a divorce—that was much more complicated.

Before the trial, the judge had a long conversation with the couple. After questioning the witnesses in court, it was finally confirmed that they did not have important reasons for dissolving the marriage. It turned out that the wife submitted the application to the court immediately after a dispute. After calming down, she regretted it, but felt embarrassed to withdraw her application. The husband, fearing that it would damage his "dignity," was unwilling to propose reconciliation. When they came to the court, the white-haired people's assessor sincerely and fatherly pointed out their unserious attitude towards each other, especially their unserious attitude towards their son. They were both ashamed. After hearing the assessor's question, "Are you willing to reconcile?" the wife apologized and requested the court to treat her application as if it had not been received. As a result, the husband took her hand and went to the store to buy a gift for their son. The family was preserved.

Now this couple lives harmoniously and happily, and they are very grateful when they think of the court. Many such examples can be cited.

If parents do not provide material assistance to their children, the court forces them to pay alimony. If parents who are engaged in education do not pay attention to disciplining their children, causing them to engage in hooliganism or other acts that disrupt social order, it is entirely correct for the court to publicize these matters.

The Soviet court often uses the following punishment methods prescribed by law, such as re-education through labor without deprivation of liberty, public reprimands without deprivation of liberty, and fines, etc.; this enables the punished to deeply recognize their guilt and, under the influence of the measures taken by the court and public opinion, correct their mistakes. This once again illustrates that the main focus of the court's work is to reform people.

The educational significance of the Soviet court's activities not only affects the defendant, but the open trials of the court and the court's judgments also have a considerable impact on other citizens present or those who see news of the trial process in publications. The court's open trials make citizens more clearly aware of the harm caused by criminals to the state and society, make them more deeply aware of the solemnity of Soviet law, and increase their vigilance.

In order to expand its educational influence, the court, when necessary, also tries cases in the district, enterprise, or collective farm where the crime occurred or where the defendant works.

The judgments made by the court often become discussion materials for production meetings, trade union meetings, and Communist Youth League meetings, and at these meetings, specific measures are formulated to further consolidate the socialist legal system and improve educational work.

The work reports made by judges to their voters are also of great educational significance. In order to support the court, voters help the court correct its shortcomings and improve its work level. Every day, voters go to the court to complain about the improper behavior of certain people, and sometimes they go to the court just to offer their suggestions.

The active participation of people's assessors in the work of the court further strengthens the connection between the court and the people. People's assessors participate in the work of state management, perform their duties in court, they are active social activists, and promoters of the socialist legal system.

The work of Soviet judges is glorious and the responsibility is heavy. Our people have high demands on them. They must not only be familiar with their work, but also ensure that their every word and deed is irreproachable, so that they have the right to interrogate others not only legally, but also morally.

### 苏维埃法庭的教育作用

    编者按：本文简要地论述了苏维埃法庭在巩固劳动纪律、打击流氓盗匪的刑事犯罪行为、保护社会主义财产、对人民群众进行社会主义教育和守法教育等各方面的重大作用。我国的人民法庭，现在也在担负着同苏维埃法庭相类似的任务。为使我国人民法庭有效地学习苏维埃法庭的先进经验，并使我国人民群众正确了解革命法庭的任务和作用，特将本文节译发表。
    苏维埃法庭的教育作用
    苏联  别祖格洛夫    
    苏维埃人的精神面貌是美好的，他们的道德品质是高尚的。在社会主义条件下，在精神上政治上牢不可破的团结一致和苏联各民族兄弟般的友爱的情况下，苏维埃人在为人民谋福利的劳动中，不断地提高自己成为现代的真正新型的最先进的人。
    但是我们不应该忘记，我们的社会中间还有一些人，在他们的意识里还保留着资产阶级思想的残余。这些过去的残余，或者如通常所说的资本主义遗毒，就是对劳动和公共财产的非社会主义态度、假公济私、不劳而食的思想、个人主义、自私自利、冷酷无情、对他人不关心、嗜酒以及其他缺点。这类资本主义遗毒的存在，妨碍着共产主义建设的进行。
    同过去的“污点”进行斗争的主要方法是说服。共产党不倦地培育着苏维埃人的高尚道德品质。工会、共青团及其他社会团体，在对劳动人民进行共产主义教育中都起着巨大的作用。学校、报刊、广播、电影、文学和艺术，也都为目前这一最重要的事业服务。
    除了说服方法以外，苏维埃国家对受资本主义遗毒很深的人，还采取强制手段。苏维埃法庭就是以国家名义对社会主义法律制度的破坏者实行强制手段的机关。苏维埃法庭的力量，首先在于它对广大群众的巨大的教育作用；在于它——和资产阶级的法庭相反——有助于培养人们对国家、对社会主义财产、对劳动和对家庭的新态度。
    苏维埃法庭的最重要任务之一，是为巩固劳动纪律而斗争。
    还有这样的人（其中也包括青年人），他们上班迟到，旷工，为了寻求“轻松的生活”而变成只追求高薪金的人——从一个企业跑到另一个企业去工作等等。一个工人旷工，就能阻碍整个生产队、小组或车间的工作，使计划不能完成。由于一个人的缘故，就会使巨大的集体，使整个企业受到损失。
    有一次在某一个港口，一条商船的船长没有什么正当理由而一连几天没有上班，因而轮船不得不停在那里，不能依照航期行驶。货物放着没有转运，水手们也不得不闲坐着，这给国家带来了物质损失。自然，船长的这种行为是犯罪的，不能不受到处罚。
    对劳动纪律的破坏，往往是由于酗酒而引起的。工人由于酒醉未醒就到工厂、矿场或建筑工地工作，时常违反技术安全规程。
    人民审判员是各个企业的经常客人。他们到企业去了解工作条件，研究引起破坏劳动纪律的原因，采取消灭这些原因的措施，他们向工人讲解劳动法，作报告，开座谈会，参加有关劳动纪律问题的讨论。
    我们的法庭在教育苏联人以真正的共产主义态度对待社会主义财产——社会主义制度神圣不可侵犯的基础——方面的作用是很大的。千百万的苏联人民对全民的利益是有认识的。可是还有这样的人，他们靠损害国家的利益来为自己谋取幸福，损害人民而自己获利。这些社会主义财产的盗窃者，骗子和小偷是人民的敌人。苏维埃法庭对侵害社会主义财产的人，是严厉惩办的。
    法庭的活动不仅限于惩罚犯人。法庭细心研究了案件的各种材料以后，就确定出引起盗窃事件的原因——物资的登记工作做的不好，商品缺乏必要的保管，上级的纵容不管等，并且采取措施以消除这些缺点。
    例如法庭审讯了一件关于侵犯集体农庄财产的案件后，就明白了仓库管理员卡尔波夫之所以能够长期地偷东西，是因为这个集体农庄的会计帐目无人过问。法庭把自己的意见通知区执行委员会，后者采取了措施，因而这个集体农庄的会计工作整顿好了。
    法庭对这一类案件的判决的重要意义，在于能够帮助我们在工人和农民中造成这样一种道德气氛：这种气氛可使盗窃行为不再发生，使得小偷和人民财富的盗窃者不能生存下去。
    在我们国家里，人——这是党和国家最宝贵的财产。苏维埃法庭严格地保护公民的生命、健康、名誉和财产。为满足劳动人民的愿望，苏联最高苏维埃主席团在一九五四年四月三十日制定了一项法令，这项法令允许法庭对蓄意行凶、情节严重者处以死刑。这个法令又一次证明，在我国，人民生命的安全是受到极大关怀的。
    在我国已经确立了社会主义的公共生活准则，这种准则充满了人对人的尊敬，对同志、同事、同学的尊敬，对他们的劳动、权利和他们的财产的尊重，对他们温暖的关怀。
    可是我们能够说，社会主义的公共生活准则，所有的人都遵守得很好吗？不，不能够这样说。可惜得很，我们还可以碰到如流氓行为等这种丑恶现象，它给苏联人民的生活带来很大害处。
    流氓妨碍有益的劳动和良好的休息。一个无所顾忌的流氓，在住宅或机关里胡闹，是多么丑恶啊！一个醉醺醺的“英雄”，无耻地在街道上纠缠行人，或者在公园、在溜冰场找少女的岔子，是多么令人作呕啊！
    苏维埃法庭是把流氓行为当作一种严重的犯罪行为来审判的。
    二十三岁的科兹洛夫经常在住宅区捣乱，纠缠行人，和人吵架，唱粗俗的歌曲。有一天傍晚，正当居民到俱乐部看电影的时候，他喝得醉醺醺的，潜进大厅，打碎了电灯泡和窗玻璃，骂人并且殴打观众。电影看不成了。一个流氓就破坏了俱乐部的工作，妨碍了很多职工的休息——他们原来打算到俱乐部来渡过自己的傍晚的。难道法庭严厉处分科兹洛夫是不正确的么？当然是正确的。
    巩固健康的家庭婚姻关系，也是法庭的重要任务。苏联的家庭是人们的亲密的集体，他们的家庭利益和社会利益是统一的。苏维埃法庭一方面巩固婚姻的登记制度，同时坚决制止对解除婚约的任何轻率行为。
    无可讳言，有一些同志是怀疑法庭在离婚案件上的作用的，他们认为经过法庭只不过是形式上的手续而已。可是生活本身证明：如果法庭是严肃地站在国家立场来处理离婚案件的话，那么它的活动就能有很好的效果。
    有过这么一回事：一个青年妇女到法庭请求离婚，理由是双方“性格不合”。丈夫也同意了。法庭是有正式的根据来批准这个申请的。要采取这样的决定是很简单的一件事。而不准离婚——这却是复杂得多了。
    审判员在开庭审判前曾和这一对夫妇作过长谈。在法庭上讯问了证人以后，最后证实他们并没有解除婚姻的重要理由。原来妻子是在发生了一次争执以后马上向法庭呈递申请书的，在情绪安定下来以后，她懊悔了，但又感到撤回自己的申请书很难为情。而丈夫呢，害怕有损自己的“尊严”，不愿提出重归于好。当他们来到法庭的时候，白发苍苍的人民审判员真挚地父亲般地指出他们彼此相处的不严肃态度，尤其是对待儿子的态度很不严肃。他们两个都感到惭愧。听见审判员“你们愿意重归于好吗”的问话后，妻子道了歉，并请求法庭当作没有接到她的申请书。结果，丈夫挽着她的手一同到商店里买了一件礼物送给儿子。家庭被保存下来了。
    现在这一对夫妇生活得很融洽、很幸福，他们想起法庭来就很感激。这样的例子是可以援引许多的。
    如果做父母的对儿女不予以物质上的帮助，法庭就强迫他们付给抚养费。如果担任教育工作的父母，不注意管教自己的孩子，以致他们发生了流氓行为或其他破坏社会秩序的行为，则法庭把这些事情公开发表，是完全正确的。
    苏维埃法庭时常运用法律所规定的下列的惩罚办法。如不剥夺公民自由的带感化性的劳动，不剥夺自由的舆论的责难及罚款等；这使受惩罚者有可能深刻地认识自己的罪过，在法庭所采取的处分手段及社会舆论的影响下，改正自己的错误。这再一次说明了法庭的工作主要是在于对人们实行改造。
    苏维埃法庭活动的教育意义不仅是对被告有所影响，法庭的公开审讯和法庭的判决，无论对于在场的或是在刊物上看到审判过程消息的其他公民的影响，也是不小的。法庭的公开审讯使公民们更清楚地明白犯人给国家和社会造成的损害，使他们更深刻地体会到苏维埃法律的严正性，而提高自己的警惕。
    法庭为了扩大教育影响，在必要时，还到发生犯罪行为或被告工作的区、企业或集体农庄审理案件。
    法庭所作的判决，时常成为生产会议、工会会议及共青团会议的讨论材料，在这些会议上，订出进一步巩固社会主义法律制度，改善教育工作的具体措施。
    审判员向选民所做的工作报告，也有很大的教育意义。选民为了支持法庭，他们帮助法庭改正缺点，提高工作水平。每天都有选民到法庭去申诉某些人的不正当的行为，而有时候他们到法庭去只是为了提出自己的建议。
    人民陪审员积极地参加法庭的工作，这更能密切法庭和人民的联系。人民陪审员参加国家的管理工作，执行自己在法庭上的职责，他们是积极的社会活动家，是社会主义法律制度的传导者。
    苏联审判员的工作是光荣的，责任是重大的。我国人民对他们的要求是很高的。他们不但要熟悉自己的业务，而且要做到自己的一言一行都是无可责难的，以便不但在法律上，而且在道德上，他们都有权力去审讯他人。
