Investigation Report on the Incident of Pulling Up Water Chestnut Seedlings in Hang County
This Newspaper Reader Letters Department

Every August is the season for farmers in Hang County to plant water chestnuts. The water chestnuts here are characterized by their large size, thin skin, and high water content, and have always been welcomed by consumers in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Farmers' income from water chestnuts is second only to rice and sericulture. Therefore, local farmers attach great importance to this economic crop, which accounts for the third largest share of rural income.

On August 1, 1954, the Party and government leading organs of Hang County held two meetings and decided that the whole county should not grow water chestnuts, but should instead plant double-cropping early rice. The county party committee enlarged meeting stipulated that Siwei District should change to planting 18,800 mu, Sandun District 7,000 mu, Pingyao District 8,000 mu, Dongtang District 4,400 mu, and Qitang District 1,800 mu. However, when this task was put forward at the county-wide labor model symposium, the vast majority of labor models present disagreed. They pointed out: planting water chestnuts has been a habit of farmers for decades, and all the seedlings have been cultivated. Farmers will not agree to change this habit and destroy the seedlings; moreover, the income from water chestnuts is much higher than that from rice! Secondly, to change to planting double-cropping early rice, the season is already late, and farmers have no planting habits. Can double-cropping rice be guaranteed to have a harvest? However, these opinions did not attract the attention of the county party committee. The county party committee secretary, Zhang Shusen, emphasized in his report: education must be combined with laws, and said that farmers are conservative. If there are really stubborn farmers who refuse to pull up water chestnuts and plant double-cropping early rice, then they will not be supplied with food rations and let them eat water chestnuts.

After the county party committee enlarged meeting ended, nine county party committee members, according to the spirit of the county party committee enlarged meeting, went to various districts to lead the work of changing planting. At that time, some district and township cadres, hearing that they were asked to pull up water chestnuts and change to planting double-cropping early rice, could not understand it ideologically. Zheng Atang, deputy head of Zhangqiao Township in Siwei District, said angrily: "Destroying water chestnut seedlings is a practice that is divorced from the masses, is detrimental to the people, and will be opposed by the masses." After the county party committee heard the reflections from below, instead of considering whether its own decision was wrong, on the contrary, it blamed those cadres who were "ideologically unconvinced" at the cadre meeting for not having the spirit of communism and not daring to "create" boldly. Deputy county head Li Guangxin criticized the cadres' "passive" and "fearful" thinking and said: "Whether the cadres' socialist consciousness is high or not, this movement is a practical test." This forced cadres to take the road of commandism.

After August 5, all district and township cadres, under the coercion of the county party committee, were mobilized. Districts successively held district party committee enlarged meetings, district and township cadre meetings, rural party member meetings, and township mass meetings. From top to bottom, from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, the county party committee's decision was deployed and implemented at all levels, and it was required to act immediately. The Hang County Agriculture and Forestry Department, under the instruction of county leaders, put forward the extremely absurd so-called nine major sufferings of planting water chestnuts, such as saying that planting water chestnuts is not beneficial to the country and the people, planting water chestnuts requires people to suffer in hot weather and cold weather, eating too many water chestnuts will cause stomach pain, etc., and asked district and township cadres to mobilize the masses to complain about the "suffering of water chestnuts." Later, Deputy County Head Li Guangxin said several times: It is necessary to resolutely "eliminate water chestnuts" and change to planting double-cropping early rice; if water chestnuts cannot be pulled up and double-cropping early rice cannot be planted, township cadres will be held responsible. After the order was issued, rural cadres were forced: "to completely eliminate water chestnuts and ensure the completion of the task."

From August 6 to August 9, in just four days, the water chestnut seedlings that could be planted on more than 40,000 mu of land in the county were all pulled up.

After the water chestnut seedlings were pulled up, the county party committee was afraid that they were not pulled up thoroughly enough, and instructed rural cadres to organize inspection teams to go deep into the fields for inspection; if seedlings that had not been pulled up were found during the inspection, they were forced to pull them up immediately. The general townships repeatedly inspected three times, and some townships had been inspected continuously for six times. If farmers refused to pull up seedlings, meetings were held to threaten them with labels such as "capitalist ideology is at work," "sabotaging national plans," and "unpatriotic." They even said that they were "ideologically reactionary, confronting the government" and "sabotaging production." Even more serious was the use of measures such as buying more surplus grain and retaining less food rations to force farmers to pull up water chestnuts and change to planting double-cropping early rice.

During the growth period of the double-cropping early rice seedlings, because the weather was hot and the seedlings were prone to wilting, the county party committee forced the masses to cover the seedling fields with quilts and mosquito nets. Chongxian Township alone forced the masses to take out 386 cotton quilts, and even the new bride's big red satin quilt was forced to be taken out. When the seedlings grew up, they were forced to rush to transplant day and night; Jin Yang Township, under the urging of superiors, lit 14 gasoline lamps to rush to transplant overnight. The masses reflected: covering rice fields with quilts and transplanting rice seedlings with gasoline lamps, these are rare things that have never happened before.

On September 27, the temperature in the Hang County area dropped, and the double-cropping early rice had stopped tillering. At this time, some cadres began to waver, but the county party committee (at this time, Zhang Shusen had been transferred to another county to serve as the county party committee secretary) still insisted on the mistake, saying: Don't waver now, if something goes wrong in the future, the county party committee will be responsible for making a review. By November, the early winter chill was attacking the rice fields in waves, and the rice could no longer mature. Farmers asked to cut the rice stalks to feed the cattle, but some county party committee members said: "We don't care whether you cut them or not." At this point, most of the 29,701 mu of double-cropping early rice planted through repeated commandism ended with no harvest.

This commandist work style has brought huge losses to the farmers in Hang County. According to preliminary statistics: pulling up more than 40,000 mu of water chestnut seedlings, calculated at 15 dan per mu and 3 yuan per dan, will result in a loss of 1.88 million yuan, plus the loss of 237,608 jin of double-cropping early rice seeds. The total loss is about 2 million yuan. Now there are 110,000 farmers in the county who need relief. The political losses are immeasurable.

Because the incident of pulling up water chestnut seedlings in Hang County has not been dealt with seriously, to this day, the farmers in this area have many opinions on the county party committee. We believe that the relevant leaders should seriously and earnestly deal with this incident, clarify the responsibilities, and draw lessons from it to improve their work style.

    对杭县拔荸荠苗事件的调查报告
    本报读者来信部
    每年八月是杭县农民栽种荸荠的时节。这里的荸荠特点是个大、皮薄、水份多，一向为京、津、沪等大城市广大消费者所欢迎。农民在荸荠方面的收入仅次于水稻和蚕桑。因此，当地农民对于这宗占农村收入第三位的经济作物是十分重视的。
    一九五四年八月一日，杭县党、政领导机关召开了两个会议，决定了全县不种荸荠，改种连作早稻。县委扩大会上规定四维区改种一万八千八百亩，三墩区七千亩，瓶窑区八千亩，东塘区四千四百亩，栖塘区一千八百亩。可是在全县劳动模范座谈会上提出这个任务时，到会的绝大多数劳动模范都不同意。他们提出：种荸荠是农民几十年来的习惯，而且苗子已全部培育好了，要改变这种习惯，毁去苗子，农民是不会同意的；何况荸荠的收入要比稻子高出许多哩！其次要改种连作早稻，目前季节已迟，农民又没有种植的习惯，连作稻能不能保险有收成呢？但是，这些意见并没有引起县委的重视，县委书记张树森在报告中还着重提出：教育要同法令相结合，并说农民是保守的。如果有真正顽固的农民不肯拔荸荠，不种连作早稻，那么就不供应口粮，让他吃荸荠好了。
    县委扩大会议结束以后，九个县委委员就根据县委扩大会议的精神，分头去各区领导改种工作。当时部分区乡干部听说要叫拔掉荸荠改种连作早稻，思想上也搞不通；四维区章桥乡副乡长郑阿堂气愤地说：“毁掉荸荠苗这种做法是脱离群众的，是对人民不利的，会遭到群众反对的。”县委听到下面的反映以后，不但没有考虑自己的决定有没有错误，相反的，还在干部大会上责怪那些“思想不通”的干部没有共产主义事业心，不敢大胆的“创造”。副县长李广新批判了干部的“消极”“畏难”思想后并说：“干部的社会主义觉悟高不高，这次运动就是一次实际的考验。”这就逼使干部走上强迫命令的道路。
    八月五日以后，各区区乡干部，在县委的强迫命令下全部动起来了。各区先后召开了区委扩大会议，区乡干部、农村党员大会，各乡群众会议，从上到下，从党内到党外，从干部到群众，层层布置执行县委会的决议，并且要求立即行动起来。杭县农林科，在县领导人员的授意下提出了极端荒唐的所谓种荸荠的九大苦楚，如说种荸荠对国家对人民不利，种荸荠要热天种冷天摸人吃苦，荸荠吃多了人肚子会痛等，要各区乡干部发动群众诉“荸荠的苦”。此后副县长李广新又几次说：要坚决“消灭荸荠”改种连作早稻；如果荸荠拔不掉，连作早稻种不上，乡干部要负责。命令下达后，乡村干部被迫：“要彻底消灭荸荠，保证完成任务。”
    从八月六日至八月九日仅仅四天的工夫，全县可以栽种四万多亩田的荸荠苗就全部拔光了。
    荸荠苗拔完以后，县委惟恐拔的不彻底，又指令乡村干部组织检查组深入田间检查；在检查中发现未拔的苗子，就强迫立即拔掉。一般的乡都反复检查三次，有的乡曾连续检查过六次。如有农民拒不拔苗，就召开会议，以“资本主义思想作怪”、“破坏国家计划”、“不爱国”等帽子进行威胁。甚至说他们“思想反动，同政府对抗”、“破坏生产”等。更严重的是用多购余粮少留口粮的办法，逼使农民把荸荠拔掉，改种连作早稻。
    在连作早稻小秧生长期间，因为天气炎热，秧苗容易枯萎，县委又强迫群众用被子及蚊帐把秧田上遮盖起来，仅崇贤一个乡就强迫群众拿出了棉被三百八十六床，连新媳妇的大红绸缎被也被迫拿出来了。秧苗长成了，又强迫群众日夜赶插；金羊乡在上级催促下，点上了十四盏汽油灯连夜赶插。群众反映：秧田盖棉被、插秧点汽灯，这是从来没有过的稀奇事儿。
    九月二十七日，杭县地区的气温下降了，连作早稻已停止分蘖。这时，部分干部开始动摇，县委（此时张树森已调往他县任县委书记去了）仍然坚持错误说：现在不要动摇，搞错了将来由县委负责作检讨。到十一月，初冬的寒气一阵阵的侵袭着稻田，稻子再也不能成熟了，农民纷纷要求割了稻秸喂牛，部分县委委员却说：“割不割我们不管”。至此，经过一再强迫命令种植的二万九千七百零一亩连作早稻绝大部分以颗粒无收结束了。
    这种强迫命令的作风给杭县农民带来了巨大的损失，据初步统计：拔毁四万多亩荸荠苗，以每亩产十五担、每担三元计算，就要损失一百八十八万元，加上二十三万七千六百零八斤连作早稻种籽的损失。全部损失在二百万元左右。现在全县有十一万农民需要救济。政治上的损失，那就无法衡量了。
    由于杭县拔荸荠苗事件未能得到严肃的处理，因而到目前为止，这个地区的农民对县委是有很多意见的。我们认为有关领导方面应当严肃认真的处理这一事件，弄清责任，并且从中得出教训，改进工作作风。
