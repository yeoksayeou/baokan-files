Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 20th: Vice-Chairman Sok of the All-India Peace Council published an article titled "The Struggle Against Imperialism" in the March issue of the All-India Peace Council's official publication, "Peace Review."

The article stated that the heroic struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan is a struggle against imperialism and for peace. Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory. The United States has established a foothold in Taiwan and is engaging in military adventures in the region, threatening peace in Asia and around the world. The United States has also violated China's territorial waters. People all over the world are shocked by this blatant imperialism and demand its end. The article also said that the Indian Prime Minister has never accepted the notion of "two Chinas" and has consistently striven to restore the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

The article continued: People all over the world know that this is a struggle between justice and power. They want justice to prevail so that the art of construction can be developed. We Indians firmly support the great Chinese people in their struggle to defeat imperialism. Without defeating imperialism, our own freedom is in danger. Not only that, but even the happiness and future of the American people will be harmed.

The article concluded, "We must work together to ensure that the freedom of the people is respected rather than violated. We must work with people all over the world to achieve this goal. We wish the great Chinese people success in their great struggle for peace and happiness for all the people of the world."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 20th: Dewan Chaman Lall, a Congress Party member of the Indian Parliament, recently gave a talk on the Taiwan issue on "All India Radio" in Delhi, saying: "The average Indian obviously cannot understand why an island only four miles from the coast of mainland China is not strategically important to its owner, but is considered important to the security of others thousands of miles away from its coast."

Lall emphasized that all the basic historical facts regarding Taiwan and the coastal islands make it so that "no one today doubts this right of the People's Republic of China." He said: "Therefore, mobilizing world opinion to support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is a matter of extreme importance." He believes that these principles will ease tensions in the Taiwan Strait.

    全印和平理事会副主席索克、印度议员拉尔发表文章和谈话
    谴责美国侵占台湾威胁亚洲和世界和平
    【新华社新德里二十日电】全印和平理事会副主席索克在三月份的全印和平理事会机关刊“和平评论”上发表了题为“反对帝国主义的斗争”的文章。
    文章说，中国人民为解放台湾而进行着的英勇斗争乃是反对帝国主义和争取和平的斗争。台湾和澎湖是中国的领土。美国在台湾设下立足点，并正在这个地区进行军事冒险，威胁亚洲和全世界的和平。美国还侵犯了中国大陆的领海。全世界人民都对这种无耻的帝国主义感到震惊，并且要求结束它。文章又说，印度总理从未接受“两个中国”的说法，并且一贯地为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法地位而努力。
    文章接着说：全世界人民都知道这是正义和强权之间的斗争。他们愿意正义获胜，以便有可能发展建设的艺术。我们印度人是坚决支持伟大的中国人民为击败帝国主义而进行的斗争的。不击败帝国主义，我们自己的自由也就有危险。不仅如此，甚至美国人民的幸福和未来也将受到损害。
    文章最后说，“我们必须共同协力，务使人民的自由受到尊敬而不是受到侵犯。我们必须和全世界的人民一起来为达到这个目的而努力。我们预祝伟大的中国人民在他们为了全世界人民的和平和幸福而进行的伟大斗争中获得成功。”
    【新华社新德里二十日电】印度国会国大党议员德万·查曼·拉尔最近在德里“全印广播电台”就台湾问题发表谈话说：“一般的印度人显然不能够了解，为什么距离中国大陆的海岸只有四英里的岛屿对于它的所有者在战略上并不重要，而对于远离数千英里以外的海岸上的另一些人的安全倒被认为是重要的。”
    拉尔着重指出，一切有关台湾和沿海岛屿的历史基本事实使得“今天任何人都不怀疑中华人民共和国的这种权利”。他说：“因此，动员全世界舆论来支持五项共处原则是一件具有极为重要意义的事情。”他认为这些原则将会缓和台湾海峡的紧张局势。
