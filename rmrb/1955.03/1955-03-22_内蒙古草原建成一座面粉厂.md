    A Flour Mill Built on the Inner Mongolian Grassland
    The first flour mill has appeared on the Inner Mongolian grassland. Construction of this flour mill began in January 1954 on a piece of wasteland outside Ba昌 County, Chahar League, and it began production on February 26th of this year.
    Previously, there were no such factories on the grassland, and the people in the pastoral areas could not eat flour for a long time. Sometimes, the flour that farmers and herders ate was supplied by private processors. The flour produced by these private processors not only failed to meet the needs of farmers and herders in terms of quantity, but also was of poor quality. After the newly built flour mill officially starts production, it can produce nearly 50,000 catties of flour or 60,000 catties of naked oat flour every day, so that the people in the three counties and five banners of the Chahar League and most of the Xilin Gol League can obtain high-quality and sufficient flour.

    内蒙古草原建成一座面粉厂
    内蒙古草原上已出现了第一座面粉厂。这座面粉厂自一九五四年一月在察哈尔盟宝昌县城外的一片荒地上开工兴建，今年二月二十六日已开始生产。
    以前，草原上没有这样的工厂，牧区的人民长时间内吃不到面粉。有时农民牧民吃到的面粉，都是私营加工户供给的。这些私营加工户出的面粉，不仅数量不能满足农民牧民的需要，而且质量低劣。新建成的面粉厂正式生产后，每天可生产将近五万斤面粉或六万斤莜面，这样便能使察哈尔盟的三县五旗和锡林郭勒盟的大部地区的人民得到质高量足的面粉。
