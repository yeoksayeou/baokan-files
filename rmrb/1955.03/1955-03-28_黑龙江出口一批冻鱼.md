Heilongjiang Province has overfulfilled its plan to export frozen fish to the Soviet Union this year. The exported frozen fish are uniformly glazed with ice, have intact bodies, and are fresh and delicious. First-class fish account for more than 99% of the total exported frozen fish.

Most of these frozen fish are products of the state-owned Fuyuan and Raohe Aquatic Products Companies, and a small portion are products of fishermen. Exporting frozen fish not only increases the state's foreign exchange income but also solves transportation and sales difficulties in remote areas and improves the lives of fishermen.

    黑龙江出口一批冻鱼
    黑龙江省今年对苏联出口冻鱼的计划已经超额完成。出口的这些冻鱼，挂冰均匀，体整鲜美，一等鱼占出口冻鱼总数的百分之九十九以上。
    这些冻鱼大部分是国营抚远、饶河两个水产公司的产品，少部分是渔民产品。出口冻鱼，不仅增加了国家外汇收入，还解决了边远地区运销上的困难，改善了渔民的生活。（王希元）
