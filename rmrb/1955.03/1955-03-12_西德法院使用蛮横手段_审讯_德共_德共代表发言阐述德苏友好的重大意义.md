Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 11th: According to the German News Agency, the West German Federal Constitutional Court continued its illegal "interrogation" of the German Communist Party on the 9th. Due to repeated obstruction by the Bonn government representatives in the past, Lei Xi, the plenipotentiary representative of the German Communist Party, spoke for the first time in the "interrogation" on the 9th.

During this "interrogation," the Bonn government representative quoted a resolution of the German Communist Party from November 1951—this resolution called on German Communist Party members to support the activities of the German-Soviet Friendship Association—as one of the reasons for accusing the German Communist Party, and accused the German Communist Party of aiming to establish "exclusive rule" in West Germany.

Lei Xi replied: The people of Germany and the Soviet Union must establish a solid friendly relationship. German history proves that when Germany maintained a friendly relationship with the Soviet Union, the situation was always good for the German people; but when the relations between the two countries broke down, the situation was very bad. When talking about the goals of the German Communist Party, Lei Xi emphasized that the German Communist Party's policy is entirely for the protection of the interests of the people.

Judge Heilant repeatedly interrupted Lei Xi's speech with his stubborn anti-Soviet remarks. Due to Heilant's anti-Soviet attitude, the legal representatives of the German Communist Party suggested that Heilant be removed from his post.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th: According to the German News Agency, the West German Federal Constitutional Court continued its illegal "interrogation" of the German Communist Party in Karlsruhe on the 8th. Because the representatives of the German Communist Party have severely refuted the reasons for the Bonn authorities' "interrogation" in previous "interrogations," the Bonn authorities brazenly forbade the representatives of the German Communist Party to speak in court during this "interrogation."

At the beginning of the "interrogation" on the 8th, Lex, the representative of the Bonn government, slandered Marxism-Leninism, attempting to frame the German Communist Party as "violating the Constitution" and "must be banned." Krüger, the legal representative of the German Communist Party, wanted to speak on this issue but was prohibited. Krüger said that it was unacceptable for the court to allow government representatives to slander Marxism-Leninism without allowing German Communist Party representatives to answer this question, but the presiding judge interrupted him. Krüger requested that the German Communist Party's struggle for peace and its national policies be discussed as the main topics, but this request was also rejected.

The court did not give the German Communist Party representatives any opportunity to answer the "documents" presented by the government and hastily decided to enter the so-called second item on the "interrogation" agenda—"regarding the strategy and tactics of the German Communist Party." Lex, the representative of the Bonn government, continued to distort and slander Marxism-Leninism, distort and slander the documents of the German Communist Party and even the Soviet Communist Party, while the court still did not allow the German Communist Party representatives to answer these slanderous attacks.

The court also rejected the application of Lei Xi, the plenipotentiary representative of the German Communist Party, to speak on several documents of the German Communist Party.

The "interrogation" continued under such unreasonable circumstances.

    西德法院使用蛮横手段“审讯”德共
    德共代表发言阐述德苏友好的重大意义
    【新华社柏林十一日电】据德意志通讯社报道：西德联邦宪法法院九日继续非法“审讯”德国共产党。由于波恩政府代表过去一再阻挠，德国共产党全权代表雷熙九日第一次在“审讯”中发言。
    在这一次“审讯”中，波恩政府代表摘引一九五一年十一月德国共产党的一个决议——这个决议号召德国共产党党员支持德苏友好协会的活动——作为控告德国共产党的理由之一，并且指控德国共产党的目标是要在西德建立“独占统治”。
    雷熙回答说：德苏两国人民必需建立巩固的友好关系。德国的历史证明，当德国同苏联保持着友好关系的时候，情况对德国人民来说总是好的；而当两国关系破裂的时候，情况就很坏。在谈到德国共产党的目的时，雷熙强调指出，德国共产党的政策完全是为了保护人民的利益。
    法官海兰特用他顽固的反苏言论一再打断雷熙的讲话。由于海兰特的反苏态度，德国共产党法律代表建议把海兰特撤职。
    【新华社柏林十日电】据德意志通讯社报道，西德联邦宪法法院八日在加尔斯卢合继续非法“审讯”德国共产党。因为德国共产党代表在历次“审讯”中对波恩当局“审讯”的理由加以严词驳斥，波恩当局竟在这一次“审讯”中蛮横地不准德国共产党代表在法庭上说话。
    八日的“审讯”一开始，波恩政府代表莱克斯就诽谤马克思—列宁主义，企图诬陷德国共产党“违反宪法”，“必须予以取缔”。德国共产党法律代表克吕格尔要就这一问题发言，但是被禁止。克吕格尔说，法庭让政府代表诽谤马克思—列宁主义而不让德国共产党代表回答这个问题是不行的，但是法庭庭长打断了他的话。克吕格尔要求把德国共产党的为和平而斗争以及它的全国政策作为主要题目来讨论，这个要求也遭到拒绝。
    法庭不给德国共产党代表任何机会来答辩政府方面提出的“证件”，就匆忙决定进入“审讯”的所谓第二项议程——“关于德国共产党的战略和策略”。波恩政府代表莱克斯继续歪曲诽谤马克思—列宁主义、歪曲诽谤德国共产党的甚至是苏联共产党的文件，而法庭依然不让德国共产党代表答辩这些诬蔑性的攻击。
    法庭也拒绝了德国共产党全权代表雷熙就德国共产党若干文件发言的申请。
    “审讯”继续在这样一种无理的情况下进行。
