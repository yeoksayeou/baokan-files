Title: Not Really "Cooking Without Rice"

It seems that everyone knows the importance of good construction preparation for completing the basic construction plan. However, even though the importance is understood, not all construction enterprises actually do a good job in construction preparation. Some say, "Design documents haven't arrived, so there's no way to start the preparation work." Others say, "There are still problems with equipment orders, so there's no use in rushing." In short, they sigh, "Even a clever housewife can't cook without rice." Those with many things to do go busy themselves with other matters; those with little to do are perfectly content to "take a breather after a year of hard work."

This breather often leads to trouble. Sharpening your spear just before battle rarely leads to victory. If one waits until the drawings are complete and the equipment arrives before starting construction preparation, time will be short, and chaos in construction, delays in progress, and waste are inevitable. There were many such lessons last year. Some projects at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant were delayed due to this.

A clever housewife indeed "cannot cook without rice," but the so-called "obstacles to construction preparation," such as the unavailability of design documents and problems with equipment delivery in basic construction, are different from "cooking without rice." The drawings will eventually arrive, and the equipment will eventually be delivered. Therefore, it's not "no rice," but rather "there is rice," only one doesn't know when the rice will be delivered. Therefore, a truly clever housewife will definitely contact the relevant parties to see when the rice can be delivered, what difficulties there are, and help to solve them; at the same time, she'll tidy up and prepare the pot, the stove, and the water for washing the rice. This is called "a clever housewife skillfully prepares for a late rice delivery."

Construction preparation is also like this. The Harbin First Construction Engineering Company initially thought that "the task hasn't been finally confirmed" and then felt that "they don't know the content of the project," so they always said that "the conditions for preparation are not met." However, under the urging of the leadership, when they realized the principle of the early bird catching the worm and grasped construction preparation, they discovered that there were no insurmountable obstacles on the road to construction preparation. "Not knowing the specific content of the project" seems to make construction preparation difficult; but since it's called construction preparation, it means preparing conditions for construction, which means understanding the project content. The Harbin First Construction Engineering Company adopted the method of "going to the door" and contacted twenty-one contracting units, thus clarifying the entire project content. Formulating construction plans and arranging construction procedures became clear.

The Jinzhou Railway Administration First Engineering Team is also an example: The First Engineering Team had a total of eighteen construction tasks this year, and by the end of January, the design department had only handed over design documents for two projects. Some people thought that since the design documents couldn't be delivered, there was no way to prepare plans, no way to stock materials, and no way to allocate labor. The First Engineering Team criticized this passive waiting mentality. On the one hand, they concentrated their efforts on the projects for which design documents were already available; on the other hand, they transferred some technical staff to support the design work, and based on the partially completed design drawings and related materials, they drafted an annual project progress schedule, a material and machinery supply and labor allocation plan, and also sent people to the future construction areas to understand the construction conditions and study construction methods. This is beneficial to the smooth organization of construction and the completion of the construction plan.

From this, it can be seen that in the face of a clever housewife, if the rice arrives a little late, although it will add some trouble and require a lot of extra work, it will never defeat her.

    并非“无米之炊”
    王朴
    做好施工准备，对完成基本建设计划的重要意义，好像是人所共知的。但重要意义虽是知道了，却并不见得所有的建筑企业都去做好施工准备。有的说：“设计文件来不了，准备工作无从下手”，有的说：“设备订货还有问题，着急也没有用”。总之是，叹一声“巧妇难为无米之炊”。事情多的，还是忙他的去；事情闲的，正好！“辛苦了一年，抓紧时间松一口气”。
    这口气一松，常常坏事。临阵磨枪，从来就很少有打胜仗的。若等图纸来齐，设备到达，再来着手施工准备，时间仓促，没有不形成施工混乱、影响进度、造成浪费的。去年就有不少这类教训。第一汽车制造厂，沈阳第一机床厂的有些工程，就曾因此推延了建设的时间。
    巧妇确实“难为无米之炊”，但基本建设中设计文件来不了，设备到货还有问题等等所谓“施工准备的障碍”，毕竟不同于“无米之炊”。图纸总是要来的，设备总是要到的。所以，不是“无米”，而是“有米”，只不过不知道米什么时候能送来。因而，真是巧妇，必然会一面去联系联系，看看米什么时候能送来，有些什么困难，帮助解决一下；一面收拾收拾，把锅、炉子、淘米的水，准备一下。这叫着“巧妇善为米迟之炊”。
    施工准备也是如此。哈尔滨市第一建筑工程公司始而认为“任务没有最后肯定”，继而感到“不知道工程内容”，因而总是说“准备工作条件不具备”。但在领导督促下，当他们意识到笨鸟先飞的道理，抓紧施工准备后，就发现施工准备的道路上，原来并没有不可克服的障碍。“不知道工程具体内容”，好像很难进行施工准备；但既然叫施工准备，就是要为施工准备条件，就是要去了解工程内容。哈尔滨市第一建筑工程公司采取“找上门去”的方法，联系了二十一个发包单位，就摸清了全部工程内容。制订建设计划，安排施工程序都有眉目了。
    锦州铁路管理局第一工程队也是一个例子：第一工程队今年共有十八件工程任务，到一月底，设计部门只交出两件工程的设计文件。有人就认为设计文件交不出来，没法编制计划，没法备料，也没法调配劳动力。第一工程队批判了这种消极等待思想，一面集中力量在已有设计文件的工程上施工，一面抽调了部分技术员工去支援设计工作，并根据部分完成的设计图纸和有关资料，草编了全年工程进度表，材料、机具供应及劳动力调配计划，还派人到未来的施工地区去了解施工条件，研究施工方法，这对于顺利的组织施工，完成建设计划，是有利的。
    由此可见，在巧妇面前，米来得迟一点，虽要增加一些麻烦，多做不少工作，但总是不能把她难倒的。
