    Xinjiang Women in the Big Family of the Motherland
    Ma Liya, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Xinjiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation
    The people's great revolution led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao liberated all the Chinese people, and also liberated the women of Xinjiang. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's ethnic policies, women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have gained equal rights with men. In the past, women in Xinjiang had no right to participate in national affairs at all. Today, 90 percent of them participate in elections at all levels. In Urumqi Prefecture alone, 1,945 women representatives participate in people's congresses at all levels. Women account for 8.8 percent of the members of people's governments at the county, district, and autonomous levels. Many women hold leading positions such as county head, district head, township head, and street director. For example, Abi Khan, a working woman who suffered all kinds of oppression in the old society, is now a district head in Turpan County, which has the largest population. For the first time in Chinese history, three women from minority ethnic groups in Xinjiang participated in the highest organ of state power—the National People's Congress. This is the most proud event for women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Now, more and more women in Xinjiang are participating in work. For example, the number of female cadres in leading organs above the district level increased from 634 in 1952 to 1,189 in 1953. In some areas, female cadres account for 10 to 20 percent of various health and education departments. In 1953, 1,500 female students graduated from political schools and medical schools at all levels and joined the workforce.

    Before liberation, women in Xinjiang had no opportunity to participate in industrial production at all. Now, there are more than 4,000 female workers in factories and mines in Urumqi alone, of whom more than 70 are labor models and hundreds of female workers have mastered advanced technologies. For example, Sha Adeti Khan, a female worker at the Xinjiang Fur Factory, can process 199 sheepskins per day. Women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are exerting their greatest efforts to participate in the construction of the socialist industrialization of the motherland and are striving to improve their economic lives through their labor.

    In the past, under the feudal system, women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang could not freely participate in agricultural production. After liberation, the Party and the government encouraged and helped young women to actively participate in labor. Now, 80 to 90 percent of women in Xinjiang participate in agricultural labor such as mowing grass and planting cotton; more than 20 percent of young women participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and have learned advanced farming methods. Some women also hold leading positions in cooperatives. According to a survey of seven agricultural production cooperatives, ten women hold positions as chairmen, vice-chairmen, and other management positions. For example, model League member Mai Muna was elected director of the credit cooperative for actively mobilizing farmers to participate in the credit cooperative. Millions of women in Xinjiang have become a powerful force in the countryside. They have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and created many new farming methods.

    Women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have also played an active role in animal husbandry production. They use scientific methods to breed livestock and pay attention to preventing livestock diseases, so that the number of livestock has increased rapidly. For example, the herder Na Biha had 87 sheep in 1951, which increased to 218 sheep in 1954. Many female labor models have also emerged in animal husbandry production.

    Before liberation, women of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, like women of other fraternal nationalities, were subjected to feudal oppression and had no status in the family. After liberation, women were liberated and have gained their due position in the family. Most families are harmonious and united.

    Xinjiang women have also achieved a turnaround in culture and education, and have had the opportunity to receive education. Thousands of female workers, farmers, and herders are able to read and write and read newspapers. For example, the peasant woman Tu He La Khan was illiterate in 1951, but now she is the accountant and secretary of the production cooperative. In Xinjiang, in addition to several girls' middle schools, many women are studying in political, technical, and medical schools. For example, 25 percent of the students at the Xinjiang Nationalities Institute are female comrades. In the history of Xinjiang, no woman has ever attended a university, but today there are dozens of Xinjiang women studying in higher education institutions in our capital, Beijing, such as the Marx-Lenin Institute, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Medical College, and the Central Institute for Nationalities.

    The Communist Party liberated all Chinese women from feudal oppression, and Xinjiang women were no exception. The gratitude of Xinjiang women to the Party and Chairman Mao is endless. The 104-year-old woman Na Wei Khan said: "I have lived for more than a hundred years and have seen many governments, but I have never seen a government like today's that cares so much about the working people."

    在祖国大家庭里的新疆妇女
    新疆省民主妇女联合会宣传部长  马利亚
    共产党和毛主席所领导的人民大革命解放了全中国人民，同时也解放了我们新疆的妇女。新疆各族妇女在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，同男子一样得到了平等的权利。过去，我们新疆妇女根本没有权利过问国家大事，今天，百分之九十参加了各级选举，仅乌鲁木齐专区就有一千九百四十五位妇女代表参加了各级人民代表大会。县、区和各级自治地方的人民政府委员中，妇女占百分之八点八；许多妇女担任了县长、区长、乡长、街长等领导工作。例如在旧社会曾受尽压迫的劳动妇女阿比汗，现在是人口最多的吐鲁番县的一个区长。中国历史上第一次有三位新疆少数民族妇女参加了最高国家权力机关——全国人民代表大会，这对我们新疆各族妇女来说是最值得骄傲的大事。现在新疆妇女参加工作的一天天增多。例如区以上领导机关的妇女干部在一九五二年有六百三十四人，一九五三年就增加到一千一百八十九人。个别地区的各级卫生、教育等部门的妇女干部占百分之十到二十。一九五三年各级政治学校、医务学校有妇女学员一千五百人毕业并参加了工作。
    解放以前，新疆妇女根本没有参加工业生产的机会，现在仅在乌鲁木齐市的各厂矿中就有四千多个妇女工人，其中并有七十多人是劳动模范，有几百个女工掌握了先进技术。例如新疆皮毛厂的女工沙阿德提汗，每天可以加工一百九十九张羊皮。新疆各族妇女正在发挥自己最大的力量参加祖国社会主义工业化的建设，并以自己的劳动来争取经济生活的好转。
    过去在封建制度下，新疆各族妇女不能自由地参加农业生产。解放后，党和政府鼓励和帮助青年妇女积极参加劳动。新疆现在百分之八十到九十的妇女都参加了农业方面的割草和种棉花等劳动；其中百分之二十以上的青年妇女参加了互助合作组织，并学会了先进的耕作方法。有些妇女在合作社中还担任了领导工作。据七个农业生产合作社的调查，担任社长、副社长和其他管理工作的，有十个是妇女。又如模范团员买木娜因为积极动员农民参加信用合作社，被选为信用合作社的主任。新疆数百万妇女在农村里已成为一支强大的力量，她们发挥了高度的积极性，创造了许多新的耕种法。
    新疆各族妇女在畜牧业生产方面也发挥了积极作用，她们采用科学方法繁殖牲畜，注意防止牲畜的疫病，使牲畜数目迅速增加。例如牧民拿比哈在一九五一年有八十七头羊，到一九五四年便增加到二百一十八头羊了。在畜牧业生产方面还出现了许多妇女劳动模范。
    解放前，新疆各族妇女和其他兄弟民族的妇女一样，受着封建压迫，在家庭中是没有地位的。解放后，妇女获得了解放，在家庭中也已经得到应有的地位。多数的家庭都是和睦团结的。
    新疆妇女在文化教育上也获得翻身，有了受教育的机会，成千的女工、农妇、牧民妇女能够识字看报了。例如农妇吐合拉汗在一九五一年还是一个文盲，现在已是生产合作社的会计和秘书了。在新疆除了几个女子中学外，在政治、技术、医务等学校中都有不少的妇女在学习。例如新疆民族学院有百分之二十五的学员是女同志。新疆历史上从来没有一个妇女上过大学，可是今天在我们首都北京就有几十个新疆妇女在马克思列宁学院、北京师范大学、北京医学院、中央民族学院等高等学校学习。
    共产党把全中国妇女从封建压迫下解放出来，新疆妇女也不例外地解放出来了。新疆妇女对党和毛主席的感激是说不完的。一百零四岁的老太太拿维汗说：“我活了一百多岁，看见了好多个政府，但是从来没有看见过像今天的政府这样关怀劳动人民。”
