Everyone Should Inspect the Phenomenon of Grain Waste
    Angang
    The most important method of fighting against the phenomenon of grain waste is to conduct organized inspections. The Supervisory Committee of the Liaoyang County People's Government in Liaoning Province, in coordination with the Grain Bureau, jointly inspected five units, proving that this is very necessary. Some people believe that grain waste mainly occurs in large cities, but in cities like Liaoyang, the phenomenon of grain waste is also very serious.
    According to the inspection results of Liaoyang Complete Middle School, Third Middle School, and a factory in Liaoyang City, the situation of these three units falsely reporting the number of people, concealing inventory, fraudulently claiming state grain, and wasting grain is very serious. In November 1954, the number of people eating in the collective canteen of Liaoyang Third Middle School was 1,172, but the quota for purchasing grain was 1,294, a false report of 122 people. The Complete Middle School falsely reported 13 people. In October and November, these two schools fraudulently claimed 1,760 jin of grain. At the end of November, Liaoyang Complete Middle School concealed a grain inventory of 2,300 jin, and in December, in addition to the rationed supply, it additionally requested a supply of 7,000 jin. The inspected factory also had the same phenomenon; the canteen alone concealed a grain inventory of 13,000 jin in November. More than 270 jin of leftover food was wasted daily by the Complete Middle School and the Third Middle School. These two middle schools used these leftover rice and food to feed nine fat pigs, and the remaining part was dumped in the sewage pool. The factory wasted more than 8,000 jin of grain per month in leftover rice and food. This factory fed 40 pigs with leftover food, and the rest was thrown away. In addition, the phenomenon of grain outflow is also very serious. The factory canteen supplies on average more than 200 people every day (a small part of whom are outside staff who must eat in the canteen) with duplicate rations. Some employees, after receiving their own grain purchase certificates, eat in the canteen or bring meals to others, transferring the supplied grain they received at home to relatives and friends in the countryside.
    Every factory, school, and government agency needs to check, based on these situations, whether there is grain waste in their own unit. They should check whether the grain used daily in their factory, school, or government agency is used according to a planned and rationed system or blindly. Is the grain requisitioned according to the actual number of people, or is it falsely reported and fraudulently claimed? How much leftover food is there each month, and why is there so much leftover food? Are there duplicate supplies and grain outflow phenomena? As long as the actual situation can be ascertained, it will be possible to have a clear understanding and find concrete measures to eliminate waste.

    大家都来检查粮食浪费的现象
    安岗
    同浪费粮食的现象进行斗争，最重要的方法是有组织地进行检查。辽宁省辽阳县人民政府监察委员会同粮食局共同配合检查了五个单位，证明这样作很有必要。有人认为浪费粮食的主要是大城市，其实像辽阳这样的城市，浪费粮食现象也是很严重的。
    根据检查辽阳市辽阳完全中学、第三中学和一个工厂的结果，发现这三个单位虚报人数、隐瞒库存、冒领国家粮食糟蹋粮食的情形很严重。辽阳第三中学一九五四年十一月份在集体食堂用膳的人数是一千一百七十二人，购买粮食的名额却有一千二百九十四人，虚报一百二十二人。完全中学虚报十三人。这两个学校在十、十一两个月冒领粮食一千七百六十斤。辽阳完全中学十一月末隐瞒库存粮食二千三百斤，十二月份还在定量供应外，额外请求供应七千斤。被检查的这个工厂也有同样现象，仅一个食堂十一月份即隐瞒库存粮一万三千斤。完全中学和第三中学被糟蹋的残饭每日达二百七十多斤。这两个中学把这些残米残饭饲养九头肥猪，剩余部分都倾倒在污水池内。工厂糟蹋的残米残饭，每月即折合粮食八千多斤。这个工厂把残饭饲养四十头猪，剩下的部分都被扔掉。此外，粮食外流的现象也很严重。这个工厂食堂每天平均有二百多人（其中有小部分是外来工作人员必须在食堂用餐），都是重复供应。部分职工自己领了购粮证，却到食堂吃饭或给别人向外带饭，把家里领去的供应粮转送农村的亲戚朋友。
    每一个工厂、学校、机关都有必要根据这些情况检查一下本单位有没有浪费粮食的情况，应当检查自己所在的工厂、学校、机关每天使用的粮食是有计划地实行按人定量呢？还是盲目的使用粮食呢？是按人数实报领粮还是虚报冒领呢？每月有多少剩饭，为什么会有很多的剩饭？有没有重复供应和粮食外流现象？只要能够查明实际情况，就可以作到心中有数，找出消灭浪费现象的具体措施。
