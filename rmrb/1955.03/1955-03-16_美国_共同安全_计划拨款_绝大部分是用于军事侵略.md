Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 15th: TASS reported that on March 14th, U.S. President Eisenhower submitted a report to Congress regarding the recent implementation of the "Mutual Security" program (or, more accurately, the plan to arm America's allies and vassals). His report on the implementation in the latter half of 1954 showed that the vast majority of this program's funds were used for military purposes. The total value of military aid materials shipped from October 1949 to December 1954 was $10.5 billion. The main items shipped were: more than 6,000 aircraft, more than 36,000 tanks, more than 36,000 artillery pieces, and so on.

	In the latter half of 1954, the United States shipped approximately $700 million worth of military supplies to the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization's armed forces in Europe, bringing the total value of such supplies shipped since 1949 to nearly $7.5 billion. As a result of the arms race forced upon them by the United States, the European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have increased their annual military expenditures to approximately $11 billion.

	By the end of 1954, the total value of military supplies shipped to the Far East had reached $1.9 billion. According to the report, in the latter half of 1954, the amount of military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee regime in South Korea increased.

	From this report, it can be seen that the United States is increasing its military supplies to those countries that it intends to draw into the aggressive bloc now being cobbled together in the Near East. Regarding this point, the report mentioned that military "aid" to the Turkish government increased in 1954. The report pointed out that Pakistan "has embarked on a massive military effort."

	The report also announced that military supplies with a total value of $383 million would be delivered to countries in the Near East, Africa, and South Asia in the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1955.

	The report stated that the activities in the latter half of 1954 "reflect a further shift in the program's focus to economically less developed regions (in the capitalist world)." The authors of the report, in explaining why the American imperialists are becoming more interested in these countries, pointed out that "underdeveloped countries together... constitute a major source of the world's critical minerals and raw materials, and possess many of the world's most valuable military bases." The report expressed great concern that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China's enormous economic achievements would profoundly impress these underdeveloped countries. The authors of the report lamented that these countries might believe that "for them, the Communist path is the best path to achieve rapid economic progress."

	The authors of the report were clearly uneasy about "the Soviet Union's increasing number of concrete proposals to provide (underdeveloped countries) with technical and capital assistance in industry and agriculture (on truly fair terms)."

    美国“共同安全”计划拨款
    绝大部分是用于军事侵略
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：三月十四日，美国总统艾森豪威尔把关于“共同安全”计划
  （或者更确切地说，武装美国的盟国和附庸的计划的最近执行情况的报告提交给国会。他的关于一九五四年下半年执行情况的报告表明，这个计划拨款的绝大部分是用于军事目的的。从一九四九年十月到一九五四年十二月运出的军事援助物资的总价值是一百零五亿美元。运出的主要项目是：飞机六千多架，坦克三万六千多辆，大炮三万六千多门等等。
    一九五四年下半年，美国运给侵略性的北大西洋集团在欧洲的武装部队的军事物资达七亿美元左右，自一九四九年以来运给的这种物资总值近七十五亿美元。由于美国逼迫它们进行军备竞赛的结果，北大西洋集团的欧洲成员国已把它们每年的军事费用增加到一百一十亿美元左右。
    到一九五四年年底为止，运往远东的军事物资总值已达十九亿美元。据这个报告说，在一九五四年下半年，对台湾蒋介石集团和南朝鲜李承晚的军事援助的数量有了增加。
    从这个报告可以知道，对于那些美国打算拉入现在正在近东拼凑着的侵略集团的国家，美国正在增加给它们的军事物资。关于这点，报告提到，给土耳其政府的军事“援助”在一九五四年中有了增加。报告指出，巴基斯坦“已经着手进行巨大的军事努力”。
    报告又宣布，在到一九五五年六月三十日为止的本财政年度中还将把共值三亿八千三百万美元的军事物资交给近东、非洲和南亚国家。
    报告说，一九五四年下半年的活动“反映出计划的重点进一步转移到（资本主义世界里）经济上不够发达的地区”。报告的作者在解释美帝国主义者为什么对这些国家更加感到兴趣时指出，“落后国家合在一起，……构成世界上关键性矿物和原料的主要来源，并且拥有许多世界上最有价值的军事基地。”报告表示非常担心苏联和中华人民共和国在经济上的巨大成就会给这些落后国家深刻的印象。报告的作者悲哀地说，这些国家可能会相信“对它们说来，共产党的道路是在经济上取得迅速的进展的最好的道路”。
    报告的作者对于“苏联愈来愈多地提出在工业和农业方面（按照真正公平的条件）给予（落后国家）技术和资本的援助的具体建议”这一事实显然感到不安。
