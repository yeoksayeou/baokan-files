    The People of a Factory and Their Endeavors
    Soviet Union Ni. Wuwen
    In the small city of Kunzevo, not far from Moscow, there is a fine spinning factory that produces woolen fabrics. This is not a newly built factory; it has been around for fifty years. However, many new things are happening in its workshops.
    The employees of the Kunzevo Textile Factory are working together with one heart. In the All-Union Socialist Competition of enterprises under the USSR Ministry of Consumer Goods Industry, the Kunzevo Textile Factory won third place. If one takes into account that no fewer than thousands of factories participated in this socialist competition, then one can understand that this is a great labor victory. In September 1954, the factory workers were awarded a red flag and a large bonus.
    The employees of the Kunzevo Textile Factory did not achieve this result easily. This achievement is the result of the concerted efforts of all employees, from the factory director to the young female weavers who are new to tending the looms. However, these many achievements have not made the factory staff dizzy with success. Every member of the factory clearly understands that they must never be satisfied with the achievements they have already made, and they must never live on past accomplishments. In order to move forward, they must resolutely explore and utilize the internal potential of production.
    Let's give a few examples to illustrate how this factory is doing in this regard.
    Responding to the Party's Call
    On the eve of the 37th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called on the Soviet people to complete the 1951-1955 Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This call received a warm response from the Soviet people. A competition to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule was launched throughout the country.
    After the Party's call reached the Kunzevo Textile Factory, workers and engineering technicians decided to re-examine the socialist pledges previously put forward in order to undertake new and higher obligations. After measuring their production capacity, all employees of the factory unanimously decided to complete the national task of 1951-1955 three months ahead of schedule, that is, before October 1, 1955, and to produce three million meters of woolen fabric above the plan. In other words, the textile workers of the Kunzevo Textile Factory could provide enough fabric for overcoats for one million adults just with the increased production.
    This is the plan of the weavers of the Kunzevo Textile Factory. The plan is bold and very realistic. The plan reflects the ardent desire of the factory workers to respond to the call of the Communist Party with practical actions.
    The female textile worker, Anna Grinkin, put it well when she said, "The Party is calling on us to give the country more products so that the people can live better. Our Party has no other concern than the welfare of the people. This means that we must further increase labor productivity. This is how I understand the Party's call."
    Decisive Condition
    The words of the female textile worker, Anna Grinkin, are correct. This ordinary Soviet woman is looking at the issue from the perspective of the national interest. Making every effort to increase labor productivity is the main and decisive condition for continuously improving our economy and enhancing the people's welfare.
    At the Kunzevo Textile Factory, people pay very close attention to increasing labor productivity. Therefore, results soon followed. During the period from January to October 1954, the weavers completed the plan for eleven months and produced 425,000 meters of high-quality woolen fabric above the plan. More than 900 workers in the factory have completed their annual work assignments. Anna Grinkin is also among the advanced workers. She uses two looms to produce high-quality woolen fabric. Grinkin has skillfully mastered the work of a weaver, she is very familiar with the performance of the looms and cherishes these machines. Therefore, she often exceeds the production quota. The quality of the fabrics she produces is all excellent. Anna Grinkin has only one thought: to complete her Five-Year Plan before March 1, 1955, ten months ahead of the scheduled deadline. All the products she produces in the subsequent ten months will be her gift to the motherland.
    This is how advanced workers and production innovators work. The rest of the people are following closely behind them.
    Unleashing Potential
    Increasing the production capacity of new machines is one of the main potentials for further increasing labor productivity at the Kunzevo Textile Factory.
    Currently, this textile factory is replacing the old-fashioned ordinary looms with domestically produced automatic looms. Automatic looms operate at high speed, are very durable, and are easy to maintain. These looms greatly increase productivity and reduce the labor of workers. Soviet automatic looms quickly won the love of textile workers.
    In order to master new technologies faster and better, technical training for workers has been organized within the textile factory. New equipment has been delivered to the workshops, and the factory's training classes have launched mass worker training. After listening to theoretical lessons, foremen, deputy foremen, and female textile workers all practically mastered the performance of the new looms. Experts conducted the lectures. Most of the workers' exam results were very good.
    Learning has produced good results. This can be seen from the following example: According to technical regulations, the crankshaft of an automatic loom should rotate 143 to 150 times per minute. Many advanced work team textile workers at the Kunzevo Textile Factory have already achieved a crankshaft speed of 142 revolutions per minute.
    However, the current speed can no longer satisfy the workers' demands. In order to fulfill their socialist pledges to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, it is necessary to unleash the full capacity of the machines and to unleash this capacity within the shortest possible timeframe. Therefore, a socialist competition to strive for the most rapid mastery of the design capabilities of new automatic looms has been launched throughout the textile factory.
    Kukushkin and His Team
    The work team led by Deputy Foreman and Communist Party member, Peter Kukushkin, is one of the advanced work teams that has successfully mastered automatic looms. There are nine female textile workers in his work team. They have all studied the new machines in training classes.
    Kukushkin is a person who is familiar with technology. Initially, he mastered the new automatic looms himself, and later he taught others to master them. Now he continues to study at the textile night school. His knowledge enables him to quickly master the new machines and bring his work team to the forefront.
    The work team leader's loyal work attitude sets an example for the comrades in the team. Kukushkin arrives at the workshop twenty to thirty minutes before his shift every day. During this time, he walks around the looms, carefully observes these machine tools, and asks the deputy foreman of the previous shift about all the problems with the looms. Before his team members go to work, the looms are always organized in an orderly manner. Having a good grasp of the new machines, work team leader Kukushkin confidently speeds up the looms. According to the quota, a female textile worker should weave thirteen meters of gabardine in eight hours, and each female worker in this work team weaves seventeen to eighteen meters. But this is not the limit. As the operating speed of the looms increases, the output of fabric will also increase accordingly.
    The female weavers of Kukushkin's work team have achieved high production figures, and they are also very concerned about another aspect of the work - product quality. The gabardine produced by this work team is always first-class. Therefore, this team has won the title of "Excellent Quality Work Team."
    There are now more than one hundred excellent quality work teams in the Kunzevo Textile Factory. Undoubtedly, there will be more such work teams tomorrow.
    Helping Backward Work Teams
    The door to obtaining the glorious title of excellent quality work team is wide open. If you encounter difficulties in your work, it doesn't matter, other comrades will come to help you. For example, there was a female textile worker's work team like this.
    The weavers in this work team never did a good job, they always had difficulty completing the production quota, and even then they could not complete it. The work team often produced waste products. The female workers were all in a bad mood, and they felt ashamed to be at the bottom.
    But this situation did not last long. After the question of giving assistance to the work team was raised, the Party and the trade union organization recommended Comrade Vasily Petrov, an experienced deputy foreman and Communist Party member, to the work team. Comrade Petrov resolutely took on the work. His observation of the situation and his conversations with the female workers convinced him that the reason why the work was not satisfactory was not due to the people - those female workers who longed to work better. The reason for being backward was that labor was poorly organized and the ordinary looms often broke down. So Comrade Petrov began by focusing on adjusting the looms, which was the main task.
    Good order was established in the work team - according to each warning signal raised by the technical inspection department regarding the discovery of defects in the fabric, Comrade Petrov used the lunch break or five minutes after work to gather the female workers together, and everyone jointly studied the reasons for the appearance of waste products. Work achievements were discussed once a week within the work team, and such small production meetings were actively conducted. At the meetings, the female textile workers put forward practical suggestions and friendly advice, and criticized shortcomings.
    The long-awaited results finally appeared. When summarizing the work of September last year, it was found that the work team led by Comrade Petrov completed 106.8% of the monthly production task, and all the products produced were of excellent quality. So the female textile workers began to believe in their own strength.
    I can tell many interesting stories about comradely friendship and mutual assistance. Advanced female workers often stand beside the looms of backward female workers, patiently teaching her good working methods. For example, the young female worker, Gina Ivanova, was a backward female worker. She could not master the new automatic looms. She did not complete the quota. So the experienced female worker, Anna Matveyeva, came to help her. The two of them worked side by side. One taught, one learned. Matveyeva taught Ivanova everything she knew without reservation, so Gina was able to increase labor productivity month by month. In October and November last year, she completed 120% of the work task.
    About Careful Calculation and Savings
    In every workshop and at every work station, people strive to produce more and better. Reducing the cost of every meter of fabric that the state spends on the factory as much as possible - this is a great work of national significance. Therefore, the Kunzevo Textile Factory believes that the savings system is of great significance.
    The female textile workers are saving every centimeter of yarn. It should be known that the yarn saved can be used to increase the production of a lot of first-class material. For example, in just one month, the factory saved two thousand kilograms of wool yarn. With these saved wool yarn, an additional four thousand five hundred meters of fabric were produced.
    There are many sources of yarn savings. Every female textile worker is striving to reduce the number of broken ends, load the thread well in the shuttle, and keep the looms in good condition.
    The rationalization proposers and inventors of the factory have launched a huge and beneficial work. In the past ten months, they put forward one hundred and eighty-six rationalization proposals. Only the one hundred and sixteen proposals that were adopted into production saved the factory five hundred thousand rubles.
    Young People
    Here is the female textile worker and Communist Youth League member, Katya Milkova. She was one of the first female workers assigned to manage automatic looms. She quickly mastered the new looms. The knowledge she gained from the factory apprentice school and her studies in the training classes helped her. Now, this young female worker tends four looms instead of the two specified by the quota. She often exceeds the quota, and the products she produces are all of excellent quality. Milkova completed her Five-Year Plan on November 18th last year, which means she completed the plan one year and one and a half months ahead of schedule. She promises to produce more than 35,000 meters of fabric above the plan before the end of the Five-Year Plan.
    Katya Milkova is still continuing her studies. She successfully combines her work in the workshop with her studies in the textile specialty night school. This advanced worker is also a top student in the night school. There are many people like Katya Milkova in our factory.
    It should be said that among the young people in the Kunzevo Textile Factory, many are very eager to learn and seek knowledge. One out of every three young workers in the factory is studying at a college, another is studying at a technical vocational school, and the third is studying at a factory youth worker school.
    Naturally, it is a difficult thing to work and study at the same time, but the young workers are able to overcome all these difficulties.
    Together with the experienced veteran cadres, the young workers are highly upholding the honor of their textile factory. (Attached picture)

    一个工厂的人们和他们的事业
    苏联  尼·乌文
    在离莫斯科不远的昆宰伏这个小城市里有一个精纺厂。它在生产毛织品。这不是一个新建的工厂，它已有五十年历史了。可是在它的各车间里却发生很多新的事物。
    昆宰伏纺织厂的职工们在同心协力地工作着。在苏联日用品工业部所属各企业全苏的社会主义竞赛中，昆宰伏纺织厂荣获第三名。假如注意到参加这次社会主义竞赛的工厂总共不下数千个，那就可以了解这是一个巨大的劳动胜利。一九五四年九月，授予了该厂职工一面红旗和巨额的奖金。
    昆宰伏纺织厂的职工们并不是轻易取得这一成绩的。这种成绩是由于全体职工，从厂长起直到初次看管织机的年青女织工们为止，大家同心协力工作的结果。可是这许多成就并没有使全厂工作人员冲昏头脑。工厂的每个成员都很清楚地了解，决不能安于既得成绩，决不能依靠过去的成就生活。而为了要前进，就必须坚毅地来发掘和动用生产的内部潜力。
    我们且举几个例子来说明这个工厂在这方面是怎样做的。
    响应党的号召
    在十月革命三十七周年前夕，苏联共产党中央委员会曾号召苏联人民提前完成一九五一——一九五五年的五年计划。这个号召在苏联人民中得到热烈的响应。全国各地纷纷展开了为提前完成五年计划的竞赛。
    在党的号召传到昆宰伏纺织厂以后，工人和工程技术人员们决定重新审查先前提出的社会主义保证，以便承担新的和更高的义务。在衡量了自己的生产能力以后，全厂职工一致决定提前三个月，即在一九五五年十月一日前，完成一九五一——一九五五年的国家任务，并超计划地生产三百万公尺的毛织品。这就是说，昆宰伏纺织厂的纺织工人只用增产的毛织品就可使一百万成年人有外衣穿了。
    这就是昆宰伏纺织厂的织工们的计划。计划是大胆的而且很现实的。在计划中反映了该厂职工用实际行动响应共产党号召的热烈愿望。
    关于这点纺织女工安娜·格琳金娜说得很好，她说：“党号召我们给国家更多的产品，以便使人民生活得更好。我们的党除了对人民福利的关怀以外，再没有什么别的可关怀的。这就是说，我们必须更加提高劳动生产率。我对党的号召就是这样了解的。”
    决定性的条件
    纺织女工安娜·格琳金娜的话是对的。这位普通的苏联女工是从国家利益来着眼的。全力提高劳动生产率——这是继续不断提高我国经济和增进人民福利的主要的和决定性的条件。
    在昆宰伏纺织厂，人们非常注意劳动生产率的提高。因此，成绩也就马上到来了。在一九五四年一月到十月这段期间，织工们完成了十一个月的计划，并超计划生产了四十二万五千公尺优等质量的毛织品。工厂有九百多工人已完成自己的全年工作任务。在先进工作者中也有安娜·格琳金娜。她使用两台织机来生产优等质量的毛织品。格琳金娜巧妙地掌握了织工的这行工作，她很熟悉织机的性能并爱护这些机器。因此，她经常超额完成生产定额。她制造出的织品质量全是优等的。安娜·格琳金娜只有一个想法：在一九五五年三月一日以前，比所预定的期限提前十个月，完成自己的五年计划。而她在后十个月中生产的全部产品就将是她对祖国的献礼。
    先进工作者和生产革新者们就是这样工作的。其余的人紧跟着他们。
    发挥潜力
    提高新机器的生产能力是昆宰伏纺织厂进一步提高劳动生产率的主要潜力之一。
    目前这个纺织工厂正在用国产自动织机来代替旧式的普通织机。自动织机是高速运转的，很耐用，看管也容易。这些织机使生产率大大提高，并减轻了工人的劳动。苏联的自动织机很快地赢得了纺织工人的喜爱。
    为了更快地和更好地掌握新技术，在纺织厂内举办了工人的技术学习。在各车间里又运来了新的装备，而工厂的各学习班已展开群众性的工人学习。工长、副工长和纺织女工们在听完理论课以后，都实际地掌握了新织机的性能。专家们进行了授课。大部分工人们的考试成绩都很好。
    学习产生了良好的效果。这可由下面的例子看出：按照技术规定，自动织机的曲拐轴在每分钟内应转一百四十三到一百五十次。昆宰伏纺织厂的许多先进的工作班纺织女工已经做到使曲拐轴每分钟的转数达到一百四十二次。
    可是目前这样的转速已不能满足职工们的要求。为了完成自己所作的关于提前完成五年计划的社会主义保证，就需要发挥机器的全部能力，并在最紧凑的期限内发挥这一能力。因此，在全纺织工厂内就展开了争取最迅速地掌握新式自动织机的设计能力的社会主义竞赛。
    库库什金和他的工作组
    副工长、共产党员别特尔·库库什金领导的工作组是胜利地掌握自动织机的先进工作组之一。在它的工作组里有九个纺织女工。她们都在实习班里学习过新的机器。
    库库什金是一个熟悉技术的人。最初他自己掌握新的自动织机，后来又教会别人去掌握。现在他在纺织夜校里继续读书。他的知识使他能迅速掌握新机器，并把自己的工作组带到先进队伍的行列中去。
    这位工作组长的忠实劳动态度，为组里的同志树立了榜样。库库什金每天都是在接班前二十分钟到三十分钟到车间里来。在这个时间内他环绕各台织机走一遭，很细心地察看这些机床，并向交班的副工长探问织机的所有毛病。在他的组员们上班工作以前，织机总是已整理得有条有理。很好地掌握了新机器的工作组长库库什金，有把握地加快着织机的速度。按照定额，一个纺织女工应在八小时内织出十三公尺嘎别丁，这个工作组的每个女工织出了十七到十八公尺。可是这还不是限度。随着织机运转速度的提高，布匹的产量也将跟着提高。
    库库什金工作组的女织工们取得了高度生产额，她们同时也非常关心工作的另一面——产品质量。这个工作组生产的嘎别丁从来都是一级品。因此，这个小组荣获了“优等质量工作组”的称号。
    现在在昆宰伏纺织厂有一百多个优等质量工作组。无疑地，这种工作组在明天将会更多。
    帮助落后的工作组
    取得优等质量工作组的光荣称号的门，是广阔地敞开着的。如果你在工作中碰到困难，那也不要紧，别的同志们会来帮助你。例如，有一个纺织女工的工作组就是这样的。
    这个工作组的织工们对工作总搞不好，在完成生产定额上总是很吃力，并且就是这样也还不能完成。工作组经常出废品。女工们的情绪都不好，她们觉得当尾巴很丢脸。
    可是这种情况时间并不久。当提出对工作组给予帮助的问题以后，党和工会组织就推荐了一位富有经验的副工长、共产党员华西里亚·别特洛夫同志到该工作组里去。别特洛夫同志坚毅地担负起了工作。他对情况的观察和他同女工们的谈话，使他相信工作不能令人满意的原因不在于人——那些热望更好地工作的女工们。落后的原因在于劳动组织得不好和普通的织机经常出毛病。于是别特洛夫同志就开始先从调整织机这个主要的工作着手。
    在这个工作组里建立了良好的秩序——根据技术检查科所提的关于在布匹上发现毛病的每个警号，别特洛夫同志利用了午息或下班后五分钟的时间把女工们召集在一起，大家共同地来研究出现废品的原因。在工作组内每周讨论工作成绩一次，积极地来进行这类小型生产会议。会上，纺织女工们提出切实的建议和友谊的忠告，并对缺点进行批评。
    期望很久的成绩终于出现。去年当作九月份工作总结时，发现了别特洛夫同志领导的工作组完成了月生产任务的百分之一百零六点八，出的产品全是优等的。于是纺织女工们开始相信自己的力量了。
    我可以讲许多关于同志友爱互助的有趣故事。先进的女工常站在落后的女工的织机旁，耐心地教给她好的工作方法。例如，年轻的女工吉娜·伊凡诺娃是一个落后的女工。她掌握不了新自动织机。她没有完成定额。于是富有经验的女工安娜·玛特维叶娃就来帮助她。她俩并排地工作。一个教，一个学。玛特维叶娃所知道的一切都毫不保留地教给了伊凡诺娃，因此吉娜就能够逐月地提高劳动生产率。在去年十和十一月她完成了工作任务的百分之一百二十。
    关于精打细算和节约
    在每个车间，每一个工作岗位上，人们都力求生产得更多和更好。尽量减低国家在工厂的每一公尺织品上所花的费用，——这是一种有全民意义的伟大工作。所以昆宰伏纺织厂认为节约制度具有极重大的意义。
    纺织女工们节约着每一公分的纱。要知道用节约下来的纱就可以增产不少的头等料子。例如，仅在一个月内，工厂就节约了二千公斤毛纱。用这些节约下来的毛纱，就增产了四千五百公尺的织品。
    节约纱的来源很多。每一个纺织女工都在力求减少断头的次数，在梭子里把线装好，使织机保持良好的状态。
    工厂的合理化建议者和发明者展开了巨大而有益的工作。在去年十个月内，他们提出了一百八十六件合理化建议。仅是被采用到生产中去的那一百一十六件建议，就使工厂节约了五十万卢布。
    青年们
    这里有纺织女工、共青团员卡嘉·米尔科娃。她是被分配去管理自动织机的第一批女工中的一个。她很快就掌握了新的织机。从工厂艺徒学校中所获得的知识和在实习班里的学习，给了她帮助。现在，这位年轻的女工看管着四台织机以代替定额所规定的两台。她经常超额完成任务，所出的产品全是优等的。米尔科娃在去年十一月十八日完成了自己的五年计划，这就是说她提前一年零一个半月完成了这个计划。她保证将在五年计划终了以前超计划生产三万五千多公尺的织品。
    卡嘉·米尔科娃仍在继续学习。她很顺利地把车间工作和在纺织专科夜校中的学习结合起来。这位先进工作者在夜校中也是高材生。在我们工厂里，像卡嘉·米尔科娃这样的人是很多的。
    应该说，在昆宰伏纺织工厂的青年们中间，很多人是很渴望学习和求得知识的。工厂内每三个青工中间就有一个是在学院里学习，另一个是在技术专科学校里学习，第三个是在工厂青年工人学校里学习。
    自然，一面工作一面学习是一件困难的事情，可是青年工人们却能克服这一切困难。
    青年工人们和富有经验的老干部一起，正在高度地保持着自己纺织厂的荣誉。（附图片）
