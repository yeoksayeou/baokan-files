    Northeast State Farms Administration's various farms have basically completed their spring planting preparations. All 4,200+ tons of wheat seeds have been prepared and selected, including over 3,500 tons of rust-resistant and moisture-resistant superior varieties, enough to sow over 23,000 hectares, accounting for 87.5% of the total wheat sowing area. In order to improve seed quality, most farms have conducted more than two rounds of fine selection of wheat seeds, and have also carried out seed drying and multiple germination tests. The seed germination rate generally reaches about 90%. All of the planned 850+ tons of soybean seeds have also been prepared, most of which have been finely selected. In order to increase yields, all farms have decided to apply large amounts of fertilizer. Currently, the farms have produced over 2,200 tons of phosphate fertilizer and granular fertilizer, enough to fertilize over 17,000 hectares of wheat fields, accounting for 63% of the sown area. The farms have also collected over 6,000 tons of stable manure and are preparing it for fermentation and application. The overhaul of over 100 tractors at the farms has been basically completed, and the repair quality has been greatly improved. (Ding Lüshu)

    东北各农场完成备耕工作
    东北国营农场管理局所属各农场的春耕准备工作已基本完成。四千二百多吨麦种已全部备齐选完，其中抗锈耐湿的优良品种共三千五百多吨，可播种两万三千多公顷，占全部小麦播种面积的百分之八十七点五。为了提高种子质量，多数农场对麦种还进行了两次以上的精选，并作了晒种和多次发芽试验，种子发芽率大部分达到百分之九十左右。大豆种子计划需用八百五十多吨，也已全部备妥，其中大部分进行了精选。为了提高产量，各场都决定大量施肥。现在各场已制出磷粉，颗粒肥料二千二百多吨，可施一万七千多公顷麦地，占播种面积的百分之六十三。各场并收集了厩肥六千多吨，正在进行发酵准备施用。各场百余台拖拉机的检修工作已基本完成，修理质量有很大提高。（丁履枢）
