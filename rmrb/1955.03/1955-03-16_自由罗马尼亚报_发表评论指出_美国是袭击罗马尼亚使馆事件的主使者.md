Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 12th: The "Free Romania" newspaper published an article on the 12th commenting on the attack on the Romanian Embassy in Switzerland.

The article points out that the robbery of the Romanian Embassy in Switzerland is reminiscent of the widespread traditions and rampant behavior in the world ruled by the Wall Street giants, as everyone knows. Some Americans who oppose easing international tensions are using various funds allocated by the United States Congress to organize robberies like the one in Bern.

The article points out that in order to organize this criminal activity, the United States has established various special agencies, led by people who play an important role in American political life. These people and these agencies play an important role in the "Cold War" conducted by the American ruling group. The article goes on to point out that the American side described the Bern incident as "a victory for a major propaganda campaign in the scope of the Cold War." Needless to say, this admission by the United States cannot please the Swiss authorities at all. In fact, as revealed in the press, the Swiss authorities are already feeling uneasy because several facts have clearly proved that the United States is the mastermind behind the attack after the incident.

The article lists evidence proving the close relationship between the United States and this incident. It particularly points out that at the time of the Bern incident, the chairman and secretary-general of the so-called "Free Romanian League," employed by the U.S. intelligence agency, were both in Bern. The press conference held by the secretary-general in Paris not long ago showed that both of them were familiar with the details of the attack. This clearly shows the role they played in this incident. However, the Swiss Federal Police released them immediately after questioning, allowing the two criminals to leave Switzerland.

The article concludes by saying that the Bern attack once again powerfully proves the threat of the U.S.-led imperialist aggressive policy to the people of the world. Therefore, world public opinion severely condemns the people who organized this criminal event.

### “自由罗马尼亚报”发表评论指出  美国是袭击罗马尼亚使馆事件的主使者

    “自由罗马尼亚报”发表评论指出
    美国是袭击罗马尼亚使馆事件的主使者
    【新华社讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特十二日讯：“自由罗马尼亚报”十二日发表一篇文章，评论罗马尼亚驻瑞士公使馆被袭击事件。
    文章指出，袭击罗马尼亚驻瑞士使馆的强盗行为，使人想起大家都知道的华尔街巨头们统治的世界中广泛的传统和到处盛行的行为。一些反对缓和国际紧张局势的美国人士，利用美国国会拨出的各种基金，来组织像在伯尔尼那样的强盗行为。
    文章指出，美国为了组织这种犯罪活动，成立了各种特别机构，由在美国政治生活中有重要作用的人来领导。这些人和这些机构，在美国统治集团进行的“冷战”中起着重要作用。文章接着指出，美国方面把伯尔尼事件说成是“冷战范围中一次重大的宣传行动的胜利”。不用说，美国的这种承认丝毫也不能使瑞士当局感到高兴。事实上，在像报界所透露的，瑞士当局已感到不安，因为在袭击事件发生后已经有若干事实明确地证明美国是组织这次袭击的幕后主使者。
    文章列举了证明美国方面和这一事件的密切关系的证据。它特别指出，伯尔尼事件发生时，受美国间谍机关雇用的所谓“自由罗马尼亚联盟”主席和总书记二人都在伯尔尼。这个总书记不久以前在巴黎举行的记者招待会表明，他们两个人都是熟悉这次袭击事件的详情的。这清楚地说明了他们在这一事件中所起的作用。但是，瑞士联邦警察却在讯问过后立刻释放了他们，让这两个罪犯离开瑞士。
    文章最后说，伯尔尼袭击事件再一次有力地证明了以美国为首的帝国主义侵略政策对世界人民的威胁，所以，世界舆论都对组织这次罪恶事件的人予以严厉的斥责。
