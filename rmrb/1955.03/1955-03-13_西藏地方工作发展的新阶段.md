The seventh meeting of the State Council passed resolutions on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, on matters concerning assistance to Tibet in construction, and on issues related to transportation in Tibet; at the same time, it approved the agreement reached between the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee on historical and pending issues, expressing satisfaction. The implementation of these decisions and the resolution of internal Tibetan issues will further strengthen the great unity of all strata of the Tibetan people under the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, strengthen the great unity of the Han and Tibetan peoples, and promote the political, economic, and cultural development and progress of Tibet. This marks a new stage in the development of work in Tibet and another great victory for the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies.

Over the past four years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the close unity and joint efforts of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet, and the working personnel in Tibet, the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet has been implemented. Achievements have been made in the political, economic, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in Tibet, the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet has been strengthened, border defenses have been strengthened, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the Tibetan people has continued to grow. These developments have laid a good foundation for the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy in Tibet and for further building a new Tibet with the help of the state.

According to Article 15 of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, a military and administrative committee should be established in Tibet. However, now that our country's Constitution has been promulgated, the Constitution clearly stipulates that regional autonomy is implemented in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, and the original military and administrative committees of the major administrative regions have been abolished. In particular, since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, significant achievements have been made in various aspects of work, and the situation is very different from when the agreement was signed in 1951. Therefore, the decision not to establish a military and administrative committee in Tibet but to establish a preparatory committee for the autonomous region is fully in line with the spirit of the Constitution and the current specific circumstances of Tibet.

Implementing ethnic regional autonomy is the basic policy for solving ethnic issues in our country. The facts after the implementation of regional autonomy in many other ethnic minority areas across the country prove that ethnic minority people, after obtaining the right to "be masters of their own house" in managing the internal affairs of their own nationalities, have universally enhanced their political enthusiasm, initiative, and patriotism, strengthened the unity between and within various nationalities, and closely linked the autonomous organs with the people, gradually promoting the political, economic, and cultural development of various ethnic minorities. We believe that Tibet will achieve further development in all aspects during the preparation period for the implementation of regional autonomy and after the formal establishment of the autonomous region.

Based on the experience of many places, the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy is a complex and meticulous task. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region should fully consider the characteristics of Tibet's political, economic, cultural, religious beliefs, and customs in its work process, strive to unite people from all walks of life, accelerate the training of ethnic cadres necessary for future autonomous organs, accumulate work experience, and create various conditions for the future formal establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region.

In the past, due to the long-term implementation of ethnic oppression and divisive policies by the Manchu Qing government and the Kuomintang reactionary government, and due to the instigation of imperialism, Tibet had long been in a state of division. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, according to the agreement, the Panchen Erdeni, welcomed by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people, smoothly returned to Tibet in 1951 and restored his inherent status and powers. This time, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni came to Beijing together, and following Chairman Mao's instructions, important officials of the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, who accompanied them to Beijing, conducted friendly discussions on historical and pending issues between the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee based on the spirit of mutual trust, mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual assistance, formulated solutions, and reached an agreement unanimously agreed upon by both parties. This is another important development in the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality following the restoration of good relations between the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni in 1951. The conclusion of this agreement further creates favorable conditions for the establishment of unified autonomous organs and other political and economic constructions in Tibet.

In recent years, the achievements made in Tibet in political, economic, and cultural aspects are inseparable from the help of the Communist Party and the People's Government. However, due to difficulties in transportation and many other difficulties that have not been resolved, past assistance to the Tibetan people has been subject to many restrictions. Now that the Kang-Tibet Highway and the Qing-Tibet Highway have both been opened to traffic to Lhasa, this has created more favorable conditions for helping Tibet develop its construction undertakings in the future. The State Council's decision on helping Tibet carry out construction matters and the decision on issues related to transportation in Tibet are aimed at further assisting Tibet in developing construction undertakings in various fields. According to these two decisions, the state will continue to carry out maintenance and upkeep work on the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet Highways, strengthen management, so that these two highways can play a greater role in transportation, and continue to build roads in Tibet; at the same time, it is necessary to establish hydropower and thermal power stations and leather factories in Lhasa, Xigaze, and other places, small iron factories, build river dikes and dams, expand agricultural experimental farms, allocate water pumps, expand schools, build urban streets and houses, and allocate one million yuan as agricultural tool purchase funds. The backward state of the Tibet region caused by the long-term reactionary rule of the Manchu Qing government, the Kuomintang government, and the invasion of foreign imperialism will gradually be changed with the implementation of these decisions. Tibet is a place with abundant resources, and its development prospects are bright; however, because the construction of our entire country can only be carried out with emphasis at present, the construction of the Tibet region can only be carried out step by step with emphasis under possible conditions.

In order to gradually develop the construction undertakings in Tibet, we must continuously strengthen and consolidate the unity between and within nationalities under the unified will of anti-imperialism and patriotism. The great unity of all nationalities is the source of our country's strength and an important condition for opposing imperialist aggression and building our country into a great socialist country. In order to further strengthen the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, the People's Liberation Army and state personnel entering Tibet must continue to earnestly implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, overcome the great-Han chauvinism thoughts that remain in the minds of some people, respect the customs and religious beliefs of the Tibetan people at all times and in all places, enthusiastically and patiently unite and help Tibetan cadres, and diligently serve the Tibetan people for a long time. Tibetan cadres should also study hard, strengthen anti-imperialist and patriotic thinking, welcome the help of Han cadres, and prevent and overcome local nationalism tendencies. Religious and secular officials of the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, as well as the religious and secular people of Tibet, should also earnestly implement the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and the agreement reached in Beijing this time on resolving historical and pending issues, unite as one, and strive to build a new Tibet.

In order to seek further development and progress for themselves and gradually enter the ranks of advanced nationalities, it is of course necessary for the Tibetan nationality to steadily carry out some reforms within Tibet. However, the internal reforms in Tibet must be suitable for the characteristics of the current stage of development in Tibet, must be based on the will of the majority of the Tibetan people and their leaders, and must be carried out by the Tibetan nationality themselves. When Chairman Mao met with Do-ga Pengcuo Raojie, the head of the Tibet National Day observation group, and others in October 1953, he instructed: "The development of Tibet's politics, economy, culture, and religion mainly depends on the Tibetan leaders and people themselves to discuss and do it, and the central government only helps. This is written in the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. But to do it, it still takes time, and it must be done gradually according to your wishes. If it can be done, do it; if it cannot be done, wait a while; if it can be done, and most people agree, it is not good not to do it. It can be done more slowly, so that everyone is happy, and it will be faster."

The Tibetan people firmly believe in Buddhism. Their freedom of religious belief is protected by our country's Constitution. Will their freedom of religious belief still be protected after socialist construction is successful in the future? Regarding this issue, Chairman Mao has long made it clear: "The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, and believers and non-believers, believers of this religion or believers of other religions, are all protected, and their beliefs are respected. Today, a policy of protecting religion is adopted, and a policy of protecting religion will still be adopted in the future."

In the nearly four years since the liberation of Tibet, the increasing unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, the increasing unity within the Tibetan nationality, and the increasing closeness of the relationship between Tibet and the central government are all major victories for the people of all nationalities in our country. The greater our victory, the more the imperialists will resent us. In recent years, the imperialists have tried every possible means to separate the nationalities of our country in order to achieve the goal of re-enslaving the nationalities of our country. The people of all nationalities in our country must be vigilant and not give the imperialists any opportunity for conspiracy. Let us, the Han and Tibetan nationalities and other nationalities, unite more closely and strive to oppose imperialist aggression and build a great socialist motherland.

    西藏地方工作发展的新阶段
    国务院第七次会议通过了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会、关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项和关于有关西藏交通运输问题等决定；同时对于西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间关于历史和悬案问题的谈判达成的协议作了批复，表示满意。这些决定的实施和西藏内部问题的解决，将进一步加强西藏各阶层人民在反帝爱国旗帜下的大团结，加强汉藏两族人民的大团结，并且促进西藏地方政治、经济和文化的发展和进步。这标志着西藏地方工作发展的一个新阶段，标志着中国共产党的民族政策的又一伟大胜利。
    近四年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、西藏人民、人民解放军进藏部队和进藏工作人员的亲密团结和共同努力下，执行了和平解放西藏办法的协议，西藏地方的政治、经济、文化教育和卫生事业都有成绩，汉藏民族之间和西藏内部的团结日益加强，边疆国防日益加强，西藏人民的爱国热情也不断增长。这些发展，给西藏地方实行民族的区域自治和更进一步在国家帮助下建设新西藏打下了良好的基础。
    根据和平解放西藏办法的协议第十五条，在西藏应该成立军政委员会，但是现在我国宪法已经颁布，宪法中明文规定各少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治，而且原有各大行政区的军政委员会都已撤销，特别是西藏和平解放以来，各方面的工作都有了显著的成绩，情况已经和一九五一年签订协议的当时有了很大的不同，因此决定在西藏地方不成立军政委员会而成立自治区筹备委员会，是完全符合宪法精神和西藏当前具体情况的。
    实行民族区域自治，是解决我国民族问题的基本政策。全国其他许多少数民族地区实行区域自治以后的事实证明，少数民族人民在得到了管理本民族内部事务上的“当家作主”权利以后，普遍地增强了政治上的积极性、自动性和爱国热情，加强了各民族之间和各民族内部的团结，密切了自治机关同人民之间的联系，逐渐促进了各少数民族政治、经济、文化的发展。我们相信西藏地方在筹备实行区域自治期间和正式成立自治区以后，将在各方面得到进一步的发展。
    根据许多地方的经验，实行民族区域自治是一项复杂细致的工作，因此西藏自治区筹备委员会在它的工作过程中，应该充分估计西藏地区政治、经济、文化、宗教信仰、风俗习惯等方面的特点，努力团结各方面人士，加紧培养为将来自治机关所必需的民族干部，积累工作经验，为将来正式成立统一的西藏自治区创造各种条件。
    过去，由于满清政府和国民党反动政府长期实行民族压迫和分化政策，由于帝国主义的挑拨离间，西藏内部曾经长期处于分裂状态。西藏和平解放以后，根据协议，在达赖喇嘛和西藏人民的欢迎下，班禅额尔德尼在一九五一年顺利地返回了西藏，恢复了固有的地位和职权。这次达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼共同来到北京，又遵照毛主席的指示，由随行来京的西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会的重要官员根据互相信任、互相尊重、互相谅解、互相帮助的精神，对西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间关于历史和悬案问题进行了友好的商讨，拟定了解决的办法，达成了双方一致同意的协议。这是继一九五一年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼恢复和好关系之后，西藏民族内部团结上的又一重要发展。这项协议的达成，进一步为西藏地方统一的自治机关的建立和其他政治、经济的建设带来了有利的条件。
    几年来，西藏地方在政治、经济、文化各方面所取得的成绩，是同共产党和人民政府的帮助分不开的。但是由于交通运输困难和其他许多困难没有解决，过去对西藏人民的帮助还受很多的限制。现在康藏公路和青藏公路都已经通车到拉萨，这就给今后帮助西藏发展建设事业创造了更有利的条件。国务院关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项的决定，关于有关西藏交通运输问题的决定，就是为了进一步帮助西藏地区发展各方面的建设事业。根据这两项决定，国家将继续对康藏、青藏公路进行整修、养护工作，加强管理，使这两条公路能够在交通运输上起更大的作用，并在西藏继续修筑公路；同时要在拉萨、日喀则等地分别建立水力、火力发电站和皮革厂，小型铁工厂，修筑河堤水坝，扩充农业试验场，拨给抽水机，扩建学校，修筑市内街道、房舍，并拨给一百万元作为农业工具购置费。西藏地区因长期遭受满清政府、国民党政府反动统治和外国帝国主义侵略而造成的落后状态，将随着这些决定的实施而逐步得到改变。西藏是一个资源丰富的地方，它的发展前途是光辉灿烂的；但是由于我们整个国家的建设目前都还只能有重点地进行，所以西藏地区的建设也只能在可能的条件下有重点地一步一步进行。
    为了逐步发展西藏地区的建设事业，我们必须在反帝爱国的统一意志之下，不断地加强和巩固民族之间和民族内部的团结。各民族的大团结是我们国家力量的泉源，是反对帝国主义侵略、把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家的重要条件。为了进一步加强汉藏民族之间的团结，进藏的人民解放军和国家工作人员必须继续认真执行和平解放西藏办法的协议，克服某些人头脑中残存着的大民族主义思想，随时随地尊重藏族人民的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，热忱地耐心地团结和帮助藏族干部，勤勤恳恳地长期为西藏人民服务。藏族干部也应该努力学习，加强反帝爱国思想，欢迎汉族干部的帮助，防止和克服地方民族主义倾向。西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会的僧俗官员，以及西藏的僧俗人民，也应该认真执行和平解放西藏办法的协议和这次在北京达成的关于解决历史和悬案问题的协议，团结一致为建设新的西藏而努力。
    西藏民族为了谋取自己进一步的发展和进步，使自己逐步进入先进民族的行列，当然有必要在西藏内部稳步地进行一些改革。但西藏地方的内部改革必须适合西藏地方当前发展阶段的特点，必须根据西藏民族大多数人民和他们的领袖人物的意志，由西藏民族自己去进行。毛主席一九五三年十月在接见西藏国庆观礼团团长朵噶·彭错饶杰等人时曾指示说：“西藏政治、经济、文化、宗教的发展，主要靠西藏的领袖和人民自己商量去做，中央只是帮助。这点是在和平解放西藏办法的协议里写了的。但是要做，还得一个时间，而且要根据你们的志愿逐步地做。可做就做，不可做就等一等；能做的，大多数人同意了的，不做也不好。可以做得慢一些，让大家都高兴，这样反而就快了。”
    西藏人民笃信佛教。他们的宗教信仰自由是受到我国宪法的保护的。将来社会主义建设成功以后，他们的宗教信仰自由是不是仍然会受到保护呢？关于这一问题，毛主席早就明确指出过：“共产党对宗教采取保护政策，信教的和不信教的，信这种教的或信别种教的，一律加以保护，尊重其信仰，今天对宗教采取保护政策，将来也仍然采取保护政策。”
    西藏解放的将近四年以来，汉藏民族的日益团结，西藏民族内部的日益团结，西藏地方和中央的关系的日益紧密，这些都是我国各族人民的重大胜利。我们的胜利越大，帝国主义就越发嫉恨我们。几年来，帝国主义曾经千方百计地妄想分离我国各民族，借以达到重新奴役我国各民族的目的。我国各民族人民必须提高警惕，不要给帝国主义以任何阴谋活动的机会。让我们汉藏民族和其他各民族都更紧密地团结起来，为反对帝国主义侵略，建设伟大的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
