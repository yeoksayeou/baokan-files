Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris, according to TASS: French Communist Party Secretary Duclos published an article in "l'Humanité" on the 18th, calling on the French people to strengthen the struggle against the Paris Accords on the eve of the Republic Senate's debate on the ratification of the Paris Accords. He pointed out that the United States, Britain, and West Germany are exerting unprecedented diplomatic pressure on France. "But the struggle is not over. Therefore, all measures must be taken immediately to ensure that the Republic Senate must listen to the voice of the people and understand the national sentiment towards the Paris Accords. This is even more necessary as we are on the eve of local elections and the re-election of half of the senators."

At the same time, the French National Peace Council also issued a letter to the French people. The letter to the French people stated: "Under the current circumstances, the Republic Senate's ratification of the Paris Accords is tantamount to surrendering to Adenauer's Germany's demands. Ratification of the Paris Accords would push France onto the dangerous road of an arms race and preparations for atomic war."

The French National Peace Council called on all patriots to express to the senators of the Republic Senate the unanimous national will to reject the Paris Accords.

    据新华社讯：据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党书记杜克洛十八日在“人道报”发表文章，号召法国人民在共和国参议院辩论批准巴黎协定问题的前夕加强反对巴黎协定的斗争。他指出：美、英和西德三国正在对法国施行史无前例的外交压力。“但是斗争还没有结束。所以必须立即采取一切措施，使共和国参议院必须听取人民的呼声和了解全国对巴黎协定的想法。由于我们正处在地方选举和一半参议员改选的前夕，这样作就更加必要。”
    同时，法国全国和平理事会也发表了告法国人民书。告法国人民书说：“在目前情况下，共和国参议院批准巴黎协定就是向阿登纳德国的要求投降。批准巴黎协定就会把法国推到军备竞赛和准备原子战争的危险道路上去。”
    法国全国和平理事会号召全体爱国人士向共和国参议院议员表示全国一致要求拒绝巴黎协定的意志。
