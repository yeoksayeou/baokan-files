The rationalization proposals of employees in the building materials industry played a role

    Over the past year, in various enterprises of the national building materials industry, a total of more than 10,700 employees have submitted 6,200-plus rationalization proposals. More than 2,900 of these have been adopted by various units, and more than 1,800 have been implemented, creating a net profit value of more than 821,000 yuan (new currency) for the country.

    Many of these rationalization proposals have played a significant role in the over-fulfillment of national plans. For example, Wang Xiliang, a technical worker from the Eighth Cement Plant who looks after cement kilns, after painstaking research, proposed improvements to the Lepol cement kiln equipment, solving the long-standing problem of poor ventilation due to material blockage, which rapidly increased clinker production. This proposal was quickly adopted by the Third Cement Plant and also achieved good results. These two plants can increase the country's clinker production by more than 40,000 tons annually, creating a net profit value of more than 270,000 yuan. After the Fourth Cement Plant adopted the suggestion of using waste model gypsum to replace natural gypsum in cement production, it can save the country more than 30,000 yuan annually. After Gao Liyu, a cost member of the Second Glass Factory, was adopted a reasonable proposal for using packing boards, it created wealth worth more than 20,000 yuan for the country in two months.

    Many enterprise leaders pay attention to mass rationalization proposals and have taken effective measures. For example, in order to help employees research incomplete rationalization proposals, the Liulihe Cement Plant formed a reception office composed of mechanical, electrical, chemical, and other professional engineers and experienced technical workers, a total of eight people. They meet with those who make rationalization proposals for five hours every week, which is enthusiastically supported by the masses of employees. However, some enterprises propose topics that are too general, such as "how to increase the output of cement kilns," which makes it impossible for the masses to start. Other enterprises do not deal with employees' rationalization proposals in a timely manner, such as the 76 rationalization proposals received by the First Cement Pipe Factory before July of last year, most of which have not been processed so far, which has affected the enthusiasm of the masses.

    建筑材料工业职工合理化建议发挥了作用
    一年来，全国建筑材料工业各企业中，共有一万零七百多名职工提出合理化建议六千二百多件。已被各单位采纳的有二千九百多件，已经实现的有一千八百多件，给国家创造了八十二万一千多元（新币，下同）的纯利润价值。
    这些合理化建议中，有许多对于国家计划的超额完成起了重大的作用。如第八水泥厂看管水泥窑的技术工人出身的王喜良，经过苦心钻研，提出改进立波尔式水泥窑设备的建议，解决了长期因料子堵塞而通风不良的现象，使熟料产量得到迅速提高。这一建议迅速被第三水泥厂采用，也获得良好效果。这两厂每年可给国家增产熟料四万多吨，创造纯利润价值二十七万多元。第四水泥厂采纳了利用废模型石膏代替天然石膏来生产水泥的建议后，每年可给国家节约三万多元。第二玻璃厂成本员高立玉合理使用装箱板材的建议被采纳后，两个月就给国家创造价值二万多元的财富。
      许多企业领导干部重视群众合理化建议，并采取了有效措施。如琉璃河水泥厂为了帮助职工研究不完整的合理化建议，由机械、电力、化学等专业工程师和有丰富经验的技术工人共八人组成接待室，每周固定有五个钟头接见提合理化建议者，得到职工群众的热烈拥护。但是有的企业提出的课题太笼统，如“如何提高水泥窑的产量”等，使群众无从着手，还有的企业对职工合理化建议不及时处理，如第一水泥管厂去年七月份以前所收到的七十六件合理化建议，到现在大部分还未处理，影响了群众的积极性。　（徐卓然）
