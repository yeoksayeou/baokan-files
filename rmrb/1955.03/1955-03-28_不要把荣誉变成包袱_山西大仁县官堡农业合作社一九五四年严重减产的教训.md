    Don't Turn Honors into Burdens
    ——The Lesson of the Severe Production Decrease in Guanbao Agricultural Cooperative, Daren County, Shanxi in 1954
    Wu Jianming
    There are some agricultural production cooperative cadres who, after achieving some successes in running their cooperatives and receiving praise and rewards from the Party and the government, make little further improvement in their work. Some even become arrogant, believing that their achievements are solely due to their individual efforts and refusing to rely on the masses. When problems arise in the cooperative, they fear that exposing their shortcomings will lead to a loss of "honor" and are unwilling to report to the Party and the government. Coupled with a lack of regular inspection of the work of these cooperatives by county and district leaders, and a lack of regular education for these cooperative cadres, these cooperatives inevitably embark on a wrong path. The Guanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daren County, Shanxi Province, is one such cooperative.
    
    Production Did Not Improve, Members Became Anxious
    In 1953, the Guanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved relatively good results in production and in leading mutual aid teams. Zhang Shun, the cadre stationed in the cooperative, made some exaggerated reports to higher authorities, and was praised by the county and provincial Party committees, becoming one of the top advanced cooperatives in the county. However, the county Party committee neglected ideological education for the cooperative cadres, and the cadres of this cooperative were blinded by the light of victory, turning honor into a burden. Zhang Shun, the cadre stationed in the cooperative, and Li Fu, the cooperative director, and others were complacent and blindly pursued large-scale cooperatives, but were unwilling to continue working diligently. They considered themselves "truly remarkable," and "stronger than the Chenjiazhuang Cooperative."

    In 1954, the Guanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded rapidly from twenty-five households to one hundred and eighty-two households. The cooperative expanded, but the management work lagged far behind the needs of production development and remained at the 1953 level. At that time, there were some serious problems in this cooperative: the cooperative's production plan was formulated by a few cooperative cadres, without discussion with the members. It was determined very hastily, without reliable guarantees, and the members were not actively supporting it. The entire cooperative of five thousand seven hundred and thirty-seven mu of land, had less than two thousand mu worth of seeds. The labor force was not organized reasonably, labor was not allocated properly, and there were not enough livestock. Some members' determination to join the cooperative was not firm, and their morale was low. The rich peasants were taking the opportunity to engage in sabotage activities. The cooperative cadres could not solve these problems, but they dared not speak out. They mistakenly believed: "Exposing the problems in the cooperative is not beneficial to the cooperative. If other villages know about these situations, wouldn't it lower our prestige?" They were arrogant and self-important, looked down on the cooperative members, and therefore, were unwilling to mobilize the members to democratically discuss and solve these serious problems in the cooperative.

    In 1954, spring plowing had already begun, but the spring plowing preparations of the Guanbao Cooperative were still not well done. At that time, the entire cooperative was "fuming from top to bottom," blaming each other. The cooperative cadres worried about the lack of seeds and complained that the members were not investing. The members sat and waited for work every day, complaining that the cooperative cadres were not assigning them tasks. By the time the seeds were collected in a mixed-up fashion, the sowing season had been missed. The cooperative cadres decided to use the cooperative's cattle to plant more than five hundred mu of land belonging to the landlords, rich peasants, and controlled elements on time. The cooperative's sowing work was delayed for many days. However, the cadre stationed in the cooperative made a false report, saying that "the sowing work was completed half a month ahead of schedule." Because of the late planting, hoeing was even later. During the summer hoeing period, the labor force was allocated unreasonably, and work points were evaluated unfairly. The cooperative cadres did the light and easy work, while other members did the heavy and difficult work. During the summer hoeing, everyone only cared about competing for work points, and the hoed crops were very unsightly. Some members sent their children, who were not yet ten years old, to the fields to grab points. The children could not distinguish between weeds and seedlings, either leaving the weeds or hoeing down the seedlings. The distance between the seedlings was far and near, dense and sparse, and some hoed fields looked like they had not been hoed at all. In the end, more than one hundred mu of land was abandoned.

    During the season when crops grew luxuriantly, the problems with the cooperative's crops became even more obvious. The seeds used for spring sowing were hastily collected, some were early-maturing varieties, some were late-maturing varieties; some were damp, some were diseased. Such seeds would naturally not grow into good crops. Therefore, the crops grew unevenly, and their development was unsound. Most of the millet was diseased. On the same plot of land, some were scorched yellow, some were still green. Of the more than one thousand mu of sorghum planted, eight hundred mu had 40% smut disease, and the harvest was less than half of the original plan. The four hundred mu of mung beans, although they grew well, were frozen to death before they matured because they were planted too late. A large number of the four hundred mu of Chinese yams also died from the severe frost, yielding only two bags per mu, four bags less than the average local farmers' yield on the same land.

    What were the main reasons for the production decrease?
    Why did the Guanbao Cooperative's production go so badly in 1954? When the Daren County Party Committee sent a work team to help them rectify the cooperative, Li Fu, the cooperative director (branch secretary), said: "There are two reasons for the production decrease: one is that there was too much rain, and the other is that the cooperative was too large and lacked experience." Party member Miao Pei put forward a different view: "No one can deny that we suffered from natural disasters, but the main cause was human error!" Several of the cooperative cadres present also said: "Old Miao is right!" Some others disagreed with Miao Pei's opinion.
    
    The work team convened a meeting of cooperative members to discuss this issue. As soon as the words "production decrease" were mentioned, the members became agitated. Party member Chen Jiulin said: "There is only one root cause of the production decrease, and that is our arrogance and complacency from top to bottom." This sentence sparked a heated debate among everyone. Miao Pei said: "I agree that the main root cause is arrogance and complacency, but I don't agree that everyone from top to bottom is arrogant and complacent..." Production team leader Li You found it unpleasant to hear and strongly argued: "Don't blame anyone, just blame the heavens for too much rain, which soaked the crops..." Before he could finish, Miao Pei, who was sitting opposite him, stood up and said: "I ask you, the land outside the cooperative and our land are the same, the crops are the same, why did those who planted on time harvest more than us? Does this 'heavens' treat people differently, only soaking the cooperative's crops, not theirs?" This question replaced what many people wanted to say. As a result of the discussion, everyone agreed with Miao Pei's statement: the main root cause of the production decrease was poor management and the serious arrogance and complacency of the main cooperative cadres. After this discussion, cooperative director Li Fu, deputy director Li Cai, and production team leader Li You all made self-criticisms to the members, admitting their mistakes.

    What should be done in the future?
    What should be done in the future? The members' meeting also discussed this issue.

    They first discussed how to do a good job in winter production, and then studied the issue of formulating the 1955 production plan. Everyone believed: (1) we must learn from the lesson of the hasty and undemocratic formulation of the production plan last year; (2) we must learn from the lesson of only making long-term plans last year, and not making short-term arrangements, which caused chaos in production; (3) we must learn from the lesson of insufficient preparation last year, which caused spring rush, work stoppages, and failure to sow on time. The entire cooperative was divided into four groups for detailed discussion, and then everyone's opinions were gathered and revised the 1955 production plan, and corrected the unreasonable system and labor organization of the past. Many members happily said: "It would be a real ghost if production doesn't increase this year!" Cui De, an old member who didn't like to talk much, also liked to say: "I am relieved now. If the production plan was still formulated like last year, without discussion by everyone, I think there would still be a production decrease. I am most satisfied with the method determined this year. I originally planned to go outside the mouth to make a living after eating the little food I have now, but now I have decided not to go, and I must work hard in the cooperative."

    In order to further improve leadership, the Guanbao Village Party Branch held a meeting to review the branch's neglect of political and ideological education work in 1954 and the damage to the cause of the Party caused by the arrogance and complacency of some comrades. Comrade Li Fu, the branch secretary, said: "This rectification of the cooperative has educated me, made my heart brighter, and made my eyes clearer. I guarantee to everyone here: I will never make that fatal mistake again. I must always remember the lesson of the production decrease, and I must paste the county party committee's notice on this matter with hard skin and save it as a mirror for me to often look at it." Miao Ru, the branch propaganda committee member, said: "This is not only a mirror for you alone, it should be a mirror for every party member of the entire branch."

    They wrote a letter of guarantee to the county party committee, the gist of which is as follows:

    While we were holding a branch meeting, we received the county party committee's criticism of us. We have studied it word by word and carried out criticism and self-criticism. Now, all of our party members feel very happy and excited in our hearts. Why are we happy and excited even after being criticized? Because it has pointed out the direction for our progress. In the past, some comrades in our branch did have extremely serious arrogance and complacency and individualistic thoughts, only reporting achievements and not reporting shortcomings; only willing to let people say good things, and not willing to let people say bad things. Even more wrongly, we had the idea of "overwhelming Chenjiazhuang." We were not striving hard and humbly learning for the socialist cause of the Party, but only thinking about letting the county, province, and even the central government know about our Guanbao Agricultural Production Cooperative. With this wrong idea, we did things wrong. If it weren't for the Party's concern for us and help for us, we wouldn't know where we would have gone wrong. We guarantee to the Party: we must run the agricultural production cooperative well in the future and resolutely complete the task of increasing production and realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture!

    不要把荣誉变成包袱
    ——山西大仁县官堡农业合作社一九五四年严重减产的教训
    武建明
    有这样一些农业生产合作社的干部，他们办社有了一些成绩，受到了党和政府的表扬和奖励之后，在工作上就很少再有什么改进了。其中有些人甚至骄傲起来，以为功劳是他们个人得来的，不肯依靠群众；社里的工作出了问题，也怕暴露了缺点会失去“荣誉”，不肯向党和政府报告。再加上县区领导方面对这些社的工作缺乏经常的检查，对这些社干部缺乏经常的教育，这些社就难免不幸地走上错误的道路。山西省大仁县的官堡农业生产合作社，就是这样的一个社。
    生产没有搞好，社员情绪不安
    官堡农业生产合作社一九五三年在生产上和带动互助组方面得到了比较好的成绩，驻社干部张顺向上级作了一些虚夸的报告，受到了县委、省委的表扬，在全县说来成了数一数二的先进社。可是，县委对社干部忽视了思想教育，这个社的干部被胜利的光芒照花了眼，把荣誉变成了包袱。驻社干部张顺和社长李富等沾沾自喜，盲目地办大社，却不愿再踏踏实实地进行工作。他们自认为“真了不起”，“比陈家庄社也强了”。
      一九五四年，官堡农业生产合作社由二十五户一下子扩大到一百八十二户。社扩大了，但经营管理工作却远远赶不上发展生产的需要，仍然停留在一九五三年的水平。当时，这个社里存在着一些严重的问题：社里的生产计划是少数社干部制定的，没有经过社员讨论，定得很草率，没有可靠的保证，社员们也不积极支持；全社五千七百三十七亩土地，仅有不到二千亩的籽种；劳动力组织得不合理，劳力支配不开，牲畜也不够用；部分社员入社意志不坚定，情绪不高；富农又在乘机进行破坏活动。社里的干部解决不了这些问题，但却不敢说出来。他们错误地认为：“暴露了社里的问题对社没利，让别村知道这些情形，岂不是降低了咱的威信吗？”他们骄傲自大，看不起社员群众，因此，也不肯发动社员民主讨论解决社里的这些严重问题。
    一九五四年的春耕已经开始了，官堡社的春耕准备工作却还做得很不好；那时，全社“上下发毛”，互相埋怨。社务干部发愁籽种不够，嫌社员不投资；社员每天坐着等活干，埋怨社务干部不分配他们干活。等到把种子杂七杂八地凑起来，已误了播种节令。社干部作主用社里的牛犋先给村里的地主、富农、管制分子的五百多亩地按时种上，社里的播种工作却推迟了好多天。可是，驻社干部却做假报告，说“提前半月完成了播种工作”。种得晚，锄得更迟。夏锄期间，劳动力支配得不合理，评工记分不公平，轻活、容易的活社务干部做，重活、难做的活让别的社员做。夏锄当中大家又只顾争分抢工，锄的庄稼都很不像样。有的社员把不满十岁的孩子们也打发到地里去抢分，孩子们连草和苗都分不清，不是留了草便是锄掉了苗，苗的距离远的远，近的近，稠的稠，稀的稀，有些锄过的田像是没有锄。最后还抛荒了一百多亩。
    庄稼茂长的季节，社里的庄稼的毛病就更明显了。春季播种时用的是急忙忙凑起来的种子，有的是早熟品种，有的是晚熟品种；有的是潮湿的，有的是有病的。这样的种子，自然不会长出好庄稼来。因此，庄稼长的七高八低，发育不健全，谷子大部分害了病。同是一块地，有的焦黄了，有的还发绿。种了一千多亩高粱，就有八百亩发生了百分之四十的黑穗病，收获量不足原计划的一半。四百亩绿豆，虽然长得还好，但因为种得太迟，没有熟就冻死啦。四百亩山药也遭了大霜死了不少，每亩只收两口袋，比当地一般农民相同的土地每亩少收四口袋。减产的主要原因是什么
      一九五四年官堡社的生产为什么搞得这样糟？当中共大仁县委派工作组去帮助他们整顿这个社的时候，社长李富（支部书记）说：“减产有两个原因：一是下雨太多，二是社大没经验。”党员苗培提出了不同的意见：“受了天灾谁也不能否认，可是主要的还是人灾！”在座的社务干部有几个人也说：“老苗说的很对！”也有些人不同意苗培的意见。
    工作组召开社员大会讨论了这个问题。一提到“减产”这两个字，社员们就激动起来了。党员陈九林说：“减产的主根子只有一个，就是我们自上而下的骄傲自满。”他这一句话引起了大家的一阵热烈争论。苗培义说：“我同意说主根子是骄傲自满，可是不同意说自上而下都骄傲自满，……”生产队长李有听得不入耳了，便强辩说：“谁也不要怨，只怨老天爷下雨过多，把庄稼泡……”没等他说完，在他对面坐着的苗培便站起来说：“我问你，社外的地和咱们的地一样，庄稼也一样，为什么人家按时种上的比咱们的收的多？一个‘老天爷’，莫非对人是两样看待，只泡社里的，不泡他们的？”这一质问，代替了许多人要说的话。讨论的结果，大家都同意了苗培的说法：减产的主根子是经营管理不善和主要社干部的严重的骄傲自满。经过这样讨论以后，社长李富、副社长李才、生产队长李有，也都向社员作了检讨，承认了错误。以后应该怎么办
    以后应该怎么办呢？社员大会也进行了讨论。
    他们先讨论了怎样做好冬季生产工作，然后研究了制定一九五五年生产计划的问题。大家认为：（一）要接受去年制定生产计划草率、不民主的教训；（二）要接受去年只做常年计划，没做短期安排造成生产上的混乱情况的教训；（三）要接受去年准备不足造成春忙、窝工和不能按时下种的教训。全社分成四个小组进行了详细的讨论，然后把大家的意见集中起来，修订了一九五五年的生产计划，把过去的不合理的制度和劳动组织都改正了。有不少社员高兴地说：“今年不增产才真有鬼！”老不爱多说话的社员崔德也喜欢地说：“这一下我才放心了。要是还像去年那样制定生产计划，不通过大家讨论，我看还是要减产。今年定的办法我最满意。我原来准备把眼下那点粮食吃完就要走口外求生，现在我已决定不走了，一定要在社里好好地劳动。”
    为了更进一步地改进领导，中共官堡村支部开会检查了支部在一九五四年忽视政治思想教育工作和一部分同志的骄傲自满情绪，对党的事业的损害。支部书记李富同志说：“这次整顿合作社教育了我，使我的心更亮了，使我的眼更明了。我在这里向大家保证：今后决不再犯那致命的错误了。我要时时刻刻记着减产的教训，要把县委关于这件事的通报糊上硬皮子保存起来，作为我的一面镜子，时常照照它。”支部宣传委员苗儒说：“这不仅是你一个人的镜子，应该作为全支部每个党员的镜子。”
    他们给县委写了一份保证书，大意如下：
    我们正在开支部大会的时候，接到了县委批评我们的通报。我们逐字逐句地学习过了，并且开展了批评和自我批评。现在，我们全体党员心中觉得十分愉快和兴奋。为什么受了批评还愉快兴奋呢？因为它指明了我们前进的方向。过去我们支部里有些同志确实在思想上是有极其严重的骄傲自满和个人主义思想，只报成绩，不报缺点；只愿让人说好，不愿让人说坏。更错误地是有“压倒陈家庄”的想法。不是为了党的社会主义事业艰苦奋斗，虚心学习；只想着要让县、省甚至中央都知道有我们这个官堡农业生产合作社。有了这错误想法，就把事情做错了。要不是党关心我们，帮助我们，我们还不知道要走错到哪里去。我们向党保证：今后一定要把农业生产合作社办好，坚决完成增加生产和实现对农业的社会主义改造的任务！
