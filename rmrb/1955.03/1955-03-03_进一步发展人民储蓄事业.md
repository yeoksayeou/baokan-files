    Further Develop the People's Savings Undertaking
    Wang Weicai

    I.

    Since the State Council promulgated the order on February 21 regarding the issuance of new Renminbi and the recall of old Renminbi from March 1, people across the country have expressed their warm support. The increased savings deposits in branches and sub-branches of the People's Bank of China in various places these days fully prove this point. For example, in Beijing, savings deposits increased by more than 11.3 billion old currency yuan (equivalent to 1.13 million new currency yuan) in the four days from February 21 to 24. Moreover, new depositors increased; one savings office alone added 1,307 new accounts, including 706 fixed deposit accounts. In Shanghai, the number of deposit transactions increased and the number of withdrawal transactions decreased in more than 270 savings offices on February 21 and 22. According to statistics from seven factory districts, including Jiangning and Yangshupu, deposits on February 21 increased by 2.2 billion old currency yuan (equivalent to 220,000 new currency yuan) compared to February 19. Cities such as Tianjin, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Hangzhou have also each added thousands of new depositors in these days.

    II.

    The people's heartfelt support for the issuance of the new Renminbi is by no means accidental. It is a manifestation of the people's firm trust in the Renminbi, based on their experience in actual life.

    Everyone who has suffered from the Kuomintang reactionary government's inflation policy will recall that the Kuomintang reactionary rule staged several tricks of "currency reform": the "Legal Tender Reform" in 1935, the issuance of "Gold Yuan Certificates" in 1948, and the issuance of "Silver Yuan Certificates" on the eve of its impending collapse on the mainland, repeatedly squeezing the people's blood and sweat. From June 1937 to May 1949, the amount of currency issued increased by more than 170 billion times. As prices soared, interest rates rose as high as 1,200 yuan per thousand yuan per day. At that time, the number of clearing transactions exceeded bank deposits by thirty times, meaning that each yuan of currency had to pass through the hands of thirty people in a single day, because no one wanted to hold the bogus currency and watch the "paper money evaporate." As a result, gold, US dollars, silver dollars, and even cotton yarn and cloth were used as chips, and the bogus currency could no longer become the main means of payment. In this situation, the people had neither the strength to save nor the desire to keep these bogus currencies. Therefore, the savings deposit item existed only in name in the bank's accounts.

    The monetary system under the management of the Communist Party and the People's Government is entirely for the service of the people. As early as the initial period of liberation, when the People's Government was eliminating the bogus currency of the Kuomintang reactionary government and prohibiting the speculative circulation of foreign currencies and gold and silver by issuing Renminbi, that is, when financial and commodity prices had not yet been completely stabilized, the People's Government, in order to protect the people from the losses caused by price fluctuations, safeguard the people's lives, and cultivate the people's habit of saving, successively launched inflation-adjusted savings in various places. Later, according to the needs of the masses, "flexible" and "principal-protected" savings were introduced, which were supported by the broad masses. For example, in Shanghai, 330,000 inflation-adjusted savings accounts were opened in one and a half months, which shows that the people wholeheartedly supported these measures of the People's Government.

    Thanks to the support of our gradually developing industrial and agricultural production, our increasingly abundant gold and silver and commodity reserves, and our national budget, which has had surpluses year after year, the material foundation for the stability of the Renminbi's value has become increasingly solid. Since the unification of financial and economic work in March 1950, a situation of long-term stability in finance and commodity prices has emerged. The consistent stability of finance and commodity prices and the gradual increase in people's income have led to the rapid development of people's savings. The progress of people's savings in recent years is as follows (including urban and rural areas):
    Year                1949     1950      1951      1952       1953       1954
    Amount (10,000 new yuan)   1,007     13,170    54,337    86,088     131,918     163,979
    Percentage           100      1,307     5,396     8,548      13,100     16,283

    The above statistics tell us that in a short period of about five years, with the active encouragement of the People's Government and the enthusiastic participation of the people, people's savings deposits have increased 162 times. This 1,639,790,000 new yuan in savings deposits is equal to 5.97 percent of China's 1954 national budget revenue.

    In this huge amount of savings deposits, fixed deposits have risen from about 20 percent of the total in 1951 to about 50 percent of the total in 1954. In individual cities such as Beijing, it accounts for 73 percent of the total. The average storage days of savings deposits have also increased from 33 days in 1951 to 112 days. From 1954, the people across the country saved more than 300 million new yuan more than in 1953 after over-subscribing to the economic construction bonds. These situations not only fully reflect the gradual improvement of people's living standards, but also powerfully demonstrate the increasingly stable value of the Renminbi. Workers in Shanghai said: "In the past, we went to pawnshops; now, we go to banks." What a stark contrast!

    III.

    The People's Government not only encourages and protects people's saving, but also, within the limits allowed by the state's financial situation, cleared the bad debts left over by the Kuomintang reactionary government—pre-liberation deposits. In view of the fact that the pre-liberation deposit problem was related to the vital interests of many people, and that the majority of the small depositors, who accounted for 80 percent of the depositors, deposited savings earned through labor, the People's Government promulgated the "Measures for the Payment of Uncleared Deposits of Silver and Money Industries before Liberation" on February 20, 1953, which reasonably and fairly solved this problem. By August 1954, according to statistics from 546 clearing locations across the country, a total of more than 393,000 accounts were repaid, amounting to 37.77 million new yuan. The depositors who received the repayments wrote letters thanking the People's Government for its concern. In particular, depositors of the Banque Franco-Chinoise, a financial institution used by imperialism to plunder old China, felt even more that only the Communist Party and the People's Government could be so concerned about and protect the interests of the people.

    IV.

    Our country has begun planned construction since 1953—gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization. This is the highest interest of the people of the whole country, because the purpose of realizing socialist industrialization is to further meet the needs of the people's material and cultural lives. However, realizing socialist industrialization requires a large amount of funds.

    People's savings is one of the important ways to accumulate funds for the country's socialist industrialization. When the Soviet Union was implementing the first Five-Year Plan, the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union pointed out in its instruction issued on February 1, 1932: "The great tasks of socialist construction in the third year of the Five-Year Plan require strengthening socialist accumulation in the Soviet Union, especially the extensive development of the savings undertaking."

    This year is the third year of our country's first Five-Year Plan construction. In this year, the country needs a lot of funds to invest in capital construction. The issuance of the new Renminbi will further consolidate our country's monetary system and provide more favorable conditions for people's savings. Therefore, it is necessary to further develop the people's savings undertaking to support the country's planned construction.

    Our country attaches great importance to the people's savings undertaking. Article 11 of our country's Constitution stipulates that "the state protects the ownership of citizens' legitimate income, savings..." In order to encourage people to participate in savings, the People's Bank of China also provides depositors with various preferential treatments and conveniences.

    First of all, everyone who participates in savings is given a certain amount of interest according to regulations, which can also be regarded as a material reward from the state to all those who support the country's construction with their surplus funds. Since 1952, the People's Bank of China has paid out approximately 80 to 100 million new yuan in such interest each year.

    Participation in savings is entirely voluntary. Therefore, whether it is current or fixed, long-term or short-term, how much to deposit, and whether to record the name and address or not are all determined by each individual. No one can force or order it.

    In order to facilitate depositors to deposit and withdraw funds, the People's Bank of China has widely established many grassroots institutions handling savings in various places, and is gradually increasing them according to actual needs. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of the increasingly developing savings undertaking, it has begun to entrust other institutions and enterprises to act as agents for absorbing savings deposits. In addition, in terms of business hours, various places have also implemented early, noon, evening, and Sunday shifts according to the requirements of depositors. The service attitude of bank staff is also improving day by day.

    In order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, and for a more prosperous and powerful socialist society to arrive sooner, everyone should not only work hard in their respective posts, but also advocate saving and deposit as much of their personal surplus funds into the bank as possible. Don't think that one person's strength is small. If the people across the country save an average of one new yuan per person per month, accumulating little by little, 600 million new yuan can be concentrated in one month. This powerfully helps the country's economic construction. Therefore, participating in savings is an act of supporting the country's socialist industrialization and a manifestation of patriotism. Today, the new Renminbi has been issued. As we are delighted by the further consolidation of our country's monetary system, we firmly believe that the savings undertaking will be further developed.

    进一步发展人民储蓄事业
    王伟才
    一
    自从二月二十一日国务院公布了关于自三月一日起发行新人民币和收回旧人民币的命令以来，全国各地人民都表示热烈拥护。这几天中国人民银行各地分、支行储蓄存款增加的情况充分证明了这一点。如北京，从二月二十一日到二十四日四天中，储蓄存款共增加了旧币一一三亿余元（合新币一一三万余元），而且新的储户增加了，仅一个储蓄所就增加了一三○七户，其中定期储蓄户有七○六户。在上海，二月二十一日、二十二日两天中，二百七十余个储蓄所存款笔数增加，取款笔数减少，根据江宁、杨树浦等七个工厂区的统计，二月二十一日的存款比二月十九日增加了旧币二二亿元（合新币二二万元）；天津、重庆、成都、杭州等城市在这几天中也都各增加了数以千计的新储户。
    二
    人民群众衷心拥护新人民币的发行决不是偶然的，这是人民群众经过实际生活的体验，对人民币有着坚定的信任的表现。
    每一个受到过国民党反动政府通货膨胀政策毒害的人都会想起：在国民党反动统治时期曾经变了几次“币制改革”的把戏，一九三五年的“法币改革”，一九四八年发行“金圆券”，当它在大陆的反动统治快将崩溃的前夕发行了“银圆券”，一次又一次地榨取了人民的血汗。从一九三七年六月到一九四九年五月，通货发行额增加了一千七百多亿倍；随着物价狂涨，利息曾高到每千元日拆一千二百元；当时每天票据交换的数字超过了银行存款三十倍，即是说，每一元货币在一天之内要经过三十个人之手，因为谁都不愿意持着伪币眼瞪着“票子化水”；于是黄金、美钞、银元、甚至棉纱、布匹都当作了筹码，伪币已不能成为主要的支付手段；在这种情况下，人民既没有力量来储蓄，也不愿意来保存这些伪币，因之，储蓄存款科目在银行帐册上形同虚设了。
    共产党和人民政府管理下的货币制度是完全为人民服务的，还在解放初期，当人民政府正以发行人民币来肃清国民党反动政府的伪币，禁止外币和金银投机流通的时候，也就是在金融物价还没有完全稳定的时候，人民政府为使人民免受物价波动的损失，保障人民生活和培养人民节约储蓄的习惯，在各地先后举办了折实储蓄，以后又根据群众的需要举办了“定活两便”和“保本保值”储蓄，受到了广大群众的拥护。如在上海，在一个半月内就开了三十三万个折实储蓄户，可见人民群众对人民政府的这些措施，是衷心拥护的。
    由于我们有逐渐发展的工农业生产的支持；我们有日益充实的金银和商品的储备；我们的国家预算又是年年有余的；人民币币值稳定的物质基础日益巩固，从一九五○年三月财经工作统一以后，就出现了金融物价长期稳定的局面。金融物价的一直保持稳定和人民收入的逐年增加，就使人民储蓄得到了迅速的发展，这几年来人民储蓄的进展情况是：（包括城市和农村）年　份一九四九年一九五○年一九五一年一九五二年一九五三年一九五四年金额（单位新币万元）一、○○七一三、一七○五四、三三七八六、○八八一三一、九一八一六三、九七九百分比一○○一、三○七五、三九六八、五四八一三、一○○一六、二八三
    上述的统计告诉我们，在短短五年左右的时间内，在人民政府的积极鼓励和人民群众的踊跃参加下，人民储蓄存款已经增加了一六二倍，这笔新币一六三、九七九万元的储蓄存款，等于我国一九五四年国家预算收入的百分之五点九七。
    在这笔巨额的储蓄存款中，定期储蓄从一九五一年占总额的百分之二十左右上升到一九五四年占总额的百分之五十左右，个别城市如北京则占到总额的百分之七十三；储蓄存款的平均存储天数也从一九五一年的三十三天上升到一一二天；而从一九五四年来看，全国人民在超额认购经济建设公债后还比一九五三年多储蓄了新币三亿余元；这些情况，不仅充分反映了人民生活水平的逐步提高，而且有力地证明了人民币币值的日趋稳定。上海的工人说：“过去跑当铺，如今上银行。”这是多么强烈的对比！
    三
    人民政府不仅鼓励和保护人民节约储蓄，而且还在国家财政情况允许的条件下，对国民党反动政府遗留下来的烂债——解放前存款进行了清偿。人民政府鉴于解放前存款问题关系到许多人的切身利益，而占存户百分之八十的小额存户中大多数又是以劳动所得的积蓄去存款的，所以在一九五三年二月二十日公布了“关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法”，合情合理地解决了这个问题。到一九五四年八月，根据全国五四六个清偿地点的统计，共计偿付了三十九万三千多户，金额达新币三、七七七万元，受偿存户纷纷写信感谢人民政府的关怀，尤其是万国储蓄会这种帝国主义在旧中国进行搜刮的金融机关的存户，更感觉到只有共产党和人民政府才能这样关怀和保护人民的利益。
    四
    我国已经从一九五三年开始了计划建设——逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，这是全国人民的最高利益，因为，实现社会主义工业化的目的就是为了进一步满足人民的物质和文化生活的需要。但实现社会主义工业化，需要大量的资金。
    人民储蓄就是为国家的社会主义工业化积累资金的重要方法之一。当苏联在实行第一个五年计划的时候，苏联人民委员会在一九三二年二月一日所发的指示中曾经指出：“五年计划的第三年度社会主义建设的巨大任务，要求在苏联更加强社会主义的积累，特别是广泛发展储蓄事业。”
    今年是我国第一个五年计划建设的第三年，在这一年中，国家需要很多资金来投放于基本建设；而新人民币的发行，就会使我国货币制度进一步巩固，为人民储蓄提供了更有利的条件；因之，必须进一步发展人民储蓄事业，来支援国家的计划建设。
    我们国家是非常重视人民储蓄事业的。我国宪法第十一条规定了“国家保护公民的合法收入、储蓄……的所有权”；为了鼓励人民参加储蓄，中国人民银行还给予储户各种优惠待遇和便利。
    首先，对于每一个参加储蓄的人都按照规定给付一定的利息，这也可以看作国家对所有以自己的剩余资金支持国家建设的人的一种物质奖励。这种利息，从一九五二年起，人民银行每年约付出新币八千万到一亿元。
    参加储蓄是完全出于各人自愿。因之，不论活期定期，长期短期，存款多少，以及记上姓名地址或不记姓名地址都是由各人自己来决定的。任何人不能强迫命令。
    为了便利储户存取款项，中国人民银行在各地普遍设立了许多办理储蓄的基层机构，而且还根据实际需要在逐步增设中。同时，为了适应储蓄事业日益发展的需要，已开始委托其他机关企业来代理吸收储蓄存款。此外，在营业时间方面，各地也根据储户要求实行了早、午、晚及星期日班的制度。银行工作人员的服务态度也在日益改善。
    为了实现国家的社会主义工业化，为了更加繁荣富强的社会主义社会早日来到，我们每个人不仅要在各个岗位上努力工作，而且还应该提倡节约储蓄，尽可能将个人的剩余资金存入银行；不要以为一个人的力量小，如果全国人民平均每人每月储蓄新币一元，积少成多，一个月就可集中新币六亿元。这就有力地帮助国家的经济建设。因之，参加储蓄就是支持国家的社会主义工业化的行为，是热爱祖国的表现。今天，新的人民币已经发行，当我们为我国的货币制度进一步巩固而欢欣鼓舞的时候，我们深信储蓄事业必将进一步发展起来。
