Harbin Railway Bureau Employees Launch "Non-Stop Through Intermediate Stations" Competition

    The dispatchers and locomotive crew members of the Harbin Railway Administration are actively engaged in a competition to achieve non-stop passage through intermediate stations, unleashing the latent power of railway transportation.

    Since the fourth quarter of 1954, dispatchers such as Xu Kejun and Qiu Wanjun of the Harbin Sub-bureau have comprehensively studied and applied the advanced working methods of Soviet dispatchers Sudnikov, Gololeva, etc., and experimented with organizing non-stop operations through intermediate stations. Thanks to their creative collaboration with drivers Sun Shigui, Zhang Yupu, and others, trains traveling on the long 145.5-kilometer section between Zhalantun and Ang'angxi, passed through four water supply stations and fourteen intermediate stations, replenishing water and cleaning furnaces without stopping, greatly increasing travel speed. The running time of such trains in the entire section was reduced by an average of one hour and thirty minutes compared to the standard, and the travel speed and technical speed reached 52 kilometers per hour. Their initiative attracted the attention of the majority of locomotive crew members and dispatchers. Many locomotive contracted teams studied and modified the locomotive oil supply devices; dispatchers went deep into locomotive depots and held forums with crew members to understand their requirements and propose competition conditions to each other. This method has now been widely adopted in the Harbin Sub-bureau. The Changchun Sub-bureau, due to its vigorous organization of non-stop operations through intermediate stations, achieved significant results in accelerating the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock. In February, the turnover rate was shortened by 0.22 days compared to January; the overall locomotive turnover was shortened by 0.6 hours, saving an equivalent of 158 locomotive-days for the entire month, which alone saved more than 40,000 yuan in new currency. The rolling stock turnover rate was also shortened by 0.22 days. The whole month was equivalent to saving 12,980 operational vehicles.

    Dispatchers Liang Jialin, Zhu Guangfu, and Wang Fuguo of the Harbin Sub-bureau, recipients of the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal, further organized the accelerated release of trains at hub stations, based on the spirit of this method. This greatly reversed the situation where Binjiang Station was often full of tracks, affecting operations.

    Currently, the number of trains operating non-stop through intermediate stations on various sections within the jurisdiction of other sub-bureaus of the Harbin Railway Administration is also increasing. The Administration is drafting special technical and organizational measures to promote this competition.

    哈尔滨铁路局职工展开中间站不停车竞赛
    哈尔滨铁路管理局的调度员和机车乘务员，积极展开中间站不停车竞赛，发挥了铁路运输的潜在力量。
    一九五四年第四季度以来，哈尔滨分局调度员徐克君、仇万俊等综合地学习运用了苏联调度员苏德尼果夫、郭洛廖娃等的先进工作方法，试验组织了中间站不停车的运行。由于他们和司机孙士贵、张玉璞等的创造性的合作，列车行驶在扎兰屯、昂昂溪间长达一百四十五点五公里的大区间上，通过四个给水站和十四个中间站，不停车上水清炉，旅行速度大大提高。这样的列车在全区段运行时间平均比标准缩短一小时零三十分，旅行速度和技术速度达到五十二公里。他们的创举引起广大机车乘务员和调度员的重视。许多机车包车组研究改装机车给油装置；调度员们深入到机务段和乘务员们举行座谈，了解他们的要求，互相提出竞赛条件。目前在哈尔滨分局已普遍采用了这一方法。长春分局由于大力组织中间站不停车运行，在机车车辆周转的加速上获得显著效果。二月份周转率比一月份缩短了零点二二天；机车全周转缩短零点六小时，全月折合节省机车一百五十八台日，只这一项就节省新人民币四万多元。车辆周转率也随着缩短了零点二二天。全月等于节省一万二千九百八十辆运用车。
    哈尔滨分局调度员、“光荣铁路工作者”奖章获得者梁家麟和朱广福、王富国根据这一方法的精神，更进一步组织了枢纽站的列车加速放行。大大扭转了滨江站过去常常满线而影响运行的情况。
    目前，哈尔滨铁路管理局其他分局管内各区段的中间站不停车运行的列车也在增加。管理局正在拟订专门的技术组织措施推动这一竞赛。
