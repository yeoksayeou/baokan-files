    Zhoushan Fishmeal Factory

    The newly built Zhoushan Fishmeal Factory in Shenjiamen, China's famous fishing port, has started production. This is the first factory on the Zhoushan Islands and also the first fishmeal factory in China. Its completion marks a further development of China's fisheries production and aquatic industry.
    The Zhoushan Islands sea area is the largest fishing ground in China. Here, 160,000 fishermen go out to sea all year round to fish, producing about two million dan (1 dan = 50kg) of yellow croaker, cuttlefish, ribbonfish, Japanese butterfish, smallhead hairtail, sea crabs, jellyfish and other fishery products annually. In the past, fish merchants used to force down prices and refuse to buy, and fish were as worthless as dirt. When there was a surplus of fish that couldn't be sold, they often had no choice but to dump loads of rotten fish back into the sea. After liberation, the number of aquatic product transport ships of the supply and marketing cooperatives increased to six or seven hundred, and the number of handicraft processing factories developed to more than four hundred, expanding the sales channels for fish. The establishment of the Zhoushan Fishmeal Factory has opened up a new avenue for the mechanical processing of fish, and it is a great joy for the fishermen of the Zhoushan Islands. The Zhoushan Fishmeal Factory is a large-scale, mechanized factory. It uses various low-grade miscellaneous fish and unpalatable shark meat that are difficult to transport and sell, as well as waste products left over from canning and inedible fish heads, tails, bones, internal organs and other wastes, to extract fish oil and make fishmeal, turning them into valuable products. In 1954, Zhoushan fishermen caught more than 20 large sharks weighing over 10,000 catties (1 catty = 0.5kg) each in the Shenjiamen area. The fish oil and skin were taken, but the shark meat was sold to farmers as fertilizer because it was not tasty. Now, with the fishmeal factory, this situation can be changed.
    Fishmeal can be used as feed for livestock and poultry. Adding only 10 percent fishmeal to the diet of livestock and poultry can make them grow faster, stronger, and more fertile. This is because fishmeal contains a large amount of protein and minerals. If chickens eat it, those that normally lay two eggs in four days can lay three. Dairy cows can produce more milk, and breeding bulls have stronger mating ability after eating fishmeal. The export value of fishmeal is also very high. With the fishmeal factory, we can not only make use of some low-grade miscellaneous fish and waste products, but also bring great benefits to our animal husbandry and the breeding research work of our scientists.
    More importantly, a large amount of fish oil will be extracted during the production of fishmeal. Fish oil is not only one of the raw materials for manufacturing leather, paints, pigments, and industrial soaps, but can also be used as machine lubricating oil. From cleaning watches to cutting steel in steel plants and machining parts in machine factories, fish oil can be used.
    The Zhoushan Fishmeal Factory in Shenjiamen also has a "fish floss" workshop. Fish floss is very similar to pork floss. It is made from the best fresh fish, with the head, tail, bones, and internal organs removed, and various spices added to make it a top-quality food. Fish floss is highly nutritious, easily digested, and most suitable for children.
    This year, the Zhoushan Fishmeal Factory plans to produce 2,400 tons of fishmeal, 120 tons of fish oil, and nearly 100 tons of fish floss. In the future, a canning factory and a dried seafood factory will also be built near the factory area. At that time, Shenjiamen will have a complete aquatic industry.

    舟山鱼粉厂
    夏景凡
    在我国著名的渔港——沈家门新建的舟山鱼粉厂已经开工生产了。这是舟山群岛上第一座工厂，也是我国第一座鱼粉厂。它的建成，标志着我国渔业生产和水产工业的进一步发展。
    舟山群岛海面，是我国最大的渔场。这里有十六万渔民一年四季出海捕渔，年产黄鱼、墨鱼、带鱼、梅子鱼、虎鱼和海蟹、海蜇等渔产二百万担左右，从前，鱼商惯于压价拒买，鱼像粪土一样不值钱。鱼多了，卖不掉，常常不得不把一担担烂了的鱼倒回海里去。解放后，供销合作社的水鲜运输船增加到六、七百条，手工加工厂发展到四百多处，鱼的销路扩大了。舟山鱼粉厂的建立，又为鱼类的机械加工开辟了一条新的道路，是舟山群岛渔民生活中的一件大喜事。舟山鱼粉厂是一座规模较大的机械化的工厂。它运用各种不好运销的下等杂鱼和不好吃的鲨鱼肉，以及制罐头剩下的废品和不能吃的鱼头、鱼尾、鱼刺、内脏等废物，来榨取鱼油，制作鱼粉，使它成为很有价值的产品。一九五四年，舟山渔民在沈家门一带捕了二十多条上万斤的大鲨鱼，取了鱼油鱼皮，鱼肉因不好吃，只好卖给农民作肥料了。现在有了鱼粉厂，就可以改变这种状况。
    鱼粉可作牲畜和家禽的饲料。在牲畜和家禽的食物中，只要加进百分之十的鱼粉，便能使牲畜和家禽发育快、长得壮、繁殖力强。因为鱼粉含有大量的蛋白质和矿物质，如果给鸡吃了，平常四天下两个蛋的便能下三个。奶牛吃了鱼粉可以多出奶，种牛吃了鱼粉交配力强。鱼粉出口的价值也很高。我们有了鱼粉厂，不但使一部分下等杂鱼和废物得到利用，还给我们的畜牧业和科学家们的配殖研究工作带来很大的好处。
    更重要的是在制作鱼粉中，将榨出大量的鱼油。鱼油不但是制造皮革、油漆、颜料、工业肥皂的原料之一，还可以作机器的润滑油。小至擦钟表，大至钢铁厂切断钢铁，机器厂切削机件，都可用鱼油。
    沈家门的舟山鱼粉厂，还设有“鱼松”车间。鱼松很像肉松，是用最好的鲜鱼除去头尾、鱼刺和内脏，加放各种香料制成的一种最好的食品。鱼松养分大，容易消化，最适于小儿食用。
    今年，舟山鱼粉厂计划生产二千四百吨鱼粉，一百二十吨鱼油和近百吨鱼松。将来，在厂区附近还要建设罐头厂，螟蜅熏干制厂。那时候，沈家门就有一套完整的水产工业。
