The hometown of Lu Xun—the “Shaoxing Lu Xun Memorial Hall” has been newly built in Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province, east of the intersection of Du Chang Fang. Entering the memorial hall, on the left and right are two octagonal doors, "Ying Xu" and "Yan Hui," leading to Lu Xun's former residence and the rest room, respectively. Directly ahead is the dark red, old-style hall gate, which is the Lu Xun Cultural Relics Exhibition Room completed at the end of last year. In the center of the exhibition room, there is a row of redwood screens with Chairman Mao's quotations about Mr. Lu Xun from his book "On New Democracy" inscribed on them. Lu Xun's life photos are arranged in sequence on the surrounding white walls. In the middle and around are displayed Lu Xun's manuscripts, works, and other cultural relics from various periods of his life. The entire exhibition room is spacious, bright, clean, and simple.

The rockery and pavilion next to the Bai Cao Yuan (Hundred Herb Garden) of Lu Xun's former residence have been repaired and a small park has been created for visitors to enjoy.

The Lu Xun Memorial Hall's Cultural Relics Exhibition Room is open daily except for Mondays. On National Day, New Year's Day, Spring Festival, and the anniversaries of Lu Xun's birth and death, Lu Xun's former residence Xin Tai Men, Lu Xun's childhood study place San Wei Shu Wu (Three Flavor Study), and Lu Xun's ancestral residence Lao Tai Men are all open.

Recently, the Shaoxing Lu Xun Memorial Hall has set up a signature station at the entrance against the use of atomic weapons. People who come to view the cultural relics in the exhibition room have solemnly signed their names here.

    绍兴鲁迅纪念馆开放
    鲁迅故乡——浙江绍兴城内都昌坊十字街口东首，新建一座“绍兴鲁迅纪念馆”。跨进纪念馆大门，左右两面是“迎旭”“延晖”两座八角门，分别通向鲁迅故居和休息室。正面是暗红色的古式厅堂大门，这就是去年年底修建完工的鲁迅文物陈列室。在陈列室的正中，有一排红木屏风，上面标着毛主席在“新民主主义论”一书中有关鲁迅先生的语录。四周洁白的墙壁上，按次排着鲁迅先生生平照片。中间和周围陈列着鲁迅一生在各个时期的手迹、著作等文物。整个陈列室宽大明亮而又整洁朴素。
    鲁迅故居百草园旁的假山、亭子等重新作了修理，辟出一个小型的公园，以供前往瞻仰的人活动。
    鲁迅纪念馆文物陈列室除星期一例假外，每日开放。国庆节、元旦、春节及鲁迅先生诞辰、逝世纪念日，鲁迅故居新台门、鲁迅幼年读书处三味书屋、鲁迅祖居老台门等处，都全部开放。
    最近，绍兴鲁迅纪念馆在门口设立了一个反对使用原子武器签名站，前往瞻仰陈列室文物的人们，都在这里庄严地签了名。
