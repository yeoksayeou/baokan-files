Remittances from overseas Chinese represent the earnings of our overseas Chinese compatriots from their labor and various occupations, used to support their families in the country. It is vital to the personal interests of our overseas Chinese and the livelihood of the vast number of relatives of overseas Chinese, and it is one of the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and their families. At the same time, remittances from overseas Chinese play a positive role in national construction and are beneficial to the people of the whole country. Especially in areas where relatives of overseas Chinese are concentrated, remittances from overseas Chinese have a significant effect on the prosperity of the local economy and the development of cultural and public welfare undertakings. Therefore, cadres at all levels, especially county, district, and township cadres, should deeply recognize the role of remittances from overseas Chinese and give them due attention.

For the past five years, the state has consistently and resolutely protected remittances from overseas Chinese and implemented the policy of "facilitating remittances from overseas Chinese and serving overseas Chinese." In order to take care of the interests of overseas Chinese and their families, the state has stipulated reasonable foreign exchange rates. In the early days of liberation, in order to prevent relatives of overseas Chinese from being affected by price fluctuations, the state formulated methods for remittances and deposits in the original currency. After the stability of our currency system and the devaluation of the currency systems of some countries, the state formulated methods for remittances in Renminbi to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and their families.

However, it has been found that in some areas, the grassroots administrative organs have not thoroughly implemented the policy of protecting remittances from overseas Chinese, and some local work cadres in residential areas of relatives of overseas Chinese do not understand the significance of remittances from overseas Chinese and the state's policy of protecting remittances from overseas Chinese. There are still varying degrees of interference with the use of remittances from overseas Chinese by relatives of overseas Chinese in some residential areas. In order to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and their families, in accordance with Article 11 of the Constitution: "The state protects the ownership of citizens' lawful income, savings, houses and other means of livelihood," the following order is now issued to implement the policy of protecting remittances from overseas Chinese:

    I. Remittances from overseas Chinese are the legitimate income of relatives of overseas Chinese, and the state's policy of protecting remittances from overseas Chinese is not only the state's current policy but also the state's long-term policy.

    II. When mobilizing relatives of overseas Chinese to participate in various cooperatives, conduct patriotic savings, and purchase public bonds, the principle of complete voluntariness must be implemented. No individual or organization may force relatives of overseas Chinese to borrow money, hold back remittances, arbitrarily inspect overseas Chinese correspondence, or use any pretext to infringe on remittances from overseas Chinese in disguised form. Any incident of infringing on remittances from overseas Chinese must be dealt with according to the circumstances; those who intentionally misappropriate, embezzle, fraudulently claim, steal remittances from overseas Chinese, and unscrupulous elements who extort relatives of overseas Chinese must be punished according to law.

    III. Relatives of overseas Chinese have the freedom to use remittances from overseas Chinese, and no one may interfere with the use of remittances from overseas Chinese for living purposes, including for weddings, funerals, celebrations, and other events.

    IV. The state encourages overseas Chinese and their families to invest remittances from overseas Chinese in production or to invest in state investment companies, and at the same time encourages overseas Chinese and their families to build houses. Local state administrative organs at all levels should provide convenience for this. Overseas Chinese have always been enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings in their hometowns, such as running schools and hospitals, building water conservancy projects, building bridges, and repairing roads. Local state administrative organs at all levels should show concern for this and provide guidance and assistance, and commend them when necessary.

    中华人民共和国国务院
    关于贯彻保护侨汇政策的命令
    侨汇是我国外华侨从事劳动和各种职业所得，用以赡养国内家属的汇款，是我国外华侨的切身利益和广大侨眷的生活依靠，是侨胞、侨眷的正当权益之一。同时侨汇对国家建设有积极的作用，对全国人民是有利的。特别是侨眷集中地区，侨汇对于繁荣地方经济，发展文化公益事业，均有显著作用。因此，各级干部，特别是县、区、乡干部，应深刻认识侨汇的作用，予以应有的重视。
    五年以来，国家对侨汇一贯是坚决保护的，并实行了“便利侨汇、服务侨胞”的政策。为了照顾侨胞、侨眷的利益，国家规定了合理的外汇牌价。在解放初期为使侨眷不受物价波动的影响，国家制定了原币汇款及存款办法。在我国币制稳定、某些国家币制贬值后，国家又制定人民币汇款的办法，以保障侨胞、侨眷的利益。
    但是，目前发现有些地区的基层行政机关贯彻保护侨汇政策不够深入，有些侨眷居住区的地方工作干部尚不了解侨汇的意义和国家保护侨汇的政策，有些侨眷居住区尚存在有不同程度的干预侨眷对侨汇使用的现象。为保护侨胞、侨眷的利益，根据宪法第十一条：“国家保护公民的合法收入、储蓄、房屋和各种生活资料的所有权”的规定，现在发布贯彻保护侨汇政策的命令如下：
    一、侨汇是侨眷的合法收入，国家保护侨汇政策不仅是国家当前的政策，而且是国家的长远政策。
    二、在动员侨眷参加各种合作社，进行爱国储蓄，购买公债时，必须贯彻完全自愿的原则。任何个人或团体不得向侨眷强迫借贷，不得积压侨汇，不得擅自检查侨批和以任何借口变相侵犯侨汇。凡有侵犯侨汇事情发生，必须分别情节论处；对于有意挪用、侵吞、冒领、盗取侨汇和敲诈侨眷的不法分子，必须依法制裁。
    三、侨眷有使用侨汇的自由，任何人对侨眷把侨汇用于生活方面，包括用于举办婚、丧、喜、庆等事，不得干涉。
    四、国家鼓励华侨和侨眷把侨汇投入生产或者向国家投资公司入股，同时鼓励华侨、侨眷修建房屋，各级地方国家行政机关对此应给予便利。华侨素来热心家乡公益事业，如兴办学校医院、兴修水利、造桥、修路等，各级地方国家行政机关对此应表关怀，并给予指导、帮助，必要时予以表扬。
    总理　周恩来
    一九五五年二月二十三日
