Zhejiang Province is reforming its cropping systems according to local conditions to increase grain yield per unit area. In the plains, double-cropping rice (including changing double-cropping inter-planting rice to double-cropping continuous rice) and single-season late japonica rice will be gradually promoted. In mountainous and semi-mountainous areas, the planting of high-yielding miscellaneous grain crops will be gradually promoted. Various localities will also improve waterlogged fields and make full use of autumn and winter fallow fields to increase the planting of one crop of miscellaneous grains, changing one crop to two crops, and two crops to three crops. In addition, various localities will make reasonable plans for the cultivation of grain crops and cash crops, and further study the rational rotation system of local cotton and hemp fields, so as to increase the yield of cash crops at the same time.

Now, an agricultural production increase campaign with the reform of the cropping system as an important content has been gradually launched in the rural areas of Zhejiang Province in a planned and led manner. Among the province's more than 40,000 new and old agricultural producers' cooperatives and many mutual aid groups, many have seriously analyzed local conditions and their own experiences, and have realistically formulated plans for reforming the cropping system to increase grain production this year. 192 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the Linshan, Henghe, and other districts of Yuyao County plan to promote double-cropping continuous rice on more than 15,400 mu, an increase of about two times compared with 1954. After Huangyan County determined to expand the planting area of double-cropping continuous rice and double-cropping inter-planting rice this year, the farmers put forward the slogan "Where double-cropping rice is promoted, water conservancy will be built there." At present, the county has dredged and widened more than 400 large and small rivers, deepened 150 large and small ponds, and built more than 50 sluices and more than 10 dams; in addition, a large amount of soil fertilizer has been accumulated. The relevant leading departments of Zhejiang Province have also helped farmers implement plans to reform the cropping system by issuing loans, supplying improved varieties, regulating draft animals, and strengthening technical training for farmers. Up to now, the relevant departments have regulated and allocated more than 12 million jin of improved rice varieties such as double-cropping rice and late japonica rice, which are suitable for the reform of cropping systems in various places.

The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Department of Agriculture of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee had previously conducted repeated investigations and studies and "ranked" the conditions of temperature, soil, rainfall, irrigation conditions, as well as labor, animal power, fertilizer, seeds, and the original farming techniques of farmers in various regions of the province. According to the preliminary plans of various counties, the focus of reforming the cropping system according to local conditions in various regions was determined. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture also specifically convened a provincial agricultural technology symposium, and repeatedly invited experts and scientific workers from the Zhejiang Agricultural College and the Agricultural Science Research Institute to discuss and study the issue of reforming the cropping system.

    浙江省因地制宜进行耕作制度的改革
    浙江省正因地制宜进行耕作制度的改革，以提高粮食的单位面积产量。在平原地区，将逐步推广种植双季稻（包括改双季间作稻为双季连作稻）和一季的晚粳稻。在山区和半山区，将逐步推广改种高产杂粮作物。各地并将改良积水田和充分利用秋、冬休闲田，增种一熟杂粮作物，使一熟改为二熟、二熟改为三熟。此外，各地将对粮食作物和经济作物的栽培作出合理的规划，进一步研究当地棉田、麻田的合理轮作制，以便同时增加经济作物的产量。
    现在，一个以改革耕作制度为重要内容的农业增产运动，已经有领导有计划地在浙江省各地农村逐步展开。在全省四万多个新、老农业生产合作社和许多互助组中，有不少已认真分析过当地条件和本身经验，实事求是地订出了今年改革耕作制度以增产粮食的计划。余姚县临山、横河等区一百九十二个农业生产合作社计划推广双季连作稻一万五千四百多亩，比一九五四年增加两倍左右。黄岩县在确定今年扩大双季连作稻和双季间作稻种植面积后，农民们提出“双季稻推广到那里，水利就兴修到那里”的口号。目前全县已疏浚加宽大小河道四百多条，挖深大小水塘一百五十口，修建水闸五十多处和水坝十多个；另外还积贮了大量土肥。浙江省有关领导部门也从发放贷款、供应良种、调剂耕畜和加强对农民的技术训练等方面，帮助农民实行改革耕作制度的计划。到目前为止，单是适合各地改革耕作制度需要的双季稻和晚粳稻等优良稻种，有关部门就调剂、调拨了一千二百多万斤。
    中共浙江省委员会和浙江省人民委员会农业厅事前曾对全省各个地区的气温、土壤、雨量、灌溉条件以及劳力、畜力、肥料、种籽和各地农民原有耕作技术等条件，反复进行了调查研究和“排队”工作，然后根据各县初步计划，确定了各个地区因地制宜改革耕作制度的重点。浙江省农业厅还专门召开了全省农业技术座谈会，并多次邀请浙江农学院、农业科学研究所有关专家和科学工作者座谈研究改革耕作制度的问题。（新华社）
