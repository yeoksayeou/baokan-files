Xinhua News Agency, March 8th, dispatch from TASS, Paris, March 7th: Judging from the commentaries in the French newspapers, the Faure government is currently facing several difficult problems, such as the issue of the Republic's Senate ratifying the Paris Accords, the issue of approving the 1955 budget, the issue of obtaining special economic powers, and the tax reform issue. "Le Figaro" believes that all of these issues are "very dangerous" for the government, because, according to this newspaper, some of these issues will become a serious test of the government's majority before the end of this week.

The government is particularly anxious about the ratification of the Paris Treaty. French newspaper commentators have once again emphasized that the senators of the Republic are afraid that ratifying the Paris Accords before the upcoming provincial council and Republic Senate elections will be detrimental to them. French political figures have to consider that the French people are opposed to the revival of German militarism. Therefore, whether any candidate can be elected in this election will largely depend on the attitude they take towards the plan to arm West Germany.

Many senators are increasingly inclined to propose amendments to the Paris Accords in order to postpone the final ratification until autumn. "Combat" writes: The election campaigns in many regions of France revolve around the issue of rearming West Germany, therefore, "Edgar Faure and his majority are falling into serious difficulties."

Xinhua News Agency, March 6th, dispatch from TASS, Paris: The Faure government has been in power for just over ten days, and many French newspapers have already pointed out that the parties forming the government's majority are showing significant divisions, and believe that these divisions are a sign of the Faure government's growing difficulties.

The newspapers point out that many representatives of some "moderate" parties on the National Assembly's Finance Committee have refused to vote in favor of the government's "overall expenditure" draft, even though these parties have joined the government. The "Independent Republicans and Social Action Party," which participates in the coalition government, has declared that it will not vote in favor of granting Faure special economic powers before April 30th. The "Independent Farmers Party" members, who are also members of the government's majority, have put forward many conditions to the head of government.

Difficulties also exist on the major issue, namely the ratification of the Paris Accords. Some newspapers believe that the senators of the Republic "will obviously not deal favorably" with the proposal for unconditional ratification of the Paris Accords. "Combat" believes that the senators of the Republic will propose amendments to the treaty on the "Western European Union," which will lead to a new debate in the National Assembly, and the new debate "harbors dangers" for the government's majority.

"Les Echos" editorial on the 4th pointed out: "The majority of the coalition government is constantly troubled by two dangers: the danger of doing nothing and thus causing failure, and the danger of taking action and thus exacerbating the current contradictions and conflicts."

    富尔政府面临巴黎协定难题
    法报指出政府内部存在分歧
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎七日讯：从法国报纸的评论来判断，富尔政府目前正面临若干困难问题，例如共和国参议院批准巴黎协定的问题、批准一九五五年预算的问题、取得经济方面的特别权力的问题、捐税改革问题等。“费加罗报”认为，所有这些问题对政府来说都是“非常危险的”，因为，这家报纸认为，这些问题中的某些问题将在本周末以前成为对政府多数派的一个严重的考验。
    政府对于巴黎条约的批准特别感到焦虑。法国报纸评论员再一次强调指出，共和国参议院的议员们害怕在即将举行的省议会和共和国参议院选举的前夕批准巴黎协定会对自己不利。法国政治人物不得不考虑到，法国人民群众是反对复活德国军国主义的，因此，这次选举中的任何一个候选人能否当选，在很大的程度上将取决于他对武装西德的计划所采取的态度。
    参议院的许多议员越来越倾向于对巴黎协定提出修正案以便把最后的批准推迟到秋天进行。“战斗报”写道：法国许多区域中的选举运动都是围绕着重新武装西德的问题进行的，因此，“埃加·富尔和他的多数派正在陷入严重的困难。”
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎消息：富尔政府上台不过十来天，法国的许多报纸就指出，组成政府多数的各党派内部呈显着分歧，并且认为这些分歧是富尔政府日益增长的困难的预兆。
    报纸指出，国民议会财政委员会一些“温和”党派的许多代表已经拒绝投票赞成政府的“总开支”草案，虽然这些党派已参加了政府。参加联合政府的“共和与社会行动党独立派”声明，它将不投票赞成赋予富尔在四月三十日前在经济方面的特别全权。“独立农民党”议员们也是政府多数的成员，他们向政府首脑提出了许多条件。
    在主要问题上，即在批准巴黎协定问题上也存在困难。某些报纸认为，共和国参议院议员“显然不会善意地”对付无条件批准巴黎协定的这种主张。“战斗报”认为，共和国参议院议员将对关于“西欧联盟”的条约提出修正案，这将使国民议会进行新的辩论，而新的辩论对政府多数派来说是“蕴藏着危险”的。
    “回声报”四日社论指出：“联合政府的多数派不断为两种危险所烦扰：什么事都不做因而造成失败的危险，以及采取行动因而使目前的矛盾和冲突更趋尖锐的危险。”
