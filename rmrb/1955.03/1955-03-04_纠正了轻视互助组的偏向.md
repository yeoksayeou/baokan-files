    Correcting the Tendency to Belittle Mutual Aid Teams
    In the process of establishing cooperatives in Huiqian Township, Xinfeng County, Guangdong Province, the Party branch relaxed its leadership over the mutual aid teams, and some cadres and masses developed the idea of belittling the mutual aid teams. Mutual aid teams that were not approved to transfer to cooperatives and some farmers who did not join the cooperatives expressed dissatisfaction. At the same time, some mutual aid teams made little progress throughout the year due to the lack of Party leadership, and some mutual aid teams became mutual aid teams in name only. After checking and studying these situations, the Party branch designated a Party member to be specifically responsible for leading the mutual aid teams. Each agricultural production cooperative should also allocate some strength to drive two or three mutual aid teams. At the same time, the branch also convened a representative meeting of mutual aid and cooperation, introduced them to the achievements of the old cooperatives and the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, and called on everyone to run the mutual aid teams well and create conditions to strive for early transfer to cooperatives. Now, under the leadership and supervision of the branch, each agricultural production cooperative has sent cooperative cadres to help the mutual aid teams solve problems, and absorbed the mutual aid team leaders to participate in the cooperative's meetings. The cooperative members also take the initiative to unite the mutual aid team members. The mutual aid teams have all improved and developed.

    纠正了轻视互助组的偏向
    广东新丰县会前乡在建社中，由于党支部放松了对互助组的领导，部分干部和群众产生了轻视互助组的思想。没有被批准转社的互助组和没有入社的部分农民都表示不满意。同时有些互助组因为缺乏党的领导，一年来进步不大，有的互助组已变为挂名互助组。党支部检查和研究了这些情况后，指定一名党员专责领导互助组。各农业生产合作社也要抽出一定力量去带动两三个互助组。同时支部还召开了互助合作代表会议，向他们介绍了老社的成绩，和农业生产合作社优越性，号召大家搞好互助组，创造条件争取早日转社。现在，各农业生产合作社在支部的领导和监督下都派出社干部帮助互助组解决问题，并吸收互助组组长参加社的会议。社员也主动去团结互助组组员。互助组都有了提高和发展。
