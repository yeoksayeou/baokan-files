Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Lead Members to Accumulate More Fertilizer
You Qun

According to recent inspections in various regions, many agricultural production cooperatives have only accumulated half the fertilizer they need, and some only have a third. Many newly established cooperatives have much higher production increase targets than when they were not organized, but the fertilizer accumulated is less than in previous years. For example, the Jinshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luxian County, Sichuan Province, plans to increase production by 20 percent this year compared to 1954, but the fertilizer prepared this year is 500,000 jin less than last year. If this situation is not changed quickly, the agricultural production cooperatives' production increase plans will fail, and it will also have a negative impact on the overall agricultural production this year.

A major reason for the fertilizer shortage in many agricultural production cooperatives this year is that the establishment and expansion of the cooperatives were not combined with production. Some cooperatives did not collect the fertilizer accumulated by members at a reasonable price, allowing it to be lost. Some members said, "Now that the cooperative is established, no one wants fertilizer anymore." Some cooperatives did not organize members to accumulate fertilizer after the establishment and expansion, and many members completely relied on the cooperative's fertilizer, so they did not accumulate fertilizer when they saw it, resulting in a large shortage of fertilizer in agricultural production cooperatives, while manure piles were tripping people up in the streets and alleys, and no one cared.

Leading agricultural production cooperatives to solve the fertilizer shortage is a very important task. First of all, the number of households participating in agricultural production cooperatives is already quite large, with some provinces reaching more than 30 percent. If the fertilizer accumulation work of agricultural production cooperatives is not done well, agricultural production will suffer great losses. Secondly, if agricultural production cooperatives do a good job in accumulating fertilizer, they can reduce production costs, increase production, and increase income, which lays a good foundation for the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives. Finally, if the fertilizer accumulation work of agricultural production cooperatives is done well and new sources of fertilizer are opened up, it can encourage the fertilizer accumulation enthusiasm of mutual aid groups and individual farmers.

To do a good job in fertilizer accumulation for agricultural production cooperatives, we must first educate the members about the consistency of individual interests and collective interests, so that the members understand that ensuring agricultural production increase this year is of great benefit to the country, the cooperative, and the farmers themselves, so that the members can consciously accumulate fertilizer for the cooperative. Some places have done this and have achieved good results. For example, the Zhengjiatian Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huangpi County, Hubei, calculated the accounts for the members: digging 3,800 jin more sod to use as fertilizer will save the money spent on buying fertilizer, which can be used to buy more than 2,600 jin of rice, which is actually equivalent to the cooperative increasing its income by this much. The Hexin Agricultural Cooperative in Hetun Village, Yixian County, Liaoning, pointed out to the members that although there was a bumper harvest last year, the income increase of each member was not much, because the cost of buying fertilizer last year accounted for 47 percent of the total production investment and about 20 percent of the cooperative's total income last year. After the members realized the benefits of fertilizer accumulation for the cooperative and themselves, they would find ways to find sources of fertilizer and pay attention to fertilizer accumulation at any time and place.

Agricultural production cooperatives should regard fertilizer accumulation as an important task. The cooperative should stipulate methods for recording work points and remuneration for members' fertilizer accumulation, and should mobilize members to accumulate and create fertilizer in a planned way. At present, the most urgent thing is to quickly collect the fertilizer accumulated by individual members. Although these fertilizers seem very small when scattered in each household, collecting them can at least solve the need for some fertilizer during the spring plowing period. At present, many agricultural production cooperatives have no toilets for people and no pens for pigs. According to statistics from twelve townships and one hundred and one cooperatives in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan, there are more than 7,900 pigs raised, of which 90 percent have no pens, causing manure to be lost at will. What a great waste this is! If agricultural production cooperatives in various places can overcome this phenomenon, fertilizer can be greatly increased.

Agricultural technical cadres should provide guidance and assistance to agricultural production cooperatives in fertilizer accumulation techniques. More than 100 agricultural technology base stations in Jinan and Changzhi areas of Shanxi Province have widely promoted high-temperature rapid composting methods, which have improved fertilizer efficiency and shortened composting time. Guidance should also be given on the reasonable storage of fertilizer. Cadres sent by the Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Section of Huaiyin County, Jiangsu, guided farmers to store ash and manure separately to reduce fertilizer loss. These methods can be implemented in agricultural production cooperatives and should be promoted.

Some cadres and farmers say, "Now that the ox has crossed the river, you can't pull it back by grabbing its tail!" They think that the spring plowing season has arrived, and it is too late to talk about fertilizer accumulation now. This statement is wrong. Fertilizer is not completely used as base fertilizer. Accumulating fertilizer now, even if it is a bit late for base fertilizer, can still be used as topdressing fertilizer later. Many cooperatives also have a large amount of readily available manure that has not been properly collected and utilized. Collecting these fertilizers and applying them as base fertilizer is still possible. Agricultural production cooperatives have a large number of people and great strength. As long as they take active measures, even now, they can still greatly change the situation of insufficient fertilizer. The Second Agricultural Production Cooperative of Jiangdian Township, Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, recently discovered that there was insufficient base fertilizer for spring-sown crops and no topdressing fertilizer for wheat fields. They rationally organized labor, digging ditch mud on one hand and collecting existing fertilizer on the other. In a short time, they replenished the fertilizer needed at present, ensuring the smooth progress of spring plowing. In places with later spring plowing, this active attitude should be adopted to solve the problem of insufficient base fertilizer.

    农业生产合作社应领导社员多积肥料
    友群
    根据最近各地检查，许多农业生产合作社积存的肥料，只有所需肥料的一半，有的还只有三分之一。许多新建社的增产指标比没有组织起来时的指标高得多，但所积存的肥料却比往年少。例如四川省泸县金山农业生产合作社今年计划要比一九五四年增产百分之二十，可是今年准备的肥料比去年却少了五十万斤。这种情况如不迅速改变，农业生产合作社的增产计划就会落空，也会给今年整个农业生产带来不好的影响。
    农业生产合作社在建立和扩大的过程中，没有把建社、扩社工作和生产结合起来。这是今年许多农业生产合作社缺肥的一个主要原因。有些社对社员自积肥料没有用合理的代价把它收集起来，任其流失。有的社员说：“建了社，肥料倒没人要了。”有些社在建社和扩社以后，也没有组织社员积肥，许多社员完全依赖社里的肥料，看到肥料也不积存，以致造成了农业生产合作社大量缺肥，而街头巷尾粪肥绊脚，也没有人理睬的现象。
    领导农业生产合作社解决缺肥问题是一件十分重要的工作。首先，现在参加农业生产合作社的户数已相当多，有些省已达到百分之三十以上，农业生产合作社的积肥工作搞不好，就要使农业生产受到很大损失。其次，农业生产合作社搞好了积肥工作，就能降低生产成本，增加生产，增加收入，这就给农业生产合作社的巩固和发展打好了基础。最后，农业生产合作社的积肥工作作得好，开辟了肥源，就能鼓舞互助组和单干农民的积肥积极性。
    要作好农业生产合作社的积肥工作，首先应该向社员进行个人利益和集体利益一致性的教育，使社员懂得保证今年农业增产对国家、对合作社和农民自己都有很大好处，使社员都能自觉地为合作社积肥。有些地方这样作了，都收到了很好的效果。如湖北黄陂县郑家田农业生产合作社给社员算账：多挖草皮三千八百斤压肥，省出的买肥料钱，就可买二千六百多斤稻谷，实际等于社里增加了这么多收入。辽宁义县贺屯村合心农业合作社对社员指出去年虽然丰收，但是每个社员的收入增加不多，就是因为去年买肥料的费用占了生产投资总额的百分之四十七，占去了全社去年总收入的百分之二十左右。社员认识了积肥工作对社对自己的好处以后，就会设法找寻肥源，随时随地注意积肥。
    农业生产合作社应该把积肥当作一项重要工作来做。社里对社员积肥应规定出记工、报酬的办法，应有计划地发动社员积肥造肥。目前最紧要的是要把社员个人积存的肥料迅速收集起来，这些肥料分散在一家一户看起来虽然很少，但收集起来至少能够解决春耕期间一部分肥料的需要。目前还有许多农业生产合作社人无厕所，猪无圈，据河南许昌专区十二个乡和一百零一个社的统计，共养猪七千九百多头，其中竟有百分之九十的猪都没有圈，使粪肥任意丢失，这是多么大的浪费！各地农业生产合作社如能克服这种现象，就可使肥料大大增加。
    农业技术干部应对农业生产合作社的积肥技术给予指导和帮助，山西省晋南、长治地区一百多个农业技术基点推广站普遍推广了高温速成沤肥法，提高了肥效，缩短了沤肥时间。对肥料的合理保管也应给予指导。江苏淮阴县农林水利科派干部指导农民实行灰、粪分开堆放，减少了肥效损失。这些办法在农业生产合作社都是有条件实现的，应该推广。
    有些干部和农民说：“现在牛已过了河，拉住尾巴也拉不回来啦！”他们认为春耕季节已到，现在谈积肥已经太晚了。这种说法是错误的。肥料并不完全都要用作底肥。现在积存肥料，即使作底肥有点晚了，以后还可作追肥施用。许多社还有大量现成粪肥没有好好收集利用，把这些肥料收集起来，作底肥施用也是来得及的。农业生产合作社人多力量大，只要采取积极的办法，即使现在，仍可在很大程度上改变肥料不足的情况。河南省襄城县姜店乡第二农业生产合作社最近发现社里春播作物底肥不足、麦田没有追肥可施后，就合理组织劳动力，一面挖沟泥，一面收集现有肥料，没有很长时间，就补足了目前所需要的肥料，保证了春耕的顺利进行。在春耕较晚的地方，都应该采取这种积极态度来解决底肥不足的问题。
