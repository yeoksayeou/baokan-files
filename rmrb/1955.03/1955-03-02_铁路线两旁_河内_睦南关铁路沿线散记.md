    Along the Railway Lines
    —Notes Along the Hanoi-Friendship Pass Railway
    By Zhǎn Cháo, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Vietnam

    The Hanoi-Friendship Pass railway stretches northeastward, parallel to Highway 1. The southern half of the railway is on the left side of the highway, and the northern half is on the right side of the highway. Our jeep advances on Highway 1, and the scenes on the railway line are clearly visible.

    A short mixed passenger and freight train departs from Hanoi Station, traveling at a speed of twenty to thirty kilometers per hour on the newly laid tracks covered with ballast. It is heading to Phủ Lạng Thương, the provincial capital of Bắc Giang Province, fifty kilometers from Hanoi. The train is filled with farmers carrying shoulder poles and baskets, merchants with goods, cadres with keychains, and cheerful young people who appear to be students. Perhaps because this section of the line has just opened, people like to stand at the joints between the carriages, waving and cheering at our jeep, which is blocked at the head of a bridge.

    North of Phủ Lạng Thương, the railway line presents a different scene. Workers are busy laying ballast and installing signals on the newly connected lines. In some places, they are still repairing temporary water supply facilities and constructing simple station buildings. The workers are focused on their work, paying little attention to what is happening nearby. They have only one thought: to accelerate the renovation work and strive for the early opening of the entire line.

    Not far away is a construction train. The locomotive is emitting a large amount of white smoke, moving slowly forward or backward under the direction of signal flags. Several open carriages are full of lively children. During the war, they had never even seen the shadow of a railway, but now they are riding the train before the adults. Some children are holding golden-star red flags and shouting at the top of their lungs: "Hanoi-Friendship Pass!" "Friendship Pass-Hanoi!" as if the line is already open.

    On both sides of the railway subgrade, vast fields unfold. These are the beautiful and fertile fields of Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces in the northern part of the Red River Delta. At this time, the rice seedlings in the fields are growing very well. Some farmers are weeding, some are irrigating, some are fishing in ponds, some are plowing the fields, and some are transplanting seedlings. It is said that in this area, it is still possible to transplant summer rice until the end of February.

    Dividing the vast fields are major and minor rivers such as the Cầu River and Thương River, as well as canals that bring life to the land. Along the railway line, near the bridges that are being painted, are moored bamboo rafts, bamboo boats, wooden boats, and short-haul steamers. The docks and ferries are filled with various sounds.

    Many new villages and towns have appeared near the railway, and the population is increasing near the stations.

    Recalling the desolate scene not long ago, when the French colonialists were still entrenched here, one is struck by how quickly and greatly things have changed!

    In July 1951, in order to cope with the increasingly developing people's guerrilla warfare in the Red River Delta, eliminate the threat to its heartland, and free up forces to invade the North Vietnamese liberated areas, the French aggressors adopted extremely barbaric methods, creating a "no-man's land" of hundreds of kilometers long and five kilometers wide around the delta. This "no-man's land" ran parallel to the railway, winding through the western parts of Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces, and then crossing the railway line from the northern half of Bắc Giang Province, turning towards Quảng Yên Province in the east. At that time, in order to create this "no-man's land," the French colonialists sent a large number of troops, first using kerosene to set fire to the residents' houses, driving people into "concentration villages" near the strongholds, and then using artillery to bombard those who were unwilling to leave or attempted to flee to the guerrilla areas, until all the houses there were destroyed and no living things remained. Usually, at the slightest disturbance, the mortars and machine guns of the French aggressors in all the nearby strongholds, large and small, would concentrate their fire there, making people afraid to approach that area, and all the good land was abandoned. Until the Vietnamese People's Army won a historic victory at Điện Biên Phủ, and the French aggressors withdrew in accordance with the Geneva Accords, this area was still a wilderness overgrown with weeds.

    According to statistics, Bắc Giang Province has a total cultivated area of 190,000 *mu* (North Vietnamese *mu*, each *mu* is approximately equivalent to more than five Chinese *mu*), of which more than 46,000 *mu* were included in the "no-man's land." If the "forbidden zones" surrounded by barbed wire around strongholds and transportation lines are added, the wasteland is at least 50,000 *mu*. This figure is quite staggering, but the people of Bắc Giang Province, with a glorious tradition of struggle, like other provinces, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government, responded to President Hồ Chí Minh's call and vigorously developed the "no-man's land" as soon as peace was achieved. Currently, the area of land reclaimed in Bắc Giang Province is more than 13,000 *mu*, and people are continuing to work hard, from transportation lines to remote areas, striving to reclaim all wasteland in the near future.

    We stopped on the road and walked into a village not far from the railway and the highway. This village is called "Tam Sơn Village," and it is located in the center of the former "no-man's land." It is only a little more than six kilometers from Phủ Lạng Thương, the provincial capital of Bắc Giang Province. Almost all of the village's one hundred or so households have now moved back from scattered places or "concentration villages." The population is slightly reduced. In the past, there were about five hundred people, but now there are only more than three hundred. This population decrease is directly or indirectly related to the creators of the "no-man's land." People returned to the village, repaired their houses on the original foundations, and launched an offensive against the wilderness. Now, not only have all the village's more than two hundred *mu* of paddy fields been reclaimed, but they have all been planted with summer rice. Thanks to solidarity and mutual assistance and government assistance, farmers' means of production are rapidly increasing. The village now has more than one hundred buffaloes, not far from the previous number. We sat for a while at the home of a local cadre named Ngô Hưng Lượng, and then walked out along a dirt road full of rubble. A group of young people were playing volleyball in a field in the middle of the village. Many of them had voluntarily cut sleepers for the railway. Ngô Hưng Lượng told us that once the train is open, everyone's enthusiasm for production competition will be even greater. Because the train has long legs, the products can be sold quickly, and the things that are needed, such as agricultural tools, fertilizers, oil, salt, cloth, towels, etc., can also be bought quickly, and the prices will be cheaper than now. So the people in the village unconditionally love their railway. Many guerrillas who participated in sabotaging the enemy's transportation lines in the past now automatically take turns on duty at night to guard the railway, preventing enemy agents from sneaking in to sabotage.

    From Tam Sơn Village onwards, there is a place called "Lồ" Station, which also belonged to the former "no-man's land." The whole village has about a thousand people, and they all moved back not long ago. Now, wisps of smoke are rising from the newly built simple houses. Everywhere is full of the breath of life.

    After passing through this area, we arrived at the place where the north and south lines of the railway were connected a few days ago. This is already in the northeastern part outside the "no-man's land," where guerrilla heroes used to strike. Further ahead, we gradually entered the hilly and mountainous area, which was the old liberated area in North Vietnam during the Vietnamese people's resistance war. Lạng Sơn Province is located at the northeastern end of this area, closely connected with Guangxi Province in our country.

    Lạng Sơn Province has a population of about two hundred thousand. The province's products, in addition to grains such as rice, corn, and sweet potatoes, are richest in forest products. There are various precious woods here—rosewood, red sandalwood, etc. It also produces a large amount of anise, fragrant mushrooms, wood ear, nhu lang (dye), etc. In addition, it produces oranges, honey, and bamboo wares. Livestock products are also abundant, which can be supplied to the plains provinces and exported abroad. However, in the past, due to inconvenient transportation, many local specialties could not be transported and sold in large quantities. And the people in the mountainous areas felt that the daily necessities of life were in short supply due to the difficulties of transportation, such as edible salt, cloth, etc., which were both scarce and expensive. Once the railway is open to traffic, these problems can be properly solved. This is why the people of all ethnic groups in Lạng Sơn Province are so enthusiastic in supporting the restoration of the railway. On the first day that the civilian laborers who were building the railway arrived in Lạng Sơn City, a load of firewood appeared in front of their door, with the words: "The first load of firewood to support the civilian laborers repairing the railway!"

    However, the people's enthusiastic participation in and support for the construction of this railway is not just because they see the economic value of the railway. Trần Văn Liên, the deputy leader of the farmers' association in a village where we rested and ate several times, said with great excitement: "We build the railway, build the North well, strengthen our strength, and do not let the American imperialists, the bad guys of France, and the Ngô Đình Diệm clique come to destroy our peaceful life." His words express the common thoughts of the Vietnamese people. (Attached pictures)

    铁路线两旁
    ——河内—睦南关铁路沿线散记
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    河内—睦南关铁路，和第一号公路平行地一直向着东北方向伸展。铁路的南半段在公路的左侧，北半段在公路的右侧。我们的吉普车在第一号公路上前进，铁路线上的情景都能看得清清楚楚。
    一列不很长的客、货混合列车，自河内车站开出，以每小时二十到三十公里的速度，在已经铺上石渣的新轨道上行驶，它是开往离河内五十公里的北江省省会府谅商市去的。车上载满了拿着扁担和箩筐的农民，带着货物的商人，挂着挂匙的干部，还有些一看就知道是学生的欢欢乐乐的青年。大概因为这段路刚通车的缘故，人们都喜欢站在两个车厢之间的接合处，向被阻在桥头上的我们的吉普车招手、欢呼。
    从府谅商往北，铁路线上又是一番不同的景象。工人们正忙着在已经接了轨的新线路上铺石渣、安号志，有些地方还在修临时给水设备和建筑简单的站房。工人们全神贯注地工作着，很少有人去看附近发生的事情。他们只有一个想法，这就是：加紧整修工作，争取全线早日通车。
    不远的地方是一列工程车，火车头吐着大量的白烟，听从讯号旗的指挥，缓慢地前进或后退。有几节敞车上尽是些热热闹闹的孩子们。打仗的时候，他们连铁路的影子都没有见过，现在却比大人先坐上火车了，还有几个孩子拿着金星红旗、放开嗓子叫：“河内—睦南关！”“睦南关—河内！”好像这条路已经通车似的。
    在铁路路基的两旁，展开了广阔的田野，这是美丽、富饶的红河三角洲北边的北宁省和北江省底田野。这个时候，稻田里的秧苗已经长得很好了，农民们有的在除草，有的在车水，有的在池塘捞鱼，还有的在翻耕田地，有的在插秧。据说这带的夏稻一直到二月底插秧还来得及。
    划分开广阔的田野的是桥河、商江等大小河流，还有给土地带来生命的水渠。铁路沿线，正在加紧油漆的桥梁左近，停泊着竹排、竹船、木船和短航程的汽船，码头和渡口上充满着各种声响。
    许多新的村镇在铁路旁边出现了，靠近车站的地方人口正增加着。
    回想不久以前，当法国殖民者还盘踞在这里的时候，那种荒凉的景象，就会惊觉变化有多么快和多么大啊！
    一九五一年七月，法国侵略军为了对付日益发展着的红河三角洲的人民游击战争，消除对它心腹地带的威胁，以便腾出手来进犯北越解放区，采取了极其野蛮的办法，在三角洲的周围制造了一个几百公里长、五公里宽的“无人区”。这个“无人区”，跟铁路成平行线，缠绕过北宁省和北江省的西部，然后再从北江省的北半部横穿过铁路线，折向东面的广安省境里去。当时，为了制造这个“无人区”，法国殖民者曾经派去大批军队，首先用火油把居民的房子点着，把人赶到据点附近的“集中村”里去，然后用大炮轰击那些不愿离开或者企图逃向游击区去的群众，直到那里的房舍全部毁灭、一个生物都没有了的时候为止。平日一有点动静，所有附近各个大小据点的法国侵略军的迫击炮和机关枪，都集中地朝着那里打，使人们不敢走向那个区域，大好的田地全部抛荒了。直到越南人民军在奠边府获得历史性的胜利，法国侵略军按照日内瓦协定撤走的初期，这一带还是长满着蒿草的荒野。
    据统计，北江省全部耕地面积共十九万亩（北越亩，每亩约等于中国五亩多），被划入“无人区”里去的就有四万六千多亩，如果再加上据点和交通线周围被铁丝网圈起来的“禁地”，荒地至少要在五万亩以上。这个数字是相当惊人的，但是有光荣斗争传统的北江省人民，也和其他省份一样，在越南劳动党和民主共和国政府的领导下，响应胡志明主席的号召，当和平刚一实现，就大力开拓“无人区”。目前，北江省开荒的面积共有一万三千多亩，人们正继续努力，从交通线到边远地区，争取在不久的将来开垦全部荒地。
    我们在路上停下来，走进一个离铁路和汽车路都不远的村子里。这个村叫做“三山村”，它就是在过去的“无人区”的中心。这里离北江省会府谅商只不过六公里多一点。全村一百多户人家，现在差不多全都从流散的地方或者“集中村”里搬回来了，就是人口稍为减了些，过去约有五百口人，现在只剩下三百多口人，这些人口的减少都是直接或者是间接地和“无人区”的制造者相关的。人们回到村里，一边就着原有的地基把房子修起来，一边就向荒野展开攻势。现在，全村二百多亩水田不仅都开出来了，而且全种上了夏稻。由于团结互济和政府的帮助，农民的生产资料迅速增加着，全村现在有了一百多头水牛，离以前的数字已经不远了。我们在一个叫吴兴良的地方干部家里坐了一会，又沿着到处是瓦砾的土道走出来。一伙年青人正在村子中间一块场子上打排球，他们中间有许多人，都曾经自动替铁路上砍过枕木。吴兴良告诉我们说：等到火车一通，大家的生产竞赛劲头就更大了。因为火车的腿长，生产出来的东西很快就可以卖出去，需要用的东西，例如农具、肥料、油、盐、布、手巾等等，也很快就可以买进来，而且价钱要比现在便宜。所以村子里的人都无条件地爱护自己的铁路。许多过去曾经参加破坏敌人交通线的游击队员，现在夜间都自动轮班到铁路上去担任警戒，预防敌人特务混进来捣乱。
    从三山村再往前去，就是一个叫“箩”车站的地方，这里也属于过去的“无人区”。全村约莫有一千人上下，也都是不久前才搬回来的。现在在新修的简单的房舍里，升起一股股炊烟。到处都充满着生活的气息。
    经过这一带，就到了前几天铁路南北两线接轨的地点，这里已经在“无人区”界外的东北部，是过去游击英雄们出击的地方。再往前进，便逐渐进入丘陵和山岳地带，这是越南人民抗战期间在北越的老解放区，谅山省便是处在这个区的东北端，和我国的广西省紧密相联。
    谅山省约有二十万左右的人口。省境的物产，除了稻子、玉米、红薯等粮食外，以林产最为丰富。这里有各种贵重的木材——红木、紫檀木等，还出产大量的茴香、香菌、木耳、茹莨（染料）等，此外还出产桔子、蜂蜜和竹器。畜产也多，可以供给平原各省和向国外出口。但是过去由于交通不便，许多土特产都没法大量向外运销。而山区里人民日常生活必需品，由于交通运输的困难，感到供不应求，例如食盐、布匹等，既少又贵。一旦铁路通车，这些问题就可以得到适当的解决。这就是为什么谅山省各族人民对修复铁路工作这样热衷拥护和支持的原因了。当修建铁路的民工来到谅山市的头一天，他们门前出现了一担柴火，上面写着：“第一担拥护修复铁路民工的柴火！”
    但是，人民热情参加和支援这条铁路修建工作，不只是看到铁路的经济价值而已，一个我们曾几次在那里休息、用饭的村子的农会副组长陈文莲异常兴奋地说：“我们把铁路修起来，把北部建设好，加强我们的力量，不让美帝国主义、法国的坏家伙和吴庭艳集团来破坏我们的和平生活。”他的话道出了越南人民普遍的心思。（附图片）
