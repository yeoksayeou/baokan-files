Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 28th: Bonn dispatch: The West German Federal Constitutional Court continued its illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party from March 21st to 25th. So far, the despicable conspiracy to frame the German Communist Party has lasted for four months, and the "trial" to create an excuse for banning the German Communist Party has been conducted thirty times.

The "trial" from March 21st to 25th mainly discussed the specific goals of the German Communist Party. In order to falsely accuse the German Communist Party of "treason," the instigators of the "trial" actually used the German Communist Party's "Program for Striving for the Restoration of National Unity in Germany," published in 1952, as "evidence" of their false accusations. However, even Bonn's representatives themselves understood that this argument was not easy to sustain, because everyone knew that the purpose of the German Communist Party's program was to unite all German people to strive for the establishment of a unified and democratic Germany. Therefore, the Bonn representative raised this issue, but colluded with the court to prevent the German Communist Party representatives from discussing the issue in detail.

German Communist Party representatives, German Communist Party Central Committee members Reschke and Fischer, and German Communist Party legal representative Krüger spoke in court. Their speeches demonstrated the German Communist Party's spirit of unyielding struggle for the peaceful reunification of Germany at the present stage.

Fischer said: The party program published in 1952 included the party's current struggle goals—the peaceful reunification of Germany—and also pointed out the path to achieve this goal. He ridiculed the claim that this program was an "attack on the basic democratic order," and he emphasized that if the Federal Government insisted that this program violated the constitution because it called for the use of strikes, demonstrations, and other non-parliamentary activities, then the question became whether the court's trial was to prohibit all demonstrations and strikes in West Germany.

The conspiracy to persecute the German Communist Party continues to be met with indignant protests from the West German people. The Hamburg Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany wrote a letter to the Federal Constitutional Court demanding an immediate halt to the "trial"; two hundred and fifty residents of Baden-Württemberg also wrote to the Federal Constitutional Court to express their protest.

    西德法院企图以“叛国”罪名诬陷德共
    德共代表申述党的纲领驳斥波恩的诬蔑
   【新华社柏林二十八日电】波恩消息：西德联邦宪法法院在三月二十一日至二十五日继续对德国共产党进行非法“审讯”。到目前为止，陷害德国共产党的可耻阴谋已经持续了四个月，为给取缔德国共产党制造借口的“审讯”已经进行了三十次。
    二十一日到二十五日的“审讯”主要谈德国共产党的具体目标的问题。为了给德国共产党诬加一个“叛国”的罪名，“审讯”的教唆者居然把德国共产党在一九五二年公布的“争取恢复德国全国统一的纲领”作为他们诬告的“证明”。但是，连波恩代表们自己也明白，这样讲是不容易站住脚的，因为大家知道，德国共产党这个纲领的目的是要团结所有的德国人民争取建立一个统一的民主的德国。因此，波恩代表提出了这个问题，但又串通法庭不让德国共产党代表详细辩论这个问题。
    德国共产党代表、德国共产党中央委员雷熙和费希以及德国共产党法律代表克吕格尔在法庭上发了言。他们的发言表现了德国共产党在目前阶段为争取和平统一德国而进行不屈不挠的斗争的精神。
    费希说：一九五二年公布的党的纲领包括了党在当前的斗争目标——和平地重新统一德国，同时也指出了达成这一目标的道路。他讥笑了这个纲领是“对基本的民主秩序的攻击”的说法，他强调说，如果联邦政府硬说这个纲领所以违反宪法，是因为它号召采用罢工、示威和其他非议会活动的方法，那么，问题就变成法庭的审讯是否要禁止西德的一切示威和罢工。
    迫害德国共产党的阴谋继续遭到西德人民的愤慨抗议。民主德国全国阵线汉堡委员会写信给联邦宪法法院，要求立即停止“审讯”；巴登—瓦登堡州的二百五十个居民也写信给联邦宪法法院表示抗议。
