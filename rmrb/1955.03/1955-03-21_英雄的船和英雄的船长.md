    The Heroic Ship and the Heroic Captain
    Wang Duan

    I.

    On January 19, 1955, the No. 163 "Nanhai" freighter was docked in Shantou harbor. The crew members were busily loading cargo onto the ship, striving to create the highest voyage record for January.

    Suddenly, a sharp and urgent air raid siren blared from afar. The escorting soldiers on the ship quickly took their positions, ready for battle.

    Four Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes appeared in the sky, swooping down to bomb and strafe the ships anchored on the sea surface. The anti-aircraft machine guns on the ship and the anti-aircraft artillery on the shore fired intensely at the enemy planes. A fierce battle began. Five bandit planes in a line rushed straight down. Two bombs exploded beside the telegraph room. Soldier Yue Kaixian bit his lip, held his breath, squinted, and aimed at the second bandit plane from the left, firing a burst that sent it sputtering flames and staggering away.

    While the escorting soldiers on the deck were fiercely fighting the bandit planes, the crew members in the engine room were also risking their lives to save the ship. The crew quarters caught fire, and the entire corridor was filled with flames and thick smoke, making it impossible to enter. Union Chairman Shi Zhenyi said to everyone, "Let's take turns going in." They took off their hats, took out their towels, soaked them in water, wrapped them around their faces, and plunged into the fire. Zeng Zhongsheng took a cotton coat, covered his head, and charged in. Yu Houyi was scorched by the flames and smoke, lost his footing, and collapsed. People dragged him out, and he vaguely said, "I'm okay, I'm okay." He got up, grabbed the fire hose, and charged in again.

    The ship's hull was hit, and many places were taking on water. The ship listed about ten degrees, a very dangerous situation. Ren Minghe saw water gushing into the second hold and rushed over, took off his clothes, and plugged the hole. Some people moved wood, some moved clothes, and all the leaks were quickly plugged.

    During the tense battle, Captain Gu Yuansong maintained a heroic and fearless spirit, calmly directing everything. Although he was knocked unconscious twice, suffered internal injuries to his chest, waist, and arms, and had his eardrums ruptured, he quickly realized, as soon as he regained consciousness, that he was a Communist Party member and had a major responsibility to the nation and the Party. He rallied himself, endured the pain, and directed the crew to put out the fire, plug the holes, move the cargo, pump out the water... and sent people to contact the shore.

    Thanks to the staunch fighting of the escorting soldiers, all the crew members, and the cooperation of the anti-aircraft artillery on shore, the bandit planes fled. Although the No. 163 "Nanhai" freighter was hit by eight shells, it stood firm on the motherland's ocean.

    II.

    The No. 163 "Nanhai" freighter not only demonstrated its heroic posture in this battle with the bandit planes, but also proved to be a hero in the face of typhoons during its sailing life.

    This happened on November 1, 1953. The No. 163 "Nanhai" freighter was docked in Haikou harbor, unloading cargo, when it suddenly received a typhoon warning. Gu Yuansong immediately directed all the ship's staff to prepare for the typhoon.

    As a typhoon of force twelve or higher whipped up huge waves that crashed onto the deck, Gu Yuansong stood steadfastly on the bridge, watching the terrifying scenes unfolding in the sea through his binoculars, directing the fight against the typhoon. Suddenly, Gu Yuansong spotted a blurry black shadow, like an arrow, flying towards the No. 163 "Nanhai" freighter. He suddenly realized: "The No. 157 'Nanhai' has broken its moorings!"

    This was a critical moment. If they were caught off guard, the ship would crash into them, and everything would be over. He immediately ordered the ship to move to the right. This was also extremely dangerous! Everyone knew that if the ship leaned to one side, the waves coming from the side would immediately engulf it. But he didn't have time to think about that. In order to avert the imminent danger, the ship tilted violently, as if it would immediately capsize into the sea. Everything on the ship fell over, and people couldn't stand. Just then, the No. 157 "Nanhai" passed by the ship. A dangerous situation was overcome thanks to calm command.

    The wind blew even harder. The ship was gradually unable to withstand the headwind. If it retreated, the anchor chain would break. If the chain broke, the ship would be blown away by the wind, and the situation would be extremely critical. Gu Yuansong immediately ordered the engine speed to be increased as much as possible. The ship advanced rapidly, fighting tenaciously against the headwind.

    People saw the captain's composure, calmness, and decisiveness, and they calmed down and felt a hundred times more courageous. The crew members, facing the typhoon that battered their faces like bullets, crawled on the deck, re-covered the tarpaulins that had been lifted by the wind, carried out various rescue and protection measures, and ensured that the cargo in the holds was not damaged. Sailor Jiang Shuqi risked his life, climbed over the bow, hugged the small flagpole, leaned out over the side of the ship, and checked the condition of the anchor chain, ensuring that it didn't fail. The tense battle was safely overcome.

    When the typhoon subsided, Gu Yuansong immediately issued orders to go and assist the brother ship that had broken its moorings and run aground on the reefs.

    Because of this tenacious struggle, they were awarded the honorary title of "Model Ship for Overcoming Typhoons."

    III.

    When the crew members talk about those glorious histories and selfless struggles, they always mention their brave, calm, and fearless captain, Gu Yuansong.

    Gu Yuansong began his nautical life at the age of nineteen. When thirteen ships of the Kuomintang Merchant Shipping Bureau announced their defection in Hong Kong in 1950, he was the first to step forward, piloting the first defector ship back to Guangzhou. He said, "The new China is the seafarers' motherland." When he accepted the task of being the captain of the No. 163 "Nanhai" freighter, someone told him that the task was arduous and required the courage to face any difficulty. He said without hesitation that he would fulfill his responsibility.

    He often educated the crew members to love the motherland, warmly cared for the crew members' thoughts, work, and life, and led all the crew members with his own exemplary actions of fearlessly completing tasks. Establishing external contacts in remote ports for loading and unloading was the most difficult task, and other ships were unwilling to take it on, but he took the responsibility. As soon as the ship docked, he would immediately get into a sampan with the political associate and head for the remote port. The water was shallow, and the boat couldn't get in. He took off his clothes, jumped into the water, and waded across. If there was no food at noon, they would take out the bread they had brought with them for lunch. If things were not settled by night, they would stay ashore, spread a borrowed mat on someone's desk, and spend the night tormented by mosquitoes until the task was completed.

    In this way, Gu Yuansong and the No. 163 "Nanhai" freighter, under his leadership, gradually became a good example of completing transportation plans. In 1954, they completed 169.08 percent of the cargo volume stipulated by the state. (Originally published in the Southern Daily, slightly abridged by this newspaper)

    英雄的船和英雄的船长
    王耑
    一
    一九五五年一月十九日，南海一六三号轮船停泊在汕头港内，船员们正忙着往船上装货，争取在一月份创造航次的最高纪录。
    突然，从远处传来一阵尖锐急促的防空警报的声音。船上的护航战士迅速地站好岗位，准备战斗。
    四架蒋贼飞机出现在天空，向停泊在海面上的船只俯冲轰炸和扫射。船上的高射机关枪和岸上的高射炮密集地朝敌机射击着。一场激烈的战斗开始了，五架贼机排成一字形直冲下来，两颗炸弹在电报房旁爆炸。战士岳开先咬紧嘴唇，屏住呼吸，眯着眼瞄准左边第二架贼机狠狠地打了一梭子，直打得它冒出火光，摇摇摆摆地逃去。
    当甲板上护航战士们和贼机激烈战斗的时候，机舱里的船员们也同样地冒着生命危险在救护船只。船员房间着火了，整条走廊都是火焰和浓烟，人们拖着救火皮龙，没有办法进去。工会主席施振仪对大伙说：“咱们轮着进去。”大家脱下帽子，拿出手巾，湿着水，裹着脸，就往火里钻。曾忠胜拿了一件棉衣，蒙着头，冲了进去。俞厚义给扑过来的火和浓烟一薰，站不住脚，一晃就栽倒下去。人们把他拖出来，他模模糊糊地说：“我行，我行。”爬起来，拿起皮龙，又冲了进去。
    船身中弹，很多地方进水了，船侧了约十度。这是十分危险的时刻。任鸣鹤看到二舱“哗哗”地涌进了水，急忙奔过去，把身上衣服一脱，将洞堵住。有些人搬木头，有些人搬衣服，一下子将所有的漏洞都堵住了。
    在紧张战斗的时刻里，船长谷源松始终保持着英勇无畏的精神，十分镇定地指挥着一切。他虽然两次被震昏，胸部、腰部、臂部都受了暗伤，耳膜也被震破了。可是，他稍为甦醒过来，马上就意识到自己是个共产党员，意识到国家和党把船交给自己的重大责任，他又振作起来，忍着疼痛，指挥着船员们救火、堵洞、搬货、抽水……，派人去岸上联系。
    在护航战士们、全体船员们顽强的战斗和岸上高射炮的配合下，贼机逃窜了；南海一六三号轮船虽然身中八弹，却始终屹立在祖国的海洋上。
    二
    南海一六三号轮船不仅是在这次和贼机的战斗中表现出它的英雄姿态，就是在航海生活上，它也是和台风作战的英雄。
  这是一九五三年十一月一日的事。南海一六三号轮船正停泊在海口港卸货。突然收到台风侵袭的警报。谷源松立即指挥全船员工做好防台风的准备工作。
    当十二级以上的台风卷着巨浪，从汹涌的海面直扑到甲板上的时候，谷源松始终站在驾驶台上，拿着望远镜，望着大海中发生的一切骇人景象，指挥着和台风作斗争。突然，谷源松发现前面一个模糊的黑影，像箭一样，向着南海一六三号轮船飞来，他猛然醒起：“南海一五七轮走锚了。”
    这是一个危急的关头，措手不及，船就会一下撞过来，那时一切都会完了。他马上发出命令，将船往右移。这也是多么危险啊！谁都知道，船身一侧，从横边卷来的风浪马上就会将船淹没在大海中，但他顾不及想这些了，为了挽救即将到来的万分危险的一霎。船身猛烈地倾斜着，好像马上就翻进大海，船上的东西一下子翻倒下来，人也站不住脚。就在这时，南海一五七号轮从船旁窜过。一场危险就在沉着的指挥下度过。
    风刮得更厉害。船逐渐顶不住迎头的大风了，如果往后退，锚链就会给拉断，链一断，船就会被风卷走，情况也是非常危急。谷源松马上下令将主机的转数尽量加大，船身迅速地往前推进着，与迎头的台风作着顽强的战斗。
    人们看到船长的镇定、沉着和果断，都安定了下来，勇气百倍。船员们迎着像弹丸一样打在脸上的台风，在甲板上爬着，将被大风掀起了的舱面帆布重新盖好，进行了各种抢救和防护，使满舱的货物没有受到损失。水手姜树岐冒着生命的危险，爬过船头上，抱着小旗杆，探身到船外，察看锚链的情况，使锚链始终没有出毛病。一场紧张的战斗就这样安然度过。
    当台风平息时，谷源松立即又发出命令前往援助走锚搁浅在礁石上的兄弟船只。
    由于这种顽强的斗争，他们获得了“战胜台风模范船”的光荣称号。
    三
    当船员们谈起那些光荣的历史和奋不顾身的斗争的时候，总会提起他们的勇敢、沉着和不怕任何艰苦的船长谷源松。
    谷源松从十九岁开始就过航海生活。当一九五零年伪招商局十三艘轮船在香港宣布起义的时候，他第一个挺身而出，驾驶第一艘起义的轮船开回广州。他说：“新中国才是海员的祖国。”当他接受南海一六三号轮船长的任务时，有人告诉他，任务是艰巨的，需要具有不怕任何困难的勇气。他毫不犹豫地说，他会尽到他所应尽的责任。
    他经常对船员们进行热爱祖国的教育，热情地关心船员的思想、工作和生活，并以自己不怕任何艰苦完成任务的模范行动来带动全体船员，在偏僻港口装卸工作中的对外联系，是最不容易完成的，别的船都不愿意担负，他便担当起来。当船一靠岸，他就立即和政治协理员坐上舢板，向着偏僻的港口驶去。水浅，船进不去，他把身上衣服一脱，跳下水去，淌着水，就这样过到对岸去。中午没有饭吃，他们就掏出带在身上的面包当作午餐。晚上，事情还没办妥，就留在岸上，在人家的办公台上铺上借来的席子，在蚊虫的骚扰中宿夜，直至把任务完成。
    就这样，谷源松和他领导的南海一六三号轮，逐渐地成为完成运输计划的良好榜样。一九五四年，他们完成了国家规定的货运量的百分之一六九点零八。　（原载南方日报，本报略有删改）
