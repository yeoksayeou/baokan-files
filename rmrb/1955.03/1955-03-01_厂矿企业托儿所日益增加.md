The nursery care system in factories and mines has greatly developed since the founding of New China. According to incomplete statistics at the end of 1954, there were more than 4,400 nursery schools nationwide, caring for more than 135,400 children. In Shanghai, there were only 36 nursery schools in the early days of liberation, but by the end of 1954, there were 387. Tianjin had only 6 in 1949, but 277 in 1954. Beijing had only one nursery school in 1949, but 291 in 1954. In other places, such as Anshan, there was also only one nursery school in 1949, but 96 in 1954. In addition to establishing and expanding formal nursery schools, factories, mines, and enterprises have also established various types of childcare facilities, such as convenient breastfeeding rooms, nursery stations in employee dormitories, and joint nursery schools. Furthermore, mass-based street (lane) nursery stations in major cities also give priority to caring for the children of female workers who have difficulties.

The work of factory and mine nursery schools has also greatly improved and advanced in recent years. Nursery schools have universally established systems for health check-ups, vaccinations, disease care and isolation, and nutritional adjustments. Children's health levels are improving day by day, and mortality rates have greatly decreased. According to statistics in Shanghai in 1954, the child mortality rate in factory nursery schools throughout the city accounted for only 3.5 per thousand of the children cared for.

Childcare workers have come up with many ways to help female workers with childcare difficulties. Many nursery schools in Shanghai have established weaning groups, using more scientific methods to help female workers wean their children smoothly without affecting their health or production. Some nursery schools have established measles isolation rooms, implementing "full-time care" for day-care children with measles, so that female workers do not have to be absent from work because their children are sick. This also ensures the safety of the children. (Communication Group of the Women Workers Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions)

    厂矿企业托儿所日益增加
    新中国成立以来，工厂矿山企业中的托儿事业，有了很大的发展。据一九五四年底的不完全统计，全国有托儿所四千四百多处，受托儿童十三万五千四百多名。上海市在解放初期仅有托儿所三十六处，一九五四年底已达三百八十七处；天津市一九四九年仅有六处，一九五四年达二百七十七处；北京市一九四九年仅有托儿所一处，一九五四年达二百九十一处；其他如鞍山市一九四九年也仅有托儿所一处，一九五四年已有九十六处。除了建立和扩大正规托儿所以外，各工厂、矿山、企业还建立了多种多样的托儿机构。如简便哺乳室、职工宿舍托儿站、联合托儿所等。此外，各大城市群众性的街道（里弄）托儿站，也都优先收托抚养有困难的女工的孩子。
    厂矿企业托儿所的工作，几年来也有了很大的改进和提高。托儿所普遍建立了健康检查、预防接种、疾病护理隔离，营养调配等制度，儿童的健康水平一天一天在提高，死亡率也大大减小。上海市一九五四年统计，全市工厂托儿所的儿童死亡率仅占受托儿童人数的千分之三点五。
    保育工作者们曾想出了许多办法来帮助托儿女工们解除困难。上海许多托儿所成立了断奶组，用比较科学的办法，帮助托儿女工在不影响孩子健康和不影响生产的情况下，顺利断奶。有的托儿所成立了麻疹隔离室，对出麻疹的日托儿童实行“全托”，使托儿女工不因为孩子生病而缺勤。并保证了儿童的安全。（中华全国总工会女工部通讯组）
