Xinhua News Agency:

    Two deep oil exploration wells have recently been successfully drilled in the Jiuquan Basin, Gansu Province. These two exploration wells are located on two structures in the basin with the greatest potential for oil reserves. One well is 2,580 meters deep, and the other is over 2,300 meters deep. One of the wells also discovered high-quality oil sand in a large section of the formation.
    The drilling workers who drilled these two wells persisted in working in the field in the ever-changing Gobi Desert, overcoming various difficulties, and improving the drilling speed. Both wells were completed two to three months ahead of the scheduled quota.

    酒泉盆地凿成两石油深探井
    在甘肃省酒泉盆地上，最近又有两口石油深探井钻凿成功。这两口探井位于盆地中储藏石油希望最大的两个构造上，其中一口井深二千五百八十公尺，另一口井深二千三百多公尺。有一口探井在一大段地层中还发现了质量很好的油砂。
    钻凿这两口探井的钻工们，在气候多变的戈壁滩上坚持野外工作，克服了种种困难，并提高了钻进速度。两口井都比规定的定额提前两个月到三个月完成了。　（新华社）
