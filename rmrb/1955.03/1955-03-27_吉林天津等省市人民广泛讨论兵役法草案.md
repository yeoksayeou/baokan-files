Xinhua News Agency, March 25th: People from all walks of life in Jilin, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shenyang and other provinces and cities are widely discussing and enthusiastically supporting the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised Draft)."

The Jilin Provincial People's Committee and the Standing Committee of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference recently held a joint enlarged meeting to discuss the draft Military Service Law. Speakers at the meeting unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support. Ma Mengda, a Hui Muslim religious leader and member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, said: "Our army was strong in the past and fought unyielding and victorious battles in the revolutionary war. In the future, in order to more effectively defend the motherland and world peace, we must implement a system of compulsory military service. I represent the Hui people of the entire province in expressing my enthusiastic support."

The Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee held its third meeting on March 23 to discuss the draft Military Service Law. Speakers at the meeting unanimously supported the draft Military Service Law. The General Study Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial-level Direct Affiliated Organs also convened a report meeting for more than 12,000 cadres from various organs stationed in Xi'an, and invited Yang Jiarui, Commander of the Shaanxi Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to give a report on the compulsory military service system.

Sichuan Province and Chongqing and Chengdu, two provincial-administered cities, as well as ten special districts including Wanxian and Yibin, and more than thirty cities and counties including Neijiang, Nanchong, and Zhongjiang, have successively established offices for discussing the Military Service Law (Revised Draft) to organize people from all walks of life to carry out discussions in a guided manner. In Dazhou and Neijiang Special Districts alone, more than 10,000 workers, government cadres, and people from all walks of life have participated in the discussions. Chongqing and Chengdu have each held report meetings with more than 1,000 participants. Special districts such as Yibin have also decided to combine the discussion with the spring ploughing production work, first conducting discussions universally at the People's Congresses or People's Committee meetings of each township, and then carrying out publicity and soliciting opinions from the broad masses of the people.

Each district within Tianjin City and Tanggu District has held meetings of the District People's Congress since March 6. The persons in charge of the CCP District Committee or the District People's Government gave reports on the draft Military Service Law and conducted group discussions.

A total of 450 representatives from the Hangzhou Municipal People's Congress, the District People's Congresses, and representatives from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province also held group discussions on the draft Military Service Law on March 18. Most of the people's representatives participating in the discussions had also solicited opinions from the people through visits or symposiums beforehand. The representatives vividly explained the necessity and benefits of implementing compulsory military service with their own experiences and study insights.

Students from more than 40 senior high schools and above in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province, have also conducted heated discussions on the draft Military Service Law. They especially welcome pre-enlistment military training in schools. Many students in various schools have automatically practiced long-distance running, grenade throwing, and obstacle jumping during sports activities. Many students participating in the "Labor and Defense System" exercises in various schools have also continued to strengthen their exercises, preparing to receive military training on the basis of the "Labor and Defense System."
