    辽宁大批拖拉机将出动春耕
    辽宁省十一个农业机器站机具检修和改装工作已基本结束，就要出动拖拉机为部分国营农场和农业生产合作社播种小麦和春翻地。绥中农业机器站已开始耙地。
    今年春季，十一个农业机器站将出动一百二十八混合台拖拉机，牵引五百零五件农具，为一百零六个村、二百九十七个农业生产合作社、两个集体农庄、十四个国营农场春翻地六千一百六十九垧，春耙地八千五百八十三垧，镇压地五千一百五十六垧，播种四千二百八十九垧。各站今年又增添了中耕除草的新作业项目，将为群众中耕三千二百六十七垧。根据去年的情况看，经过机耕的土地，一般都比当地群众的耕地增产百分之十五到二十。今春只以翻地六千一百六十九垧来计算，每垧增产五百斤，就可以给国家增产粮食三百零八万四千五百斤。
