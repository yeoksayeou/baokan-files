Guangdong Province Establishes New Overseas Chinese Farm

In February, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province established a new collective farm for Overseas Chinese in Guangdong Province to help returning Overseas Chinese find employment. The farm is located in Zhuhu Township, Hua County, and is named "Hua County Overseas Chinese Collective Farm." It covers an area of 7,000 mu and has mountain ponds and fruit trees. The natural conditions are good and suitable for planting various cash crops, and the transportation is also very convenient. In the next three years, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province plans to allocate 180,000 yuan to the farm as production and basic construction funds; 85,000 yuan will be allocated this year.

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Guangdong Province also plans to send 250 returned Overseas Chinese to the farm this year to participate in production. The first group to participate in the work of this farm will be students from the Taishan Overseas Chinese Study Class.

Prior to the establishment of this farm, Guangdong Province established the Wanqingsha Returned Overseas Chinese Collective Farm, the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Wanning County, Hainan, and the Lufeng County Overseas Chinese Collective Farm. The Wanqingsha Returned Overseas Chinese Collective Farm was merged with the state-owned Wanqingsha Farm in January 1954 to form the state-owned Zhujiang Machinery Farm. There are currently more than 1,100 returned Overseas Chinese working on this farm. More than 3,100 people work at the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Collective Farm in Wanning County, Hainan, and more than 230 people work at the Lufeng County Overseas Chinese Collective Farm.

    广东省建立新的华侨农场
    广东省华侨事务委员会为了帮助归国华侨就业，二月间在广东省内又建立了一个华侨集体农场。这个农场的场址在花县竹湖乡，名叫“花县华侨集体农场”，面积有七千多市亩，场内有山塘、果树等，自然条件良好，适合种植多种经济作物，交通也很便利。今后三年内，广东省华侨事务委员会准备拨十八万元给这个农场，作为生产和基本建设资金；今年先拨八万五千元。
    广东省华侨事务委员会并准备在今年内送出二百五十名归国华侨到农场参加生产。第一批参加这个农场工作的是台山华侨学习班学员。
    在建立这个农场之前，广东省会建立万顷沙归国华侨集体农场、海南万宁县兴隆华侨集体农庄、陆丰县华侨集体农场。万顷沙归国华侨集体农场一九五四年一月已经和国营万顷沙农场合并组成国营珠江机械农场，在这个场工作的归国华侨现有一千一百多人。在海南万宁县兴隆华侨集体农庄工作的有三千一百多人，在陆丰县华侨集体农场有二百三十多人。
