    Friendship Farm Planning Design Completed

    The land planning design for the state-owned Friendship Farm has now been completed. On March 18th, Comrade Maslov, the leader of the land consolidation survey team, and Zhang Shengsan, Deputy Director of the State Farm Administration Bureau of our Ministry of Agriculture, who is in charge of the land consolidation work of the Friendship Farm, arrived at the state-owned Friendship Farm from Harbin and formally handed over the above-mentioned planning design to Wang Caoli, the farm director. The completion of the planning design marks the basic completion of the first step in establishing the state-owned Friendship Farm: land consolidation.

    This map shows that in the future, with the correct use of this 32,800-plus hectares of land, the amount of commodity grain turned over to the state in one year, if transported by trains with a load of 30 tons, could form a train 18 li long; the amount of beef, pork, chicken and other meats turned over to the state could reach more than 1,900 tons; and the amount of milk turned over to the state could supply nearly 150,000 people for one year (at half a pound per person per day).

    The staff and workers of the state-owned Friendship Farm warmly welcome the birth of this design. They expressed with full confidence that they would strive to realize this beautiful vision with the help of Soviet experts.

    友谊农场规划设计图已制成
    国营友谊农场土地规划设计图现已制成。三月十八日，土地整理考察组组长马斯洛夫和主持友谊农场土地整理工作的我国农业部国营农场管理局张省三副局长等由哈尔滨来到了国营友谊农场，把上述规划设计图正式交予农场场长王操犁。规划设计图的完成，标志着建立国营友谊农场的第一步工作——土地整理工作业已基本结束。
    这个图上显示着：在将来，正确利用这块三万二千八百多公顷的土地，一年中缴给国家的商品粮食，如以载重三十吨的火车来运送，即可以排成一个长达十八里的列车；缴给国家的牛肉、猪肉、鸡肉等肉类也可达一千九百多吨；缴给国家的牛奶量，可以供给近十五万的人吃用一年（以每人每天半磅计）。
    国营友谊农场的职工们热烈欢迎这张设计图的诞生。他们满怀信心地表示：要在苏联专家的帮助下，为争取实现这个美好的远景而斗争。
