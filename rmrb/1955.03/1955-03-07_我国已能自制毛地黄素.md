    China Can Now Produce Digitoxin Independently
    The state-owned Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory and the Chongqing Industrial Experiment Institute have jointly completed a difficult trial production task, extracting digitoxin from foxglove leaves.
    Foxglove is a cardiotonic drug. Currently, all kinds of foxglove injections sold in the Chinese market are imported from abroad or processed by domestic pharmaceutical factories using foreign digitoxin, and they are also in short supply. Now, the digitoxin extracted from foxglove leaves by the state-owned Southwest Pharmaceutical Factory and the Chongqing Industrial Experiment Institute has been tested by the Chongqing Pharmaceutical Inspection Institute and found to meet international standards, making it suitable as a raw material for manufacturing foxglove injections.

    我国已能自制毛地黄素
    国营西南制药厂和重庆工业试验所已共同完成了一项繁重的试制工作，从毛地黄叶子中提制出毛地黄素。
    毛地黄是一种强心药。目前在我国市场上所销售的各种毛地黄针药，都是由国外进口或由国内的药厂购买外国的毛地黄素加工制成的，并且还很缺货。现在国营西南制药厂和重庆工业试验所从毛地黄叶子中提制出的毛地黄素，经重庆市药品检验所测定，认为符合国际标准，适合作制造毛地黄针药的原料。　（杨宏灿）
