Xinjiang Imports Superior Soviet Cotton Seeds

    Xinjiang Province's cotton planting area this year will increase from over 800,000 mu last year to over 1,160,000 mu. According to the plan, the total cotton output this year will increase by 77.14% compared to last year, and the yield per unit area will increase by 26.1% compared to last year. In order to solve the cotton seed problem, a total of 440 tons of superior cotton seeds suitable for cultivation in the Xinjiang region were imported from the Soviet Union.
    The superior Soviet cotton seeds imported this time include a total of eighteen varieties. Some of these varieties will undergo comparative observation experiments before a decision is made to promote their adoption; other varieties, such as "611-B," "108-F," and "Two and Three" long-staple cotton, have recently been carefully studied based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, taking into account the Soviet cultivation methods and combining them with the characteristics of various regions in Xinjiang, and a decision has been made to supply them for field cultivation this year. It is planned to cultivate them in the Manas River Basin, Urumqi, Yanqi, Korla, Aksu, and Turpan.

    新疆运进苏联优良棉种
    新疆省今年的植棉面积将由去年八十多万亩增加到一百一十六万多亩。根据计划，今年棉花总产量要比去年提高百分之七十七点一四，单位面积产量要比去年提高百分之二十六点一。为了解决棉花种子问题，由苏联引进适合新疆地区栽培的优良棉种共四百四十吨。
    这次运进的苏联优良棉种共有十八个品种。其中有些品种将经过比较观察试验后，再决定推广引用；另有“六一一伯”、“ 一零八夫”、“二与三”长绒棉等品种，最近已根据苏联专家的建议，按苏联栽培情况，结合新疆各地区的特点，认真地进行了研究，决定在今年供给大田栽培。计划在玛纳斯河流域、乌鲁木齐、焉耆、库尔勒、阿克苏和吐鲁番等地栽培。
