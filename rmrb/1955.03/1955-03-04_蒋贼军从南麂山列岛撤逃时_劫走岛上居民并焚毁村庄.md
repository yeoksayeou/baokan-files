Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, March 3rd: Our reporter reports: When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops retreated from the Nanji Islands, they committed heinous crimes just as they did on Dachen Island. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops fled, they abducted all of the more than two thousand residents on the island. From the doorways of the houses in Shanjiaoliao Village to the pier where Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops fled, traces of residents being dragged away were left along the way. Scattered on the ground were torn cotton collar and children's clothing of women and children. The villages on the island were set on fire and destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops. Many villages, such as Mazuao, Dashaao, and Huogunao, were completely burned down. The residents' clothing, food, furniture, and fishing nets were all burned to ashes. Some houses continued to smolder for several days after being burned. The fishermen's fishing boats were all destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, and broken boat planks were floating everywhere in the bays. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops fled, they also used poison to kill the residents' goats that they could not take with them, and even dogs and cats were shot to death by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops.
    The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed on the island expressed great indignation at the brutal crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, and stated that they would continue to liberate the coastal islands of Fujian and finally liberate Taiwan, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and seek justice for the people in distress.

    蒋贼军从南麂山列岛撤逃时
    劫走岛上居民并焚毁村庄
    【新华社浙江前线三日电】本社记者报道：蒋贼军从南麂山列岛撤逃时制造了像在大陈岛上一样的滔天罪行。蒋贼军逃窜时，把岛上的二千多居民全部劫走。从山脚寮村的民房门口到蒋贼军逃窜的码头上，沿途留下了居民被拖走的一道道的脚迹，地上零乱地丢散着被撕掉了的妇女和小孩的棉衣领子和小孩衣服等。岛上的村庄被蒋贼军放火焚毁了。马祖岙、大沙岙、火棍岙等许多村庄全部被烧光。居民们的服装、粮食、家具和渔网等都被烧成了灰烬。有些房屋燃烧了好几天以后还在冒着余烟。渔民们的渔船都被蒋贼军破坏了，各个岙湾里到处漂浮着被捣碎的破船板，蒋贼军在逃窜时，还用毒品害死了居民带不走的山羊，甚至连狗和猫也被蒋贼军开枪打死了。
    进驻岛上的人民解放军各部队指战员对蒋贼军的残暴罪行，都表示极大的愤恨，纷纷表示要继续解放福建沿海岛屿和最后解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，为被难的人民讨还血债。
