"Good Partner" or Robber?
	Xiaochun

    The US government announced on the 3rd that it would guarantee the investment of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Taiwan. A month earlier, on February 3rd, the US government also announced that it would provide guarantees for the investment of a steel container manufacturer, Lim Manufacturing Company, in the Philippines.

    As the Associated Press admitted, this measure by the US government is to "increase the export of US private capital to Asia." Obviously, this measure is related to the following news. This news says that the United States has drafted an expanded Asian economic and technical "aid" plan, the main way of "aid" is to encourage large amounts of US private capital investment to "develop" the backward areas of Asia. Harold Stassen, Director of the US Foreign Operations Administration, is an active advocate of this plan. In order to peddle this plan, Stassen is now traveling between the capitals of Far Eastern countries to win them over. On the 6th in Manila, he touted that the US "aid" plan "will involve capital and technical assistance needed to increase food production, expand industry, increase employment and develop trade." According to this, have the Wall Street bosses who got rich by plundering and exploiting other countries become great philanthropists? Of course not. There is a reason for this.

    The past facts of the US government providing Marshall Plan-style "economic aid" have made the people of Asia increasingly aware that the so-called "economic aid" from the United States is only to promote the sale of surplus US goods, and to make the economy of the recipient country subject to the control of US monopoly capital, serving the aggressive interests of the United States. Therefore, Asian countries willing to maintain national independence have refused to continue to accept this aid. This has forced the US aggressive group to adopt a more covert form, dressing themselves up as "good partners" of the Asian people, and wanting to continue their economic aggression against Asian countries through the so-called private investment "partnership."

    Walter Robertson, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, a representative figure in the US policy of aggression against Asia, sang a charming tune on January 13, saying that the relationship between the United States and Far Eastern countries is a "partnership" and that the United States is trying to become a "good partner," which is the reason.

    In order to make it easier for Asian countries to be hooked, the United States is also attempting to take advantage of the urgent desire of Asian countries for industrialization. Stassen has this intention. He announced in Colombo on the 4th that "accelerating industrialization will be part of the Asian economic development envisioned by the United States."

    However, US Secretary of State Dulles inadvertently revealed the true intention of the United States behind this "good partner" mask towards Asia on February 26 in Yangon. He said that the United States "cares" about Asia just like it "cares" about Latin America. Indeed, looking at the relationship between the United States and Latin American countries, one can know what kind of role Stassen's plan has arranged for Asian countries.

    As everyone knows, Latin America is the main area for direct foreign investment by US monopoly capital, and it is also one of the main targets of plunder and enslavement by US monopoly capital. According to US official statistics, US monopoly capital has invested at least six billion US dollars in Latin America. In the last eight years (1945-1952), US monopolists have made at least 5.8 billion US dollars in staggering profits here. Because they use cheap local labor and forcibly occupy the raw materials of these countries, their profit rate in Latin American countries is much higher than in the United States. This is the reason why American bosses are particularly "concerned" about that "backward region." Due to this "concern" of the United States, US monopoly capital such as Standard Oil of New Jersey, US Steel Corporation, Anaconda Copper Mining Company, and United Fruit Company not only manipulate the economic lifeline of Latin American countries and enslave the people of these countries, but also control the real political power of these countries. They can arbitrarily subvert local governments they are dissatisfied with. In the past fifty years, the United States has organized more than a hundred armed interventions and "rebellions" in Latin America. In June 1954, the United States openly interfered in the internal affairs of Guatemala, overthrowing the legitimate government of Guatemala and installing a puppet regime there to serve the United Fruit Company. In January 1955, Costa Rica suffered another US-instigated armed invasion. These are all recent examples.

    This "partner" of US monopoly capital has not brought industrialization and economic independence to Latin America, nor has it improved the lives of the people there. On the contrary, it has only deepened the economic difficulties there, increased dependence on the United States, and caused widespread poverty. Former President of Costa Rica, José Figueres Ferrer, said at a press conference in Montevideo in 1953, "The policy of private capital investment in backward countries, which is praised by the United States... brings poverty to the people."

    All these facts prove that this "good partner" of the United States is actually a robber.

    Obviously, the United States is wearing a "good partner" mask, and in the name of "aid," it is allowing US monopoly capital to infiltrate Asia in large quantities. Its purpose is to turn Asia into a second Latin America under US control, and to make Asian countries vassals of the United States. One of the main contents of the Stassen Plan is to establish an institution in the name of managing US "aid" to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries receiving "aid." Of course, the purpose of the Stassen Plan is not only this, it also intends to further squeeze out the influence of Britain and France in Asia through "aid." On this point, US monopoly capital is also planning to use Japan's economic power to take the lead. No wonder Agence France-Presse reported that "Britain is very cold towards Stassen's plan."

    The Associated Press pointed out on November 23 last year that the United States' huge investment plan in Asia "also has a great need from the political and military point of view of the Cold War." It can be seen that the strategic purpose of this "good partner" plan of the United States is to use "aid" as bait, first starting with economic control, and then controlling the military and internal affairs of Asian countries, attempting to finally pull them all into the US Asian aggression system and serve as US war tools.

    But no matter how beautiful an appearance the United States puts on its aggressive conspiracy, the people of Asian countries will not be fooled. The resistance and struggle of the Asian people against imperialist colonial oppression for centuries prove that the Asian people know very well that "partnering" with the monopoly capital of imperialist countries means losing economic and political independence and autonomy. What the Asian people want is equal and mutually beneficial economic exchanges and international cooperation between countries. "Aid" and "partnership" from a "good partner" like US monopoly capital, which is always controlling other countries and enslaving the people of all countries, has long been rejected in many parts of Asia, and in the future this "good partner" will inevitably receive more opposition here.

    “好伙伴”还是强盗？
    晓春
    美国政府在三日宣布对美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司在台湾的投资予以保障。一个月之前，二月三日，美国政府也曾宣布对美国的一家钢铁容器制造商——利姆制造公司在菲律宾的投资提供保障。
    如美联社所承认的，美国政府这种措施是为了“增加美国私人资本向亚洲的输出”。很明显，这种措施是和下面的消息有关的。这些消息说，美国已拟订了一项扩大的亚洲经济与技术“援助”计划，“援助”的主要方式是鼓励美国的私人资本大量投资，以“开发”亚洲的落后地区。美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生是这个计划的积极倡导者。为了兜售这个计划，史塔生现在正奔波于远东各国首都之间，进行拉拢。他六日在马尼拉鼓吹说，美国的“援助”计划“将牵涉到为增加粮食生产、扩大工业、增加就业人数和发展贸易所需要的资本援助和技术援助。”照这样说，难道靠掠夺和榨取别国发财的华尔街大老板们倒成了大慈善家吗？当然不是。这中间有个缘故。
    美国政府提供马歇尔计划式的“经济援助”的已往事实，已经使得亚洲人民越来越认识到：美国的所谓“经济援助”不过是为了推销美国的过剩商品，并且使受援国的经济受美国垄断资本的控制，为美国的侵略利益服务。因此，愿意保持民族独立的亚洲国家已经拒绝继续接受这种援助。这就使美国侵略集团不得不采取更加隐蔽的形式，把自己装扮成亚洲人民的“好伙伴”，想通过所谓私人投资“合伙”的形式，来继续其对亚洲国家的经济侵略。
    美国侵略亚洲政策的代表人物、负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊在一月十三日唱起迷人的调子，说美国同远东国家的关系是“合伙关系”，美国正在设法成为“好伙伴”，就是这个道理。
    为了使亚洲国家易于上钩，美国还企图利用亚洲各国对于工业化的迫切愿望。史塔生就是怀着这样的意图。他四日在科伦坡宣布说，“加速工业化将是美国所设想的亚洲经济发展的一部分。”
    但是，美国国务卿杜勒斯二月二十六日在仰光却无意之中道出了美国这张“好伙伴”面具后面对亚洲的真正意图。他说，美国“关怀”亚洲，就像“关怀”拉丁美洲一样。的确，看看美国和拉丁美洲国家的关系，就可以知道史塔生的计划给亚洲国家安排的是一个什么样的角色。
    人所共知，拉丁美洲是美国垄断资本在国外直接投资的主要地区，也是目前美国垄断资本掠夺和奴役的主要对象之一。据美国官方统计材料，美国垄断资本在拉丁美洲的投资至少在六十亿美元以上。在最近八年中（一九四五—一九五二年），美国垄断资本家在这里至少获取了五十八亿美元以上的惊人利润。因为当他们利用当地的廉价劳动并强占这些国家的原料，所以他们在拉丁美洲国家投资的利润率比在美国国内高得多。这就是美国老板对那个“落后地区”特别“关怀”的原因。由于美国的这种“关怀”，美国的美孚油公司、美国钢铁公司、安纳康达铜矿公司和联合果品公司等美国垄断资本，不仅操纵拉丁美洲国家的经济命脉，奴役这些国家的人民，而且控制了这些国家的政治实权。它们可以任意颠覆它们所不满意的当地政府。在最近五十年中，美国在拉丁美洲组织的武装干涉和“叛变”就达一百次以上。一九五四年六月美国竟公然干涉危地马拉的内政，推翻了危地马拉的合法政府，在那里安置了一个为美国联合果品公司服务的傀儡政权。一九五五年一月哥斯达黎加又遭受了美国指使的武装侵略。这些都是最近的实例。
    美国垄断资本这个“伙伴”没有给拉丁美洲带去工业化和经济的独立，也没有改善那里人民的生活。相反，它只是加深了那里经济的困难，增加了对美国的依附，造成了普遍的贫困。哥斯达黎加前总统菲洛雷斯一九五三年在蒙得维的亚的一次记者招待会上曾说，“美国所颂扬的关于在落后国家进行私人资本投资的好处的政策……给人民带来贫困。”
    所有这些事实证明美国这个“好伙伴”实际上就是强盗。
    很明显，美国戴起“好伙伴”的面具，以“援助”的名义，使美国垄断资本大量渗入亚洲，其目的就是要把亚洲变成第二个在美国控制下的拉丁美洲，使亚洲国家成为美国的附庸。史塔生计划的主要内容之一就是设立一个以执掌美国“援助”为名的机构，来干涉受“援”国家的内政。当然，史塔生计划的目的不仅如此而已，它还打算通过“援助”来进一步排挤英国和法国在亚洲的势力。在这
  一点上，美国垄断资本还盘算着借助日本的经济势力来打头阵。难怪法新社报道说，“英国对史塔生的计划很冷淡”。
    美联社在去年十一月二十三日曾经指出，美国对亚洲的庞大投资计划，“从冷战的政治和军事观点来看，也有很大这样的需要”。由此可见，美国这个“好伙伴”计划的战略目的还在于以“援助”为钓饵，先从经济控制入手，进而控制亚洲各国的军事和内政，企图最后把它们都拉入美国的亚洲侵略体系，充当美国的战争工具。
    但是无论美国给自己的侵略阴谋披上怎样漂亮的外衣，亚洲各国人民是不会上当的。几世纪来亚洲人民对帝国主义殖民压迫的反抗和斗争，证明亚洲人民知道得很清楚，同帝国主义国家的垄断资本“合伙”，就意味着丧失经济上和政治上的独立自主。亚洲人民要的是各国之间平等互利的经济交流和国际合作。像美国垄断资本这样老在控制别国、奴役各国人民的“好伙伴”的“援助”和“合伙”，在亚洲许多地方早已遭到拒绝，今后这种“好伙伴”必然还会在这里受到更多的反对。
