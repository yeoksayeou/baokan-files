    Shanghai Academic and Cultural Circles
    To Hold Report Meeting on Materialist Thought
    The working committee of the Shanghai Municipal Academic and Cultural Circles' Criticism and Discussion Meeting on the Thought of Hu Shi has decided to hold a series of academic report meetings on the propaganda of Marxist materialism in a planned way. This report meeting will begin on March 5th and continue until the end of April, with ten sessions in total. The first report meeting has been decided to be given by Liu Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai: Why Criticize Bourgeois Idealism? Why Study the Materialist Worldview?
    Since the first discussion meeting held in late January by the philosophy, politics, history, education, and literature groups of the Shanghai Municipal Academic and Cultural Circles' Criticism and Discussion Meeting on the Thought of Hu Shi, they have separately studied how to deepen the criticism of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist thought. The philosophy group has already held its second discussion meeting, focusing on "The Reactionary Essence of Hu Shi's Pragmatist 'Empiricism'." The second discussion meetings of the history, literature, and other groups will also be held successively. The criticisms and discussions on Hu Shi's reactionary views on philosophy, politics, literature, history, etc., from the first discussion meetings of each group have been written into papers and published in the Liberation Daily one after another. From February 1st to 25th, Shanghai academic and cultural figures have published 18 essays and short articles related to criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary thought in the Liberation Daily and Wenhui Daily.
