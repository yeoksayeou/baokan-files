Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Italian people are protesting the fascist thugs' attack on the Italian Communist Party offices.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, fifty party members of the fascist party "Italian Social Movement" attacked the building housing the Italian Communist Party's offices on the evening of the 9th. These fascists arrived in cars and charged towards the building, shouting: "Long live the SS!" "Long live the Western European Union!" They threw several grenades and petrol bombs into the "New Life Publishing House," which sells progressive books and newspapers in the building. These fascists smashed the windows of the bookstore and set fire to the books.
    Another group of fascists with clubs and stones tried to break into the Communist Party's offices, but they were prevented from doing so.
    They scattered anti-communist and anti-Soviet leaflets on the streets and fled before the police arrived.
    These terrorist acts by the fascists have aroused the indignation of the working people and social figures in Italy. The Rome Trade Union Council and the Rome Provincial Committee of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party issued a statement calling on anti-fascists, democrats, and all working people to take a firm stand to prevent the recurrence of attacks by bellicose fascists.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 15th] According to a TASS dispatch from Rome: Italian working people and social figures continue to protest and condemn the fascist attack on the headquarters of the Italian Communist Party.
    On the 11th, workers in various industries in Rome held a general strike. Strikes were also held in the provinces of Messina, Florence, and Pistoia. Thousands of resolutions were passed by factories demanding the trial of the main culprits responsible for these fascist atrocities.
    The Florence Municipal Council, with votes from Communist, Socialist, Christian Democratic, Social Democratic, Liberal, Republican, and Monarchist council members, passed a resolution requesting the government and parliament to take measures against those responsible for this despicable attack and to prevent the revival of fascism. The Venice Municipal Council passed a resolution with a large majority condemning the fascist thugs for attacking "the building of a party that stood at the forefront of the resistance movement." Similar resolutions were also passed by the municipal councils of Domo, Novara, Verona, Piacenza, and other places.
    The Executive Committee of the Turin Provincial Committee of the Italian Social Democratic Party issued a statement demanding the immediate dissolution of the neo-fascist party.
    Marcoeli (Republican), Vice-Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, urged the government to "strictly adhere to the provisions of the constitution and criminal law in order to demonstrate to the Italian people that the mistakes and crimes of the past will not be repeated."

    意大利人民抗议法西斯匪徒袭击意共办公处
    据新华社讯：法西斯政党“意大利社会运动”党的五十个党徒在九日晚上袭击意大利共产党的办公处所在的房子。这些法西斯分子是乘汽车去的，他们冲向这座房子，高呼：“党卫军万岁！”“西欧联盟万岁！”把几个手榴弹和汽油罐投进房子中发售进步书报的新生出版社。这些法西斯分子打碎了书店的窗户，并且放火烧书。
    另一群拿棍棒和石头的法西斯分子企图窜进共产党的办公处，但是他们被阻止住了。
    他们把反共和反苏传单撒在街上，并在警察到达之前逃跑。
    法西斯分子的这些恐怖行动已经引起了劳动人民和意大利社会人士的愤慨。罗马工会委员会同共产党和社会党的罗马省党委会发表了一项声明，号召反法西斯人士、民主人士和全体劳动人民采取坚决的立场，以防止好战的法西斯分子进行袭击的事件重演。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社罗马消息：意大利劳动人民和社会人士继续抗议并且谴责法西斯分子袭击意大利共产党领导机关大楼的事件。
    十一日，罗马各业劳动者举行总罢工。墨西拿省、佛罗伦萨省、皮萨托雅省也举行了罢工。各工厂通过了几千个决议，要求审讯这批干下法西斯暴行的首恶分子。
    佛罗伦萨市政委员会在共产党、社会党、天主教民主党、社会民主党、自由党、共和党和保皇党委员的投票下，通过一项决议，要求政府和议会对于这次卑劣袭击的责任人采取措施，并且防止法西斯主义的复活。威尼斯市政委员会以绝大多数票数通过决议，谴责法西斯匪徒袭击“在抵抗运动中站在最前列的一个政党的大楼”。多莫、诺瓦拉、维罗那、皮亚森萨等地的市政委员会也都通过类似的决议。
    意大利社会民主党都灵省委员会执行委员会发表声明，要求立刻解散新法西斯党。
    意大利下议院副议长马克雷利（共和党）吁请政府“严格遵守宪法的条款和刑法，以便向意大利人民表明，过去的错误和罪行将不会重演”。
