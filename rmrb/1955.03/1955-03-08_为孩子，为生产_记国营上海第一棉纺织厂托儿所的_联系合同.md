    For the Children, For Production
    ——A Record of the "Connection Contract" of the Nursery of the State-Owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory

    Lenin once said: "Public canteens, nurseries and kindergartens... can truly liberate women, reduce and eliminate the phenomenon of inequality between them and men in social production and social life." The nursery of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory truly plays such a role. More than 3,000 of the factory's workers are women, accounting for more than 65 percent of the total number of employees. Solving the childcare problems of the mothers among the female workers is extremely urgent.

    In the early days of liberation, the factory's nursery only had fifty beds. To meet the needs, it has now been developed to more than 160 beds, which can accommodate more than 390 children aged one month to sixteen months. According to the factory's production schedule, the nursery takes care of the children in four rotating shifts: A, B, C, and extended day. However, when children got sick, it still affected their mothers' production. Later, through the signing of "connection contracts" between the childcare workers and the female workers with children, the nursery staff further established the idea of serving production, making their work truly connected with production.

    In the past, the nursery only helped mothers with breastfeeding and had nothing to do with production. For several years, the childcare workers have been looking at their work in this way.

    In the fourth quarter of 1953, the factory launched an increase production and practice economy movement, and the nursery, like other welfare work departments in the factory, was still unclear about how to cooperate with production. At this time, the factory Party committee pointed out: "The work of the conservation section is to maintain machines, and the work of the welfare department is to maintain people; the welfare department must also earnestly serve production."

    The mothers also talked about many problems in the childcare workers' work at the symposium. When children sleep, they often kick off their blankets. Some childcare workers, in order to save trouble, tightly tie the children's legs with diapers. When mothers see red marks on their children's calves, they naturally feel distressed; some mothers are not at ease and sneak to the nursery to have a look even when they go to the toilet. Some mothers reported: "The child is often sick and cannot guarantee attendance." The situation in one class was the most serious, and nearly half of the children's mothers felt there was a problem.

    After the factory Party committee and the trade union organization educated the nursery staff, the childcare workers examined their work with a spirit of self-criticism. They also visited the workshop. They personally saw the tense situation of the workers' labor and what kind of losses would be caused if they did not concentrate. Everyone clearly realized that the task of the nursery was to: reduce diseases, eliminate accidents, take good care of children, and enable mothers to work in peace.

    Previously, some childcare workers and female workers with children had spontaneously established "childcare worker covenants" and "mother covenants." It did not play a big role, but after all, it was a creative attempt in its infancy. On the basis of the childcare workers' improved understanding, the matter of signing "connection contracts" between childcare workers and female workers with children was proposed under leadership. However, some people had concerns about the clause "guarantee to reduce children's diseases" in the contract. "Children are not machines. If they are broken, they can be repaired; mothers give their children food randomly at home, how can we guarantee that children will get sick less often?" Some female workers with children also had the idea of being afraid of trouble when they heard that they were going to sign a connection contract.

    Through the study of the general task of the state during the transition period, the childcare workers had a new understanding of their work and guaranteed to take good care of the children. At the same time, the trade union assisted the nursery in holding a "mother meeting" to let the female workers with children know that the connection contract was for taking good care of the children and to enable mothers to work in peace.

    The childcare workers and female workers with children were willing to sign the connection contract.

    The large group in Class B of the nursery began to try out signing connection contracts as a key point. Based on the health status of 32 children in the previous month, they held a forum with doctors and mothers to study the reasons for the high incidence of children's diseases and solutions. Wang Longhua often suffered from diarrhea. When childcare worker Jiang Yanming signed a connection contract with Wang Longhua's mother, she started by guaranteeing that the child would not have diarrhea and gain weight within that month; she also required the mother not to give the child food randomly and guarantee to work in peace without absenteeism. Soon, Wang Longhua's diarrhea was cured and he gained weight at the end of the month. Wang Longhua's mother was very moved and became more active in her work afterwards.

    The experience of the key experimental group further built the confidence of the nursery staff in signing connection contracts, and they generally signed connection contracts with the mothers. A new atmosphere appeared throughout the nursery.

    After three or four months, many childcare workers and female workers with children relaxed their efforts on the connection contract. Some childcare workers' guarantee conditions were always the same, and the children were not taken care of well enough. Some female workers with children set their guarantee conditions lower than the administrative targets. The inspection also had no original records as a basis, only relying on word of mouth to say "completed" or "not completed". Both sides had doubts about the role of the connection contract.

    The factory leaders promptly pointed out: "The connection contract is to guarantee each other, and should meet each other, frequently contact and exchange opinions, so that the role of the contract can be brought into play." The childcare workers discussed this instruction and examined the shortcomings in their work, and their understanding was improved again.

    When childcare worker Ji Yiru signed a contract with the mother of Zhang Xiuying, the mother guaranteed that she would not exceed six pieces of defective cloth that month. As a result, because the child was often sick, her mother was very uneasy about production, and the guarantee was not fulfilled, and nine pieces of defective cloth were produced. Ji Yiru realized that this was her own fault. After that, she took careful care of the child. Xiuying no longer got sick. Xiuying's mother originally guaranteed that she would not exceed five pieces of defective cloth in the second month, but only produced two pieces of defective cloth. She happily went to the nursery to tell the childcare worker.

    In order to improve business, the childcare workers decided to revise the contract once at the beginning of each month. As the contract was revised, they came up with various ways to take good care of the children. They put forward different guarantee conditions for different children, often held parent symposiums, used holidays to bring pictures to the workshops to promote new parenting methods to the mothers, or conducted home visits, and so on. When measles was prevalent last year, they did a good job in preventing measles transmission and measles isolation to ensure that female workers with children would not be absent from work due to their children's illness. When mothers were required to give their children whole blood injections, if some mothers were physically weak, the childcare workers would draw their own blood to inject the children. "The aunts take care of the children better than we do." The mothers were very moved. In that quarter, 49 of the 51 mothers whose children had measles guaranteed attendance. The children's health level continued to improve, which encouraged the mothers' production enthusiasm.

    In 1954, the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory comprehensively and evenly overfulfilled the production tasks, and the signing of connection contracts between childcare workers and female workers with children played a certain role.

    为孩子，为生产
    ——记国营上海第一棉纺织厂托儿所的“联系合同”
    蔡鉴远
    列宁曾经说过：“公共饭堂，托儿所和幼稚园，……能够真正解放妇女，减少和消灭她们在社会生产和社会生活作用上处于与男子不平等的现象。”国营上海第一棉纺织厂的托儿所就真正起了这样的作用。这个厂的女工三千多人，占职工总数百分之六十五以上。解决女工中母亲们的托儿问题，极为迫切。
    解放初期，这个厂的托儿所只有五十张床位。为了适应需要，现在它发展到一百六十多张床位，可以收托一个月到十六个月的孩子共三百九十多个。托儿所按工厂的生产时间，分甲、乙、丙、长日四班轮流照顾孩子。可是，遇到孩子生病时，仍然要影响母亲们的生产。后来通过保育员和托儿女工的订立“联系合同”，托儿所的工作人员进一步树立了为生产服务的思想，使她们的工作真正地同生产联系起来了。
    过去，托儿所只是帮助妈妈们解决喂奶的事情，和生产没有什么关系。几年来，保育员们一直是这样看待自己的工作的。
    一九五三年第四季度全厂开展增产节约运动，托儿所和厂里其他福利工作部门一样，仍然不明确要配合生产进行工作。这时，厂党委指出：“保全科的工作是保养机器，福利部门的工作是保养人；福利部门也必须切实做到为生产服务。”
    妈妈们在座谈会上也谈出了保育员工作中的很多问题。孩子们睡觉时常踢翻被子，有的保育员图省事，就用尿布把孩子的两腿紧紧扎起。妈妈看见孩子的小腿上扎出了红印，自然感到心疼；有的妈妈不放心，在上厕所的时候，也要悄悄遛到托儿所看看。有的妈妈反映：“孩子多病，不能保证出勤。”其中一班的情况最严重，近二分之一孩子的妈妈感到有问题。
    厂党委和工会组织对托儿所工作人员进行教育以后，保育员们用自我批评的精神检查了各自的工作。她们又参观了车间。她们亲眼看到工人劳动的紧张情况，如果注意力不集中，将会造成怎样的损失。大家明确认识到托儿所的任务是：减少疾病，消灭事故，带好孩子，使妈妈安心生产。
    以前，某些保育员和托儿女工之间自流地有过“保育员公约”、“妈妈公约”的订立。它起作用不大，但毕竟已经是一种萌芽性质的创造。在保育员提高了认识的基础上，保育员和托儿女工之间订立“联系合同”的事，就有领导地提了出来。但合同中的“保证减少孩子疾病”一条，有人有顾虑。“孩子又不是机器，坏了可以修理；妈妈在家乱给孩子吃东西，怎么好保证孩子少生病？”托儿女工听说要订立联系合同，也有怕麻烦的思想。
    经过国家过渡时期总任务的学习，保育员们对自己的工作有了新的认识，保证要带好孩子。同时，工会协助托儿所召开了“妈妈会”，使托儿女工知道联系合同是为了带好孩子，为了使妈妈们可以安心生产。
    保育员和托儿女工都愿意订立联系合同了。
    托儿所乙班中的大组作为重点开始试行订立联系合同。她们根据前一月份三十二个孩子的健康情况，召开了有医师和妈妈参加的座谈会，研究孩子疾病率高的原因和解决的办法。孩子王龙华常患腹泻，保育员蒋燕明和王龙华的妈妈订立联系合同时，打头就保证这个月内孩子不拉肚子，体重增加；也要求妈妈不乱给孩子吃东西，保证安心生产不缺勤。很快王龙华的腹泻治好了，月底体重增加了。王龙华的妈妈很受感动，以后工作更积极了。
    重点试验组的经验使全所保育员对订立联系合同进一步建立了信心，普遍和妈妈们订立了联系合同。整个托儿所出现了新气象。
    过了三、四个月，许多保育员和托儿女工对联系合同却又松了劲。某些保育员的保证条件老是那么几条，孩子也带得不够好。有的托儿女工的保证条件订得比行政指标还低，检查也没原始记录作根据，只凭口头说“完成”、“完不成”。双方对联系合同的作用都有了怀疑。
    厂领导方面及时指出：“联系合同是要互相保证的，应该互相见面，经常联系、交换意见，才能够发挥合同的作用。”保育员们对这一指示作了讨论，并检查了各自工作中的缺点，认识才又得到提高。
    保育员冀翼如和孩子张秀英的妈妈订合同时，妈妈保证那一个月不超过六匹坏布。结果因为小孩常常生病，弄得她妈妈生产很不安心，保证没完成，出了九匹坏布。冀翼如认识到这是自己的错。以后，她对孩子就细心照顾。秀英不再生病了。秀英的妈妈第二个月本来保证不超过五匹坏布，结果只出了两匹坏布，她妈妈愉快地到托儿所告诉保育员。
    为了提高业务，保育员们决定每月初修订合同一次。随着合同的修订，她们想出了各种带好孩子的办法。她们针对不同孩子提出不同的保证条件，经常召开家长座谈会，利用假日带图片到工房去向妈妈们宣传新育儿法，或进行家庭访问，等等。去年麻疹流行的时候，她们就做好预防麻疹传染和麻疹隔离工作，保证托儿女工不因孩子生病缺勤。当要求妈妈为各自孩子作全血注射，遇到有的妈妈身体虚弱，保育员就替妈妈抽自己的血给孩子注射。“阿姨带孩子比我们带得好。”妈妈们很感动。那一季度，五十一个患麻疹的孩子的妈妈，四十九个保证了出勤。孩子的健康水平不断提高，鼓舞了妈妈们的生产积极性。
    一九五四年度，国营上海第一棉纺织厂全面地、均衡地超额完成生产任务，保育员和托儿女工之间的订立联系合同起了一定的作用。
