    Preventing Man-Made Losses
    To the Editor:
    In September of last year, 10,000 cases (20,000 cans) of glycerin produced by the Shenyang Oils and Fats Chemical Factory were shipped from Dalian to Shanghai via the Dalian office of the China Chemical Raw Materials Company. The leakage from this batch of glycerin amounted to 9,430 kilograms. The leaked oil accumulated on the bottom of the ship's hold and the company's warehouse floor alone amounted to 2,000 kilograms, and it had all deteriorated and been damaged, resulting in significant losses. Almost every one of the 10,000 cases of glycerin had leakage, and 320 cans were completely empty. The main causes of the leakage were the insecure containers and poor packaging. For example, the iron barrels containing the glycerin were made of inferior tinplate, which could not withstand the weight of 20 kilograms, and the barrel bodies cracked due to long-distance transportation and handling. The barrels were not welded well, and glycerin leaked from the weld cracks. Each case contained two cans, but there was no padding on either side of the bottom of the case, and there were gaps, so the two iron barrels rubbed against each other, and some broke. Some packing workers accidentally nailed the nails into the iron barrels, and oil flowed out of the small holes.
    These losses were completely avoidable. The problem is that the relevant departments lack a sense of responsibility for state property. Some people even believe that the goods have been "insured" by the People's Insurance Company of China, and that the insurance company will compensate for any leakage or breakage, so they do not bother to package them carefully or actively prevent possible losses during transit. This attitude is obviously wrong.
    The transport breakage and leakage insurance offered by the People's Insurance Company of China is to guarantee that if goods suffer accidental damage during transportation, the company will be responsible for compensating the losses. But this does not mean that after insurance, the insured party can take an irresponsible attitude towards state property. The reason is very clear: the lost equipment is still state property; the funds paid by the People's Insurance Company of China are also state funds. I suggest that relevant enterprises seriously improve the packaging, handling, and loading and unloading of transported materials. Dai Ziwei

### 防止人为的漏损现象

    防止人为的漏损现象编辑同志：
    去年九月间，一万箱（两万听）沈阳油脂化学厂出品的甘油经由中国化工原料公司大连驻在所从大连装船运到上海。这批甘油损漏达九千四百三十公斤。仅在轮船舱底和公司的仓库地板上积储的漏油即达二千公斤，而且都已变质损坏，损失重大。一万箱甘油几乎没有一箱没有渗漏的，其中完全漏空的就有三百二十听。渗漏原因，主要是盛容器不牢和包装不善。如装甘油的铁桶是由劣质的马口铁皮制成，经不起二十公斤的重量，加上长途运输搬卸，桶身裂开；桶身焊接得不好，甘油从焊接裂口处漏出；每箱合装两听，箱底两边没有衬垫的东西，且有空隙，两个铁桶互相磨擦，有的就破裂了；有的装箱工人将铁钉误钉在铁桶上，油就从小孔中流出。
    这些损失是完全能够避免的。问题在于：有关部门对国家资财缺乏责任心。甚至有人认为货物已经向中国人民保险公司“保了险”，渗漏破碎有保险公司赔偿，因而不去妥慎包装，不去积极防止途中可能发生的损失。这种态度显然是错误的。
    中国人民保险公司举办的运输破碎渗漏险，是保障货物在运输途中如果遭受意外事故，得由公司负责补偿损失。但这并不等于保了险以后，投保户便可以对国家财产采取不负责任的态度。道理是很明显的：损失了的器材仍然是国家的物资；中国人民保险公司支付的资金也还是国家的资金。我建议有关企业，认真改善运输物资的包装和搬运装卸工作。  戴子伟
