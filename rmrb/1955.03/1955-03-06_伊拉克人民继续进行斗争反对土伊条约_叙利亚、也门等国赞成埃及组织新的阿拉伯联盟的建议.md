    Iraqi People Continue to Struggle Against the Turkish-Iraqi Treaty
    Syria, Yemen and Other Countries Endorse Egypt's Proposal to Organize a New Arab League
   [Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 2nd] According to TASS, "The Republic" reports that the Iraqi people are continuing their struggle against the military alliance concluded with Turkey. Leaflets protesting the Iraqi-Turkish treaty are appearing throughout the country. The police are carrying out large-scale arrests.
      "The Republic's" Beirut correspondent reports that middle and high school students in Baghdad went on strike on February 26 (the day after the Turkish-Iraqi treaty was signed) to protest. The strike is still continuing.
      [Xinhua News Agency, March 5th] TASS, Beirut, March 4th: The Lebanese newspaper "Al Hiyat" Baghdad correspondent reported that the strike begun on February 25th by all middle and high school students in Baghdad to protest the conclusion of the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty is still continuing. The reporter pointed out that patriots, disregarding the danger to their lives, are distributing leaflets opposing Nuri al-Said's policies and organizing temporary gatherings where speakers denounce the Turkish-Iraqi treaty concluded behind the backs of the Iraqi people.
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd] According to TASS, March 2nd: Agence France-Presse's Beirut correspondent reports that the Egyptian government has suggested holding a meeting in Cairo soon of the leaders of all Arab countries except Iraq.
    Currently, Salah Salem, the Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, is visiting the capitals of various Arab countries. He has proposed to the Lebanese and Syrian governments the establishment of a military and economic alliance of Arab countries without Iraq's participation. According to the Arab News Agency, Egypt suggests that the countries participating in this alliance establish a unified command for armed forces, unify their foreign and financial policies, and establish a "Guidance Committee" composed of representatives of Arab countries.
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd] According to TASS: Arab newspapers report that Egypt's proposal to establish an Arab League that does not allow Iraq to participate is receiving attention and support from some Arab countries.
    Syrian Army Chief of Staff Shawkat Shukeir announced on February 28th at a banquet he held to entertain Egyptian Minister of National Guidance Salah Salem that he supports Egypt's proposal to unify the armies of Arab countries. Salem is currently in Damascus discussing with Syrian government leaders the establishment of a unified Arab army without Iraq's participation. Syrian newspapers believe that Shukeir's statement indicates that Salem has successfully persuaded Syria to accept Egypt's proposal to establish a political, economic, and military alliance of Arab countries against the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty.
    Individuals close to the Egyptian and Syrian delegations believe that Saudi Arabia will be the first Arab country to participate in the organization proposed by Egypt.
    According to Cairo Radio, Yemeni Prime Minister Hassan, who is currently visiting Cairo, has also announced that the Yemeni government supports Egypt's proposal to establish a league of Arab countries without Iraq's participation.
    The Egyptian newspaper "The Republic" reported that Salem, during his recent visit to Lebanon, "successfully persuaded Lebanon to condemn the Turkish-Iraqi treaty." Cairo Radio quoted a statement from Lebanese Prime Minister Solh saying that the Lebanese government, parliament, and public are carefully studying "Salem's positive proposal aimed at ensuring the economic and military unification of Arab countries."
    Reports say that Salem is scheduled to arrive in Amman on March 2nd to hold talks with the Jordanian government.
    According to British newspapers, British political circles are closely watching Egypt's diplomatic activities among Arab countries. Although they refuse to comment on Egypt's plans and proposals, they do not hide their concerns about the path that Arab countries will choose. It is expected that Britain, which supports the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, will take diplomatic measures in the capitals of various Arab countries to persuade them to reject Egypt's proposal.

    伊拉克人民继续进行斗争反对土伊条约
    叙利亚、也门等国赞成埃及组织新的阿拉伯联盟的建议
   【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社开罗一日讯：“共和国报”报道，伊拉克人民正在继续进行反对和土耳其缔结军事联盟的斗争。全国各地都有抗议伊拉克—土耳其条约的传单。警察正在进行大规模的逮捕。
      “共和国报”驻贝鲁特记者报道，巴格达的大中学生在二月二十六日（土耳其—伊拉克条约签订后一天）举行罢课，表示抗议。罢课现在还在继续。
      【新华社五日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特四日讯：黎巴嫩“呼声报”驻巴格达记者报道，巴格达所有大中学学生从二月二十五日开始的罢课现在仍在继续中，这次罢课是为了抗议缔结土耳其—伊拉克军事条约举行的。这个记者指出，爱国者们不顾生命的危险，散发反对努里·赛义德的政策的传单，并且组织临时集会，在集会上发言的人都斥责背着伊拉克人民缔结的土耳其—伊拉克条约。
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社二日讯：法新社驻贝鲁特记者报道，埃及政府已经建议最近在开罗举行除伊拉克以外的所有阿拉伯国家政府领袖的会议。
    目前，埃及国家指导部部长赛拉·萨勒姆正在各阿拉伯国家的首都访问。他已经向黎巴嫩和叙利亚政府提出成立没有伊拉克参加的阿拉伯国家军事和经济联盟的建议。据阿拉伯通讯社报道，埃及建议，参加这个联盟的国家成立一个武装部队的统一司令部，并且统一它们的外交和财政政策，以及设立一个由阿拉伯国家代表组成的“指导委员会”。
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社消息：阿拉伯国家的报纸报道，埃及提出的成立不让伊拉克参加的阿拉伯联盟的主张，正在得到一些阿拉伯国家的重视和支持。
    叙利亚陆军参谋长绍卡特·绍克尔二月二十八日在他为招待埃及国家指导部部长赛拉·萨勒姆而举行的宴会上宣布，他赞成埃及提出的关于统一阿拉伯国家军队的建议。萨勒姆目前正在大马士革同叙利亚政府领袖们商谈成立一个没有伊拉克参加的统一的阿拉伯军队。叙利亚报纸认为，绍克尔的声明表明，萨勒姆已经顺利地说服叙利亚接受埃及的建议，即成立一个反对土耳其—伊拉克军事条约的阿拉伯国家的政治、经济、军事联盟。
    接近埃及和叙利亚代表团的人士认为，沙特阿拉伯将会是第一个参加埃及建议的阿拉伯国家组织的国家。
    据开罗电台广播，现在开罗访问的也门首相哈桑也已经宣布，也门政府赞成埃及提出的成立一个没有伊拉克参加的阿拉伯国家联盟的建议。
    埃及“共和国报”报道，萨勒姆最近在访问黎巴嫩时，“已经成功地说服黎巴嫩谴责土耳其—伊拉克条约”。开罗电台援引黎巴嫩总理索尔哈的一个声明说，黎巴嫩政府、议会和公众正在仔细地研究“萨勒姆的目的在于保证阿拉伯国家的经济和军事统一的积极建议”。
    消息说，萨勒姆预定在三月二日到达安曼，同约旦政府举行会谈。
    据英国报纸透露，英国政界正密切注视埃及在阿拉伯国家间进行的外交活动。他们虽然拒绝对埃及的计划和建议发表评论，但并不隐讳他们对于阿拉伯国家将选择的道路表示忧虑。据预料，赞成土耳其—伊拉克条约的英国将在各阿拉伯国家的首都采取外交手段以使这些国家拒绝埃及的建议。
