Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 29th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on the 29th, in order to cover up its actions of condoning the agents of American imperialists to lure and force people to withdraw to South Vietnam, the French side has repeatedly slandered that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is obstructing the freedom of movement of people in Nam Dinh province.
Recently, the mobile inspection team of the Vietnam International Supervisory and Control Commission arrived in Nam Dinh again, and met with the priest in charge of the Nam Dinh Provincial Cathedral on March 23. The priest said: "We are satisfied with the appropriate arrangements made here for issuing passes. The People's Government provides full assistance to all applicants for withdrawal." He also told the mobile inspection team that the parishioners have always enjoyed freedom of movement and freedom of religion.

Furthermore, the mobile inspection team of the Vietnam International Committee investigated the freedom of movement of residents in Quang Xuong, An Định and Tho Xuan districts of Thanh Hoa Province in north-central Vietnam from March 24 to 27.

The inspection team directly contacted local residents and asked them if they were willing to go to the South. The residents unanimously replied that they were willing to stay in the North and did not want to go to South Vietnam. When Catholics met with the inspection team, they condemned the activities of American imperialist agents threatening and deceiving residents to move to the South. Many people whose relatives had been lured away asked the International Committee to intervene and allow their relatives to return to the North.

    越南国际委员会的调查揭穿了法方的诬蔑
    南定和清化两省居民告诉机动视察小组说他们行动自由
    据新华社河内讯　据越南通讯社二十九日讯：法方为了掩饰它纵容美帝国主义者的代理人诱骗和强迫人民撤往南越的阴谋的行为，一再诬蔑说越南民主共和国政府在南定省妨碍人民的行动自由。
    最近，越南国际监督和监察委员会机动视察小组再次抵达南定，并且在三月二十三日会见了负责南定省会大教堂的神甫。这位神甫说：“我们对于这里签发通行证所作的适当安排感到满意。人民政府对所有申请撤走的人都给以充分的帮助。”他还对机动视察小组说，教民们一直享有行动自由和信仰自由。
    另讯　越南国际委员会的机动视察小组从三月二十四日到二十七日，在中越北部清化省广昌县、安定县和寿春县调查这个地区居民行动自由的情况。
    视察小组直接和当地居民接触，询问他们是否愿意到南部去。居民一致回答愿意留在北部，不愿到南越去。天主教徒们在会见视察小组人员时，谴责美帝国主义者的特务威胁和欺骗居民迁往南部的活动。许多有亲属被诱迫撤走的人要求国际委员会出面干涉，让他们的亲属回到北部来。
