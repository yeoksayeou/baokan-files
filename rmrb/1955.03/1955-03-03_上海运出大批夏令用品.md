Shanghai Ships Large Quantities of Summer Goods

As spring has just stepped onto the land of the motherland, the state-owned commercial departments in Shanghai are already actively transferring summer goods to various regions. By February 20th, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had shipped over 1 million bolts of light-colored floral cloth and printed linen gauze, and the Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China National General Merchandise Company had shipped 700,000 dozens of undershirts and vests. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China National Pharmaceutical Company had also shipped large quantities of summer medicines such as Rentan, Ten Drops of Water, and Cooling Balm. Among them, Rentan shipped to the Northwest region alone amounted to 1,400 boxes.

This year, the summer goods produced in Shanghai have been improved in many ways based on the opinions of consumers from various regions. The general merchandise company shortened undershirts and vests by one centimeter, which does not hinder wearing but saves cotton yarn, enough to weave an additional 11,000 dozens of undershirts in this year alone. The pharmaceutical company improved the packaging specifications of summer medicines. For example, "DDT solution" used to be in 500 cc bottles, and sometimes it was wasted if not used up. This year, when organizing processing and ordering, a new type of 250 cc bottle has been added. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has organized the production of more than 460 new patterns of light-colored floral cloth this year, including small floral patterns such as plum blossoms, cherry blossoms, and jasmine, which are loved by rural women, as well as plain-background, large-lace skirt fabrics mainly for urban girls to make skirts.

    上海运出大批夏令用品
    当春天刚刚踏上祖国大地的时候，上海市国营商业部门已经在积极向各地调运夏令用品了。到二月二十日，中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站运出的浅色花布和印花麻纱，已经有一百多万匹，中国百货公司上海采购供应站运出的汗衫和背心有七十万打。中国医药公司上海采购供应站也运出了大批仁丹、十滴水、清凉油等夏令药品，其中仅运给西北地区的仁丹就有一千四百箱。
    今年上海生产的夏令用品，根据各地消费者的意见作了许多改进。百货公司把汗衫和背心缩短了一公分，这样并不妨碍穿着，但是节省下来的棉纱，仅今年一年就可以多织一万一千打汗衫。医药公司改进了夏令药品的包装规格，如“滴滴涕溶液”过去都是五百公撮一瓶，有时使用不完便造成浪费，今年组织加工和订货时，新增加了二百五十公撮的一种。中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站今年组织生产的浅色花布，有四百六十多种新花样，其中有梅花、樱花、茉莉花等农村妇女喜爱的小朵花型，也有主要供城市姑娘们做裙子用的素底大花边裙子布。
