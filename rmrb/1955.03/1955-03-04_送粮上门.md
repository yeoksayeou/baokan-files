    Delivering Grain to the Door
    In the twelfth district of Taoyuan County, Hunan Province, there are fifteen townships, and three grain supply points have been established. Most of the people in the townships can buy grain conveniently, but the three townships of Qujia Rong, Lianghuangdian, etc., are far from the supply points. In order to facilitate the purchase of grain for families lacking labor in these areas, the local grain department decided to deliver grain here every ten days. On January 20, the first day of grain delivery, the three grain supply points in the district sent people to carry more than 2,300 jin of rice to Qujia Rong and other three townships to supply grain to their doorsteps. In two days, more than 700 jin of rice were sold, and 31 households of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, families of lake management laborers, and families lacking labor who lacked grain bought grain. Chen Qigu, a family member of a lake management laborer in Qujia Rong Township, said with emotion: "The people's government is really taking care of us so thoughtfully. I want to write to my son and tell him not to worry about the affairs of the family and to work harder to repair the lake." Old farmer Xu Leqing said: "I have lived for seventy years, and this is the first time I have seen the government deliver rice to our doorsteps for sale. The state's grain store is really good!"

    送粮上门
    湖南省桃源县第十二区有十五个乡，设立了三处粮食供应点。大部分乡的群众买粮都很方便，只有璩家溶、梁皇殿等三个乡距离供应点较远。当地粮食部门为了便利这些地区缺乏劳动力的人家购买粮食，决定每隔十天到这里送粮一次。一月二十日送粮的第一天，全区三处粮食供应点派人挑着二千三百多斤大米，分别到璩家溶等三个乡上门供应。在两天当中，共卖出七百多斤大米，有三十一户缺粮的烈属、军属、治湖民工家属和缺乏劳动力的人家买到了粮食。璩家溶乡治湖民工家属陈七姑感动地说：“人民政府对我们真是照顾得周到。我要写信给我儿子，叫他不要挂念家里的事情，加劲把湖修好。”老农民徐乐清说：“我活了七十来岁，头一次看到政府送米上门来卖，国家的粮店真是好！”（贺才仁等）
