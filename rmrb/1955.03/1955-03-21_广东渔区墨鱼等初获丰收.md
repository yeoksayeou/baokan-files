The spring fishing season has begun for fishermen in Guangdong's coastal areas. Since February, the climate in the South has gradually warmed, and schools of cuttlefish and horse mackerel have been seen floating on the surface of the sea in search of food from eastern to western Guangdong, a rare occurrence in previous years. In the waters off Shadi, more than 13,000 dan of cuttlefish have been caught in just over ten days. In the port of Zhabo, even small fishing boats can catch five or six hundred jin of cuttlefish a day. To date, more than 30,000 dan of cuttlefish and more than 40,000 dan of horse mackerel have been caught in Guangdong's coastal fishing ports. In the South China Sea, the maximum daily catch of horse mackerel exceeded 5,000 dan. This single day's production is equivalent to the total production of horse mackerel in Guangdong's coastal fishing ports for the entire month of February last year.

    广东渔区墨鱼等初获丰收
    广东沿海渔民春季捕鱼工作已经开始。从二月份起，南方气候已逐渐变暖，在由粤东到粤西的海面上，墨鱼、鰺鱼成群的浮游在水面上觅食，这是往年所少见的。在沙堤的海面上，十多天来已捕获墨鱼一万三千多担；闸波港一般的小钓船一天也可以钓到墨鱼五、六百斤。到现在止，广东沿海各渔港已捕获墨鱼三万担以上，鰺鱼四万担以上。在南海的海面上，最多一天捕获鰺鱼五千多担，这一天的生产就相当于去年二月份一个月广东沿海各渔港鰺鱼的总产量。　（本报驻广州记者）
