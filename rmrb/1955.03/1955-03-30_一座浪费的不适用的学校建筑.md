    A Wasteful and Unsuitable School Building
    By Our Correspondent Gu Lei
    The "Geological Palace" is the school building of the Northeast Institute of Geology. The entire building has five floors and is 42 meters high, making it one of the most luxurious buildings in Changchun.
    This "palace" has an area of more than 28,600 square meters, costing more than 6 million yuan, with an average construction cost of more than 220 yuan per square meter. Moreover, it was built on the foundation of the former puppet Manchukuo imperial palace. Much money could have been saved on the foundation during construction. Therefore, in reality, the calculated cost per square meter should be higher than 220 yuan!
    The state stipulated that the construction cost of university school buildings (classrooms and laboratories) should not exceed 140 yuan per square meter in 1953 and should not exceed 125 yuan per square meter in 1954. Measured against this standard, the investment in the "Geological Palace," even calculated at 140 yuan per square meter, exceeded the state control target by more than 2.3 million yuan. This means that the money used to build the "Geological Palace" could have built at least one and a half school buildings of the same size according to the state-prescribed standards.
    When allocating investment, the Ministry of Geology did not fully consider the investment effect, nor did it specifically review the design, and was also negligent in inspecting the project. The Changchun Municipal People's Government also felt that adding a "magnificent" building could add luster to the city's appearance, and in case the Institute of Geology moved away, it could take over the building for other uses, so it also enthusiastically helped. The Institute of Geology also did not object to the building, because after all, it was still a magnificent school building, so why not! This is the main reason for the waste.

    Why did this building waste so much money?
    First, let's look at the roof. This "palace" is paved with more than 230,000 green glazed tiles. There are various glazed decorations on the roof ridge: at both ends of the main ridge, there are "ruyi"-shaped "kisses" with phoenixes carved on them; nine immortal beasts are squatting on the inclined ridges; at the tips of the flying eaves, there is a fairy riding a luan; the beam ends and brackets are exposed under the roof... In short, all the structures and decorations that can be seen on old-style palaces are here, although they are all reinforced concrete products, they are still painted with various colors like the architects of the feudal era handled wooden structures, truly a "carved beams and painted rafters."
    In order to express the "palace's" grandeur, the main entrance is opened on the second floor. When entering the "palace," you must first pass through two "huabiao"-style lamp posts carved with coiled dragons; behind the lamp posts, a pair of huge stone lions sit on two large stone piers. Moving forward, you step onto natural granite steps; the steps lead to a platform of more than 600 square meters, also paved with natural granite; when approaching the main entrance, you can also see walkways extending on both sides of the main entrance, each 50 meters long, surrounded by railings with carved baluster heads, all terrazzo products; in the center are five vermillion-lacquered gates, inlaid with huge copper decorations; above the gate hangs five "palace lanterns" worth 2,500 yuan.
    The interior decoration is extremely luxurious. A large chandelier in the central hall alone cost 800 yuan. The floor of the hall is made of brown artificial marble. The twelve large pillars in the hall are also inlaid with artificial marble. On both sides of the central staircase, there are two fleshy natural marble stone drums, which took 600 man-days to carve, costing 5,700 yuan for this item alone. Other things such as small mosaic floors and marble handrails are all done with "utmost care."
    Most of the structure of this building is reinforced concrete, and some beams are steel. Except for the "chiseled stone" on the walls, which preserves the original appearance of the material, other places are painted with oil paint. The walls of the corridors are painted with green bamboo and various flowers. Most of the walls of the rooms are painted with monochrome oil paint in the upper part, and "peace doves" and "mandarin ducks playing in the water" are painted at the base of the walls. All kinds of exposed structures are painted with various patterns. Through these luxurious decorations, it is not difficult for people to imagine the waste of building materials, the waste of paint for decoration, and the waste of a large amount of labor for painting and drawing.

    The "Geological Palace" was built from 1953 to 1954. At this time, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people were carrying out the great socialist construction with full of victorious confidence. This was an era full of light and happiness; the purpose of building the Institute of Geology was to train many vibrant young people with broad prospects into geological talents who master modern technology, in order to accelerate socialist construction. Therefore, in construction, we must closely rely on the principles of "suitability, economy, and beauty," create images that can reflect the economic and political life of this era, and convey the concrete feeling of the great changes in the motherland to the younger generation.
    But what images do we see?
    In the central hall, the "caisson ceiling," which is three stories high from the ground, is filled with paintings of white cranes and blue skies. All the large and small horizontal beams are painted with colored paintings, some are "three blessings clouds," some are "bats," and some are painted with half of the rising sun emerging from the sea, just like the paintings used in feudal society to symbolize "rising step by step." When this "palace" was first completed, you could still see stories such as "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea," "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang," and "Naval Battle" here, but later it was felt that they were "too uncoordinated" with the building, so they were all painted over and replaced with pine, bamboo, plum, and orchid. On a ink painting of plum blossoms, there is a line of cursive script. Looking closely, it seems to be the five characters "Plum occupies the head of all flowers"; the word is signed "×× Tourist" below, just like the inscriptions commonly seen in ancient temples. The two-story "pavilions" surrounding the twelve large pillars in the hall are painted with various colors, especially blue. In addition, the large chandelier hanging from the ceiling and the lights on the pillars are all "candle-style" and "oil lamp-style." After the lights are turned on, the dim light flickers, illuminating the brown marble floor and the dim walls, illuminating all kinds of "antique" decorations, truly like being in a Buddhist hall or an ancient temple.
    Such a building, whether from the outside or inside, does not show the spirit of our times. What we see is just a crude imitation of ancient architecture, all in the style favored by the ruling class of feudal society—
  "Auspicious," "safe," "wishful," "detached," "empty."

                  ×××
    Writing this far, I have not yet mentioned the biggest shortcoming of this building—so much money was spent, and it was decorated so luxuriously, but it is not suitable.
    There are many pillars in the building, the light in the rooms is weak, and the lower four floors cannot be used as classrooms, so the classrooms have to be placed on the top floor. Students have six classes a day, eat two meals, plus two exercise breaks, so they have to run up and down several times. And when it rains, there are more than 100 leaks in the roof, which also affects learning.
    The whole building has electricity for elevators and lights, but no electricity for laboratories. If you want to experiment, you can't turn on the elevator or lights; if you want to take the elevator and turn on the lights, don't do experiments. You can only take care of one thing at a time. The substation does not have explosion-proof equipment, and there will be danger if you use them all at once!
    The school currently needs more than 70,000 square meters of space. Because this unsuitable building was built, it has already occupied more than 80,000 square meters, which is still not enough, and another 20,000 square meters has to be built. In this way, the classrooms are scattered, which also increases the difficulty of management.
    Except for the fifth floor, each room in this school building is narrow and long,
  with one window. There are few windows, the rooms are deep, so it is naturally not bright inside, and most of the rooms have pillars. One pillar in a small room, two, four, or six pillars in a larger room, some blocking the door, some close to the window, which is not only unsightly but also in the way. It is very dim everywhere in the building. When the sun is high in the sky, it is dusk here; when the sun sets, it is already night here. Even if you turn on the lights, you cannot feel a bright and pleasant atmosphere.
    Everyone knows that toilets should be well-ventilated, but the windows of some toilets here can never be opened. There is no exhaust device in the bathrooms, no urinals; the floor of the toilets has no slope, which easily leads to water accumulation, and so on. In short, you cannot see the designer's concern for people here.
    The Changchun Municipal Government originally had a small plan, suggesting that the walkways on the second floor and the balconies on the fourth and fifth floors be repaired for review during festivals, but now it seems that this purpose will not work either. If the reviewers stand on the fifth and fourth floors, they are too high; if they stand on the walkways on both sides of the gate, they are too low. During last year's National Day parade, a rostrum had to be built separately in front of the gate, and the original plan of "killing two birds with one stone" also failed!

              ×　×　×
    From the perspective of suitability, economy, beauty, or any other angle, the "Geological Palace" exposes serious errors in design thinking. That is the pursuit of form and luxury. What other explanation is there besides this? At this time, those who actively advocated building this building may find various excuses to say:
    "This was originally using the old foundation and was restricted by the original structure, so it could not be suitable for school use!"
    But, people also have the right to ask in return:
    "The money given by the state was to build a school, not to restore the old imperial palace!"
    They may also say:
      "Since we want to promote national form, it is inevitable to waste some in structure, materials, and decoration. Why be so calculating!"
    To this kind of statement, people will firmly answer:
    "If this is really the case, the country and the people resolutely do not need this kind of 'national form' that is wasteful, unsuitable, and not beautiful!"

### 一座浪费的不适用的学校建筑

    一座浪费的不适用的学校建筑
    本报记者　顾雷
    “地质宫”是东北地质学院的校舍，全楼五层，高四十二公尺，是长春市内最豪华的一座建筑物。
    这座“宫殿”二万八千六百多平方公尺的面积，用了六百多万元，平均每平方公尺的造价二百二十多元。而它还是在伪满时旧皇宫的基础上建筑的。修建时可以节省很多打基础的钱。因此，实际上，在计算每平方公尺造价时，还应高于二百二十多元！
    国家曾规定，高等学校的校舍（教室和实验室）每平方公尺造价一九五三年不得超过一百四十元，一九五四年不得超过一百二十五元。以这个标准衡量“地质宫”的投资，即使按每平方公尺一百四十元计算，也超过国家控制指标二百三十多万元。这也就是说，用建筑“地质宫”的钱，照国家规定的标准，至少可以多盖同样大小的校舍一个半。
    地质部在拨付投资时，没有充分考虑投资效果，也没有具体审查设计，又疏于对工程的检查，长春市人民政府也觉得添一幢“富丽堂皇”的建筑，可以为市容增光不少，而万一地质学院搬走了，便可以接收这个建筑以备他用，因此也热心帮助。地质学院也不反对这个建筑，因为究竟还是一幢辉煌的校舍，又何乐而不为呢！这就是造成浪费的主要原因。
                ×××
    为什么这座建筑物会浪费这样多的钱呢？
    先看看屋顶。这个“宫殿”，是用二十三万多块绿色琉璃瓦铺成。屋脊上有各种各样的琉璃装饰：正脊两端，挑着“如意”形的“吻”，吻上刻着凤；戗脊上蹲着九条仙兽；在飞檐的梢头，有一位仙女骑着鸾；房盖下露出梁头，斗拱……，一句话，凡是在旧式宫殿上可以看到的结构和装饰这里都有，虽然全是钢筋混凝土的制品，但仍同封建时代的建筑家处理木结构一样，涂上了各种油彩，真正是一片“雕梁画栋”。
    为了表现“宫殿”的气魄，大门开在二楼。进“宫”时，首先要穿过两根雕着盘龙的“华表”式的灯柱；灯柱后面，两个大石墩上分坐着一对巨大的石狮子。再向前走，便步上天然花岗石的台阶；台阶上是六百多平方公尺的一片平台，也是用天然花岗石铺成；快接近正门时，又可看见翼伸在正门两旁的走台，每边各五十公尺长，都用栏杆围着，栏杆上装有雕着花纹的望柱头，全是水刷石制品；正中是五扇朱漆大门，上面嵌着巨大的铜饰；门顶上，高悬着价值二千五百元的五盏“宫灯”。
    楼内的装饰极其豪华。中央大厅上的一盏大花灯就花了八百元。大厅的地面是褐色人造大理石的。厅里的十二根大柱，也用人造大理石镶起来。在中央阶梯两边，摆着两个肉色天然大理石的石鼓，这是用六百个工日刻成的，只这一项就花了五千七百元。其他如小方块拼花地板、大理石的扶手等，也都无一不做到了“尽量讲究”。
    这幢建筑中的大部分结构是钢筋混凝土的，有一些梁还是钢的。这里除了墙面的“剁石”还保存材料的原有面目外，其他地方都涂上了油彩。走廊的墙上画着绿竹和各种花卉。大部分屋子的墙都是上部涂着单色油彩，墙根上画着“和平鸽”和“鸳鸯戏水”。凡是露在外面的各种构架，都画着各色图案。透过这些豪华装饰，人们不难想像到建筑材料的浪费、装饰用的油漆的浪费、以及粉刷和描绘用的大量人工的浪费。
                ×××
    “地质宫”是一九五三年到一九五四年修建的。这时，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，正满怀胜利信心地进行着伟大的社会主义建设。这是个充满光明和幸福的年代；建筑地质学院的目的，是要把许多朝气勃勃、有广阔前途的青年，培养成掌握近代技术的地质人材，以便加速社会主义建设。因此，在建筑上，要紧紧依靠“适用、经济、美观”的原则，创造出能够反映这个时代经济、政治生活的形象，把祖国伟大变化的具体感觉传达给年轻的一代。
    但是，我们所看到的是些什么形象呢？
    在中央大厅，离地面有三层楼高的“藻井”上，画满了一幅幅的白鹤青天。所有大小横枋上，都油漆着彩画，有的是“三福云”，有的是“蝙蝠”，还有的是画着海上露出半边朝日，和封建社会用来象征“指日高升”的画图一般无二。这座“宫”初落成时，在这里还可以看到“八仙过海”“三打祝家庄”“兵船大战”等故事图，后来觉得和这个建筑“太不协调”，都涂掉了，又换上了松、竹、梅、兰。在一幅墨绘梅花上，题着一行草书，因字迹很小，仔细看去，彷佛是“梅占百花魁”五个字；词的下面署着“××游人”，和在古庙里常见的题字一个模样。围绕着大厅中十二根大柱子的两层“楼阁”，都涂着各种各样的颜色，而尤以蓝色为多。再加上天花板下吊着的大花灯和柱子上的灯都是“蜡烛式”和“油灯式”的，开灯以后，微光闪烁，照着褐色大理石的地面和暗淡的墙壁，照着各种“古色古香”的装饰，真像置身在佛堂或古庙里。
    这样的建筑，无论从外部或内部，都看不到我们这个时代的精神，所看到的只是对古代建筑的生搬硬套，都是封建社会统治阶级所爱好的风格——
  “吉祥”“平安”“如意”“超然”“虚无”。
                  ×××
    写到这里，还没有提到这座建筑的最大缺点——钱花得这样多，装饰得这样豪华，但并不适用。
    楼里的柱子特别多，屋子里光线弱，下面四层楼都不能做教室，不得不把教室放在最高一层。学生一天六堂课、吃两顿饭，外加两次工间操，就得上下跑好几趟。而下雨时，房顶有一百多处漏水，也影响学习。
    全楼有开电梯、点电灯用的电，没有实验室用的电。想试验就不能开电梯、点电灯，想坐电梯、点电灯就别进行试验，两头只能顾一头，变电所里又没有防爆装置，一齐用就出危险！
    学校现有的人数共需要七万多平方公尺房子。因为盖了这个不适用的楼，现在已占用了八万多平方公尺，还不够用，还得再盖两万平方公尺。这样一来，教室分散，也增加管理方面的困难。
    这座校舍，除五楼外，每间屋子都是窄而长，
  一面窗户。窗户少，房子深，里面自然不亮，而且大部分房子里都有柱子。小屋子一根，大点的有两根、四根、六根的，有的顶着门口，有的紧靠窗口，不仅难看而且碍事。楼内各处都暗淡得很，太阳当空时，这里是黄昏，夕阳西下时这里已是夜晚了，即使打开灯，也感觉不到明朗、愉快的气氛。
    谁都知道，厕所是应该空气流通的，但是这里有些厕所的窗子却永远开不开。浴室里没有排气装置，没有小便池；厕所的地面没有坡度，容易积水，等等。总之，在这里看不到设计者对人的关怀。
    长春市政府原来还有一个小打算，建议修二楼的走台和四楼五楼的阳台，以备过节时检阅用，现在看来这个用场也不行。检阅的人如果站在五楼和四楼太高，站在大门两旁的走台上又太低。去年国庆节游行时，不得不在门前平台上另搭一个主席台，原来“一举两得”的打算也落空了！
              ×　×　×
    无论从适用、从经济、从美观、从任何一个角度来看，都暴露了“地质宫”设计思想上的严重错误。那就是追求形式，追求豪华，除此以外还有什么别的解释呢？这时，那些积极主张盖这幢楼的人可能找出各种借口说：
    “这原是利用的旧基础，受原有结构的限制，不可能适合学校用啊！”
    但，人们也有权这样反问：
    “国家给的钱，是要盖学校的，并不是恢复旧皇宫的呀！”
    他们还可能说：
      “既然要发扬民族形式，难免在结构、材料和装饰方面浪费一些，何必斤斤计较呢！”
    对这种话，人们将会坚决地回答：
    “如果真是这样，国家和人民坚决不需要这种浪费大、不适用、又不美观的‘民族形式’！”
