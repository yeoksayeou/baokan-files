More than 950 international students from various countries are currently studying at 74 universities and secondary specialized schools in China. These include students from the Soviet Union, various People's Democratic countries, and 14 countries such as Finland, India, and Indonesia, with students from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam constituting the vast majority. It is estimated that the number of international students in China will increase to over 1,600 after the summer vacation this year. Before 1954, 120 students from countries such as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia had already graduated and returned to their home countries.

International students from various countries are studying over 100 majors in various types of schools in 26 cities in China, including engineering, agriculture, medicine, finance and economics, politics, language and literature, history, and art. Before formally studying their majors, they first study Chinese language for one year at the Chinese Language Special Training Class of Peking University or the Chinese Language Special Training School of Guilin. Students majoring in literature, history, and philosophy must study Chinese language for two years. During this year, they initially master the ability to listen to lectures, read books, and speak, and can learn and use 4,000 to 5,000 Chinese words, laying the foundation for further study of their majors. Currently, there are more than 330 international students studying in these two units.

Most of the students from the Eastern European People's Democratic countries study Chinese literature, history, art, and foreign trade, with a few studying agricultural science and engineering. Eight students from Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other countries are studying Chinese art history, dyeing and weaving, traditional Chinese painting, and printmaking at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Polish postgraduate student Subitz has studied Chinese primitive society and Yin Dynasty art, ancient bronzes, paintings, ceramics, and arts and crafts such as lacquerware, jade articles, and cloisonné at the Palace Museum and the Historical Museum.

At Tangshan Railway Institute, 24 students from Korea and Vietnam are studying railway engineering technology. At the Beijing Machine Building School, more than 30 students from Korea and Vietnam are studying in five majors: casting, machine tool manufacturing, metal cutting, tool manufacturing, and metal heat treatment.

The vast majority of these international students study very hard and achieve excellent results. Among the 84 students from eight countries, including the Soviet Union and Romania, studying at the Renmin University of China, most of their grades last semester were excellent, and some were good. The seven Vietnamese students at Wuhan Institute of Hydraulic Engineering all achieved excellent grades in all courses. (Xinhua News Agency)

    九百多名外国学生留学我国
    有九百五十多名各国留学生目前正在我国七十四所高等学校和中等专业学校学习。其中包括苏联、各人民民主国家和芬兰、印度、印度尼西亚等十四个国家的留学生，以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国派来的留学生占绝大多数。到今年暑假以后，在我国的各国留学生数预计将增到一千六百多名。在一九五四年以前已经有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、匈牙利、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克等国一百二十名留学生结业回国。
    各国留学生在我国二十六个城市的各类学校里分别学习着工、农、医、财经、政治、语言文学、历史和艺术等类共一百多个专业。他们在正式学习专业以前，先在北京大学中国语文专修班或桂林中国语文专修学校学习一年中国语文，其中学文史、哲学的学生须学二年语文。在这一年时间内，他们初步掌握听课看书和说话的能力，能学会和运用四千到五千个中国词汇，为进一步学习专业打下基础。现在在两个单位学习的留学生共有三百三十多名。
    东欧各人民民主国家的留学生大多数学习我国的文学、历史、艺术和对外贸易等专业，有少数学习农科和工科。保加利亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰等国的八名留学生正在中央美术学院学习中国美术史、染织、彩墨画和版画。波兰研究生苏贝慈已在故宫博物院和历史博物馆研究过有关中国原始社会及殷代的美术，古代的铜器、绘画、陶瓷，以及漆器、玉器、景泰蓝等工艺美术。
    在唐山铁道学院有二十四名朝鲜和越南的留学生在学习铁道工程方面的技术。在北京机器制造学校也有三十多名朝、越留学生分别在铸造、机床制造、金属切削加工、工具制造、金属热处理等五个专业学习。
    这些留学生绝大多数学习都很努力，成绩优良。在中国人民大学学习的苏联、罗马尼亚等八国的八十四名留学生中，上学期的成绩大部分都是优等，
  一部分是良好。在武汉水利学院的七名越南留学生，各项课程的成绩都是优等。（新华社）
