    The "Specialness" of Key Projects
    Wang Pu
    The key projects designed with Soviet assistance are at the heart of our country's First Five-Year Plan. The state is making every effort to save in all areas, concentrating large amounts of funds to supply the needs of these projects; the Party is drawing the most outstanding cadres from various posts to send to these projects; the Soviet people and government have sent technically excellent experts to help build these projects; existing enterprises are treating orders from these projects as the most urgent and important tasks to complete; transportation departments, trade departments, cultural and educational departments, and all related people are doing their utmost to support these projects.

    However, some people working on key projects have become "dizzy" as a result. They feel that since the work they are undertaking is the most important, then everything should be different, and everything should appear to be "key." Thus, everything is done with "special circumstances," large expenditures do not follow state quotas, and small expenditures do not follow regulations. They demand that everyone obey and "support" them, and they can disregard the difficulties of others and the state in the slightest. Moreover, their demands for things are as urgent as sparks, leaving no room for discussion. Otherwise, "you cannot afford to delay key projects."

    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is somewhat like this. When formulating plans at the beginning of last year, they emphasized their "special circumstances," saying that the quotas for the Northeast region were not applicable to them. The state stipulated an average of 12.4 million yuan (old currency) per person per year for construction costs, but they insisted on 21.6 million yuan (old currency). When building dormitories, they refused to use existing standard designs and insisted on designing them themselves, spending more than 100,000 yuan (old currency) per square meter. Because they did not compile plans according to the state-stipulated quota data, the construction costs listed in the plan were too high, and the construction cost of the factory buildings alone was over-reported by 146 billion yuan (old currency). Now, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has overcome much of this arrogance and self-importance, but unfortunately, some units are still learning from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, using their shortcomings and mistakes as their own "standards" and "experience" in capital construction. For example, cadres from the tractor factory and the ball bearing factory told their superiors: "Whatever the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant does, we will do the same." These two factories and the mining machinery factory all want to build their own separate guesthouses. The tractor factory believes that it is a large factory, and other factories should obey it; when the superiors asked them to build a guesthouse jointly with the ball bearing factory, they insisted on disagreeing. In addition, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory spent 1.24 million yuan (old currency) per square meter to build cadre dormitories, with a construction area of 91 square meters per household, which is twice the size of ordinary dormitories. "If you build like that, why can't I build like that?" The Harbin Boiler Factory was not convinced and imitated the Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory to build the same dormitories.

    Such "specialness" is really detrimental to the glorious title of key projects. Key projects are where the hopes of the people of the whole country are placed, and the people have given the greatest trust to those who work in key projects. The "specialness" that the people demand of key projects is: because key projects have the most investment, they are required to pay "special" attention to saving; because key projects have the most complex technology, they are required to be "special" careful to ensure that the project reaches first-class quality; because the early or late completion of key projects directly affects the speed of industrialization, they are required to work "special" hard, strengthen management, and ensure that the factory is put into production on schedule; because key projects have the most Soviet experts to help and guide, they are required to make "special" efforts to learn and learn the skills of building heavy industry better and faster; because it is a key project, the Party has sent the most outstanding cadres to this position, so they are required to set an example for the whole country in implementing the Party's policies, overcoming difficulties, cooperating and collaborating, and completing tasks.

    We hope that the staff of various key projects, especially the leading cadres, will examine themselves. If they have been covered with the kind of "self-proclaimed special" dust that is harmful to the country, it is best to clean it up quickly. At the same time, we hope that they will bravely take on these "special" requirements that are beneficial to the country.

    重点工程的“特殊性”
    王朴
    苏联帮助我国设计的重点工程，是我国第一个五年建设的中心。国家从各方面努力节约，集中大量的资金供给这些工程需要；党从各个岗位上抽调出最优秀的干部输送给这些工程；苏联人民和政府派遣了技术优良的专家来帮助建设这些工程；现有企业把这些工程的订货当作最紧急最重要的任务来完成；交通运输部门、贸易部门、文化教育部门以及一切有关的人们，无不竭尽自己的能力来支援这些工程。
    但是，有一些在重点工程中工作的人，却因此而“晕”了起来。他们觉得，既然自己所担负的工作是最重要的，那么，一切也都应该与众不同，处处都要显得像个“重点”的样子。于是，样样事情做起来都是“情况特殊”，大项开支不执行国家定额，小项开支不按照规定办事。事事要人服从我，“支援”我，我就可以丝毫不顾及别人和国家有什么困难。而且要起东西来急如星火，没有商量的余地。否则，“耽误了重点工程，你担待不起。”
    第一汽车制造厂就多少有点这种派头。去年年初编制计划的时候，他们强调自己的“情况特殊”，说东北地区的定额对他们不适用，国家规定每人每年平均旧币一千二百四十万元筹建费，他们偏要旧币二千一百六十万元。修建宿舍，有现成的标准设计不用，一定自己单独设计，每平方公尺多花了旧币十万元以上。因为不按照国家规定的定额资料编计划，使计划中所列的建筑费用偏高，仅厂房的建筑造价就多报了旧币一千四百六十亿元。现在，第一汽车制造厂这种骄傲自大、自命特殊的现象虽然已克服了许多。但可惜的是，有一些单位还在学习第一汽车制造厂的样子，以他们的缺点和错误作为自己的“标准”和基本建设的“经验”。例如拖拉机厂和滚珠轴承厂的干部向上级说：“第一汽车制造厂怎么办，我们也怎么办。”这两个厂和矿山机械厂都要自己单独建设一个招待所。拖拉机厂认为自己是大厂，其他厂应该服从它；上级让他们和滚珠轴承厂合建一个招待所，他们坚持不同意。此外，哈尔滨量具刃具厂修造干部宿舍，每平方公尺花了旧币一百二十四万元，每户建筑面积占了九十一平方公尺，超过一般宿舍两倍。“你这样盖，我为什么不能这样盖？”哈尔滨锅炉厂不服气，也仿照量具刃具厂盖了同样的宿舍。
    这样的“特殊”，实在是有损于重点工程这个光荣的称号。重点工程是全国人民希望所寄托的地方，人民对于在重点工程中工作的人赋予了最大的信任。人民要求于重点工程的“特殊”是：因为重点工程投资最多，所以要求他们“特殊”地注意节约；因为重点工程技术最复杂，所以要求他们“特殊”地小心，保证工程达到头等的质量；因为重点工程完成得迟早直接影响工业化的速度，所以要求他们“特殊”地紧张工作，加强管理，保证工厂按期投入生产；因为重点工程有最多的苏联专家帮助指导，所以要求他们“特殊”地努力学习，更好更快地学会建设重工业的本领；因为是重点工程，党把最优秀的干部派到了这个岗位上，所以要求他们在执行党的政策上，在克服困难、配合协作、完成任务上，作全国的表率。
    我们希望各个重点工程的工作人员，特别是领导干部，检查一下自己。如果已经蒙上了那种有害于国家的“自命特殊”的灰尘，最好赶快把它清除干净。同时，希望他们把这些有利于国家的“特殊”要求勇敢地担当起来。
