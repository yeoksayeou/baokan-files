(Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 14) The land consolidation training class held by the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China in Harbin concluded on March 12. Of the more than 300 students, some will accompany Soviet experts to the State-owned Friendship Farm for field planning practice, and most will return to work in their respective provinces.

The land consolidation training class started on February 5 and lasted for just over a month. The Soviet experts of the land consolidation survey team headed by Maslov, who came to China to help build the State-owned Friendship Farm, took time out from their busy indoor land consolidation work for the State-owned Friendship Farm to give lectures to the land consolidation training class. In their lectures, they repeatedly emphasized that land consolidation work must be combined with the experience of the masses, must be beneficial to production, and must be carried out in accordance with the principle of saving money and achieving great results. Under the enthusiastic and patient guidance of the Soviet experts, the students have initially mastered a complete set of knowledge about land consolidation work. They systematically studied the scientific theories and advanced Soviet experience of inter-farm and intra-farm land consolidation, as well as soil, water conservancy, plants, and surveying. Nineteen students from Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangxi provinces said in a letter of thanks to the Soviet experts: "You have helped China establish a young science of land consolidation. Under your patient guidance, we have not only learned advanced scientific theories and rich experience, but also learned the noble ideological qualities and working style of the great Soviet people."

At the graduation ceremony of the land consolidation training class, Yu Jie, Deputy Governor of Heilongjiang Province, pointed out in his speech: It is the first time in the history of our country to systematically study scientific knowledge related to land consolidation. The Soviet experts headed by Maslov have comprehensively and systematically taught us the advanced Soviet knowledge and practical experience of land consolidation, which is of great significance to the future development of agricultural production in our country. He expressed his gratitude to the Soviet experts for their hard work. Soviet expert and leader of the land consolidation survey team, Maslov, said in his speech: It is difficult to teach everyone all the knowledge of land consolidation in a short period of time. We would be very happy if what we have taught can play a role in the actual work of surveying wasteland and establishing farms in China. I firmly believe that our common cause will be further developed and consolidated. Wang Fengzhai, director of the training class and deputy director of the Land Utilization Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of our country, hoped in his speech that after returning to their respective regions, the students could train more land consolidation workers and spread this science to the whole country. Nada, a student representative from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: Entrusted by all the students, I would like to pay high tribute to our teachers—the Soviet experts—who have worked tirelessly and enthusiastically taught us, and assure the Soviet experts and our Chinese leaders that we will never be arrogant or impatient in our future practical work, spread the scientific knowledge we have learned to others, and apply it well to our work, so as to develop the vast wasteland resources of our motherland.

    农业部培养了我国第一批土地整理工作者
    【新华社哈尔滨十四日电】中华人民共和国农业部在哈尔滨举办的土地整理讲习班，已经在三月十二日结业。三百多名学员中，一部分即将随同苏联专家到国营友谊农场进行田间规划的实习，大部分将返回各省工作。
    土地整理讲习班从二月五日开学，只经过了短短一个多月的时间。来我国帮助建设国营友谊农场以马斯洛夫为首的土地整理考察组苏联专家们，在为国营友谊农场进行繁忙的土地整理室内作业中，抽出时间来给土地整理讲习班讲课。他们在讲课中一再强调土地整理工作必须和群众经验相结合，必须对生产有利，本着花钱少、收效大的节约原则来进行。在苏联专家热情耐心教导下，学员们已初步掌握一套完整的有关土地整理工作的知识。他们系统地学习了场间、场内土地整理和土壤、水利、植物、测量等科学理论和苏联的先进经验。来自云南、四川、广西三省的十九名学员，在写给苏联专家的感谢信中说：“是你们帮助中国建立起年轻的土地整理科学。在你们耐心教导下，我们不仅学到先进的科学理论和丰富的经验，还学到了伟大的苏维埃人高贵的思想品质和工作作风。”
    在土地整理讲习班举行的结业典礼会上，黑龙江省副省长于杰讲话指出：系统地进行有关土地整理的科学知识学习，在我国历史上还是第一次。以马斯洛夫为首的苏联专家，把苏联先进的土地整理知识和实际经验全面地系统地教给我们，对我国今后农业生产的发展有着重大意义。他对苏联专家们的辛勤工作表示感谢。苏联专家、土地整理考察组组长马斯洛夫在讲话中说：在很短的时间内，想把土地整理的全部知识教给大家是很困难的。如我们所讲的东西能在中国勘测荒地和建立农场而进行土地整理的实际工作中能起到作用，我们将非常高兴。我深信我们的共同事业定能更进一步发展和巩固。讲习班主任、我国农业部土地利用总局副局长王凤斋在讲话中希望学员们回到各地后，能培养出更多的土地整理工作者，把这一门科学传播到全国去。学员代表、来自内蒙古自治区的学员那达那说：我受全体学员的委托，向不辞劳苦、热心教导我们的老师——苏联专家们致以崇高的敬意，向苏联专家和我国领导同志保证，我们今后在实际工作中一定不骄不躁，把学到的科学知识传播给他人，很好地运用到工作中去，以开发祖国的大片荒地富源。
