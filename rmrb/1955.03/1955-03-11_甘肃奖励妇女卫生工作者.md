    On March 7th, at a model award conference held by the Gansu Provincial Department of Health for directly affiliated units, eight model women healthcare workers were rewarded. Some of these female model workers work in ethnic minority agricultural and pastoral areas and remote regions. They often ride camels and donkeys, and even walk to climb mountains and cross rivers, through grasslands and the Gobi Desert. Wang Guanghua, a second-class model of the fourth team of the Gansu Provincial Maternal and Child Health Team, discovered while working in the Fourth District of Liangdang County last year that the farmers' stoves there had no chimneys, and many people suffered from angular conjunctivitis and many people suffered from gastrointestinal diseases. She went deep into the farmers' homes and guided them to build 324 chimneys, improve 15 wells, and build 69 new toilets, etc., and was praised by Liangdang County and Tianshui Prefecture. Yu Pinghua, a third-class female model worker, once saved the lives of three women in labor. Among them, the parturient Guo Yanfang suddenly convulsed seven days after giving birth, stopping breathing for two minutes with each convulsion. With Yu Pinghua's active rescue, the life of this parturient was finally saved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    甘肃奖励妇女卫生工作者
    三月七日，在甘肃省卫生厅召开的直属单位奖励模范大会上，八个模范妇女卫生工作者受到了奖励。这些女模范工作者，有些在少数民族的农、牧区和边远地区工作。她们经常骑骆驼和毛驴，甚至徒步爬山涉水，穿过草滩和戈壁滩。甘肃省妇幼卫生队第四队二等模范王光华去年在两当县四区工作时，发现当地农民家里炉灶没有烟囱，很多人都患烂眼角病，患肠胃病的人也很多。她就深入到农民家里，指导农民修造了三百二十四个烟囱，改良了十五个水井，新修了六十九所厕所等，受到两当县和天水专区的表扬。三等女模范工作者于萍华，曾抢救了三个产妇的生命，其中产妇郭艳芳产后七天突然抽搐，每抽搐一次停止呼吸两分钟，在于萍华的积极抢救下，终于挽救了这个产妇的生命。    （新华社）
