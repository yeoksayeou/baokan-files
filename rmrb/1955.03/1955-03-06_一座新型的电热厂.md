    A New Type of Electric Heating Plant
    Gao Changrui, Chief Engineer of Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant

    A new type of electric heating plant has been erected. In the winter before last, this was still a vast plain at the foot of the Lüliang Mountains; today, seven magnificent and beautiful buildings, with beautiful aerial trestles and corridors, have appeared before our eyes like a myth. The main plant building has the dazzling white numbers "1954" embedded on the side of its roof. When the light smoke from the boiler room floats across these four large characters, it heralds that a large amount of electrical and thermal energy will be continuously transmitted from this new power base.

    This electric heating plant was built with the help of the Soviet Union. Our great ally, the Soviet Union, not only supplied us with a complete set of first-class technical equipment, but also sent many experts to the site to conduct surveying, design, and guide our installation, and taught us how to adjust operations until we could fully master these advanced equipment.

    The first characteristic of this electric heating plant is its high degree of mechanization, which minimizes physical labor. In old power plants designed by the British and Americans, most of the work of coal transportation, unloading, crushing, and feeding coal involved heavy and tiring physical labor; here, trains drive directly into the 100-meter-long coal transportation building, and the coal unloading trench, which can hold more than a thousand tons of coal, is directly installed in the basement under the railway tracks. At the push of a button, a rotating wheel with crab-claw-like iron teeth immediately pushes the coal onto the coal conveyor belt, which, after three turns and climbing two buildings, directly stores it in the 30-meter-high raw coal hopper. Along the belt, equipped with automatic recording scales, automatic iron suction machines, automatic wood chip separators, automatic coal winnowing, screening machines, and automatic coal crushers, the coal conveying work is systematically completed without any manual labor. In ordinary power plants, ash removal after combustion is very arduous; not only can the removed ash burn the skin, but fly ash can also seep into the nose and mouth, turning the saliva of ash removal workers black for two or three days after work. Here, two ash flushing pumps and two jet pumps completely replace this arduous labor. The ash flushing pump can crush the ash and slag and spray it out to the ash flushing pool six or seven miles away with water pressure. Numerous handwheels in the power station are automatic; an unfamiliar visitor is often surprised when he sees the wheels beside him or at his feet suddenly turning automatically. Some of these handwheels are taller than a person and are operated remotely by operators sitting dozens of meters away by pressing buttons. In general, all kinds of natural forces replace people's labor, such as electricity, mechanical force, thermal power, and compressed air. The soft chemical tanks in the chemical sub-plant, four or five people tall, are larger in volume than a house, but a young female operator can easily fill the tank with chemicals by turning the air valve and using the blowing force of high-speed air.

    The second characteristic of this new type of electric heating plant is its high degree of automation. The entire combustion system is automatically adjusted, and it can rationally allocate the load between each boiler according to pre-determined values ​​through automatic mechanisms, and automatically adjust wind pressure, water pressure, air pressure, air volume, steam volume, pulverized coal volume, and changes in various temperatures. When the power plant outputs energy, the load of electricity and heat is also automatically adjusted. The main responsibility of the shift workers is to regularly check and maintain these automatic mechanisms. The heat engine room will be staffed by technical workers and technicians wearing white work clothes as clean as nurses. The main control room here is the nerve center of the power station, and the working conditions of important equipment are centrally reflected in this area through automatic signals. If a fault occurs anywhere, the central signal panel will emit bell and horn sounds separately, and the red and green lights will flash momentarily to tell the duty personnel where the fault is. At the same time, the light indicator will also light up, reflecting words such as "working transformer grounded" and "fuse blown," indicating the nature of the fault.

    The horn and bell sounds can be canceled after attracting the attention of the duty personnel; the light indicator continues to glow, insisting that the fault be properly dealt with before it goes out automatically. In this way, the duty person sitting in the control room can understand the situation in every corner of the plant and deal with it accordingly. The entire plant is also equipped with a new type of automatic telephone switchboard, with an average of one telephone for every two people. The duty personnel also have an independent dispatch system telephone, so that the orders of the commanding personnel can be immediately transmitted to each work area. The entire plant also has an automatic master clock that controls the sub-clocks in each room, unifying the dispatch time of each sub-plant. The offices of production commanders are equipped with electric meters and frequency meters, which can grasp the main quality of the power plant products—voltage and frequency changes—every minute.

    The above-mentioned high degree of mechanization and automation ensures that the electric heating plant can achieve two main goals during operation: safe power generation and economical power generation. The electrical part is most prone to accidents in old power plants. Here, high-voltage conductors are completely isolated in the power distribution box; when exposure is required, the power is immediately cut off, absolutely guaranteeing personal safety. The oil switches and gate knives throughout the plant are equipped with new type electric lock devices, ensuring accurate operation. When workers accidentally pull the wrong switch sequence due to occasional negligence, the electric lock will prevent the gate knife or switch from moving, using mechanical force to correct human errors. The plant's own power supply system has segmentation equipment; when a fault occurs in one section of the power supply, the automatic device immediately closes the other section of the backup power supply. The time is very short, only making people feel a flash of light, and the motors and machines in the plant can continue to operate. When the power supply is very insufficient, the plant's own power equipment will automatically select and automatically stop the secondary equipment that can be used intermittently, such as coal conveying and grinding, so that the main machine will not stop operating for even a second. This action is automatically operated according to a pre-arranged schedule, avoiding mistakes due to rush operations by the operating personnel. In addition, the temperature gauges, pressure gauges, flow meters, etc. on important machines have maximum or minimum limit protection devices, which will issue an alarm when the limit is exceeded, and can automatically trip in critical situations, avoiding serious damage to the equipment.

    The electric heating plant's equipment gives very careful consideration to economical power generation. Cogeneration can use the waste steam and waste heat after power generation to meet the needs of production, which is the most economical way to produce electricity. The rivers or pools next to many power plants are constantly emitting hot steam day and night, indicating that a lot of heat is being wasted. In the electric heating plant, most of the waste heat is used. The steam turbine, which is the heart of the power station, has two cylinders connected in series and two-stage heat supply and extraction equipment. The high-pressure and low-pressure steam inlet valves, as well as the rotatable partitions at the turbine outlet, can automatically switch and adjust to adapt to changes in the supply of electrical energy and high and low-pressure thermal energy. This complex and sophisticated adjustment mechanism ensures the improvement of the overall thermal efficiency. Even in small places that are generally easily overlooked, the principle of economy is implemented. Condensate (distilled water condensed from steam) is protected like fresh blood. Sewage and used waste steam are continuously treated and used, and used as heating power as much as possible. Very careful attention is paid to insulation engineering; the insulation layer of steam pipes is more than six inches thick, keeping the engine room cool and greatly reducing the loss of radiant heat. These measures accumulate effective thermal energy little by little, reduce coal consumption, and can accumulate a lot of funds for the country in the long run.

    In order to improve the level of safety and economic efficiency to a higher level during operation, the third characteristic of the electric heating plant is also reflected in the close combination of technology and science. Through scientific analysis and supervision, the quality and efficiency of electric and thermal energy supply are continuously improved. Water is the only working medium in a cogeneration plant. Therefore, the Soviet Union has specially equipped us with a large-scale water quality treatment room. In order to soften boiler water, salt and other chemical agents are used for exchange treatment. Electricity and heat are the finished products of the cogeneration plant. Therefore, the Soviet Union has also equipped us with complete electrical and thermal engineering laboratories and many highly accurate instruments. For example, the oscilloscope in the electrical aspect can simultaneously photograph the voltage, current, and their interrelationships in eight different locations. Alternating current has fifty cycles of change per second, and the oscilloscope can photograph this change like an X-ray, providing operating personnel with a basis for operation and supervision. The automatic recording instrument for thermal engineering tests also has a sophisticated mechanical structure. Among them, the temperature recorder can measure the temperature of six or seven different locations inside the machine every twenty-five seconds in turn, and then print these temperature data on time in different colors such as red, green, yellow, and purple, providing the most reliable analysis and statistical data for the research work on the economic operation of the entire power station.

    In the electric heating plant, another characteristic that should be mentioned is that Soviet experts also provided advanced designs and equipment of socialist society for the living and working environment of our country's workers. The room temperature in the workshop is adjusted with warm water, and places that need fresh air are specially equipped with hot air ventilation equipment, making the room like spring all year round, and workers can easily keep a clear head. The office building is also equipped with showers and dressing rooms for female workers, allowing workers to take a shower after get off work, put on makeup, and go home easily and happily. Around the buildings, the green area is more than one hectare, which is of great benefit to the health of the workers.

    People working in such a power plant feel infinite glory and excitement. We personally accepted the latest Soviet equipment, many of which are marked with the words "Produced in 1953." We personally operate advanced Soviet machinery, many of which are inventions and creations that have won the Stalin Prize by the Soviet people. We have personally seen the selfless labor of Soviet experts and understood the experts' diligence and untiring enthusiasm to teach us the techniques at hand. All of this has converged into the same voice from the heart of the electric heating plant workers: Thank you for the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union! All of this has also established a common belief among the electric heating plant workers: We must overcome shortcomings, learn from the Soviet Union, and conscientiously manage this new type of factory. Only in this way can we live up to the Soviet elder brother's exquisite technical assistance and live up to the Soviet government and all the people's eager expectation for the high development of our industry.

    一座新型的电热厂
    太原电热厂总工程师　高昌瑞
    一座新型的电热厂矗立起来了。前年冬，这儿还是吕梁山麓下一片广阔的平原；今天，七座雄伟秀丽的建筑物带着美丽的悬空栈桥和飞廊，已经像神话似地出现在我们眼前。主厂房顶侧嵌着“1954”四个耀眼的白色大字。当锅炉房上的轻烟斜飘过这四个大字时，预示着大量的电能和热能，将陆续从这个新的动力基地输送出去。
    这个电热厂是苏联帮助我国建设的。伟大的友邦苏联不仅供应了我们整套的头等的技术设备，而且派遣了不少专家先后来到现场进行勘测、设计、指导我们安装，并教会我们调整运转，直到我们能完全掌握这些先进设备为止。
    这个电热厂的第一个特点是高度机械化，使体力劳动减轻到最低限度。在英美设计的旧电厂中，输煤、卸煤、砸煤、上煤等工作大部分都使用着笨重劳累的体力劳动；在这儿，火车直接开进长达一百多公尺的输煤大厦，可容纳千吨以上燃煤的卸煤沟就直接装置在铁路路轨下面的地下室里，一按电扭，装有蟹爪式铁牙的转轮立即将燃煤拨上输煤皮带，经过三个转弯，爬上两座大楼，直接贮进高达三十公尺的原煤斗中。沿着皮带，装备有自动记录磅秤、自动吸铁机、自动木屑分离器、自动簸煤、筛煤机和自动碎煤机，有系统地完成了输煤工作，不需要任何人力。普通电厂燃烧完毕后的除灰工作是很艰苦的，不仅除出的灰渣会烤伤皮肤，飞灰也会渗进口鼻中，使除灰工人在工作后两三天内唾沫都是黑的。这儿两个冲灰泵和两个喷射泵就全部代替了这一艰苦的劳动。冲灰泵可以将灰渣挤碎并以极高压力（这压力能把水打上一百三十层高的大楼）的水力将灰喷出六、七里以外的冲灰池内。电站内无数的手轮都是自动操作的，一个陌生的参观者往往会大吃一惊，当他看到身边的或脚旁的轮子会忽然自动地克嚓克嚓转动起来。这一些手轮有的比
  一个人还高，都由操作人员坐在数十公尺以外拨动按钮进行远方操作。总的说来，代替人们劳动的有各种各样的自然力量，如像电力、机械力、热力等，此外还有压缩空气的风力。化学分场四、五人高的软化大罐容积比房子还大，但一个青年女值班工一扭风门就可利用高速空气的吹引力很轻便地将化学品装满罐内。
    这个新型电热厂的第二个特点是高度自动化。整个燃烧系统是自动调整的，能够根据预先规定的数值，通过自动机构来合理分配各锅炉间的负荷，并自动调整风压、水压、气压、空气量、蒸气量、煤粉量和各种温度的变化。电厂输出能量时，电力和热力的负荷也是自动调整的。值班工人主要的责任是经常检查和维护这些自动机构。在热机房工作的将是穿着白工作服和护士一样清洁的技术工人和技术人员。这里的主控制室是电站的神经中枢，重要设备的工作情况都通过自动信号集中反映到这一地区。任何一处发生故障，中央信号盘就会分别发出铃声和喇叭声，红绿灯变为一霎一霎的闪光告诉值班人员故障在那儿，同时灯光指示器也放光了，映出“工作变压器接地”“保险熔断”等等字样，说明故障性质。
    喇叭和铃响在引起值班人员注意后可以加以解除；灯光指示器则继续发光，坚持到故障被正确处理后才会自行熄灭。这样，值班人安坐在控制室内，就能了解全厂各个角落的情况加以处理。全厂还装有新型的自动电话总机，平均每两个人就使用一部电话机。值班人员另外还有独立的调度系统电话，使指挥人员的命令能立即传达到各工作地区。全厂还有自动母钟控制着每一房间的子钟，统一各分场的调度时间。生产指挥者的办公室内装有电表和周波表，每一分钟都能掌握电厂产品的主要质量——电压和周波的变化。
    上述这些高度机械化和自动化的配备，保证了电热厂在回转时能够达到两个主要目的：安全发电和经济发电。旧电厂中最容易引起事故的是电气部分。这里高压导电体完全隔绝在输配电箱内，需要外露时，电源立即切断，绝对保证了人身安全。全厂的油开关和闸刀都有新型的电锁装置，保证了操作准确，当工人由于偶然疏忽拉错开关次序时，电锁就会使闸刀或开关不能动作，用机械的力量来校正人的错误。厂用电系统有分段设备，当一段电源发生故障时，自动装置就立即将另一段备用电源合上，时间非常迅速，只使人觉得灯光一闪而已，厂内的马达和机器仍能继续运转。当电源非常不足时，厂用电设备还会自动选择，将次要的可以断续用电的设备，如像输煤磨煤等机械自动停下，让主要的机器一秒钟都不停止运转。这种动作都是按照预先安排好的时间表自动进行操作，避免了运行人员忙中有错。此外，重要机器上的温度表、压力表、流量表等都有最大或最小的限额定值保护装置，超过限额时就会发出警报，在情况危急时，就能自动跳闸，避免了设备严重损坏的事故。
    电热厂设备对经济发电的考虑更是非常周到的。热电工程能够利用发电以后的余汽和余热来供给生产上的需要，本身就是最经济的电能生产方式。很多电厂旁边的河流或水池子里日夜不断地冒着热蒸汽，说明不少热量被浪费了。而在电热厂里，大部分的余热都被利用着。作为电站心脏的汽轮机，有串联着的两个汽缸，和两级供热抽汽设备。高压和低压的进汽门，以及汽机出口处的可转隔板，都能适应电能和高低压热能供应的变化而自动开关调整。这样复杂精致的调整机构，保证了热电总效率的提高。在细小的，一般容易被忽略的地方，也都贯彻着节约的原则。复水（蒸汽凝结成的蒸馏水）像鲜血一样地被保护着。污水和用过的余汽，都继续处理使用，并尽可能作为加热的动力。对保温工程更是非常注意，蒸汽管子保温层厚达六英吋以上，保持了机房的凉爽，大大减少了幅射热的损失。这些措施一点一滴地积聚了有效的热能，减低煤耗，在长期运行中，就能为国家积累大量的资金。
    为了在运行中将安全程度和经济效果提到更高的水平，电热厂的第三个特点还表现在技术和科学的密切结合上。通过科学的分析监督，不断提高电热能供应的品质和效率。水是热电站的唯一工作介质，因此，苏联特别为我们配备了一所规模宏大的水质处理室。为了软化锅炉用水，要用食盐和其他化学剂来进行交换处理。电和热是热电站的成品，因此，苏联还为我们配备了完备的电气和热工的试验室和许多高度精确的仪器。例如电气方面的示波器，可以同时为八个不同地点的电压、电流、以及它们的相互关系拍照。交流电每一秒钟内有五十次周而复始的变化，示波器就能将这种变化像拍X光一样地照成照片，提供给运行人员作为操作和监督的依据。热工试验用的自动记录仪表，也有精致的机械结构。其中的温度记录表每隔二十五秒，就能把机器内部六七处不同地点的温度轮流测量一次，再用红绿黄紫等不同的颜色，将这些温度数据按时打印下来，为整个电站经济运行的研究工作提供了最可靠的分析和统计资料。
    在电热厂里，还应该提到的一个特点是苏联专家在对我国工人的生活和工作环境上，也提供了社会主义社会的先进设计和设备。工作车间的室温用暖水来调节，需要新鲜空气的地方，还特别装用热风通气设备，使室内四季如春，工作人员容易保持清醒的头脑。办公楼里还设有淋浴室和女工化装室，使工人们下班以后，洗个澡，化装后轻松愉快地回家。在建筑物周围，绿化区有一顷多，这对工人的健康有很大好处。
    工作在这样一个电厂中的人们，都感到无限的光荣和兴奋。我们亲手接受了苏联最新型的设备，其中不少还打着一九五三年出品的字样。我们亲身操作着苏联先进的机械，其中不少是苏联人民荣获斯大林奖金的发明创造。我们亲眼看到苏联专家的忘我劳动，领会到专家勤勤恳恳、日夜不倦地把着手教会我们技术的高度热忱。这一切，汇集成电热厂工作者发自内心的同一呼声：感谢苏联伟大和无私的援助！这一切，也使电热厂工作者树立了一个共同的信念：一定要克服缺点、学习苏联，兢兢业业地管理好这座新型工厂。这样才不负苏联老大哥对我们技术精湛的援助，才不负苏联政府和全体人民对我们工业高度发展的殷切期望。
