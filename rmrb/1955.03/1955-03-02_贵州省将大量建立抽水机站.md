Guizhou Province plans to build fifty-five pumping stations this year. According to the production season and progress of surveying and other work, the plan is to build them in four batches by quarter. In the first quarter—before spring plowing—twenty stations are planned to be built in the four special districts of Zunyi, Guiding, Duyun, and Xingyi, with Zunyi and Xingyi special districts as the key areas for station construction. At present, except for the station site in Guiding Special District which has not been re-surveyed, the station sites in Zunyi, Xingyi, and Duyun Special Districts have all undergone re-surveying and measurement work. According to preliminary statistics from design data: After the first batch of twenty pumping stations is built, it can guarantee the spring plowing water for more than 12,700 mu of dry land. The surveying, design, and other technical and material preparations for the pumping stations planned to be built in the second quarter are also actively underway.

The majority of the fifty-five pumping stations planned to be built this year are in low-water, high-field areas that are susceptible to drought. The lifting height of general pumping stations is five to fifteen meters, and the highest reaches eighteen to twenty-five meters. After all these pumping stations are completed, they can irrigate a total of more than 48,500 mu of dry land.

    贵州省将大量建立抽水机站
    贵州省今年计划建立抽水机站五十五个。根据生产季节和勘测等工作的进行情况，计划分季度作四批建立。第一季度——春耕以前，计划在遵义、贵定、都匀、兴义等四个专区建立二十个站，以遵义、兴义两专区为建站重点。现在，除贵定专区站址尚未复勘外，遵义、兴义、都匀等专区，均已进行了站址的复勘、测量工作。据设计资料初步统计：第一批二十个抽水机站建立后，可保证一万二千七百多亩旱田的春耕用水。计划在第二季度建立的抽水机站，现也正在积极进行站址的勘测、设计和其他技术、物资上的准备工作。
    今年计划建立的五十五个抽水机站，绝大部分都是在易受干旱威胁的低水、高田地区。一般抽水机站的提水高度是五至十五公尺，最高的达十八至二十五公尺。这些抽水机站全部建成后，共可灌溉四万八千五百多亩旱田。
