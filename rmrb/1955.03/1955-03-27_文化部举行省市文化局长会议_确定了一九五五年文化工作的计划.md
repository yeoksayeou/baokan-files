    The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China recently held a conference of provincial and municipal cultural bureau chiefs to review the cultural work of 1954 and discuss and determine the plan for cultural work in 1955.

    Based on the country's general task and the current situation of cultural work, the conference determined that the guiding principle and tasks for national cultural work in 1955 are: to actively carry out the struggle against bourgeois erroneous ideologies on the cultural front, to rectify the ranks of cultural workers in a step-by-step manner, to strengthen the study of political and artistic theory, to improve the ideological and artistic levels of cultural workers, to further develop creative work, to strengthen artistic practice, to go deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to vigorously implement the principles of overall planning and consideration, comprehensive arrangement, going deep into the inland, and streamlining and economizing, so that cultural work can better serve the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    The conference emphasized the importance of carrying out ideological struggle on the cultural front, believing that the cultural front is an important component of the ideological front, and that the people's cultural work during the transition period is essentially the work of using socialist ideology to defeat bourgeois ideology, and to educate the working people and the next generation with socialist ideology so that they become conscious and active builders of socialist society. Therefore, in the cultural field, publicizing materialist ideology, criticizing bourgeois idealist ideology, and criticizing various forms of bourgeois erroneous ideologies with the idealist world outlook as the core, is the primary task of all cultural workers. All localities and cultural departments must vigorously continue the criticism of the Hu Shi and Hu Feng factions of bourgeois idealism, and gradually develop and deepen it in combination with the actual conditions of each locality and department. At the same time, in the examination and criticism in connection with practice, gradually and deeply study the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism—dialectical materialism and historical materialism. The conference also pointed out that the ranks of cultural workers should continue to be rectified on the basis of gradually improving their ideological level.

    The conference emphasized that cultural work must further penetrate the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and adhere to the direction of serving them. Only in this way can the development of creative work and artistic practice have a clear direction and goal, and an infinitely rich source. To this end, we must pay attention to overcoming the idea of ​​unwillingness to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the idea of ​​despising popularization work and popular work, and criticize the idea of ​​opposing popularization and improvement; all types of performance groups should perform for workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres in a planned way, strengthen the distribution and screening of films in industrial and mining areas and rural areas, strengthen the publication of popular books and periodicals and the distribution and circulation of books in industrial, mining, and rural areas, further enrich the activities of cultural centers and stations, strengthen the guidance of clubs in industrial, mining, and rural areas, and strive to carry out mass amateur art activities.

    The conference emphasized that cultural administrative departments at all levels should implement overall planning and comprehensive arrangements for various public and private cultural undertakings and cultural enterprises, strengthen leadership and management of private cultural enterprises, and carry out further utilization and transformation industry by industry, so that all state-owned, joint state-private, cooperative and private cultural undertakings and cultural enterprises can be gradually incorporated into the national plan, fully utilized and developed, and prevent blind development and excessive concentration.

    The conference pointed out that the key to implementing the guiding principles and tasks of cultural work in 1955 lies in improving the leadership of cultural administrative departments. The conference pointed out that the national cultural work in 1954 had great achievements, but there were varying degrees of non-political tendencies, detachment from the masses, and detachment from reality in all aspects of cultural work, and the current cultural work is far from meeting the needs of the country's socialist construction and the growing cultural needs of the people. To this end, cultural administrative departments at all levels must earnestly overcome the errors of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and decentralism, resolutely rely on and obey the leadership of the party and government leading organs, improve collective leadership, strengthen political and ideological leadership, vigorously promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, pay attention to investigation and research, pay attention to specific guidance and inspection of work, and closely link with the masses of the people. Cultural administrative organs and cultural institutions at all levels must strictly implement streamlining and improve work efficiency.

    During the conference, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions invited the directors of the cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities to hold a discussion, exchanging views on the issues of close contact between local cultural administrative departments and local literary federations and trade unions, further promoting creative work, and developing cultural work in industrial and mining areas.

    文化部举行省市文化局长会议
    确定了一九五五年文化工作的计划
    中华人民共和国文化部最近举行了省市文化局长会议，检查一九五四年的文化工作，讨论和确定了一九五五年文化工作的计划。
    会议根据国家的总任务和当前文化工作的情况，确定一九五五年全国文化工作的方针任务是：积极地开展文化战线上的反对资产阶级错误思想的斗争，有步骤地整顿文化工作者的队伍，加强政治理论和艺术理论的学习，提高文化工作者的思想水平和艺术水平，进一步发展创作，加强艺术实践，深入工农兵群众，并大力贯彻统筹兼顾、全面安排、深入内地和精简节约的方针，使文化工作更好地为国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造服务。
    会议强调了在文化战线上开展思想斗争的重要性。认为文化战线是思想战线的一个重要组成部分，而过渡时期的人民文化工作实质上就是用社会主义思想战胜资产阶级思想的工作，就是用社会主义思想教育劳动人民和后一代，使他们成为社会主义社会自觉的积极的建设者的工作。因此，在文化领域内，宣传唯物主义思想，批判资产阶级唯心主义思想，批判以唯心主义世界观为核心的各种形式的资产阶级错误思想，是一切文化工作者的首要任务。各地和各个文化部门必须大力继续开展对胡适派、胡风派资产阶级唯心主义的批判，并结合各地的和各部门的实际，逐步发展和深入。同时在联系实践的检查和批判中，逐步深入地学习马克思列宁主义的理论基础——辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。会议又指出，文化工作者的队伍应在逐步提高思想水平的基础上继续进行整顿。
    会议强调文化工作必须进一步深入工农兵群众，坚持为工农兵服务的方向。只有这样，发展创作和艺术实践才有明确的方向和目标，才有无限丰富的源泉。为此，必须注意克服不愿为工农兵服务、轻视普及工作和通俗工作的思想，批判将普及与提高对立起来的思想；各类演出团体都应有计划地为工农兵及其干部演出，加强对工矿和农村的电影发行和放映工作，加强通俗书刊的出版和对工矿农村的图书发行和流通工作，进一步充实文化馆、站的活动，加强对工矿农村俱乐部的辅导，努力开展群众业余艺术活动。
    会议强调各级文化行政部门应对各项公私文化事业和文化企业，实行统筹兼顾，全面安排，并对私营文化企业加强领导和管理，逐行逐业进行进一步的利用和改造，使一切国营、公私合营、合作社性质的和私营的文化事业和文化企业逐步纳入国家计划，充分地加以利用和发挥，并防止盲目发展和过分集中。
    会议指出，要贯彻一九五五年文化工作的方针任务，关键在于改进文化行政部门的领导。会议指出一九五四年全国文化工作是有很大成绩的，但各个文化工作环节上存在着不同程度的非政治倾向、脱离群众、脱离实际的缺点，当前的文化工作还远不能满足国家的社会主义建设的需要和人民群众日益增长的文化生活的需要。为此，各级文化行政部门必须认真克服主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义的错误，坚决依靠和服从党政领导机关的领导，健全集体领导，加强政治思想领导，大力发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，重视调查研究，注意具体指导和检查工作，密切与人民群众的联系。各级文化行政机关和文化事业机构必须厉行精简，提高工作效率。
    会议进行期间，曾由中国文学艺术界联合会和全国总工会邀请到会的各省市文化局长举行了座谈，对密切地方文化行政部门与各地文联和工会联系，进一步繁荣创作，发展工矿文化工作的问题交换了意见。                      （新华社）
