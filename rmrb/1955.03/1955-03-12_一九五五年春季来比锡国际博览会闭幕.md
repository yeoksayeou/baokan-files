    一九五五年春季来比锡国际博览会闭幕
    【新华社柏林十日电】二月二十六日开幕的一九五五年春季来比锡国际博览会已在九日闭幕。展览期间观众共达五十六万人，其中有一万八千多人来自西德和西柏林，有九千九百多人来自世界上五十四个国家。西德厂商参加展览的有一千六百六十二家，从三十六个国家来的一千零九十六个机构也参加了展览。
    在博览会期间，民主德国达成对外和对西德的贸易额为十三亿八千二百万卢布，其中出口为九亿六千五百万卢布，进口为四亿一千七百万卢布。民主德国和社会主义阵营国家签订了五亿六千五百万卢布以上的出口合同。民主德国和西方各国的出口合同达三亿一百万卢布。
    民主德国对外与国内贸易部在十日发表的公报中指出：“来比锡博览会的巨大成就又一次证明了博览会是经济上和政治上具有头等意义的事件。来比锡作为国际博览会的一个中心，通过各国人民间和平贸易关系的开展，对于缓和国际紧张局势是有贡献的。作为一个唯一的全德博览会来说，它也有助于德国人民间的谅解。”
