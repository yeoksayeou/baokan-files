Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech to the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and all the monks and laypersons from Tibet in Beijing:

Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and their entourages have completed their work in Beijing and will be leaving for Tibet in a few days after visiting some places. We warmly congratulate them on the achievements they have made in their work in Beijing and their visits to various places, and wish them a safe journey and good health!

The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni came to Beijing together this time, met Chairman Mao, attended the First Session of the First National People's Congress and the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, studied the issue of establishing a unified preparatory committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, including the Tibet Local Government, the Panchen Kampus Ladrang Committee, and the Qamdo (Changdu) Area People's Liberation Committee. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni also went to various places to visit and saw the construction of the motherland in various fields. Recently, they also participated in the plenary meeting of the State Council to discuss work in Tibet. Based on the reports and opinions of Zhang Jingwu, the representative of the Central People's Government, and the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and their accompanying officials, the State Council passed resolutions on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, on assisting the Tibet Local Government in construction matters, and on transportation issues in Tibet. The State Council is satisfied with the agreement reached between the Tibet Local Government and the Panchen Kampus Ladrang Committee regarding historical issues and outstanding cases after consultations between the two parties. All of this shows that the relationship between Tibet and the whole country in the big family of the motherland is closer, the patriotic spirit of the Tibetan people has increased, and the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and the internal unity of Tibet have been strengthened day by day.

The close unity of all ethnic groups in our country and within Tibet is possible and constantly strengthened because the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and seized national power. The basis of this unity is national equality, and the purpose of unity is to oppose the common enemy—imperialist aggression—and build our motherland—a free and equal national family. This is an anti-imperialist and patriotic unity. Without this unity, the forward development of construction is impossible.

In the four years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, thanks to the united cooperation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the personnel led by them, the active efforts of all the Tibetan people, and the arduous struggle of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the working personnel, Tibet's work has made achievements in many aspects, laying the foundation for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region in the future. This is something we should all celebrate. However, we have done very little to help the Tibetan people and must pay attention to it in future work. We should all work hard to further strengthen and consolidate the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, further strengthen and consolidate the internal unity of Tibet, and strive for the steady and step-by-step establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region and the construction of a new Tibet.

I wish the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni good health!
I wish all the monks and laypersons from Tibet in Beijing good health!
Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country!
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in our country!

    周恩来总理的讲话达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼、西藏全体来京的僧俗人员：
    达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和他们的随行人员已经完成了在京的工作，日内就要离开北京了。他们在参观某些地方之后，就要回到西藏去。我们热烈地祝贺他们在京工作和在各地参观中所取得的成就，并祝他们一路平安、身体健康！
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼这次一同来到北京，见到了毛主席，出席了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，并根据毛主席的指示，研究了成立包括西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会和昌都地区人民解放委员会的统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会问题。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼还一道到各地去参观，看到了祖国各方面的建设情况。最近期间，他们又参加了国务院讨论西藏工作的全体会议。国务院根据中央人民政府代表张经武和达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼及其随行官员的报告和意见，通过了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会、关于帮助西藏地方政府进行建设事项、关于西藏交通运输问题等决定。国务院对西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会之间关于历史和悬案问题经双方协商达成的协议感到满意。所有这一切，表明西藏地方在祖国的大家庭中，同全国各地的关系是更加密切了，西藏人民的爱国主义精神更为增涨了，汉族同藏族的团结和西藏内部的团结日益加强了。
    我国各民族和西藏内部的亲密团结，所以成为可能，并且不断地得到加强，是由于中国人民在中国共产党领导下推翻了国民党反动统治，掌握了全国政权。这个团结的基础是民族平等，团结的目的是反对共同的敌人——帝国主义的侵略，和建设我们的祖国——自由平等的民族大家庭。这是反帝爱国的团结，没有这种团结，建设事业的向前发展是不可能的。
    西藏和平解放四年来，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和他们所领导的两方面的人员的团结合作下，在全体西藏人民的积极努力下，在人民解放军进藏部队和工作人员的艰苦奋斗下，西藏的工作在许多方面已经取得了成绩，为今后建立西藏自治区筹备委员会打下了基础。这是值得我们大家庆贺的。但是我们对西藏人民的帮助，还做得很少，必须在今后工作中加以注意。我们大家应当努力，更进一步地加强和巩固汉藏民族的团结，更进一步地加强和巩固西藏内部的团结，为稳妥地、有步骤地建立西藏自治区、建设新西藏而奋斗。
    祝达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的健康！
    祝西藏全体在京的僧俗人员的健康！
    我国各民族大团结万岁！
    我国各民族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
