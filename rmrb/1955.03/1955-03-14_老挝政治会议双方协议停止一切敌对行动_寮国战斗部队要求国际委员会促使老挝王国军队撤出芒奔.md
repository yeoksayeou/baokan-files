Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 13th: News from Laos says that the Lao political conference has reached an agreement on both sides ceasing all hostile actions.

	At the March 9th meeting, the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government, headed by Oun Heuan, and the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces, headed by Phoumi Vongvichit, issued a joint statement.

	The statement said: "In order to fulfill the Geneva armistice agreement, achieve the common goals of the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Forces, and satisfy the Lao people's desire for unity of purpose and the security of the motherland, the political conference held by the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces, during the period from January 21 to March 9, 1955, unanimously recognized the need for both sides to demonstrate their hope for consultation and cooperation through practical actions, first of all, to immediately terminate all hostilities between each other, in order to ease tensions and create favorable conditions for the political conference to resolve common fundamental political issues."

	The statement said: "For this purpose, the political delegation of the Royal Lao Government, on behalf of the Royal Lao Government, guarantees that no hostile actions—especially military offensives—against the Lao Fighting Forces will recur." The political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces, on behalf of the Lao Fighting Forces, also made the same guarantee.

	The statement pointed out: Both headquarters should instruct the officers and troops under their command to cease all hostile actions against the other party, especially military offensives.

	The statement also said: The conference firmly believes that this joint statement "will create favorable conditions for the establishment of a political consultative committee to resolve all common political issues."
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 13th: Lao news: The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces wrote to the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos on the 3rd, requesting measures to stop the Royal Lao Government's military offensive against Muong Phanh and to withdraw all Royal Government-commanded troops from the Muong Phanh area.

	The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces said in its letter that from December 31 of last year to January 2 of this year, the French and Lao Royal sides used armed forces to attack and occupy Muong Phanh in Sam Neua Province, which was under the jurisdiction of the Lao Fighting Forces. In order to avoid possible conflicts, the Lao Fighting Forces stationed in Muong Phanh temporarily withdrew from Muong Phanh. On February 1, these troops, commanded by French and Lao Royal officers, automatically withdrew from Muong Phanh under the protest of the people, and the Lao Fighting Forces, which originally administered Muong Phanh, returned to Muong Phanh. However, the Royal Lao Government falsely accused the Lao Fighting Forces of attacking the Royal Army, and on March 1, the Royal Army once again launched an offensive against the Lao Fighting Forces in Muong Phanh.

	The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces pointed out that this behavior of the Royal Lao Government is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords and is creating difficulties for the ongoing political conference.

	The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces requested the Lao International Commission to take effective measures to stop the Royal Lao Government's offensive against Muong Phanh and to withdraw all troops commanded by the Royal Government from the Muong Phanh area. The General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces requested the Lao International Commission to send a mobile team, assisted by liaison officers from the Lao Fighting Forces, to conduct an investigation in Muong Phanh; and demanded that those who created the Muong Phanh incident be severely punished and that the losses suffered by the people of Muong Phanh be compensated.

    在三月九日的会议上，以乌昏为首的老挝王国政府政治代表团同以富米为首的寮国战斗部队政治代表团发表了一项联合声明。
    声明说：“为了履行日内瓦停战协定，实现老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队的共同目标，满足老挝人民对双方齐心一致和祖国安全的愿望，老挝王国政府政治代表团和寮国战斗部队政治代表团举行的政治会议在一九五五年一月二十一日到三月九日的会议期间一致认识到双方有必要以实际行动来表明双方希望协商和合作，首先是立即终止相互之间的一切敌对行动，以求缓和紧张局势，为政治会议解决共同有关的基本政治问题创造有利条件。”
    声明说：“为了这个目的，老挝王国政府政治代表团代表老挝王国政府保证不许任何对寮国战斗部队的敌对行动——特别是军事进攻——重演。”寮国战斗部队政治代表团代表寮国战斗部队也作了相同的保证。
    声明指出：双方司令部都应当训令它们指挥下的军官和军队停止对他方的一切敌对行动，特别是军事进攻。
    声明并且说：会议坚定地相信，这个联合声明“将为建立政治协商委员会来解决一切共同有关的政治问题创造有利条件”。
      【新华社河内十三日电】老挝消息：寮国战斗部队总司令部在三日写信给老挝国际监督和监察委员会，要求采取措施，制止老挝王国政府对芒奔的军事进攻，并且从芒奔地区撤出一切王国政府指挥的军队。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部在信中说，从去年十二月三十一日到今年一月二日，法国和老挝王国方面使用武装力量进攻并且占领了在寮国战斗部队管辖下的桑怒省境内的芒奔。驻在芒奔的寮国战斗部队为了避免可能发生的冲突，临时撤出了芒奔。二月一日，这些由法国和老挝王国军官指挥的军队在人民的抗议下自动撤离芒奔，原来管理芒奔的寮国战斗部队于是又回到芒奔。但是老挝王国政府却诬蔑寮国战斗部队进攻王国军队，三月一日，王国军队又再次向芒奔的寮国战斗部队发动进攻。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部指出，老挝王国政府的这种行为是严重地违反日内瓦协定的，并且为正在举行的政治会议造成困难。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部在信中要求老挝国际委员会采取有效措施，制止老挝王国政府对芒奔的进攻，并且从芒奔地区撤出由王国政府指挥的一切军队。寮国战斗部队总司令部要求老挝国际委员会派遣机动小组，在寮国战斗部队联络官的协助下到芒奔进行调查；并且要求严惩那些制造芒奔事件的人员，赔偿芒奔人民所遭受的损失。
