    Reactions to "Let's Cherish Valuable Timber More"
    Timber Should Not Be Backlogged, Causing Losses to the Country
    After reading the article "Let's Cherish Valuable Timber More" published in the People's Daily on February 4th, I felt very angry. Our country is carrying out economic construction and needs a large amount of timber, but due to the lack of a strong sense of responsibility among the timber management staff in Inner Mongolia, the state suffered a loss of more than 110 billion old currency. I suggest that the relevant departments quickly dispose of this timber and not allow it to be backlogged any longer, so as to avoid causing even greater losses to the country. In the future, the timber management staff in Inner Mongolia must take their work seriously, cherish timber more, and supply the valuable timber to the national economic construction departments. Waste is not allowed to occur again.

    Suggestion for Further Investigation and Handling
    After reading the article "Let's Cherish Valuable Timber More" in the People's Daily on February 4th, I was shocked. Every one of the 660,000 cubic meters of timber was infested with insects, causing a great loss to the country! People across the country are working hard in their respective positions to actively carry out socialist construction. However, the responsible personnel of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Administration did not go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation, causing serious losses to the country. I hope that the competent authorities will further investigate and understand this matter, and give serious punishment to those who should be held responsible.

    对“多多爱惜宝贵的木材吧”一稿的反应
    不应积压木材，造成国家的损失
    我看到二月四日人民日报登载的“多多爱惜宝贵的木材吧”一稿后，感到很气愤。我国正在进行经济建设，需要大量木材，可是由于内蒙古管理木材工作人员的工作责任心不强，给国家造成旧币一千一百多亿元的损失。我建议有关部门，对这些木材赶快处理，不要再积压了，以免给国家造成更大的损失。内蒙古管理木材工作人员今后对自己的工作要切实负责，多多爱护木材，把宝贵的木材供应给国家经济建设部门，不允许再有浪费现象发生。

    建议进一步进行调查和处理
    二月四日人民日报“多多爱惜宝贵的木材吧”一稿，我读后大吃一惊，六十六万立方公尺的木材每一根都生了虫，给国家造成了多大的损失！全国人民都在不同岗位上努力工作，积极进行社会主义建设。可是内蒙古森林工业管理局的负责人员，却不深入下层，了解情况，给国家造成了严重损失。我希望主管部门对这件事作进一步的了解调查，对那些应当负责的人员，给以严肃的处理。
