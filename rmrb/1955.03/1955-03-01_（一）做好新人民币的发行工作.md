(I) Do a Good Job in Issuing the New Renminbi

After the order to issue the new Renminbi and withdraw the old Renminbi was announced, the broad masses of the people throughout the country expressed their warm support. The new Renminbi will be issued today, and people can see that our country's monetary system is further stabilized and sound.

People all over the country generally believe that the issuance of the new Renminbi is a manifestation of the further stabilization and soundness of China's monetary system, and that the new currency is "good-looking, easy to calculate, easy to use, and easy to keep accounts." Workers said: "The government's advance announcement of this measure shows the consolidation of our economic system." Workers and staff are engaging in production and other work with even greater enthusiasm. An elderly man in Beijing in his seventies said: "This time it completely eliminates the traces of inflation of the past ten years, and our lives have become much younger." People of ethnic minorities are even more excited that the new Renminbi is printed with four ethnic languages, believing that this is unprecedented in our country's history, and it embodies the equality and unity of all ethnic groups in our country. Industrialists and businessmen are also particularly satisfied that there is no discrimination in the exchange of new and old currencies, and they have made assurances of patriotism and law-abidingness. People everywhere are more actively participating in people's savings: in the four days from February 21st to 24th, savings deposits in seven major cities including Beijing and Tianjin increased by 100 billion yuan (old currency), many of which have terms of one year or more. These once again prove that the measures taken by the people's government are entirely in line with the vital interests of the people.

Since the issuance of the new Renminbi is a major economic and political measure, and the exchange work is a very complex and arduous task, and the announcement time was not long ago, the publicity work in some areas is not yet universal or in-depth, and the preparations are not adequate. Therefore, we must continue to work hard to carry out publicity and explanation work, strengthen market management, and prepare for the exchange of new and old Renminbi. These three aspects of work are closely related, and doing a good job in these three aspects is the key to ensuring the smooth completion of the issuance of new currency and the withdrawal of old currency.

Why is it so important to do a good job in publicity? Because the issuance of new currency and the withdrawal of old currency are related to the economic life of everyone, it is necessary to make everyone understand the significance of this measure. Especially some housewives and peasant masses, because they live scattered, and many are illiterate, it is impossible to quickly understand the significance and method of issuing new currency, so some people's understanding is still vague, and domestic and foreign enemies and bad elements who disregard the overall situation may take the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, which further increases the task of publicity work. We must educate the masses of people to truly understand the significance of issuing new currency, so as to consciously abide by and implement laws and decrees.

According to feedback from various places, what needs to be repeatedly publicized to the masses at present is the stability of our country's currency. Because every time the Kuomintang reactionary rule issued counterfeit currency, it devalued the banknotes and made them worthless, causing large fluctuations in prices, which left an extremely bad impression on the people. Some people are still worried about whether our prices can be stabilized. This concern is completely unnecessary. Because the political system and economic system of the Kuomintang reactionary rule cannot be compared with our political system and economic system at all. The Kuomintang reactionary government issued counterfeit currency on the basis of inflation and unstable prices, and its purpose was only to carry out more brutal plunder of the people. Our situation today is of course completely different from the past. For more than five years, although the prices of individual commodities in our country have risen slightly, the prices of most commodities have fallen, but on the whole they have been stable. For example, the retail prices of major daily necessities such as Zhongbai japonica rice, "Dragon Head" fine cloth, and "Unified" briquettes in the Shanghai market have not changed for nineteen to twenty-five months. Moreover, this state of price stability will definitely continue in the future. Because our country's prices are based on the state's strong material reserves and investment in the market at stable prices, and at the same time, we have established a strong socialist financial system, unified management of the financial industry, and the planned nature of currency circulation is increasing day by day. The state's holdings of gold and foreign exchange are also increasing day by day. Gold reserves alone increased more than tenfold in 1954 compared with 1950. Therefore, from all aspects, the Renminbi has a solid and stable foundation, which is beyond doubt. The people said: "Grain, cloth, and department stores are all controlled by the state. How can speculators make trouble!" This view is correct.

Then why is it stipulated that the old Renminbi be withdrawn within a time limit? This is because if the new and old currencies are allowed to circulate and use at the same time for a long time, it will not only be very inconvenient for calculation and payment, but also may cause confusion in currency circulation, which is not conducive to the economic life of the country and the people. Therefore, the State Council stipulates that old currencies of 10,000 and 50,000 yuan will only circulate until March 31, 1955, but they can still be exchanged for new currencies at the legal ratio from the People's Bank of China before April 30. Various old currencies of 5,000 yuan and below will have a longer period before the exchange stop date for the convenience of circulation. Therefore, people with not much old currency on hand can slowly use the old currency. These regulations once again show that the people's government is thinking of maintaining the people's interests and convenience in every way.

There is a ten-yuan bill in the new Renminbi that is not ready to be issued temporarily. Some people ask what the reason is. It should be pointed out that our country's economy is developing rapidly, and the amount of commodity circulation is also expanding. The issuance of ten-yuan bills is to adapt to this situation and is conducive to commodity circulation; however, in order to take care of the current circulation habits, it will not be issued temporarily.

Another key to doing a good job in issuing the new Renminbi is to strengthen market management and earnestly ensure the supply of materials. The most important work here is to ensure that what 10,000 yuan of old Renminbi could buy in the past, 1 yuan of new Renminbi can buy now. Therefore, the national market management department must strictly check and manage the pricing, transfers, and the ratio of new and old currencies in transactions of various industrial and commercial households, and resolutely ban and strictly prevent illegal acts such as price increases, private discounts, and deception of the masses by those illegal industrial and commercial operators. The state-owned stores in Guiyang City marked the prices of commodities in both new and old currencies, so that citizens could see that the prices had not changed at all. This should be promoted in state-owned, cooperative, joint state-private, and private enterprises across the country. The masses of the people should also carefully supervise the pricing of shops and stalls. Shops should pay special attention to the supply of goods purchased by the people, and should not have the idea of being conservative or reluctant to sell.

Another key to ensuring the smooth progress of the issuance of the new Renminbi is to make good preparations for the exchange and to make it convenient for the masses of the people everywhere. During the exchange period, the institutions of the People's Bank of China at all levels should, in addition to setting up a number of temporary exchange stations according to possible conditions, also entrust institutions to act as exchange agents, and notify the masses to carry out the exchange at that time. Employees of various agencies, factories, and people's organizations can organize collective exchanges as much as possible, and people from all walks of life can exchange on their own in accordance with the exchange period prescribed by the State Council. The two-month exchange period is not short, so there is no need to be crowded. Relevant business departments should repeatedly explain the above-mentioned issues to the masses of the people at any time.

The exchange of new and old Renminbi begins today. Since the issuance of new currency is unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, as long as we do a good job in publicity work under the leadership of the Party and government, state-owned enterprises and cooperatives can cooperate closely, and the staff of the National Bank can engage in exchange work with a good service spirit, we will definitely be able to do a good job in the important task of issuing new currency and withdrawing old currency.

### （一）做好新人民币的发行工作

    （一）做好新人民币的发行工作
    发行新的人民币和收回旧人民币的命令发布以后，全国广大人民莫不表示热烈拥护。新人民币今天就发行了，人们可以看到我国的货币制度进一步稳定和健全了。
    全国各地人民普遍认为发行新的人民币是我国货币制度进一步稳定和健全的表现，而且新币“好看、好算、好使用、好记账”。工人们说：“从政府提前公布这一措施，就可看出我国经济制度的巩固。”工人和职员正以更高的热情来从事生产和其他工作。北京市一个七十多岁的老人说：“这一次彻底扫除了十多年来通货膨胀的痕迹，我们的生活都年青了许多。”少数民族的人民对新的人民币上印有四种民族文字，更感到兴奋，认为这是我国历史上从来没有过的事，它体现了我们国家各民族的平等和团结。工商业者对于新旧币兑换时没有差别对待，也特别感到满意，他们纷纷提出爱国守法的保证。各地人民都更加踊跃地参加人民储蓄：北京、天津等七个大城市自二月二十一日至二十四日四天之内，储蓄存款就增加了一千亿元（旧币），其中很多存期都在一年以上。这些再一次证明了人民的政府采取的措施完全符合于人民的切身利益。
    由于发行新的人民币是一项重大的经济的和政治的措施，兑换工作是一项十分复杂艰巨的任务，而命令公布的时间也不久，有些地区的宣传工作还不普遍，不深入，准备工作也不周全，因此目前还必须继续努力展开宣传解释工作、加强市场的管理、做好新旧人民币的收兑准备。这三方面的工作是紧密关联着的，做好这三方面的工作，是保证顺利完成发行新币和收回旧币的关键。
    为什么做好宣传工作是十分重要的呢？因为发行新币和收回旧币，关系到每一个人的经济生活，必须使人人都了解这项措施的意义。特别是一部分家庭妇女和农民群众，由于他们居住分散，不识字的人多，对于发行新币的意义和办法不可能很快了解，因此有些人在认识上还很模糊，而国内外的敌人和不顾大义的坏分子也可能乘机造谣破坏，这就更加重了宣传工作的任务。我们必须教育人民群众真正认识发行新币的意义，从而自觉地起来遵守和执行法令。
    根据各地的反映，目前需要继续反复向群众宣传的就是我国货币的稳定性。由于国民党反动统治时期每发一次伪币，都使票子贬值，分文不值，引起物价大波动，在人民中留下了极其恶劣的影响，现在还有一些人顾虑我们的物价能不能稳定。这种顾虑完全没有必要。因为国民党反动统治的政治制度和经济制度根本不能同我们的政治制度和经济制度相比。国民党反动政府发行伪币，是在通货膨胀，物价不稳定的基础上发行的，其目的只是为了对人民进行更残暴的掠夺。我们今天的情况当然和过去完全不同。五年多以来，我国的个别商品价格虽然稍有上涨，但多数商品价格是下降的，总的说来却是一直平稳的。例如上海市场的中白粳大米，龙头细布，“统一”煤球等主要生活用品的零售价格，已经十九个月到二十五个月没有变动了。而且这种物价稳定的状况，今后还一定会继续下去。因为我国物价是建立在国家拥有雄厚的物质储备，并按稳定的价格投入市场的基础之上的，同时我们建立了强大的社会主义金融体系，统一管理了金融业，使货币流通的计划性日益加强，国家掌握的黄金、外汇也在逐日增多，单只黄金储备一项一九五四年就比一九五○年增加了十倍以上。因此，从各个方面说来，人民币都有着巩固和稳定的基础，这是没有疑问的。人民群众说：“粮食、布匹、百货都被国家掌握住了，投机商人那里闹腾得起来！”这种看法是正确的。
    那末为什么要规定期限收回旧人民币呢？这是因为如果让新、旧币长时期同时流通使用，不仅计算和支付十分不便，也使货币流通可能发生混乱，不利于国家和人民的经济生活，所以国务院规定一万、五万元的旧币只流通到一九五五年三月三十一日止，不过在四月三十日前仍可向中国人民银行按法定比率兑换新币。五千元及五千元以下的各种旧币，则为了流通的方便，停止兑换日期将会更长一些。因此，手头存有旧币不多的人，可以慢慢用出旧币。这些规定又一次说明了人民的政府是处处从维护人民利益和便利人民着想的。
    新人民币中有一种十元券，暂时还不准备发行。有的人问这是什么理由。应该指出，我国的经济正日益发展着，商品流转额也日益扩大，发行十元券是适应这种情况的，是有利于商品流转的；但是为了照顾当前流通的习惯，暂时还不发行。
    做好新人民币发行工作的另一个关键，就是要加强市场管理，切实做好物资供应。这里最主要的工作就是必须确实保证过去一万元旧人民币能买到的东西，现在一元新的人民币就能买到。因此国家市场管理部门必须对各工商业户的标价、转账以及在交易中的新旧币的比率，进行严格地检查和管理，对于那些不法工商业者进行抬价、私行贴水、欺骗群众等不法行为必须坚决取缔严加制止。贵阳市国营商店，把商品标出新旧币两种价格，使市民具体看到物价毫没有变动，这件事情值得在全国各地的国营、合作社营、公私合营、私营企业中推广。人民群众也应对商店、摊贩的标价进行认真的监督。商店对于人民的购货尤须注意供应，不应有保守、惜售的思想。
    保证新人民币发行工作顺利进行的另一个关键，就是必须作好兑换准备工作，必须处处使人民群众方便。在收兑期间，中国人民银行各级机构除应根据可能的条件设立若干临时的兑换站以外，还应委托代理兑换的机构，并届时通告群众进行兑换。各个机关、工厂和人民团体的职工，可以尽量组织集体兑换，各阶层人民可按照国务院规定的收兑期限自行兑换。两个月的收兑期限不算短，因此不必拥挤。有关业务部门，应随时反复地将上述各项问题向人民群众讲解清楚。
    新、旧人民币的兑换工作今天开始了。由于发行新币是全国人民所一致拥护的，只要我们在党政领导下作好宣传工作，国营企业和合作社能够密切配合，国家银行工作人员能够以良好的服务精神来从事兑换工作，我们是一定能够作好发行新币和收回旧币这一项重要的工作的。
