Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 24th: According to a dispatch from United Press International's Washington correspondent, U.S. Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Democrat, advocated for a meeting of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in a television broadcast on March 20th.

He said, "The major powers, who have a vital interest in world peace, should hold a meeting as soon as practically possible." While expressing that such a meeting is possible, George said, "The real hope of avoiding war" now lies in "some kind of high-level meeting of major countries."

George further said that his "meaning" is that "the question of participation" by France and the People's Republic of China "should be left open." He added that countries "directly involved" in major world conflicts should participate in the meeting.

At the same time, George also believes that such a meeting could be held after the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

Political figures in New York believe that George's remarks are related to the publication of the so-called "documents" of the Yalta Conference, which was insisted upon by the extremely reactionary elements in the Republican Party in order to attack the Democratic Party. In an attempt to strengthen the position of the Democratic Party, which is under attack from the Republicans, George proposed the idea of negotiations among the major powers. People here believe that this shows that the idea of negotiating with the Soviet Union is not only supported by the general public in other countries, but also by people within the United States.

The initiative put forward by George made the State Department uneasy. State Department spokesman, Mr. Suddam, said on March 22nd, "Senator George's proposal is consistent with the attitude taken by the State Department." However, Suddam implied that the State Department intends to negotiate "from a position of strength."

Contrary to Suddam's statement, Roberts, a reporter for "The Washington Post and Times Herald," pointed out that there is an "important difference" between George's proposition and that of the US government. He specifically pointed out that the President and the Secretary of State have both been avoiding mentioning the idea of holding a new meeting with the People's Republic of China, but George advocates holding high-level talks with representatives from the People's Republic of China.

On March 21st, Senator George explained his proposal in a conversation with an Associated Press reporter. George said, "I think there should be a meeting without any constraints. What I have in mind is a meeting where the world's problems can be put on the table for discussion. If we insist on having preconditions, then we won't get anything."

George also said that such a meeting might reach some agreements that could point the way to establishing "more normal relations" with the People's Republic of China.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee member, Republican Senator Smith, and Democratic Senator Morse expressed their support for George's proposal.

### 美参院外交委员会主席乔治  主张举行美、英、苏三国会议

    美参院外交委员会主席乔治
    主张举行美、英、苏三国会议
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：合众社驻华盛顿记者报道，美国参议院外交委员会主席、民主党人乔治三月二十日在电视广播节目中主张举行美、英、苏三国政府首脑会议。
    他说：“对世界和平有切身关系的大国应当在实际可能的情况下尽速举行会议。”乔治在表示举行这样一个会议是可能的时候说：“避免战争的真正希望”现在系于“主要国家的某种高级会议”。
    乔治进一步说，他的“意思是”，对于法国和中华人民共和国的“参加问题要把门开着”，他又说，世界重大冲突中“直接有关”的国家都应当参加会议。
    同时，乔治又认为这样一种会议可以在批准巴黎协定以后举行。
    纽约政界人士认为，乔治的谈话同在共和党里极端反动分子的坚持下为了打击民主党而公布雅尔塔会议的所谓“文件”一事有关。为了设法加强受到共和党打击的民主党的地位，乔治提出了大国谈判的主张。这里人士认为，这表明同苏联谈判的意见不但受到其他国家广大公众的支持，而且在美国国内也受到支持。
    乔治提出的倡议使得国务院感到不安。国务院发言人苏丹姆在三月二十二日说：“参议员乔治提出的建议，是同国务院采取的态度一致的。”但是，苏丹姆暗示，国务院打算的是“以实力为后盾”的谈判。
    同苏丹姆的说法相反，“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”的记者罗伯茨指出，乔治的主张同美国政府的主张之间有着“重要的分歧”。他具体指出总统和国务卿都一直在避免提到同中华人民共和国举行新会议的主张，但是乔治主张举行有中华人民共和国的代表参加的高级会谈。
    三月二十一日，参议员乔治在对美联社记者的谈话中解释了他的建议。乔治说：“我认为应当举行一个没有拘束的会议。我所想到的是一个可以把世界上的问题放到桌上来讨论的会议。如果我们坚持要有先决条件的话，那末我们就不会得到什么了。”
    乔治又说，这种会议可能达成一些协议，这些协议可以指出同中华人民共和国建立“较正常的关系”的道路。
    参议院外交委员会委员，共和党人史密斯和民主党参议员莫尔斯表示赞同乔治的主张。
