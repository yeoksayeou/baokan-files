The No. 1 boiler of the thermal power station at the First Automobile Works construction site is being prepared for production and began furnace baking on March 1st.

    On this day, Soviet experts Yeshkov, Yuzhikin, and others were on hand to provide guidance. When the furnace door showed a glowing red light, the 60-meter-high chimney of the main plant building of the thermal power station emitted smoke for the first time. The workers standing around the boiler excitedly shouted, "It's lit! It's smoking!" Li Yinfu, who was studying the "Safety Regulations," hurriedly rushed to the scene upon hearing the cheers. He looked at the thick smoke spewing from the chimney and excitedly said, "In order for the remaining boilers to begin furnace baking as soon as possible, I will work even harder and welcome the 'May 1st' Labor Day by supplying electricity to the entire factory."

    After achieving this victory, all the employees of the thermal power station are working hard to strive for early power transmission.

    第一汽车厂热电站开始烘炉
    第一汽车制造厂工地热电站第一号锅炉正准备投入生产，已在三月一日开始烘炉。
    这天，苏联专家耶什可夫、尤其金等都亲临现场指导。当炉门呈现出通红的火光时，热电站主厂房六十公尺高的烟囱口便第一次冒出了浓烟。站在锅炉四周的工人们，兴奋地喊道：“生火了！冒烟了！”正在学习“保安规程”的李音符，听到这一片欢呼声，急急忙忙赶到现场，他望着烟囱吐出的浓烟，激动地说：“为了其余几个锅炉早日烘炉，我要更加努力地工作，迎接‘五一’节向全厂送电。”
    热电站全体职工在取得这一胜利后，正为争取早日送电而努力。
