Since this newspaper initiated the discussion on "How farmers should dispose of the money in their hands" on January 12, many rural cadres, members of agricultural production cooperatives, individual peasant activists, and bank cadres have sent letters expressing their opinions. During the discussion, everyone analyzed the reasons why some farmers cannot correctly dispose of their money through specific examples and personal experiences, and put forward opinions and experiences on helping farmers arrange their economic lives. This discussion is of certain educational significance.

Helping farmers correctly dispose of their income is an important issue raised by rural economic life today. The occurrence of this problem is not accidental. Because China's agriculture has developed significantly in recent years, and the income of the majority of farmers has increased substantially. This is a concrete manifestation of China's increasingly prosperous and prosperous countryside.

With a substantial increase in income, it is of course completely natural and reasonable for farmers to spend more money to improve their lives. However, we should also see that some unhealthy phenomena have occurred in many places recently. Some farmers are distressed because they have a lot of income but don't know how to dispose of it. A considerable portion of farmers spend a lot of money on eating, drinking, and squandering. In addition, some farmers use money to engage in speculative business or lending. Obviously, the above situations are detrimental to the further development of agricultural production and the continued improvement of farmers' lives.

Why can't some farmers correctly dispose of the money in their hands? Judging from the results of this discussion, there are various specific reasons for this. However, these reasons ultimately boil down to one main point, that is, some farmers still lack a correct understanding of the various policies of socialist transformation, and more or less still have some doubts and concerns about socialism. In the rapid advancement of the socialist transformation of agriculture, it is not surprising that farmers show some wavering due to their economic status and narrow-mindedness. However, it must be pointed out that some shortcomings and deviations in the implementation of various policies in some places have further fueled the wavering psychology of these farmers. This must be given great attention.

Since the essence of the problem is like this, then the issue of helping farmers dispose of their income needs to be treated with special caution and patience. Abandoning leadership over farmers' economic lives is of course wrong; but if farmers' economic lives are rudely interfered with, that is also wrong. It is worth noting that the phenomenon of rudely interfering with farmers' economic lives has already occurred in some places. For example, some places force farmers to save and invest in credit cooperatives; some cadres, when they see farmers buying some living materials, indiscriminately label them as "wasteful"; some agricultural production cooperatives, because they are afraid that members will spend their money, do not distribute the dividends that members should receive. Facts have repeatedly proven that this kind of coercive order not only cannot help farmers correctly handle their income, but instead further arouses farmers' waste.

The correct attitude should be: to strengthen leadership without interfering too much. That is to say, we should carry out persuasion and education to farmers with full enthusiasm and empathy, with a spirit of being responsible for farmers' economic lives. When educating farmers, we must focus on linking relevant policies such as the establishment of agricultural cooperatives and unified purchase and sales, so that farmers can correctly understand socialism through these specific policies. However, just talking about principles is not enough. Attention should be paid to correctly implementing these policies in various practical works, so that the broad masses of farmers can deeply see the unity of individual interests and collective interests, national interests, and the unity of immediate interests and long-term interests. Any shortcomings and deviations that occur in these works
  (such as improper handling of major economic issues such as shareholding, distribution, and investment in some agricultural cooperatives, problems with unified purchase and sales and commodity supply work in some places, etc.) must be seriously corrected, and sincere self-criticism must be conducted to the masses, so that the masses can clearly distinguish the party and the state's policies from the shortcomings in the work. Doing so will raise the socialist awareness of farmers, reduce and gradually eliminate their concerns.

The facts reflected in this discussion show that, on the basis of raising farmers' socialist awareness, helping farmers correctly dispose of their income is completely possible. Comrade Li Yaoxian, secretary of the Gaozhangzi Village Branch in Lingyuan County, Rehe Province, wrote in his letter: After the masses sold their surplus grain, the party members and cadres in their village educated the masses through detailed calculations, changing the plans of some people to buy too many living materials, so that the village's income from selling surplus grain was 91 million old currency. In addition to being used to improve living standards, all the income was properly arranged according to items such as repaying national loans, savings, credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives shareholding, and expanding production investment. In this village, there is an agricultural cooperative member named Cui Zuozhong, who used to lend money every year. This year, after participating in the cooperative, he received education and deposited his surplus money of 1.5 million old currency into the credit cooperative and invested 1.15 million old currency in the agricultural cooperative. He said: "I will never lend money again. When I have money, I should help the country's construction."

When helping farmers correctly handle their income, we should especially emphasize the importance of expanding production investment. Many comrades have reflected in the discussion that the current situation in many agricultural cooperatives is that on the one hand, many members hold a lot of money, and on the other hand, the cooperatives face difficulties in lacking funds. The situation reflected by Comrade Zhang Jiqiao in Dong'an Township, Shilong County, Guangxi, is a clear example. Several agricultural cooperatives in this township have all set out plans to increase production by 20%, but the funds needed for production have not been settled. Members have a lot of money (due to last year's bumper harvest), but are unwilling to actively invest. Among the five new cooperatives, there are two cooperatives in which members do not invest at all, and the members' investment in the other three cooperatives is only 1.92 million old currency. This unreasonable situation should be changed quickly. Every agricultural cooperative should first rely on tapping the potential of its own funds to expand production, and borrow as little or no national loans as possible, so that national loans can be used where they are more needed. To achieve this, we must strengthen the ideological education of agricultural cooperatives, criticize the ideas of some members who "rely on the cooperative for food" and simply rely on national loans, so that everyone cares about collective interests and actively invests in the cooperative. However, at the same time, we must pay special attention to preventing the practice of blindly setting up large stalls and increasing the burden on members without proceeding from the actual situation.

Among the farmers who have not yet joined the cooperative, some people are unwilling to invest in production when they have money, they do not buy draught animals when they should, and they do not repair farm tools when they are broken, because they are afraid of suffering losses when they join the cooperative in the future. This concern is also unnecessary. They should be told that all important economic issues related to the personal interests of cooperative members in the agricultural cooperative will be properly handled in accordance with the party and the state's policies, and farmers with more means of production will not suffer losses when they join the cooperative.

Of course, in addition to expanding production investment, farmers can also make other arrangements for their income according to their specific conditions and needs. It is also completely right to better improve material and cultural life when economic conditions permit, and this must not be regarded as waste. If the money in the hands of farmers cannot be used for a while, they can also deposit the money in banks or credit cooperatives, or subscribe for national construction bonds to support national construction, as many farmers say, these are all good things that "benefit the country and benefit themselves."

To help farmers correctly dispose of their income, we must also earnestly do a good job in all aspects of economic work. State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives should improve the supply of unified sales commodities and other commodities to rural areas with a spirit of being responsible to the country and farmers, and provide more means of production and living materials to farmers in a timely manner, so as to meet the needs of the broad masses of farmers as much as possible. In addition, rural savings, credit cooperation and other work must also be effectively improved.

    必须正确地帮助农民合理安排资金
    ——关于“农民应该怎样支配手里的钱”的讨论的结束语
    编者
    自本报在一月十二日发起“农民应该怎样支配手里的钱”的问题讨论后，有许多农村干部、农业生产合作社社员、个体农民积极分子以及银行工作干部等来信发表意见。在讨论过程中，大家通过具体事例和切身体验分析了有些农民不能正确地支配钱的原因，并提出了帮助农民安排经济生活的意见和经验。这个讨论是有一定教育意义的。
    帮助农民正确地支配他们的收入，是今天农村经济生活所提出的一个重要问题。这个问题的发生，并不是偶然的。因为我国农业几年来有了显著的发展，广大农民的收入有了大量的增加。这是我国农村日益富裕和繁荣的具体表现。
    在收入大量增加的情况下，农民要多用一些钱来改善自己的生活，这当然是完全自然和合理的。但是，我们也应该看到，最近时期以来很多地方发生了一些不健康的现象。有些农民因为收入多而发生了不知道该怎样支配的苦闷。还有相当多的一部分农民因为钱多了，就大吃大喝，挥霍浪费。此外还有些农民用钱来做投机生意或放债。显然，上述这些情况对于农业生产的进一步发展和农民生活的继续改善，都是不利的。
    为什么有些农民不能正确地支配自己手里的钱呢？从这次讨论的结果看，这是有各种各样具体原因的。但是，这些原因归根到底主要是一个，这就是部分农民对社会主义改造的各项政策还缺乏正确的理解，对社会主义或多或少地还存有一些怀疑和顾虑。在农业社会主义改造的迅速前进中，农民由于他们的经济地位和狭隘心理而表现出某些动摇，这是不奇怪的。但是必须指出的是，有些地方在执行各项政策过程中所发生的一些缺点和偏差，就更加助长了这些农民的动摇心理。这是必须引起大家十分重视的。
    问题的实质既是这样，那么，对待帮助农民支配他们的收入的问题，就需要特别慎重和耐心。对农民的经济生活放弃领导，固然是错误的；但如果对农民的经济生活粗暴地加以干涉，那也是错误的。值得注意的是，这种粗暴地干涉农民经济生活的现象已经在某些地方发生了。例如有的地方强迫农民储蓄和向信用合作社入股；有些干部见到农民买一些生活资料，就不分青红皂白地扣上“浪费”的帽子；有些农业生产合作社因为怕社员把钱花掉，社员应分红的钱也不分配了。事实一再证明，这种强迫命令的做法，不但不能帮助农民正确地处理他们的收入，反而更加引起了农民的浪费。
    正确的态度应该是：既要加强领导，又不要干涉过多。这就是说，应该以对农民经济生活负责的精神，满腔热忱地、设身处地地向农民进行说服教育。在向农民进行教育时，必须着重联系有关建立农业社和统购统销等各项政策，使农民通过这些具体的政策正确地认识社会主义。但是仅仅是讲道理也还是不够的，应注意在各项实际工作中正确地贯彻这些政策，使广大农民深切地看到个人利益和集体利益、国家利益的一致性，眼前利益和长远利益的一致性。在这些工作中发生的任何缺点和偏差
  （如有些农业社对入股、分配、投资等重大经济问题的处理不当，有些地方的统购统销和商品供应工作有毛病等等），都必须严肃地加以纠正，并且诚恳地向群众进行自我批评，使群众把党和国家的政策同工作中的缺点分别清楚。这样做，就会提高农民的社会主义觉悟，减少和逐渐消除他们的疑虑。
    这次讨论中反映的事实说明，在提高农民的社会主义觉悟的基础上，帮助农民正确地支配他们的收入是完全可以作到的。热河省凌源县高杖子村支部书记李耀先同志来信说：他们村里的党员和干部在群众卖余粮以后，就通过算细账的方式向群众进行教育，改变了有些人想过多地买生活资料的打算，使全村卖余粮的收入旧币九千一百万元，除了用去改善生活的以外，都按照归还国家贷款、储蓄、信用社和供销社入股、扩大生产投资等项目，作了妥善的安排。这个村里有一个名叫崔作忠的农业社社员，过去每年都放债，今年参加到社后受到了教育，把自己的余钱旧币一百五十万元存到信用社，向农业社投资旧币一百一十五万元。他说：“今后再不放债啦，有了钱应当帮助国家建设。”
    在帮助农民正确地处理他们的收入时，应当特别强调说明扩大生产投资的重要意义。许多同志在讨论中都反映，目前在许多农业社中存在着这样的情况：一方面，许多社员手里握有不少的钱，另方面社里却发生资金缺乏的困难。章季樵同志所反映的广西石龙县东岸乡的情况，就是一个明显的例子。这个乡的几个农业社都订出了增产两成的计划，但是生产所需要的资金却没有着落。社员手里有许多钱（因去年丰收），却不肯积极投资。五个新社中，社员一点不投资的有两个社，另外三个社的社员投资也只有旧币一百九十二万元。这种不合理的情况应该迅速改变。每一个农业社都应该首先依靠发掘自己社内的资金潜力来扩大生产，尽可能少借或不借国家贷款，使国家贷款用到更需要的地方去。要做到这点，必须加强农业社的思想教育，批判某些社员的“靠社吃饭”和单纯依赖国家贷款的思想，使大家关心集体利益，积极向社内投资。但同时要特别注意防止不从实际情况出发，盲目摆大摊子，增加社员负担的作法。
    在现在还没有入社的农民中，有些人有了钱不愿意向生产上投资，该买耕畜也不买，农具坏了也不修理，原因是他们怕将来入社吃亏。这种顾虑也是不必要的，应该告诉他们：农业社里的一切有关社员个人利益的重要经济问题，根据党和国家的政策，都会得到正确的处理，生产资料多的农民入社时是不会吃亏的。
    当然，除了扩大生产的投资以外，农民还可以根据自己的具体条件和需要，对自己的收入作其他的处理。在经济条件所允许的情况下更好地改善物质和文化生活，也是完全应该的，决不能把这看成是浪费。如果农民手里的钱一时用不了，还可以把钱存到银行或信用社里，或者认购国家建设公债，支援国家建设，正如许多农民所说的，这些都是“功在国家、利在自己”的好事情。
    要帮助农民正确地支配他们的收入，还必须切实做好各方面的经济工作。国营商业部门和供销合作社应该以对国家和农民负责的精神，改进对农村的统销商品和其他商品的供应工作，及时地把更多的生产资料和生活资料供给农民，尽可能地满足广大农民的需要。另外，农村储蓄、信用合作等项工作，也都必须切实改进。
