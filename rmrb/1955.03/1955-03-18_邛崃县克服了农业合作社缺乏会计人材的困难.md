    Qionglai County Overcomes the Difficulty of Agricultural Cooperatives Lacking Accounting Personnel
    Chen Lian
    Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, established sixty-nine agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest of 1954. After these cooperatives were established, they initially encountered the difficulty of lacking accountants. Before the establishment of the cooperatives, each cooperative had selected and trained accounting personnel, and the county party committee had also transferred them to receive nine days of accounting technical training; however, after the cooperatives were established, these accounting personnel generally felt unable to cope.
    The Qionglai County Party Committee paid attention to this problem from the beginning. The county party committee considered that the accounting ability was weak and the distribution of cooperatives was very wide, so the original accounting instructor could not take care of them all, so they added another instructor. They also ranked the accountants of all the cooperatives in the county according to their awareness and ability, in order to guide them according to different situations; at the same time, in order to prevent confusion in the accounts, they also unified the styles of various account books. However, in the specific work of each cooperative, there were still many errors and confusions. Within half a month, three of the thirteen cooperatives in Dongyue Township had errors in their accounts, and the "Victory" cooperative in Gongchen Township had an error of 20,000 yuan (old currency), which took three days to find. The chaotic financial accounting work in the cooperatives made some accounting personnel feel uneasy about their work. Some found it troublesome, some were annoyed by the errors in the accounts, some were afraid of taking responsibility, and individual ones complained about low salaries, resulting in negative and sluggish work. In order to reverse this situation in a timely manner, the county party committee convened an accounting meeting in early October 1954, before the first account statements of each cooperative were published. By checking the accounts and solving specific problems, the business ability of the accountants was improved, and everyone was educated to recognize the importance of accounting work in agricultural production cooperatives. At the meeting, the accountants of the old cooperatives introduced their experiences in overcoming difficulties, and also brought out the problems encountered by everyone in their actual work for joint research and resolution, strengthening the confidence of the new cooperative accountants in overcoming difficulties.
    Collective research and resolution of problems at the meeting was just one method. The county party committee believed that it was also necessary to strengthen regular leadership and check and help each cooperative's work at any time. After this meeting, the county party committee organized the accountants of each cooperative into ten accounting mutual aid groups according to the distance of the cooperative, the strength of their ability, etc., so that they could regularly exchange experiences and continuously improve their work ability. When using accounting mutual aid groups, attention was also paid to adopting the method of master teaching apprentice, assigning accountants with weak abilities to be guided by those with strong abilities. Li Shaolun, the accountant of the "Dawn" branch, made mistakes in the accounts because he was not familiar with the business. The accountants of the "Taian" cooperative and the "Dawn" cooperative helped him to clear up the accounts and taught him how to set up accounts. In this way, Li Shaolun quickly learned to independently record and set up accounts.
    The two accounting instructors went to each cooperative separately to check the work and helped solve the problems at any time. During their rounds of inspections, they found that the accounting ability of four of the six cooperatives in the third district was very poor and the accounts were chaotic; although accounting mutual aid groups had been established, the cooperatives were too far apart in the mountains, making mutual aid inconvenient. Instructor Li Jishen invited three cooperatives closer to the district committee to come to the district to study for a few days and checked the accounts, so that these three accountants understood how to do a good job in accounting. Another cooperative was too far away, so Li Jishen went to live there until he taught them how to do it before leaving. The accounting mutual aid groups went to the instructors for help when they encountered problems that they could not solve, and the instructors helped solve them by telephone or by going there in person.
    The county party committee also paid attention to using the strength of all parties to strengthen the accounting work of agricultural production cooperatives. The county party committee required the financial and grain personnel of each district and township to attach importance to the financial accounting work of agricultural production cooperatives and assist in leading the accounting work of each cooperative in their locality. This group of people played a great role in practical work. They made up for the shortcomings of the accounting instructors, helped the accountants of many cooperatives solve difficult problems in a timely manner, and also patiently cultivated some accounting talents. Zheng Benchu, the accountant of the "September 3rd" cooperative in Dongan Township, was a graduate of a senior primary school. He did not know how to set up accounts at the beginning, but with the help of Kang Yonggui, a financial and grain affairs cadre in the township, he was soon able to work independently. Among the demobilized soldiers, many were able to take on accounting work, and the county party committee paid attention to placing some of them in agricultural production cooperatives to work as accountants. In this way, the difficulty of lacking accountants was solved, and the demobilized soldiers were properly resettled.
    Now, the accounting work of the sixty-nine cooperatives established before the autumn harvest of 1954 has been put on the right track, and they can do daily clearing and monthly closing and publish the accounts on time. More than 70 percent of the accounting personnel can independently set up accounts, and the rest can also keep accounts, and are basically able to cope with the accounting work.

    邛崃县克服了农业合作社缺乏会计人材的困难
    陈濂
    四川省邛崃县在一九五四年秋收前建立了六十九个农业生产合作社，这些社建立起来以后，一开始就遇到了缺少会计的困难。在建社前，各社对会计人员也曾进行过选择和培养，县委还调他们去受过九天会计技术训练；但是社建成后，这些会计人员还是普遍感到不能胜任。
    中共邛崃县委一开始就注意了这个问题。县委考虑到会计能力弱，社的分布又很广，原有的一个会计辅导员照顾不过来，便又增加了一个辅导员。他们还把全县各社的会计按觉悟和能力排了队，以便分别不同的情况加以指导；同时为了防止账目混乱，还统一了各种账簿的式样。可是各社具体作起来，还是有不少错乱。半个月内，东岳乡十三个社就有三个错了账，拱辰乡“胜利”社错了二万元
  （旧币），花了三天时间才找出来。社内财务会计工作混乱，有些会计人员就对工作不安心了。有的嫌麻烦，有的错了账感到恼火，有的怕负责任，个别的还嫌待遇低，工作消极疲沓。为了及时扭转这种情况，县委在一九五四年十月上旬各社公布第一次账目前，召开了一次会计会议。通过检查账目、解决具体问题来提高会计的业务能力，并且教育大家认清农业生产合作社的会计工作的重要性。在会上，老社的会计介绍自己克服困难的经过，又把大家在实际工作中碰到的问题拿出来共同研究解决，加强了新社会计战胜困难的信心。
    在会议上集体研究解决问题，只是一种办法。县委认为还需要加强经常性的领导，随时检查和帮助各社工作。在这次会后，县委就把各社的会计根据社的远近、能力强弱等情况，组织成十个会计互助小组，使他们经常地相互交流经验，不断提高工作能力。在运用会计互助小组时，还注意了采用师傅带徒弟的方法，把能力弱的会计交给能力强的指导。“黎明”分社的会计李绍伦业务不熟悉错了账，“太安”社和“黎明”社的会计就帮助他清理，并且教他建账。这样李绍伦很快就学会单独记账、建账了。
    两个会计辅导员平时分头到各社去检查，发现问题随时帮助解决。他们在巡回检查时发现三区六个社有四个社的会计能力很差，账目错乱；虽然成立了会计互助组，但是在山地里，社和社之间相隔太远，不便互助。辅导员李继善就邀集靠区委较近的三个社到区里来学习了几天，又检查了账目，使这三个会计都弄清了应该怎样搞好会计工作。还有一个社隔得太远，李继善就去住在那里，直到教会了才走。会计互助组遇到不能解决的问题就去找辅导员，辅导员通过电话或亲自去帮助解决。
    县委还注意了运用各方面的力量来加强农业生产合作社的会计工作。县委要求各区、乡财粮工作人员重视农业生产合作社的财务会计工作，协助领导所在地各社的会计工作。这部分人在实际工作中发挥的作用很大。他们弥补了会计辅导员的不足，帮助许多社的会计及时解决了疑难问题，还耐心培养了一些会计人材。东安乡“九三”社会计郑本初是个高小毕业生，开始不会建账，在乡财粮干事康永贵的帮助下，很快就能独立工作了。在转业军人中有不少是能担任会计工作的，县委就注意安置了一部分在农业生产合作社内作会计。这样，既解决了会计缺乏的困难，又使转业军人得到妥善的安置。
    现在，一九五四年秋收前建立的六十九个社的会计工作都已经上了轨道，能够做到日清月结、按
  时公布账目了。有百分之七十以上的会计人员已能独立建账，其余的也能记账，对会计工作基本上能够胜任。
