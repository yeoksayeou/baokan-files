    Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The number of people nationwide participating in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons has reached 300,731,2714. This figure is based on incomplete statistics from 25 provinces, 3 municipalities directly under the central government, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Tibet, covering 35 days from February 14th to March 20th. This number exceeds the 220 million signatures collected in 1950 for the Stockholm Appeal demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons by approximately 80 million, and approaches the 340 million signatures collected in 1951 demanding that the five major powers conclude a peace pact.
    Currently, in most provinces and regions across the country, the number of participants in the signature campaign is approximately 50% of the total population. In provinces and regions where the signature campaign has progressed relatively quickly, such as Heilongjiang Province, the number of participants is approximately 80% of the province's total population. In provinces such as Shaanxi, Anhui, and Shanxi, the number of participants accounts for approximately 70% of the total population of each province. In provinces such as Rehe, Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Sichuan, the number of signatures has exceeded or is approaching 60% of the total population of each province. The signature campaign is continuing to be carried out in the vast rural areas and remote regions.

    反对使用原子武器签名运动继续扩展
    全国签名人数超过三亿
    【新华社二十二日讯】全国参加反对使用原子武器签名的人数已达三亿零七百三十一万二千七百一十四人，这是根据全国二十五个省、三个直辖市和内蒙古自治区、西藏地方从二月十四日截至三月二十日为止的三十五天中不完全的统计得出的数字。这个数字比一九五○年全国在要求禁止使用原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数二亿二千多万超过约八千万，并接近一九五一年要求五大国缔结和平公约签名时的三亿四千万的签名人数。
    现在，全国大部分省区参加签名的人数大约各达总人口的百分之五十左右。在签名运动进展比较快的省区，如黑龙江省参加签名的人数已约等于全省总人口的百分之八十，陕西、安徽和山西等省参加签名的人数已占各省总人口的百分之七十左右，热河、辽宁、河北、山东、江西和四川等省的签名人数已超过或接近各省总人口的百分之六十。签名运动正继续在广大农村和边远地区开展中。
