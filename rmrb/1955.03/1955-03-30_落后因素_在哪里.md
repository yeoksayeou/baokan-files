    Where are the "Backward Factors"?
    Gantong
    On the evening of January 3rd, the Lanzhou West District Brick and Tile Factory held an emergency meeting.
    The lights-out bell had already rung. The offices and dormitories were pitch black, but the factory director's office was still lit. The light shining from the window looked glaring. The atmosphere in the factory director's office was also tense. The factory director, deputy director, and heads of the production and planning sections were sitting on sofas and chairs. Some looked exhausted from the tension, while others looked angry and agitated—but no one spoke, clearly waiting for something.
    The door opened. Statistician Li Futang walked in. He was there on orders. Clearly, he was the target everyone was waiting for. As soon as he entered, Deputy Director Li Minggeng slammed a document on the table and shouted angrily at him, "We need to get this straight, what exactly are you trying to do?"
    The momentum was fierce, and Li Futang felt threatened. He hesitated slightly, but immediately understood the deputy director's meaning and said calmly, "I'm not trying to do anything, I'm just telling the truth."
    One said "We need to get this straight," and the other said "I'm just telling the truth," so what exactly was this about?
    It turned out that the Lanzhou West District Brick and Tile Factory had already overfulfilled its annual production and increased production and conservation plan by 744,000 bricks in mid-December 1954. According to the original plan, no bricks would be produced in late December, so statistician Li Futang prepared the report for the last ten days of the month and sent it to the Municipal Bureau of Industry. But after the report was sent, it was discovered that two more kilns, numbers three and eight, had been fired, yielding more than 200,500 bricks. Since the report for the ten-day period had been missed, it should be included in the monthly report. He asked Deputy Director Li Minggeng about it, but Li pushed it off again and again, and finally told him, "Ask Li Yuqing, see if the January task can be completed? Should those two kilns of bricks be counted in next year's plan?"
    Li Yuqing was the head of the production section, and he replied cleverly, "Let Deputy Director Li decide. Count them if you want."
    Deputy Director Li already had a plan. He decided to include those 200,000-plus bricks in the 1955 plan. Factory Director Lin Ziming completely agreed with this "decision." He also criticized some comrades who disagreed with this approach: "You only look at the advanced factors, not the backward factors. If the new blanks don't keep up, the January task won't be completed. Is it okay not to plan for the long term?"
    Li Futang was responsible for filling out the reports and was a Communist Party member. The sense of responsibility of a Communist Party member required him to write an explanation, which roughly stated: The bricks from kilns three and eight, which have not yet been fired, should have been counted in the 1954 surplus, but due to the conservative thinking of the leadership, they are being reserved for 1955 production. After the "explanation" was written, it was sent to the factory director's office.
    This explanatory material was the reason for Deputy Director Li's great anger, and the reason for this emergency meeting tonight. The matter was originally very clear, and the factory directors also knew: These two kilns of bricks should be counted as 1954 production and should not be left to "ambush." But they wanted to persuade, or rather, to suppress this statistician who did not respect the "leadership's intentions."
    But this statistician was quite "stubborn," and actually said calmly, "I'm just telling the truth!" And he also defended himself:
    "Before the new year, I asked you: How should I report the bricks from kilns three and eight that have not yet been fired? You said you would study it with Director Lin; later I asked you again, and you said wait until after the new year; after the new year, I asked you again, and you said it was already very messy, don't report it..."
    Deputy Director Li was adding fuel to the fire when he heard this defense. He impatiently interrupted the statistician's words, "Enough, enough! Since you knew this, why did you write it that way? Isn't that slapping your own face?" However, Deputy Director Li was, after all, somewhat cultured, and he tried to suppress his anger, and changed to a slightly gentler tone: "You are a statistician, an assistant to the factory director, you must represent the factory director's intentions—well, of course, if you have different opinions, go and report them to the higher authorities!"
    "Okay!" Statistician Li Futang finally agreed, saying, "Let's do it according to the factory director's intentions. But, I still have to report my opinion to the higher authorities."
    Clearly, the situation was very awkward. Factory Director Lin, who had been silent on the sidelines, had to say a few words: "Since it has already been done this way, then change the explanation and report it, saying that in order to lay a good foundation for the product quality classification in 1955, the two kilns of bricks that have not yet been fired are being reserved for testing." Speaking to this point, perhaps he himself felt a little guilty, so the last sentence was changed to a question: "This way, we should be able to answer to the higher authorities, right?"
    But the higher authorities did not think that these deputy and factory directors were "answering" to them. The Municipal Bureau of Industry decided that they should re-report those two kilns of bricks as part of the 1954 production, and also criticized their thinking of concealing production, and did not appreciate their "long-term plans."
    People may ask: Are the factory directors so cautious because the factory's production capacity is generally relatively poor? As early as when the annual production plan for 1954 was being drafted, the Municipal Bureau of Industry wanted them to increase the production of 500,000 bricks. The factory directors strongly emphasized the "backward factors" in the factory, saying that they could not complete the task. After repeated mobilization by the Bureau of Industry, they reluctantly increased the production by 500,000 bricks with trepidation. But the workers used their soaring production enthusiasm and continuous inventions to meet the new tasks. And the result? The annual production plan was overfulfilled by 949,000 bricks!
    The factory directors certainly knew these things. But that thing called "backward factors" often weighed on them like a nightmare. They never believed that there would be any "advanced experience" in the factory. When other factories asked Director Lin to introduce his advanced experience, Director Lin quickly stopped them: "It's just a little experience, not worth introducing." Even the record of overfulfilling the plan by 949,000 bricks could not move them, so that when they set this year's production plan, they still ordered 5,000 fewer bricks per kiln on average.
    Now, the problem is clearer. In the Lanzhou West District Brick and Tile Factory, there are indeed noteworthy "backward factors." These "backward factors" are none other than the factory directors' conservative thinking, their underestimation of the workers' initiative and creativity, and their bad habit of seeking superficial achievements!

    “落后因素”在哪里
    甘通
    一月三日的晚上，兰州西区砖瓦厂召开了一次紧急会议。
    熄灯钟已经敲过了。办公室和宿舍都是漆黑的，但厂长室的灯还在亮着。从窗子里透出来的灯光，显得很刺目。厂长室里的气氛也显得紧张。沙发上，椅子上，分坐着厂长、副厂长和生产股、计划股的负责人。他们有的在紧张中显得疲惫，有的怒形于色，显得很焦燥——但都没有说话，显然是在等待着什么。
    门开了。统计员李辅唐走了进来。他是奉命而来的。显然他就是大家等待着的目标。所以他刚一进门，李副厂长就拍着桌子上的一份材料，怒气冲冲地朝他喊道：“咱们把这事情弄明白，你究竟是什么企图？”
    气势来得很凶，李辅唐感到了一些威胁。他稍稍犹疑了一下，但马上领会了副厂长的意思，平静地说：“没有什么企图，我说的都是实话。”
    一个说要“把这事情弄明白”，一个说“我说的都是实话”，这究竟是什么事情呢？
    原来兰州西区砖瓦厂，在一九五四年十二月中旬，就已经超额七十四万四千块砖完成了全年的生产计划和增产节约计划。按原计划，十二月下旬不出砖，统计员李辅唐便据此造好下旬报表，送到市工业局了。但在旬报送出后，却发现三号八号两窑又烧好了二十万零五千多块砖。旬报既然漏了，月报是应该填进去的，他去问副厂长李明耕，李副厂长一推再推，后来才对他说：“去问李玉卿，看明年一月份任务能完成吗？那两窑砖要不要算到明年的计划中去？”
    李玉卿是生产股的负责人，他回答得很巧妙：“李副厂长决定吧，要算就算。”
    李副厂长早就胸有成竹，他决定把这二十万有零的砖算到一九五五年的计划中去。厂长蔺子明对这个“决定”是完全同意的。他还批评不同意这种做法的一些同志：“你们光看先进因素，不看落后因素，新坯接不上，一月份任务完不成，不做长远打算还行？”
    李辅唐是负责填写表报的，是一个共产党员。共产党员的责任心要求他写了一个说明，大意是：尚未出窑的三号八号两窑的砖，本应算作一九五四年超额数内，因领导思想保守，要留作一九五五年的产量。“说明”写好后，就送到厂长室去。
    这份说明材料就是惹得李副厂长大动肝火的原因，也是今晚召开这个紧急会议的原因。事情本来是很明白的，厂长们也知道：这两窑砖，应该算作一九五四年的产量，而不应该留下来“打埋伏”。但他们却要说服，或者说要压服这个不尊重“领导意图”的统计员。
    可是这个统计员竟“固执”得很，居然平心静气地说：“我说的都是实话”！并且还申辩道：
  “年前我就问过你：没有出窑的三号和八号窑的砖，该怎报？你说和蔺厂长研究研究；后来我又问你，你说等过了年再说；过了年我又问你，你说已经弄得很乱，不要报了……”
    李副厂长听了这通申辩，真是火上添油。他焦燥地打断统计员的话说：“够啦，够啦！既然知道这样，你还那末写，不是打自己的屁股吗？”不过，李副厂长究竟是有些修养的，他尽量压制着怒火，又改用略微平和的口气说：“你是统计员，是厂长的助手，要代表厂长的意图——唔，当然，有不同意见，去向上级反映好了！”
    “好吧！”统计员李辅唐终于同意了，说：“就根据厂长的意图办吧。可是，我的意见还要向上级反映的。”
    显然，这个局面很尴尬。原来在一旁默不作声的蔺厂长，不得不说两句了：“已经这样做了，那就把说明改变一下报上去，就说为了给一九五五年产品质量分类打好基础，没出窑的两窑砖，留作试验。”谈到这里，也许他自己也感到有点心虚，所以最后一句话，改成问句的口气：“这样，该对得起上级了吧？”
    可是上级却偏不以为这正副厂长“对得起”自己。市工业局决定要他们把那两窑砖算到一九五四年的产量以内重新上报，还批评了他们隐瞒产量的思想，没有体谅他们的“长远打算”。
    人们也许会问：厂长们如此小心谨慎，是不是因为这个厂的生产能力一般比较差呢？远在拟订一九五四年全年生产计划时，市工业局要他们增加五十万块砖，厂长们就曾大力强调厂里的“落后因素”，说完不成任务，经过工业局再三动员，才提心吊胆、勉勉强强地增加了五十万块砖。可是工人们却用高涨的生产情绪和接连不断的创造发明来迎接新的任务。结果呢，全年超额九十四万九千块砖完成了生产计划！
    这些事情，厂长们当然知道。可是，那个叫做“落后因素”的东西却时常像梦魇一样压着他们。他们从不相信厂里会有什么“先进经验”。当别的厂请蔺厂长去介绍先进经验时，蔺厂长连忙挡住：“小小经验，不值得介绍。”甚至超额九十四万九千块砖的纪录，都不能打动他们，以致订今年的生产计划时，平均每窑还是少订了五千块砖。
    现在，问题比较清楚了，在兰州西区砖瓦厂，确实存在着值得注意的“落后因素”，这种“落后因素”不是别的，恰恰就是厂长们的保守的、轻视工人积极性创造性的思想和骗取表面成绩的恶劣作风！
