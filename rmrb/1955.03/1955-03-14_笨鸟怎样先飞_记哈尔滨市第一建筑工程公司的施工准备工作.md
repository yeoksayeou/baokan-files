How the clumsy bird flies first
    —On the construction preparation work of Harbin No. 1 Construction Engineering Company
    Pan Guohua

    Why were we a step behind?

    In December 1954, after the Harbin No. 1 Construction Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company) completed its 1954 construction tasks ahead of schedule, leading cadres were satisfied with their existing experience in civil construction and felt that the tasks had been completed well. When this year's preliminary determination of over 90,000 square meters of construction area was made, they thought, "The task is small, not enough to keep us busy," and therefore emphasized that "the task has not been finally confirmed, the conditions for preparation are not available"; "The task has not been formally issued, it is not too late to carry it out after it is issued!"

    Because of this, at the first Party committee meeting to study construction preparation work, it was only decided that the deputy director of the Party committee office would be responsible for leading it; the administration did not include preparation work in the arrangements for the period before and after the New Year. Of the 19 cadres in the construction section, 15 were assigned to write winter training materials; the chief of the finance section said, "The financial summary and final accounts work is busy enough for a while, and the leadership has not yet instructed on the construction preparation work, and the planning section has not given any indicators. It is not clear how to do it." The trade union focused its efforts on summarizing the work of the trade union last year, and the chairman of the trade union said: "There is no manpower to do preparation work, and besides, the Spring Festival is coming soon, and the Spring Festival activities have to be started."

    Under these circumstances, other units had already reorganized their construction teams and started to prepare the annual technical construction and financial plan for 1955, while they had not yet considered it.

    Where is the key?

    After the New Year, the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of responsible cadres of basic construction departments to mobilize them to do a good job in construction preparation. In his report, the comrade in charge of the Municipal Committee's Basic Construction Department severely criticized the phenomenon that some units last year did not seriously do preparation work, the state plan was not fully completed, quality accidents occurred continuously, costs were overspent, and state funds were seriously wasted, and pointed out that this phenomenon must never be allowed to continue this year. Therefore, to do a good job in preparation work, we must first correct the understanding of leading cadres and overcome the blind optimism and passive waiting that exists in a considerable number of cadres... After hearing these words, Liu Zhile, secretary of the company's Party committee, felt a little uneasy. He turned around and said to Zhang Yanhe, deputy director of the company's Party committee office, who was sitting behind him: "Old Zhang, did you hear that?"
      "I heard it."
      "This is criticizing us!"
    Deputy Director Zhang nodded.

    After the meeting, the company's Party committee, in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Committee and in light of the company's specific situation, believed that in order to immediately and comprehensively do a good job in preparation work, it was first necessary to criticize blind complacency. Blind complacency was mainly manifested in overestimating last year's achievements. Therefore, first of all, they launched criticism and self-criticism by inspecting last year's work. After carrying out criticism and serious inspection, cadres realized that the plan completed last year was not comprehensive, and 124 quality accidents occurred one after another, 84 of which were caused by technical guidance errors; the cost reduction work was not done well, and material waste alone amounted to more than 720 million yuan (old currency); 452 safety accidents occurred, of which the fourth engineering team, which contracted the reconstruction project of the Harbin Sugar Factory, had 102 accidents of varying sizes. The phenomenon of uneven construction throughout the year and the failure to complete the operation plan every month was very common, resulting in serious waste. According to preliminary statistics from April to November, more than 37,000 man-hours were wasted due to waiting and shutdowns, amounting to more than 940 million yuan. After some leading cadres learned about this situation, their blind complacency began to be hit.

    However, the sentiment that this year's "task is small, not enough to keep us busy" has not been completely overcome. The company's Party committee organized leading cadres to analyze the characteristics of this year's construction tasks. At this time, everyone was shocked: "A donkey jumped out of the sheepfold," and the content of civil construction projects had undergone great changes. The number of large and high-rise buildings has increased, and projects such as the Harbin Foreign Languages ​​College and the Provincial People's Government Office Building each have more than 10,000 square meters, the structure of the project is complex, and the proportion of mixed structures has increased, accounting for 87.76% of the total project. This has increased many difficulties in terms of construction management and construction methods. Therefore, this year's task is "not small, not enough to keep us busy," but is more arduous and complex.

    After initially overcoming blind complacency, some leading cadres raised the question, since this year's task is large, but the conditions are not yet available, what should we do? The Party committee further organized cadres above the section level to analyze the main reasons for the poor completion of last year's tasks, which was that the preparation work was not done well, and the reason why the preparation work was not done well was that the ideological method was not correct, and the quality of the preparation work was understood as being determined only by objective conditions, believing that: "If you give me drawings, materials, and money, I can construct with people." As a result? When the conditions were all there, they were not organized in accordance with socialist management principles, and as a result, a chaotic situation once appeared on some construction sites after many construction sites started blindly. Everyone believes that since we understand the reasons for the poor completion of tasks last year, and this year's tasks are exceptionally heavy, we should be: "Clumsy birds fly first."

    How to take the first step?

    After a series of ideological education, everyone realized that the current construction technical force is insufficient, and it is still a "clumsy bird", and must fly first to comprehensively complete this year's task. But how exactly to fly first? Everyone believes that it is necessary to do the preparation work in the case of certain conditions being lacking.

    After the national construction task indicators were issued, they only knew which construction units were there, but they did not know the specific content of the project. If they did not understand it as soon as possible, it would hinder a series of preparation work. "What to do?" So they adopted the method of "going to the door" to actively contact the construction units, mobilized more than a dozen cadres, spent four days running through 21 contracting units, found out the entire content of the project, and created conditions for formulating this year's construction plan and arranging the construction program, and also helped and supervised the construction units. The Heilongjiang Provincial Bureau of Foreign Trade is carrying out basic construction for the first time this year, and does not know much about all the scientific knowledge and procedures of basic construction. Therefore, the preparation work is carried out in a chaotic manner, and nothing is in order. Comrade Wu Ping of the company's planning section went twice to help them study the work in detail. They felt that the help was great. After ten days, they had initially determined the address and decided to adopt standard designs. As a result, the preparation work went smoothly.

    After the content of the project is known, the construction unit cannot quickly submit the drawings, so the budget cannot be prepared, which hinders the preparation work. The company's leadership believes that the reason why economic accounting has not been done well in the past few years, the operation plan is not accurate, and the construction management is chaotic is because there is no budget, and the leadership has no idea about the project. At the same time, the preparation of the budget is indeed complicated and arduous, and it takes a long time. In the past, it has always been in a state of preparing the budget while constructing, and even the budget cannot be submitted after the project has been completed. In order to change this passive situation, the company's leadership mobilized comrades Yuan Zhichao, Bi Jianming, and Hu Shunsheng from the construction section to research a simple and rapid method of preparing the budget within a certain period of time. After two weeks, they proposed a rapid budgeting method that can submit the project budget within one week after the drawings are submitted.

    When the construction unit cannot submit the drawings and the project budget cannot be prepared, the company, based on its experience in civil construction over the past few years, collects and studies various materials, especially learning from the experience of state-run construction enterprises in this area, divides civil construction into several types, and compiles the "Outline of Construction Organization Design" and drafts the "Provisional Regulations for the Compilation of Construction Organization Design". In this way, the construction site can prepare some of it before receiving the drawings, and after the drawings are submitted, it can prepare a complete and feasible construction organization design in a very short time according to the outline regulations.

    The construction organization design is originally an important document to strengthen plan management, organize rhythmic and balanced construction, and guide site layout. However, in the past, the company waited for the construction unit to submit the drawings before compiling it. Due to the short time, it was often compiled unrealistically and became empty words on paper, failing to play its due role. This method determined this year can shorten the time for compiling the construction organization design and overcome the formalism tendency of the construction organization design.

    笨鸟怎样先飞
    ——记哈尔滨市第一建筑工程公司的施工准备工作
    潘国华
    为什么晚一步
    一九五四年十二月，哈尔滨市第一建筑工程公司（以下简称公司）提前完成了一九五四年建设任务后，领导干部就满足于民用建筑方面已有的经验，认为任务完成的还不错。当今年初步确定九万多平方公尺建筑面积任务后，他们认为：“任务小，吃不饱”，因而就强调“任务没有最后肯定，准备工作条件不具备”；“任务没有正式下达，下达后再进行也赶得上！”
    正因为这样，在党委会第一次研究施工准备工作时，仅决定由党委办公室副主任负责领导；行政在布置新年前后工作时，也未将准备工作列入。施工科共有十九名干部，就抽出十五名编写冬训教材；财务科长说：“现在财务总结和决算工作就够忙一阵，施工准备工作领导上还没指示，计划科也没有给指标，究竟怎样干法还不明确。”工会是集中力量总结去年工会工作，工会主席说：“没有人力做准备工作，再说春节快到了，春节活动还得动手做。”
    在这种情况下，别的单位已整顿了施工队伍，着手编制了一九五五年年度技术施工财务计划，而他们还没有考虑。
    关键在哪里
    新年后，中共哈尔滨市委召开了基本建设部门负责干部会议，动员做好施工准备工作。市委基本建设部负责同志在报告中严厉批判了去年某些单位由于没有认真做好准备工作，国家计划完成的很不全面，质量事故不断发生，成本超支，严重浪费了国家资金的现象，并指出这种现象今年绝不允许继续产生。因此要做好准备工作，首先要端正领导干部认识，克服目前在相当一部分干部中存在的盲目乐观，消极等待思想情绪……。公司党委书记刘之乐同志听到了这些话后，心里有些不安，他回过头来向坐在他后面的公司党委办公室副主任张延和说：“老张，你听见没有？”
      “听见了。”
      “这是批评咱们呢！”
    张副主任点点头。
    会后，公司党委根据市委指示并结合公司具体情况，认为要想立即全面做好准备工作，首先就必须批判盲目自满情绪。盲目自满情绪主要表现在过高估计了去年成绩。因此首先就通过检查去年工作，开展了批评与自我批评。经过了开展批评、认真检查后，干部认识到去年完成的计划不全面，先后发生了一百二十四次质量事故，其中八十四次是由于技术指导错误而造成的；降低成本工作做得不好，仅材料浪费一项即达七亿二千多万元（旧币，下同）；安全事故发生了四百五十二次，其中承包哈尔滨糖厂复建工程的第四工程队，就发生了大小事故一百零二次。全年施工不均衡，月月完不成作业计划的现象很普遍，造成严重浪费。从四月到十一月的初步统计，因窝工、停工就浪费了三万七千多个工时，折算金额达九亿四千多万元。某些领导干部知道了这种情形后，盲目自满情绪开始受到了打击。
    但是，今年“任务小，吃不饱”的情绪还没有彻底克服。公司党委针对这种思想组织领导干部分析了今年建设任务特点。这时，大家才大吃一惊：认为“羊圈里蹦出一条驴来”，民用建筑工程内容已起了很大变化。大型、高层建筑增加，哈尔滨外国语专科学校和省人民政府办公厅大楼等工程，每一栋都在一万平方公尺以上，工程结构复杂，混合结构比重增加，占全部工程的百分之八十七点七六。这无论在施工管理、施工方法方面，都增加许多困难，因此，今年的任务“不是小，吃不饱”，而是更加艰巨和复杂了。
    盲目自满情绪初步克服后，有些领导干部又提出，既然今年任务大，可是到现在条件都不具备，怎样办呢？党委又进一步组织科级以上干部，分析了去年任务完成不好的主要原因，是准备工作没做好，准备工作之所以没做好，是思想方法不对头，把准备工作好坏理解为只由客观条件来决定，认为：“你给图纸、材料、钱，我有人就可以施工。”结果呢？条件都有了，却没有按社会主义经营方针、管理原则组织起来，结果很多工地盲目开工后，曾一度在部分工地出现混乱局面。大家认为：既然了解去年完成任务不好的原因，今年任务又异常繁重，就应当是：“笨鸟先飞”。
    如何先走一步
    经过了一系列的思想教育后，大家认识到当前施工技术力量不足，还是一只“笨鸟”，必须先飞，才能全面完成今年任务。但是，究竟怎样先飞呢？大家认为必须在某些条件欠缺情况下，做好准备工作的准备。
    国家建设任务指标下达后，他们仅知道哪几个建设单位，还不知道工程具体内容，如不及早了解，就会妨碍一系列准备工作的进行。“怎么办呢？”于是他们采取了“找上门去”的方法，主动跟各建设单位联系，动员了十几名干部，经过了四天时间，跑遍了二十一个发包单位，摸清了全部工程内容，给制订今年建设计划，安排施工程序，创造了条件，同时也帮助、督促了建设单位。黑龙江省对外贸易局今年第一次进行基本建设，还不很了解基本建设全部科学知识和程序，因而准备工作进行得混乱，什么工作都没有头绪。公司计划科吴平同志去了二次，帮助他们具体研究了工作，他们感到帮助很大，经过十几天后，已初步确定了地址，决定采用标准设计，结果准备工作进行很顺利。
    工程内容知道后，但建设单位还不能迅速提出图纸，因而预算不能编制，又阻碍了准备工作进行。公司领导上认为：几年来，所以做不好经济核算，作业计划编制不准确，施工管理混乱，就是因为没有预算，领导对工程心中没数所造成的。同时，编制预算也确实复杂、艰苦，需要很长时间，历年都处于边作预算、边施工，甚至工程已完工预算还提不出来的状态。公司为了改变这种被动局面，领导上动员了施工科原志超、毕建明、胡顺生同志，让他们在一定的时间内研究出一种简便而又迅速的编预算方法。他们经过了两个星期，提出一种快速预算方法，能在图纸提出后一周内将工程预算提出。
    当建设单位还不能提出图纸，工程预算还不能编制的时候，公司就根据几年来在民用建筑方面的经验，搜集多方面的资料加以研究，特别是学习了国家直营建筑企业这方面的经验，将民用建筑分为几种类型，编制了“施工组织设计提纲”，拟订了
  “编制施工组织设计暂行条例”。这样工地在未接到图纸前，即可先行编制部分，待图纸提出后，即可根据提纲条例，在很短时间内编制出完整可行的施工组织设计。
    施工组织设计本来是加强计划管理、组织有节奏均衡施工，指导现场布置的重要文件。但是，往年公司都在等待建设单位提出图纸后才进行编制，由于时间短促，常常编制得不切实，成为纸上空文，不能起到应有的作用。今年确定的这种方法，就能够缩短编制施工组织设计时间，克服施工组织设计的形式主义偏向。
