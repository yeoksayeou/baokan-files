Why Leave a University Graduate Idle?
Zhang Licheng

I am a graduate of the Pediatric Department of Dalian Medical College. It has been five months since I was assigned a job, but I still have no work to do. I have repeatedly asked the responsible comrades in my department for work, but the problem has not been resolved, and I have received a lot of criticism instead. Since being transferred to Beijing on February 13th, I have become a national cadre who only receives a salary without any actual work.

I left school on October 15, 1954, and went to the Electrical Installation Engineering Company affiliated with the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. Fortunately, I was quickly assigned to work in the internal medicine clinic of the health center. However, I soon realized that I seemed to have been assigned to the wrong place. I was assigned to a place that didn't urgently need a pediatrician. I only saw one or two children a day, and sometimes I had no work at all. Li, the director of the health center, told me that this is a capital construction department with high mobility and is very scattered. Employees cannot bring their families, so there are not many families and naturally fewer children. I thought that I was a pediatrician painstakingly trained by the state. Currently, when pediatricians are extremely scarce, I should go to places with more children and not be idle here. To carefully solve this problem, I asked a classmate from my alma mater to inquire with the school about how to handle this issue. At this time, the company was preparing to launch a political movement. Since I had little medical work, I devoted my energy to the political movement, attending meetings and writing slogans every day. I believed that my work problem would be resolved after the movement, and I firmly believed that the country needed me to do more work.

One day, the health center held a meeting to discuss the staffing of the health center. I raised my opinion for the first time at the meeting: I suggested that the company's health center consider not setting up a pediatrics department temporarily, and asked the company not to think that since a pediatrician has been assigned, it must be included in the establishment. At the same time, I reminded the director that doing so would easily lead to the accumulation and waste of talent. However, the director ignored my opinion and still wrote out the original list of health center personnel and expanded the establishment, requesting additional cadres. I could see that I was going to be stuck here.

After the political movement ended, I formally submitted a written opinion to the organization, requesting a solution to my work problem. Unfortunately, it coincided with the end of the project, and the company was preparing to relocate. Since those who moved with the company were all workers, and there were not many family members, I, a nurse, and a midwife were left in place to form a health station, providing medical services for the sixty or seventy households of family members and dozens of aftercare staff who had not moved. Wang, the chief of the personnel section, comforted me before leaving: "The company did not request to transfer a pediatrician. Since the bureau assigned you to us, that's good. We will never let you work like this. We will definitely find a way to solve it for you. However, this needs to be discussed with other leaders, and we will give you an answer before December 10th."

The company moved away on November 23rd. I stayed in place. Although I didn't only treat children, and did some other work, there were not many remaining staff and very few patients. The situation in the local brother companies was the same. They left a very small number of family members and set up a separate health station, equipped with several doctors and nurses. We have repeatedly suggested that since several companies are constructing on the same construction site, the medical organizations should be unified. If the medical equipment of Party A is more complete, it should help Party B. If each company does its own thing, I don't know how much manpower will be wasted. However, the leaders always say that we don't understand the situation. And they emphasized: "It won't work to be together." I can't understand: These factories and companies are all under the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, why can't they help each other? Why do they only care about themselves and not the overall situation? December 10th passed, and I still hadn't received a letter from the chief of the personnel section. I wrote a letter to inquire, but there was no result. What should I do if I remain idle? I told Zhou, the director of the remaining staff office, what I was thinking and my opinions, hoping that he could help me solve the work problem. However, he criticized my ideas, saying: "Precisely because the capital construction of heavy industry is very important, capital construction departments also need pediatricians." He also questioned me: "According to your statement, that is to say that capital construction departments cannot have pediatricians, then, should the children here die!" I was very dissatisfied with this statement. I felt that it was not that I wanted to distinguish between capital construction departments and non-capital construction departments. I was saying that from the perspective of the national situation, pediatricians are very scarce, and pediatricians should meet the needs of work to the greatest extent, that is, to treat more children. Moreover, the local hospitals also have pediatricians, and capital construction departments can sign contracts with these hospitals. Children's medical care is not completely without guarantee. Finally, Director Zhou said: "I don't care what point of view you are starting from, or what ideology you belong to, I think: Ultimately, you have some personal plans." He also cited many examples to prove my individualism, hoping that I would make a self-criticism. At the group meeting the next day, he also thought that my ideological problem was serious.

Half a month later, the leadership informed me that if I could properly solve the medical problems of the family members and staff of the remaining staff office, I could immediately leave the original place and go to a new construction site to work. According to this instruction, I signed a medical contract with the local factory and mine health centers, ended the work, and transferred to a new construction site on January 2nd of this year. After arriving at the new construction site, the situation was even worse. There was still not much work, and I felt very depressed. I discussed it with the chief of the personnel section several times, and he said that the company had agreed to transfer me to a suitable place and had written a report to the bureau, but because the company's leadership relationship had changed, it was now under the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and this unit was newly established and busy, so there was no reply for a long time. I had to wait again.

After another month and a half, the chief of the personnel section notified me that the bureau had agreed to transfer me to work in Beijing. But when I went to complete the formalities the next day, he changed his mind and said that the manager did not allow me to leave. The chief of the personnel section emphasized: "Now the manager decides everything. If he doesn't allow you to leave, you can't leave." Before I could say anything, he hurried away, just asking me to go back and think about it.

What did he want me to think about? I have had no work for four months. If in a position that urgently needs a pediatrician, I could see at least forty sick children in the clinic every day. In four months, a total of more than four thousand eight hundred sick children would have the opportunity to be treated; in the ward, managing beds, nearly a thousand critically ill children would receive appropriate care. I decided to go to the manager again. The first day I met Manager Yang, he affirmed: "We do not agree with you leaving, the reason is that the company will need pediatricians in the future." I said:
"Cadres should be used in places where they are urgently needed. If the company really needs pediatricians in the future, the company can ask the bureau to transfer them again. Now that the bureau is transferring me, I think there must be a place that needs me more urgently than our company." Manager Yang did not consider my opinion, saying: "If the bureau lacks doctors, they can find a way themselves, we don't need to consider it. A doctor should clearly define the service objects, there are enough doctors in the city." He also said: "The workers in the capital construction department should be well taken care of." His meaning seemed to be that my request for work was to go to the city. I couldn't help but ask: Is leaving a doctor idle taking care of the workers?

The first day's conversation had no result. The next day I went to Manager He again, and he answered more simply and clearly: "If the manager doesn't allow you to leave, you can't leave. You should obey the organizational assignment." When I continued to offer my opinions, Manager He said: "Our company would rather pay you a salary every month and let you wait!" I really don't understand, salary is the reward for labor, why do you want me to take a salary for doing no work? Finally, while he insisted that I was not at ease working in the company, he agreed that I could leave. Before leaving, the chief of the personnel section asked me: "What, you still can't understand, you must leave?" Yes, I really can't understand, medical cadres are so scarce, why don't you let me work?

I set off on February 13th to report to the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in Beijing. After arriving in Beijing, the cadre department sent me to the administrative department, preparing to assign me to work in the soon-to-be-established health room, but I encountered new changes. The health room was not established, and the work designated for me was gone. The cadre department wanted me to stay in the health department for a period of time and then talk about it. How long will I stay? It has been five months since I graduated, and it has been more than half a year since I left the hospital and actually worked. A student who has just left school originally does not have enough practical experience. If I remain idle, everything will be neglected. How can I work at that time? Our country has very few pediatricians. I cannot be idle, and I should not be idle. I ask to be assigned to a place that needs pediatricians. However, Wang, the director of the health department, said: "Since you have come to the industrial sector, it is impossible to be assigned out again. We will also need pediatricians in the future. Don't see the needs of the country too narrowly. Your work problem can only be considered and resolved within the scope of this department." I asked him not to draw such a deep line between the country and this unit. He said: "In the current situation of cadre shortage, this line is inevitable. We can't control the needs of others, just like no one will help us with the health work of our bureau." I really don't understand: my request for work and obedience to the overall needs of the country is seeing the problem too narrowly, while only considering the interests of this unit, disregarding the needs of the country, and intentionally accumulating and wasting cadres is far-sighted!

I would like to ask the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the affiliated Electrical Installation Engineering Company: Why do you have to hold on to cadres that you do not currently need?

    为什么让一个高等学校毕业生闲着
    张励成
    我是大连医学院小儿科本科毕业生，分配工作已经五个月了，但到现在还没有什么工作。我曾多次向本部门的负责同志要求工作，但问题始终没有得到解决，反而受了不少批评。从二月十三日调来北京后，我更成了个只拿薪金没有实际工作的国家干部。
    我是一九五四年十月十五日离校到重工业部有色金属工业管理局所属电气安装工程公司的。很幸运，我很快被分配到卫生所内科诊察室工作。可是，很快地我又发现我似乎被分配错了，我被分配到一个并不迫切需要儿科医生的地方。我每天只给一两个孩子看病，有时完全没有工作。卫生所李所长告诉我说：这里是一个基本建设部门，流动性大而且很分散，职工们不可能都带家眷，家属不多，孩子自然就少了。我想到我是国家辛辛苦苦培养出来的儿科医生，目前，在儿科医生极端缺少的情况下，我应当到孩子多的地方去，不应当在这里闲呆下去。为了慎重地解决这个问题，我请母校同学代我请示学校，应该怎样处理这个问题。这时，公司里正准备开展一次政治运动。由于我的医疗工作少，我就把精力用在搞政治运动上，每天开会，写标语。我相信在运动结束后，我的工作问题是会得到解决的，我坚信国家是需要我作更多的工作的。
    一天，卫生所开会研究卫生所人员编制问题。我在会上第一次提出了自己的意见：建议公司卫生所考虑暂时不设小儿科，并要求公司从实际出发，不要认为儿科医生已经分配来了，就一定要放在编制以内。同时还提醒所长说：这样作，很容易造成人材的积压和浪费。但是，所长没有理会我的意见，仍旧写好卫生所原有人员名单，并扩大了编制，要求增加干部。眼看着我将被积压在这里了。
    政治运动结束后，我向组织方面正式提出了书面意见，要求解决我的工作问题。事不凑巧，又碰到工程正告结束，公司准备迁移。由于随公司转移的都是工人，家属不多，我和一位护士、一位助产士被留在原地成立保健站，为未迁走的六七十户家属和几十名善后工作人员做医疗工作。人事科王科长临走时安慰我说：“公司并没有要求调配儿科医生，既然局里把你分配到我们这里来了，也很好，我们决不会让你这样工作下去，我们一定替你想办法解决。不过，这还要和其他领导同志商量，十二月十日前再给你回答。”
    公司在十一月二十三日迁走了。我留在原地，虽然不单是给小孩看病，也做一些其它的工作，但留守人员不多，病人很少。在当地的几个兄弟公司的情况也是一样，留有极少数家属，就单独成立了一个保健站，配备几个大夫、护士。我们曾经几次提出，几个公司在一个工地交错施工，医疗组织就应当统一起来，如果甲方的医疗设备比较齐全，就应当帮助乙方。如果每个公司都是各自搞一套，不知要浪费多少人力。但是，领导同志总说我们不了解情况。并强调说：“在一起是搞不好的。”我想不通：这些厂矿、公司都属重工业部领导，为什么不能互相帮助？为什么都只管自己而不管整体？　　十二月十日过了，还没有见到人事科长的来信。写信去催问也没有结果。闲下去又怎么办呢？我把我所想的事情和意见都告诉了留守处周主任，希望他能帮我解决工作问题。但是，他对我的想法作了批判，说：“正因为重工业的基本建设非常重要，所以基本建设部门也需要儿科医生。”同时质问我：“照你的说法，那就是说基本建设部门不能有小儿科医生，那么，这里的孩子就该死啦！”我听了这话很不满意，我觉得并不是我要去分别基本建设部门和非基本建设部门，我是说，从全国的情况来看，儿科医生十分缺乏，儿科医生应当在最大限度上满足工作的需要，也就是要为更多的孩子看病。况且，当地医院也有儿科医生，基本建设部门都可以和这些医院订立合同。孩子们看病并不是完全得不到保证的。最后，周主任说：“我不管你是从什么观点出发，或者是属于什么主义，我认为：归根结柢你是有些个人打算。”他还举了许多例子，证明我的个人主义，希望我作一次检查。在第二天的小组会上，他还认为我思想问题严重。
    半个月以后，领导方面通知我说，假若我能妥善地解决留守处的家属和职工的医疗问题，立刻就可以离开原地到新的施工地点去工作。根据这个指示，我和当地的厂矿卫生所订立了医疗合同，结束了工作，就在今年一月二日转移到新的施工地点。到了新施工地点后，情况更糟，工作仍然不多，内心感到非常苦闷。几次和人事科长商量，他都说公司已同意把我调到一个合适的地方，并已向局里写了报告，可是，由于公司的领导关系有了改变，改属重工业部建筑局，而这个单位又是刚刚成立的，工作较忙，所以很久没有回信。我又只好等着。
      又过了一个半月，人事科长通知我，局里同意调我到北京工作。但当我第二天去办理手续时，却又改口说经理不准我走。人事科长并着重地说：“现在经理决定一切，他不准走，就不能走。”我还没有来得及说话，他就匆匆地走开了，只是让我回去考虑。
    要我考虑什么呢？我已经四个月没有什么工作了。如果在一个迫切需要儿科医生的岗位上，每天门诊至少可以看四十个病儿，四个月合计就有四千八百多个病儿有了治疗的机会；在病房管理病床，也会有近千个重病的孩子得到适当的护理。我决定再去找经理。第一天见着了杨经理，他肯定地说：“我们不同意你走，理由是公司将来需要儿科医生。”我说：
  “干部应当用在迫切需要的地方，假若公司将来确实需要儿科医生，那时候公司可以再向局里要求调配。现在局里来调我，我想一定有一个地方比我们公司需要得更迫切一些。”杨经理并不考虑我的意见，说：“局里缺医生他们自己可以想办法，不用我们考虑。一个医生应当明确服务对象，城里的医生够多了。”又说：“基本建设部门的工人应当好好照顾。”他的意思好像是说我要求工作就是要到城市去。我不禁想问一句：难道闲着一个医生是对工人的照顾吗？
    第一天的谈话没有结果。第二天我又去找何经理，他回答得更简单明确：“经理不准走，就不准走。应该服从组织分配。”当我继续提出意见时，何经理却说：“我们公司宁愿每个月给你薪金，让你等着嘛！”我真不懂，薪金是劳动的报酬，为什么要我不做工作白拿薪金呢？最后他一面硬说我不安心在公司工作，一面却又答应我走了。临行之前，人事科长问我：“怎么，你还想不通，一定要走？”是的，我真想不通，医务干部那么缺乏，为什么不让我去工作呢？
    我在二月十三日启程来北京重工业部建筑局报到。到北京后，干部处把我送到行政处，准备分配到即将成立的保健室工作，但又遇到了新的变化，保健室不成立了，指定给我的工作也没有了，干部处要我先到卫生处呆一个时期再说。究竟呆到什么时候呢？毕业至今五个月了，离开医院实际工作已半年多了，一个刚离开学校的学生，实际经验本来就不够，再闲呆下去，一切都荒疏了，到那时怎能再工作呢？我们国家的儿科医生很少，我不能闲着，而且也不应该闲着，我要求把我分配到需要儿科医生的地方去。但是，卫生处王处长却说：“既然来到了工业部门，想再分配出去是不可能的了。我们将来也需要儿科医生。你不要把国家需要看得太狭窄。你的工作问题只能在本部门范围以内考虑解决。”我要求他不要在国家和本单位之间划一条那么深的界线。他却说：“在目前干部缺少的情况下，这种界线是不可避免的。我们管不了别人的需要，就像我们局里的卫生工作不会有别人帮着搞一样。”我真不明白：我要求工作，服从国家整体需要是看问题太狭窄，而只考虑本单位的利益，不顾国家需要，有意积压和浪费干部却是眼光远大！
    我想请问重工业部建筑局和所属电气安装工程公司：为什么要把自己目前并不需要的干部硬扣着不放呢？
