Tsinghua University Launches Motorcycle Sports Activities

    Every physical exercise period, sixty students from Tsinghua University take turns driving motorcycles around the Tsinghua campus. Among them, more than a dozen are preparing for examinations to obtain government driver's licenses, planning to take long-distance motorcycle trips during the spring break.
    The students participating in this semester's motorcycle training class at Tsinghua University are all students with excellent performance in the "Prepared for Labor and Defense" physical training system. They are diligently learning the principles and driving skills of motorcycles. In the final stage of their learning, they are required to perform complex actions such as driving on narrow roads, weaving through poles, and starting on sandy ground and slopes. With the assistance of the Central National Defense Sports Club, Tsinghua University has had more than eighty students and fourteen teachers participate in motorcycle training classes. Students from the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing, Department of Electrical Engineering, and Department of Power Machinery have also participated in the maintenance of the motorcycles.

    清华大学开展摩托车体育活动
    每当体育锻炼的时间，在清华园内有六十名清华大学的学生轮流驾驶着摩托车驰骋着。其中有十几个人正准备参加考试，取得政府的驾驶执照，计划在春假期间驾驶摩托车作长途旅行。
    参加清华大学这学期举办的摩托车学习班学习的都是“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度锻炼中成绩优良的学生。他们用心地学习着机车的原理和驾驶技巧。在学习的最后阶段，他们要求能作小路驾驶、穿竿、沙地和坡上起车等繁复的动作。清华大学在中央国防体育俱乐部的协助下，已有八十多个学生和十四个教师参加过摩托车学习班。机械制造系、电机工程系、动力机械系有的学生还参加了机车的保修工作。（新华社）
