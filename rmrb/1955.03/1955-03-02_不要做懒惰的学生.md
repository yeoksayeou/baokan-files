Don't Be a Lazy Student
Kong Sang

There is no doubt that we must conscientiously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in our industrial construction. Especially in the construction of complex, modern, and important projects, it is almost impossible to move forward without learning from the Soviet Union.

However, learning is not equal to formal, mechanical application. Real learning requires using one's brain. No matter what advanced Soviet experience it is, no matter what measure is proposed by Soviet experts, we must understand why it is done this way, under what circumstances and conditions it was proposed, and so on. In short, we must integrate it with the actual situation and repeatedly ponder it before we can thoroughly understand it, turn Soviet experience into our own knowledge, and ensure that it will not be distorted during implementation. Otherwise, we will not be able to do things without the specific guidance of Soviet experts; and often, we will do things badly, and good experiences will have bad results.

For example, in the reconstruction project of the Shenyang Wire Factory, because the information we provided was insufficient, the Soviet Union used foam glass as the roof insulation layer when designing for us. In the Soviet Union, foam glass is made of broken glass and is very cheap. But in our country, foam glass has just been successfully trial-produced, and the cost is very high. The personnel building the Shenyang Wire Factory did not study and understand its essence, which runs through the spirit of economic accounting. Instead, they mechanically implemented this regulation without proposing reasonable suggestions for modification based on China's actual situation. As a result, the construction of the factory building cost more than 12 billion old yuan. For another example, the Soviet Union designed the carpentry workshop and auxiliary workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant for us, and used hexagonal wooden blocks to pave the floor. The Soviet Union made this kind of floor by using small pieces of wood, so the cost was very low. However, when the construction personnel of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant implemented this measure, they used large pieces of finished timber. As a result, the material yield rate was only 19%, which cost a lot of effort and wasted more than 2,400 cubic meters of wood.

This phenomenon is not isolated at present. In the process of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, there are still many people who do not like to use their brains. Regardless of the actual situation here and the economic effect of implementing this measure, they copy it from Soviet books and move it from other places. They are full of righteous words, as if they are the most determined to learn from the Soviet Union; in fact, they are just covering up their laziness. Because, copying without changing a single detail is indeed the easiest path to take.

We do not need such lazy students. Because this kind of learning attitude not only hinders us from truly mastering the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also distorts and damages the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, causing major and minor mistakes and harms to our construction cause.

    不要做懒惰的学生
    孔桑
    我们在工业建设当中，必须认真学习苏联的先进经验，这是毫无疑问的。特别是建设复杂的近代化的重要工程，如果不学习苏联，几乎可以说是寸步难行。
    但是，学习并不等于形式地机械搬用。真正的学习是要用脑子的。不论是那一项苏联先进经验，不论是苏联专家提出的那一项措施，都必须弄懂为什么要这样做，这是在什么情况和条件下提出来的，等等。总之，必须联系实际情况，反复琢磨，才能够融会贯通，把苏联经验变成自己的学问，并保证在执行中间不至于走样。否则，离开了苏联专家的具体指导就不能做事；而且往往会把事情做坏，使好经验收到坏效果。
    例如，沈阳电线厂的改建工程，由于我们提供的资料不够，苏联代我们设计时采用了泡沫玻璃做屋面防寒层。在苏联，泡沫玻璃是碎玻璃做的，很便宜。但在我国，泡沫玻璃刚刚试制成功，成本很高。建设沈阳电线厂的人员在接到这个设计文件后，没有钻研领会它那贯串着经济核算精神的实质，根据我国的实际情况提出合理的修改建议，而是机械地执行了这项规定。结果使厂房的建筑多花了旧币一百二十多亿元。又如苏联代我们设计的第一汽车制造厂的木工场和辅助工场，采用了六角木块来铺砌地板。苏联做这种地板是利用零星的小木头，所以成本很低。但是第一汽车制造厂的建设人员在执行这项措施时却是用大块的成材来做。结果出材率只有百分之十九，多费了很多功夫，还浪费了二千四百多立方公尺的木材。
    这种现象在目前并不是个别的。在学习苏联先进经验当中，还有很多这样的不大喜欢动脑子的人。他们不管自己这里的实际情况如何，执行这项措施的经济效果怎样，就照样从苏联的书籍上抄来，照样从别的地方搬来。他们嘴里振振有辞，好像他们学习苏联是最坚决的；实际上不过是掩盖了自己的懒惰。因为，丝纹不动地照搬，究竟是最好走的路。
    我们不需要这样懒惰的学生。因为这样的学习态度不仅阻碍着我们真正地掌握苏联的先进经验，而且适足以歪曲和损害苏联的先进经验，给我们的建设事业造成大大小小的错误和危害。
