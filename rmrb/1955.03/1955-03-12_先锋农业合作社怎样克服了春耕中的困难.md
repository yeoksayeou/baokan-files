How the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative Overcame Difficulties in Spring Plowing
By our correspondent Lü Jianzhong

Editor's Note: In the spring plowing production campaign of 1954, the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guowangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, implemented the mass line, overcame various difficulties, and created a set of methods for leading agricultural production. This leadership method has been widely promoted in Henan and is also of reference value to other regions.

In January, the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guowangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, expanded from 26 households to 144 households. Before and after the expansion of the cooperative, the general line education was deeply carried out among the farmers. The members of the cooperative were organized to visit the Yubei Textile Factory and held seminars and get-togethers with the workers. At the same time, on the basis of evaluating yields, livestock, farm tools, and fertilizers, the system of contracting for cultivation and output was initially implemented, and the annual production plan was formulated, production areas were divided, and production teams and production groups were established. The production enthusiasm of the members, especially the poor peasant members (including new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), was very high.

At this time, the Guowangdu Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the resident work team believed that only by getting the current spring plowing production up and running could the production enthusiasm of the members be fully developed, and the emotions of some middle peasants who feared that "the cooperative cadres would not lead production well" and feared that "the cooperative would not be able to handle large-scale operations" could be stabilized.

Just after the Spring Festival, the production teams and groups of the agricultural cooperative began some piecemeal production activities. Team One looked for fertilizer, Team Two checked farm tools, and Team Three calculated seeds. In the dining hall and in the team houses, people were talking about the historical wheat yields, about the lack of snow, the cold spring, and the lack of fertilizer, and about the good or bad geological conditions of each team's land and whether there were difficulties in completing the plan, and so on.

The Guowangdu Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party paid attention to these ordinary and sporadic activities of the masses. They held branch meetings, party members and youth league members meetings, and activist meetings to study the current problems and clearly realized that the lack of farm tools, fertilizers, and seeds, and the strengthening of wheat field management, were the important issues urgently to be solved in carrying out the spring plowing production campaign. However, the newly expanded agricultural cooperative was in a state of chaotic management. No one "knew" how many farm tools, fertilizers, and seeds there were at that time, how many were needed, and how the hundreds of acres of wheat fields that were originally managed separately should be managed. In order to prepare for spring plowing based on the actual situation, the village branch and the agricultural cooperative's committee summarized the piecemeal and spontaneous inspection activities of each team and launched a universal inspection of farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, and wheat field management in each team. The inspection results showed that 1,200 carts of base fertilizer were needed for cotton fields, and the existing coarse fertilizer was 500 carts short, excluding the topdressing required for wheat fields; 8,000 jin of seeds were needed for cotton fields, but only 3,000 jin were available; 1,300 jin of millet, corn, and black bean seeds were also lacking; three carts needed to have their chassis replaced, and more than 130 pieces of manure forks, shovels, hoes, etc., and more than 600 other utensils needed to be added. Wheat seedlings had begun to turn green and needed to be cultivated, watered, and topdressed. Based on the problems identified by the inspection, the agricultural cooperative conducted "four calculations": calculating how much time there was for spring plowing, calculating how much production tasks there were, calculating how much labor and livestock power the entire cooperative had, and calculating how much harvest could be achieved by implementing dense planting of cotton and wheat; and then reviewing and revising the original production plan.

After such inspection and calculation, everyone understood the situation, and the serious lack of preparation for spring plowing surprised the members and overcame their complacency. At the same time, the village branch and the agricultural cooperative also helped the seven newly established mutual aid groups in the village to consolidate, and also used the same method to check the spring plowing preparation work and the difficulties that needed to be solved.

Launching the masses to find out the problems in spring plowing was only the first step. What was more important was how to solve the difficulties found in the inspection.

According to the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative's production increase plan, it would require 60 million yuan in old currency just to add farm tools, purchase fertilizers and seeds in the spring. This was the first major difficulty encountered after the expansion of the agricultural cooperative.

The agricultural cooperative had a large scale and a small foundation. The amount of money that members could take out was also limited, and some wealthy members with surplus money were unwilling to invest.

The Party branch and the cooperative's committee believed that they should still mobilize and rely on the masses to solve this difficulty. They explained to the members the important significance of doing a good job in spring plowing production for supporting national industrial construction and consolidating national defense, and explained through several typical households accounting in detail that only by doing a good job in the cooperative's production and realizing the production increase plan could the members' income be guaranteed and their lives improved, educating everyone to establish the idea of taking the cooperative as their home. On the other hand, they also held meetings to ask everyone to come up with ideas and find solutions. In the discussion, there were many opinions. Some suggested applying for state loans to purchase means of production; some suggested that all the members' farm tools should be evaluated and put into the cooperative; others suggested that it would be best to organize the cooperative's carpenters and blacksmiths to do it themselves, but there were no raw materials. Finally, this proposal touched the youth league member Shi Jinghui. He thought: If we rely on state loans, it will not only increase the burden on the state, but also affect the actual income of the members. He remembered the story of the volunteer soldiers using artillery shell casings to make equipment in the front, and thought that there were still some rusty scrap iron piled under his bed at home. If the scrap iron and wood materials of each member's family were collected, could the cooperative's blacksmiths and carpenters make various farm tools? So he put forward his suggestion to everyone, and this suggestion was immediately approved by everyone and supported by the leadership. As a result, the entire cooperative collected more than 1,200 jin of scrap iron and more than 20 pieces of wood (evaluated and registered by the cooperative), and made more than 600 various farm tools. This alone saved the cooperative 10 million yuan in old currency.

However, the serious economic difficulties faced by the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative had not yet been resolved at this time. The Party branch and the cooperative's committee called on the members to deposit their surplus funds into the credit group and use them for production. In the midst of the vigorous "four checks and four calculations," the middle peasants began to feel that "collective strength is great" and "cooperatives have solutions," but many middle peasants initially took a wait-and-see attitude towards investing in the cooperative.

The poor peasants took the lead. The poor peasant Guo Lianxi was the first to express at the conference that he would deposit all 5 million yuan in old currency obtained from the bonus into the credit group to prepare for investment in the cooperative. The poor peasant Guo Zhenyu also deposited 400,000 yuan in old currency from selling grain into the credit group. As a result, the entire cooperative deposited 27 million yuan in old currency into the credit group, of which 13 million yuan was deposited by poor peasants and new middle peasants, who accounted for less than half of the total number of households in the cooperative.

The township credit cooperative also helped the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative. They signed a contract with the Jinjiatun Credit Cooperative, which had more sufficient funds, to transfer 20 million yuan in old currency to help the Pioneer Cooperative purchase fine fertilizer. The Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative also signed a joint contract with the supply and marketing cooperative. The Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative pre-sold all the surplus grain and cotton to the state according to the plan, and the supply and marketing cooperative supplied the means of production and living materials needed by the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative.

As a result, the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative only borrowed 5 million yuan in old currency from the National Bank, and the financial difficulties were solved.

At the same time, the Party branch and the cooperative's committee continued to mobilize everyone to think of ways to solve the shortage of fertilizer in spring plowing. The members came up with many ways to accumulate fertilizer, such as compressing cotton stalks, accumulating weeds, exchanging old wall soil and kang soil, digging pond mud, manure base, and pen base. At the same time, reasonable methods for grading and pricing and calculating remuneration by the piece were stipulated. All four production teams made guarantees plans, and the rush to accumulate fertilizer was enthusiastically launched by the agricultural cooperative throughout the village. In just a few days, the agricultural cooperative accumulated 800 carts of fertilizer.

Other difficulties were also solved one by one by everyone thinking of ways. For example, the cotton seeds and grain seeds lacking in the cooperative were collected by each household gathering a small amount. In addition, according to the suggestions of the members, the agricultural cooperative also led the entire village to plan to dig more than 3,000 zhang of channels and drainage ditches, and used old bricks and stones to repair more than 90 culverts and small waterway openings. During this period, under the slogan of "Everyone runs the cooperative, everyone loves the cooperative," the members put forward more than 30 suggestions. The two key issues of the lack of coarse fertilizer in the spring and the construction of water conservancy projects have been resolved.

When the spring plowing preparation work was about to be completed, the Party branch held a meeting to study the next stage of production content: strengthening wheat field management and carrying out spring plowing. The Party branch and the cooperative's committee organized more than 50 people, including Party members, youth league members, production team leaders, group leaders, experienced old farmers, accountants, and technicians, to conduct detailed inspections in the fields: checking wheat seedlings; checking soil fertility—soil quality and fertility; checking pests and diseases. Based on the inspection results and climatic conditions, specific measures such as timely shallow hoeing, topdressing, and watering were formulated to ensure that wheat had many ears, large ears, and full grains. In this way, the cooperative's slogan of action changed from "four checks and four calculations" to "three checks and three guarantees."

Based on this inspection, the cooperative comprehensively reviewed and partially revised the production plan, and calculated the labor force of the entire cooperative. At the same time, it organized patriotic production increase competitions, taking the twenty days before the Qingming Festival as a production period, and taking the wheat "three checks and three guarantees" and plowing spring land as the content of the competition in this period, and then mobilized the masses to discuss and implement it. In this way, competitions were launched between teams and teams, groups and groups, and agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Model units, model figures, and advanced deeds appeared, and were spread and praised through allegro, blackboard newspapers, etc. If shortcomings were found, appropriate criticisms were also made.

At the same time, in the production increase competition, the agricultural cooperative also led the mutual aid groups in the entire village to complete the spring plowing plan, and helped the mutual aid groups with insufficient livestock power to plow 40 mu of land. The mutual aid groups affectionately called the agricultural cooperative "elder brother" and wholeheartedly followed the agricultural cooperative.

The production movement centered on mutual assistance and cooperation in the entire village was thus carried out vigorously.

    先锋农业合作社怎样克服了春耕中的困难
    本报记者　吕建中
    编者按：河南省安阳县郭王度村先锋农业生产合作社在一九五四年的春耕生产运动中，贯彻群众路线，克服各种困难，创造了一套领导农业生产的方法。这个领导方法已在河南普遍推广，对其他地区也有参考的价值。一
    河南省安阳县郭王度村先锋农业生产合作社一月间由二十六户扩大到一百四十四户。在扩社前后，对农民深入地进行了总路线教育，组织社员参观了豫北纱厂，同工人举行了座谈、联欢；同时在评产量、评牲畜、评农具、评肥料的基础上，初步贯彻了包耕包产制，制定了全年生产计划，划分了生产区，建立了生产队、生产组等。社员们，尤其是贫农社员（包括原来是贫农的新中农在内）的生产情绪非常高涨。
    这时候，中共郭王度村支部和驻村工作组认为：只有把当前的春耕生产搞起来，才能使社员们的生产积极性得到充分发挥，才能使一部分中农怕“社干部领导不好生产”和怕“社大办不好”的情绪稳定下来。
    春节刚过，农业社的生产队里、组里便开始了一些零碎的生产活动。一队找肥料，二队检查农具，三队计算种籽。饭场上，队屋里，人们在谈论着历年的小麦产量，谈论着雪少、春寒和料肥不足的事情，谈论着每个队的地质好坏和完成计划有没有困难，等等。
    中共郭王度村支部注意到群众这些平常而零星的活动。他们召开了支部会、党团员和积极分子会，研究了目前存在的问题，明确认识到农具、肥料、种籽不足和加强麦田管理，正是开展春耕生产运动急待解决的重要问题。但刚刚扩大的农业社，经营管理混乱，农具、肥料、种籽当时究竟有多少，需要多少，原来都是分散经营的几百亩麦田应该怎样管理，这些情况大家都“不摸底”。为了根据实际情况做好春耕准备，村支部和农业社社务委员会便把各队那些零碎的、带有自发性的检查活动总结起来，发动各队普遍进行查农具、查肥料、查种籽、查麦田管理。检查结果，棉田底肥需要一千二百车，现有的粗肥，除去麦田所需的追肥外，还缺五百车；棉田需要八千斤种籽，现在只有三千斤；谷子、玉米、黑豆种也缺一千三百斤；有三辆马车要换底，还需添置粪叉、锨、锄等一百三十多件，其他用具六百多件。麦苗已开始返青，需要整畦、浇水和追肥。农业社根据检查出的问题，又进行了“四算”：算春耕共有多少时间，算多少生产任务，算全社共有多少劳力和畜力，算实行密植的棉花和小麦能达到多少成收；然后再来审查和修订原来的生产计划。
    经过这样的检查和计算，大家摸了底，春耕生产准备不足的严重情况使社员们大吃一惊，克服了麻痹思想。和这同时，村支部和农业社也帮助全村新成立的七个互助组进行了整顿，也用同样方法检查了春耕准备工作和需要解决的困难问题。二
    发动群众检查出春耕中的问题，仅仅是第一步，更重要的还是怎样解决检查出来的困难问题。
    按照先锋农业生产合作社的增产计划，光春季添置农具、购买肥料和种籽等就需要旧币六千万元，这是农业社扩大后所碰到的第一个大困难。
    农业社摊子大、底子空，社员能够拿出来的钱也是有限的，而且一部分有余钱的富裕社员，还不肯拿钱投资。
    党支部和社务委员会认为，还是应该发动和依靠群众来解决这个困难。他们向社员说明搞好春耕生产对支援国家工业建设和巩固国防的重要意义，并通过几个典型户算细账，说明只有搞好社的生产，实现增产计划，才能保障社员增加收入、改善生活，教育大家树立以社为家的思想。另方面他们又开会让大家出主意，想办法。在讨论当中，大家意见很多。有的提议请求国家贷款购买生产资料；有的提议把社员的农具统统评价入社；也有的提出最好组织社里的木匠铁匠动手自己做，但是没有原料。最后这个提议打动了青年团员施景会。他想：如果依靠国家贷款，不仅加重了国家负担，同时也会影响到社员的实际收入。他想起了志愿军在前方利用炮弹皮做器材的故事，想到自家床底下还堆着一些生了锈的碎铁，要是把每个社员家的零碎废铁和木料都收集起来，不是可以让社里的铁匠、木匠做成各种农具吗？于是他便向大家提出了自己的建议，这个建议立刻就得到大家的赞同和领导上的支持。结果全社共收集了一千二百多斤碎铁和二十多根木料（由社里评价登记），做成了各种大小农具六百多件。仅这一项就节省了社里的开支旧币一千万元。
    然而先锋农业生产合作社所面临的严重的经济困难，这时还没有得到解决。党支部和社务委员会号召社员把余资存入信用小组，用到生产上来。中农在轰轰烈烈的“四查四算”当中，开始感觉到“集体力量大”，“合作社有办法”，但是对于向社里投资，很多中农开始时还是抱着观望的态度。
    贫农出来带了头。贫农郭连喜在大会上第一个表示把分红得来的旧币五百万元全部存到信用组，准备向社投资。贫农郭振玉也把卖粮的旧币四十万元存入信用组。结果，全社存入信用组旧币二千七百万元，其中有一千三百万元是占全社总户数不足一半的贫农、新中农存入的。
    乡里的信用社也帮了先锋农业社的忙。他们同资金比较充足的靳家屯信用社订立合同，调剂来旧币两千万元帮助先锋社购买细肥。先锋农业社又和供销社订了结合合同，先锋农业社按计划预售给国家全部余粮和棉花，供销社则供应先锋农业社所需要的生产资料和生活资料。
    结果先锋农业社只向国家银行贷款旧币五百万元，便解决了资金的困难。
    同时党支部和社务委员会继续发动大家想办法解决春耕中的缺肥困难。社员们想出了好多积肥的门路，如压棉花柴、积杂草，换旧墙土和炕土，挖塘泥、粪底和圈底，同时规定出合理地分等作价、按件计工取酬的办法，四个生产队都订出了保证计划，突击积肥工作便由农业社带动全村热烈地展开了。几天的工夫，光农业社就积了八百多车的肥料。
    其他困难也经过大家想办法，一个一个地解决了。例如社里缺少的棉种和谷种，就是由各户集少成多地收集起来的。另外，根据社员们的建议，农业社还带动全村计划挖渠道和排水沟三千多丈，利用旧砖、石修闸口和小水道口共九十多个。在这一段期间，社员们在“大家办社，大家爱社”的口号下，提出了三十多条建议。春季缺粗肥和兴修水利这两个关键性问题，都解决了。三
    在春耕准备工作快完成时，党支部开会研究了下一段的生产内容：加强麦田管理和进行春耕。党支部和社务委员会组织党团员、生产队长、组长和有经验的老农、会计和技术员等共五十多人，分头到田间进行了细致的检查：查麦苗；查地力——土质和肥瘦；查病虫害。根据检查的结果和气候条件订出了适时浅锄、追肥、浇水等具体办法，保证小麦穗头多，穗头大，籽粒饱。这样，社里的行动口号便由“四查四算”变为“三查三保”。
    根据这样的检查，合作社便把生产计划做了全盘审查和部分修订，并对全社的劳动力进行了核算。同时组织爱国增产竞赛，把清明节前的二十天做为一个生产段落，把小麦“三查三保”和翻犁春地作为这一段的竞赛内容，然后就发动群众讨论贯彻。这样，队和队、组和组、农业社和互助组便展开了竞赛。出现了模范单位、模范人物和先进事迹，就通过快板、黑板报等给以传播、表扬，发现了缺点，也进行适当的批评。
    同时，在增产竞赛中农业社也带动了全村的互助组完成了春耕计划，并帮助牲畜不足的互助组犁了四十亩地，互助组亲切地称农业社为“老大哥”，一心跟着农业社走。
    全村的以互助合作为中心的生产运动，就这样生气勃勃地开展起来了。
