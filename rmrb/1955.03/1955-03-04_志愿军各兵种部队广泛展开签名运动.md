Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 3rd: The various arms and services and units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) have launched widespread propaganda and signature campaigns against the use of atomic weapons. Many organs and companies have held signature rallies against the use of atomic weapons, and cadres and soldiers have signed the "Appeal to the People of the World."

    The soldiers of a certain Volunteer Army unit guarding the Shangganling area held a signature rally on the position. The soldiers of the 5th Company of a certain Volunteer Army unit, which won the collective first-class merit in the summer counterattack in 1953, also sent the signature book to the sentry posts and kitchens, so that the sentries and cooks who were performing their duties also signed. A certain engineering unit of the Volunteer Army participating in the restoration and construction project in Pyongyang also held a signature rally at the construction site, and all cadres and soldiers signed. Zhao Renhu, a commander of a certain Volunteer Army unit who had won first-class merit and a representative of the National People's Congress, said when signing: "We resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons, but we are never afraid of any war. If the American imperialists dare to launch an atomic war, they will surely be wiped out!"

    In the course of the signature campaign, the newspapers and periodicals published by the leadership organs of the Volunteer Army at all levels have successively published articles against the use of atomic weapons. Many commanders and political work cadres have made reports to the vast number of cadres and soldiers on the opposition to the use of atomic weapons. In some organs and company auditoriums and clubs, the "Appeal to the People of the World" and slogans such as "Oppose American imperialism's incitement of atomic war, we must be vigilant and guard the position!" are posted.

    志愿军各兵种部队广泛展开签名运动
    据新华社平壤三日电：中国人民志愿军各兵种、各部队广泛展开反对使用原子武器的宣传和签名活动。很多机关和连队都举行了反对使用原子武器的签名大会，干部和战士都在“告全世界人民书”上签了名。
    守卫在上甘岭地区的志愿军某部战士们在阵地上举行了签名集会。曾在一九五三年夏季反击战中荣立集体一等功的志愿军某部第五连的战士们并把签名簿送到哨位上和伙房里，让那些正在执行任务的哨兵和炊事员们也都签了名。参加平壤市恢复建设工程的志愿军某工兵部队也在工地上举行了签名大会，全体干部和战士都签了名。曾立过一等功的志愿军某部指挥员、全国人民代表大会代表赵仁虎在签名时说：“我们坚决反对使用原子武器，但我们决不怕任何战争。如果美帝国主义胆敢发动原子战争，它们就一定要被消灭干净！”
    在开展签名运动的过程中，志愿军各级领导机关出版的报刊，都陆续登载了反对使用原子武器的文章。许多指挥员和政治工作干部曾分别向广大干部、战士作了关于反对使用原子武器的报告。有些机关和连队的礼堂和俱乐部里，都张贴着“告全世界人民书”以及“反对美帝国主义煽动原子战争，我们要提高警惕，守卫阵地！”等标语。
