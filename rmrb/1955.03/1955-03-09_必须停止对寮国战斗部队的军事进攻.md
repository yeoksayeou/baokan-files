    Military Offensives Against the Laotian Fighting Units Must Stop

    On March 5th, a spokesman for the General Headquarters of the Laotian Fighting Units issued a statement strongly protesting the increasingly severe military offensives by the other side against the Laotian Fighting Units in Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces. The statement solemnly pointed out that armed offensives against the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Units and other related activities that violate the Geneva Accords have created a serious tense situation in Laos, endangering the peace and independence of Laos.

    This statement by the Laotian Fighting Units should attract the close attention of peace-loving people around the world to the situation in this part of the world. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, the Laotian Fighting Units were transferred to the two provinces of Phongsaly and Sam Neua in Laos for assembly, and both sides must cease all hostilities, pending a political solution. As everyone knows, the Laotian Fighting Units have correctly fulfilled the terms of the Geneva Accords, completed the assembly work within the stipulated time, and have been striving for a political solution to domestic problems. However, the other side has repeatedly and seriously violated the Geneva Accords and constantly launched armed offensives. They use this destructive action to respond to the peaceful efforts of the Laotian Fighting Units.

    Facts show that the American aggressor forces are mainly responsible for the current serious situation in Laos. In order to turn Laos into its military aggression base, the United States has planned a series of activities to undermine the Geneva Accords in Laos, including arranging to conclude a military treaty with Laos and attempting to pull it into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. Under the direction and assistance of the United States, from the day of the ceasefire to the beginning of 1955, the other side constantly sent armed bandits to the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Units by means of airdrops and infiltration, attacking the Laotian Fighting Units. During this period, the other side carried out a total of sixty-three attacks, robberies, or massacres against the residents of the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Units. Thirty-one of these were direct attacks on the Laotian Fighting Units. They want to use this to gradually occupy these areas. Recently, the Lao Royal Government has also interrupted the political conference and transferred a considerable number of troops to the Sam Neua border. On March 1st, Lao armed bandits launched another fierce attack on Muong Boun in Sam Neua Province, occupied Muong Boun, and continued to attack Sala. It is very clear that these military actions planned by US imperialism have seriously undermined the effective implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos. If these military actions that violate the Geneva Accords are not stopped in time, the Geneva Accords are in danger of being completely torn up by the US aggressive bloc and its followers. Peace-loving people must be vigilant about this.

    It is especially worth noting that the United States has actually sent a large number of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique remnants to the assembly areas of the Laotian Fighting Units to carry out riots. According to Myanmar's "New Era" report, at the end of January and mid-February, batches of transport planes continued to transport the remnants of the Chiang bandit clique who were wandering in the Ouxi area of Phongsaly Province, Laos, to the Meng Hsin area on the Laos-Myanmar border. These bandits are currently moving to the Meng Kang area within Myanmar, which borders our country, intending to join forces with the remnants of the Chiang bandit clique originally in Myanmar, waiting for an opportunity to flee into our country. It can be seen that the conspiracy activities to undermine the Geneva Accords in Laos, orchestrated by the United States, are also directed against the People's Republic of China. It not only threatens the peace of Laos, but also seriously threatens the security of the People's Republic of China, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. The United States must bear full responsibility for the consequences of these military actions it has planned in Laos.

    The Chinese people fully support the solemn protest put forward by the Laotian Fighting Units in its statement on February 5th. The implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos must be maintained and implemented, all military attacks on the Laotian Fighting Units must be stopped immediately, and the Lao political conference must continue to be held to seek a political solution to the Lao situation that conforms to the Geneva Accords. The French government, as one of the directly related countries, has a special responsibility to take measures to ensure that the demands put forward by the Laotian Fighting Units in its statement are realized. The British government, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, should also fulfill its obligations under the Geneva Accords, stop its policy of condoning the United States' violation of the Geneva Accords, and take measures to stop the United States' serious violation of the Geneva Accords and endangering the peace of Indochina.

### 必须停止对寮国战斗部队的军事进攻

    必须停止对寮国战斗部队的军事进攻
    三月五日，寮国战斗部队总司令部发言人发表声明，强硬抗议对方对桑怒省和丰沙里省寮国战斗部队的日益加甚的军事进攻。声明严正地指出，对寮国战斗部队集结地区的武装进攻和其他相关联的破坏日内瓦协议的活动，已经在老挝造成了严重的紧张局势，危害了老挝的和平和独立。
    寮国战斗部队的这一声明应该引起全世界爱好和平的人们对世界这一部分地区的局势的密切关注。按照日内瓦协议的规定，寮国战斗部队转移至老挝的丰沙里和桑怒两省进行集结，双方必须停止一切敌对行动，等待政治解决。大家知道，寮国战斗部队正确地履行了日内瓦协议的条款，在规定时间内完成了集结工作，并且一直努力求得国内问题的政治解决。但是，对方却一再严重地违反日内瓦协议，不断发动武装进攻。他们用这种破坏行动来回答寮国战斗部队的和平努力。
    事实表明，美国侵略势力是造成老挝目前的严重局势的主要负责者。美国为了把老挝变成它的军事侵略基地，已在老挝策划了一系列破坏日内瓦协议的活动、包括安排同老挝订立军事条约，并企图把它拉进东南亚侵略集团。在美国的指使和协助之下，自从停火的那天起到一九五五年开始的时候为止，对方不断用空投和渗透的办法把武装匪徒派到寮国战斗部队的集结地区，进攻寮国战斗部队。在这个期间，对方总共对寮国战斗部队集结地区居民进行了六十三次袭击，抢劫或屠杀的事件。其中有三十一次是对寮国战斗部队的直接攻击。他们想借此来逐步侵占这些地区。最近，老挝王国政府又中断了政治会议，而调了相当大数量的部队到桑怒边界。三月一日，老挝武装匪徒对桑怒省的芒奔发动了又一次猛攻，占领了芒奔，并继续向萨拉发动进攻。十分明显，美帝国主义策划下的这些军事行动，已严重地破坏了日内瓦协议在老挝境内的有效实施。如果这种违反日内瓦协议的军事行动不及时加以制止，日内瓦协议就有被美国侵略集团及其追随者彻底撕毁的危险。爱好和平人民对此必须提高警惕。
    尤其值得注意的是，美国竟派了大批蒋介石卖国集团残匪到寮国战斗部队集结地区进行暴乱。据缅甸“新时代”报道，在一月末和二月中旬，又不断有大批运输机把流窜在寮国丰沙里省乌西地区的蒋贼集团残匪运到寮国、缅甸边境的孟新地区。这些匪徒目前正向同我国接壤的缅甸境内孟坎地区移动，打算和原在缅境的蒋贼集团残匪会合，伺机窜犯我国国境。由此可见，美国在老挝策动的破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动也是针对着中华人民共和国的。它不仅威胁了老挝的和平，并且也严重地威胁了中华人民共和国的安全，中国人民对此绝对不能容忍。美国必须对它在老挝境内策划的这些军事行动的后果负完全的责任。
    中国人民完全支持寮国战斗部队在二月五日的声明中所提出的严正抗议。必须维护并贯彻日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，立即停止对寮国战斗部队的一切军事攻击，继续举行老挝的政治会议以求得老挝局势符合于日内瓦协议的政治解决。作为直接有关国家之一的法国政府有特别责任采取措施使寮国战斗部队在声明中所提出的要求得以实现。作为日内瓦会议主席之一的英国的政府也应该履行它所承担的日内瓦协议的义务，停止它纵容美国违反日内瓦协议的政策，并采取措施来制止美国在老挝的这种严重违反日内瓦协议和危害印度支那和平的行为。
