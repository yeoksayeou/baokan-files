Column: Oppose the Phenomenon of Wasting State Assets

To the Editor:

Since the establishment of the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station in Jilin, blind operation has resulted in the waste of considerable and useful state assets.

The Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station was established in 1953, initially under the leadership of the former Northeast Administrative Committee Forestry Bureau. It was transferred to the leadership of the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department after the abolition of the Greater Administrative Regions last year. The purpose of establishing this mechanical afforestation experimental station was to conduct mechanical afforestation experiments in the western shelterbelt area, a saline-alkali area seriously affected by wind and sand disasters and with a shortage of labor. The goal was to explore afforestation experiences and pave the way for large-scale mechanical afforestation in the future.

The Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station has not yet gained mature experience in saline-alkali land afforestation experiments, but it blindly used tractors to plow 1,564 hectares of saline-alkali land in Kaitong County. Of the 884 hectares surveyed in the autumn of 1954, only 392 hectares of neutral and slightly alkaline soil were suitable for afforestation, while the rest were heavily alkaline soil, unsuitable for afforestation. If the already plowed 1,564 hectares are calculated with 50% being heavy alkaline soil, then half of the land cannot be afforested. Calculating the plowing cost at 85.12 yuan per hectare, this wastes 66,500 yuan of state funds. At the same time, in the 127 hectares afforested last year, the survival rate was only a little over 36.6% due to insufficiently meticulous technical operation and poor natural conditions.

There was also a situation of blind expansion in the purchase of mechanical equipment, resulting in stockpiling and waste. The Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station originally had two "Nachi" tractors. In the spring of 1954, the Central Ministry of Forestry transferred five "Dete-54" tractors from Hainan Island, and in the autumn, the experimental station bought back four "Stalin-80" tractors from Hainan Island. Shortly after, ten "50-55" tractors ordered from Hungary by the former Northeast Forestry Bureau in 1952 were also allocated. Thus, the station had a total of twenty-one tractors (in addition to fourteen ordered from abroad), but only five were frequently used, with a mechanical utilization rate of about 24% of the total. In addition to this, the experimental station also established a repair shop, spending 43,300 yuan to buy a generator, 12,000 yuan to buy a lathe, and 4,400 yuan to buy a vertical drilling machine (and also ordered mobile tool repair vehicles, automobile cranes, etc. from abroad). These machines have been idle there because no one knows how to operate them.

In China today, where agricultural machinery is in great demand, the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station has left more than ten tractors and other machines idle for a year, wasting useful state assets, which cannot but arouse indignation.

Why did this happen? It is understood that the main reason is that the leaders of the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station are not clear about the afforestation station's guidelines, tasks, and future development direction. At the same time, there is also a mentality of being fond of grandeur and blindly expanding. Therefore, they can neither carry out work based on the actual local conditions, nor can they purchase equipment based on the actual needs and according to the principles of economy, resulting in serious waste. The former Northeast Forestry Bureau's lack of specific guidance and in-depth inspection of the afforestation station's work is also one of the reasons for this situation.

It is hoped that relevant departments will conduct an inspection of the work of the Kaitong Mechanical Afforestation Experimental Station and correct this phenomenon of blind advancement and serious waste.

### 开通机械造林试验站盲目经营浪费严重

专栏：反对浪费国家资财的现象

    开通机械造林试验站盲目经营浪费严重编辑同志：
    吉林开通机械造林试验站成立以来，由于盲目经营，浪费了不少国家有用的资财。
    开通机械造林试验站是一九五三年成立的，当时由前东北行政委员会林业局领导，去年大区行政机构撤销后才划归吉林省林业厅领导。成立这个机械造林试验站的目的，是为了在西部防护林带地区，风砂灾害严重、劳动力不足的盐碱地带进行机械造林试验，摸索造林经验，给今后大量机械造林开辟途径。
    开通机械造林试验站在盐碱地造林试验还没有取得成熟的经验，就盲目地用拖拉机在开通县的大片碱甸子上，翻了一千五百六十四公顷的盐碱地。在一九五四年秋季已经进行调查的八百八十四公顷中，仅有中性和轻碱性的土壤三百九十二公顷可以造林，其余都为重碱土，不适宜造林。如果把已翻的一千五百六十四公顷地按百分之五十的重碱土计算，就有一半土地不能造林。翻地成本每公顷以八十五元一角二分计算，就浪费了国家资金六万六千五百元。同时去年已造林的一百二十七公顷中，由于技术操作不够细致和自然条件不好，成活率只占百分之三十六点六强。
    在机械设备的购置上，也有盲目摆大摊子因而造成积压浪费的情况。开通机械造林试验站原有“那其”拖拉机二台，一九五四年春天，中央林业部又从海南岛拨来五台“德特五四”，秋天试验站又去海南岛买回“斯大林八十号”四台。过了不久，原东北林业局在一九五二年向匈牙利订购的十台“五○—五五”拖拉机也拨来了。这样，这个站就一共有拖拉机二十一台（另外还向国外订了十四台），但经常使用的只有五台，机械利用率约占总数的百分之二十四。除此以外，试验站还成立了一个修理厂，花了四万三千三百元买发电机一台，用一万二千元买镟床一台，用四千四百元买立式钻床一台（还在国外订购了流动工具修理车、汽车起重机等）。这些机器因为没有人会操纵，还一直闲放在那里。
    在我国农业机器非常缺乏的今天，开通机械造林试验站把十多台拖拉机和其他机器干呆了一年，浪费了国家有用的资财，不能不令人感到气愤。
    为什么会造成这种情况呢？据了解，主要是由于开通机械造林试验站领导上对造林站的方针任务和今后的发展方向不明确，同时又存在着好大喜功、盲目摆大摊子的思想。因而他们既不能根据当地的实际情况开展工作，又不能从实际需要出发根据节约的原则购置设备，以致造成严重的浪费。前东北林业局对造林站的工作缺乏具体指导和深入检查，也是造成这种情况的原因之一。
    希望有关部门对开通机械造林试验站的工作作一次检查，并纠正这种盲目冒进，严重浪费的现象。               于殿友　常云亭
