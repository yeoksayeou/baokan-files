    Many Farmers in Liaoning Actively Improve Soil
    Farmers in southern and western Liaoning Province are working hard to improve soil on barren alkaline wasteland, and many agricultural producers' cooperatives have included soil improvement plans in their production plans. In Xinjin County, three to four hundred carts a day are going in groups to Nanda Bay to collect alkaline mud. 141 agricultural producers' cooperatives and some mutual aid teams in the Second District have improved more than 1,100 hectares of sandy soil from last winter to now. Influenced by the cooperatives, farmers in the Eleventh District have also hauled back alkaline mud from the seaside to improve more than 2,500 hectares of soil, which is expected to increase grain production by about 2,500 shi. In Guantun District, Yingkou County, there are more than 370 hectares of alkaline depressions that have historically been unable to retain seedlings, resulting in very low yields. Farmers have hauled more than 10,000 carts of yellow earth onto this alkaline depression. Many cooperatives in Gaiping, Suizhong, Xingcheng and other counties are also using methods such as "sand covering alkali" and "silt to mountain land" to carry out soil improvement work.

    辽宁很多农民积极改良土壤
    辽宁省南部和西部的农民们正在瘠薄碱荒地上紧张进行土壤改良工作，许多农业生产合作社的生产计划里都订有改良土壤的计划。新金县每天有三四百辆大车成群结队地到南大湾地方去起碱泥，二区一百四十一个农业生产合作社和部分互助组，从去冬到现在已改良了沙土一千一百多垧，十一区农民在合作社的影响下，也从海边拉回碱泥改良土壤二千五百余垧，约能增产粮食二千五百石。营口县官屯区有三百七十多垧碱洼地，历年保不住苗，产量很低，农民们已在这块碱洼地上拉上了黄土一万余车。盖平绥中兴城等县不少社亦正采用“砂压碱”“淤土上山地”等办法进行土壤改良工作。  （王文荣）
