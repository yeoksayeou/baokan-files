The Far East has seen a new high tide in the peace movement. The driving force behind this high tide is the widespread support in public opinion for the Five Principles guiding international relations:

	Mutual respect for territorial sovereignty
	Mutual non-aggression
	Mutual non-interference in internal affairs
	Equality and mutual benefit
	Peaceful coexistence

These five principles were first established as part of the Agreement between the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India, signed in April 1954. Two months later, these five principles became the basic content of two joint statements issued by the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma regarding Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese relations. In October 1954, the joint declaration on foreign policy issued by the Soviet Union and China specifically mentioned these five principles. The two countries announced that they would continue to strictly abide by these principles as the basis for their relations with countries in Asia and the Pacific region, as well as other countries.

These statements and declarations are of great historical significance. They set an example for relations in the entire Asian region, making it possible to expand the scope of implementation of the fifth principle – peaceful coexistence.

These contributions to further easing international tensions have been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people everywhere. These contributions have been particularly welcomed throughout Asia, as evidenced by the broad endorsement of social figures and organizations with various different purposes and beliefs. This shows that the Five Principles express in all respects the most cherished aspirations of the people of all countries in Asia.

The spread of these principles in the Far East is a direct and inevitable result of the history of the entire region. The people of our countries have loved each other since ancient times. This closeness is a phenomenon in world relations. It is the result of a long period of peace, during which cultural exchange was full, trade thrived, and deep mutual understanding continued to grow. The history of relations between some countries – such as China and India – has lasted for thousands of years, during which they have never been at war.

In modern times, when the people of the Far East suffered under the domination of Western imperialism, such relations were interrupted a great deal. Only in Japan, where capitalism developed to the peak of monopoly control, did it follow the example of imperialism. Against the interests of the Japanese people, hatred was cultivated as a policy tool. However, even this obstacle could not destroy the fraternal feelings among the peoples of Asian countries. Because we have all experienced, to varying degrees at different times, the suffering and humiliation of colonialism, and because we have always been troubled by a large number of the same problems, including the livelihood of our people, this family-like affection has continued to grow.

In the current period – starting from the First World War and the October Socialist Revolution, which provided the example set by the great Soviet people, especially after the Second World War – many Asian countries have achieved independence. The people of this region, who have long fought for national rights and security, have finally established for themselves an equal position in world affairs.

Today, it is inconceivable that the discussion and handling of issues involving the welfare of the people of Asian countries can proceed without their active and leading participation. It is no longer possible to ignore or suppress the will of hundreds of millions of people, because they are striving to defend the honor of their motherland, and because they are working to break free from the backwardness caused by colonialism in order to contribute to the progress of mankind. On the contrary, this will is the decisive factor in all Asian affairs.

The announcement of the Five Principles immediately became a powerful expression of the will of the people of Asian countries, while illustrating the resurgence of their long-standing fraternal affection. Thanks to this expression of will and mutual trust, the entire situation in the Far East has moved forward.

The Five Principles are the foundation for further development of consultative and negotiation methods. Our deciding on issues of importance to our people ourselves, free from the interference of imperialist interventionists, is what consolidates peace in the vast region. With the new and higher type of relationship that exists between people's democratic countries and socialist countries, and in connection with all forms of peace movements, we have become one of the important factors in promoting the possibility of peaceful coexistence and expanding the base of world peace.

The above very practical exposition of the Five Principles, the above exposition of the favorable relations maintained by the countries in the Far East with different economic and social systems, serves as a warning to those who are bent on playing the tricks of power politics, attempting to divide the region into opposing blocs, and foreshadows the bankruptcy of such conspiracies. The high political awareness of the average person in Asia, more than in any other era in history; the belief of the broad masses in the Five Principles – these facts are political realities, and ignoring them cannot but lead to tragic results. These realities are sufficient to guarantee that the seeds of discord sown by imperialists among the people of Asian countries will inevitably not sprout and grow.

What could illustrate this more clearly than the Manila Conference in September 1954, which was intended to piece together the so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization"? Apart from the three countries that have military treaties with the convener of the conference, the United States, no other major Asian countries participated in the conference. On the contrary, they, along with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, exposed the whole thing. The people of Asian countries correctly condemned this conference for attempting to undermine the results of the Geneva Conference and interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries. They firmly believe that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a military treaty with the "Made in America" label, its main target is China, but it will strike at the welfare of every Asian country.

It was not difficult for the people of Asian countries to reach this conclusion, because in their eyes, the premise of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization itself is a fabrication out of thin air. They are surrounded by the intense anti-communist hysteria that is extremely rampant in the United States today. They are told that "communist aggression" threatens them, which, in more explicit terms, is to make them afraid of the victory of the Chinese people over feudalism and imperialism. The difference between this bewitching statement and the historical and current facts of Asian life is so great, and it is so contrary to the actual situation of the Five Principles jointly determined by the Chinese people, that the result is further exposure of the despicable intentions of the conference.

It is immediately clear that the threat does not come from China, but precisely from the drafters of this treaty, which regards any movement to strive for national independence, to seek land, to seek food, and to seek progress as "subversive"; this treaty grants colonial countries the right to take military action anytime and anywhere they please; this treaty enables American corporations to obtain strategic materials from Southeast Asian countries, while the people therefore receive the reward of being ruled by old-fashioned colonial methods. Obviously, in this entire region, only a small handful of politicians are willing to sign a bill of sale in exchange for this terrible rule of the United States.

Therefore, those who sincerely want to understand the actual situation in Asia have to admit that the Chinese people have not aroused hostility among their neighbors in the slightest. The people of Asian countries only have admiration and pride in the Chinese people, because we have stood up, and no force in the world can bring us down again. The people of Asian countries have seen that in the entire domestic and foreign policy program of the People's Republic of China, in any action we have taken in the five years since the founding of our country, there is nothing that would make people believe the lie on which the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is based. The facts are just the opposite. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and similar actions taken by the United States in this region violate the wishes and ideas of the people of Asian countries so much, and violate the letter and spirit of the Five Principles so much, that American policy has gone bankrupt, and the aggressive bloc behind this policy has been met with distrust and hatred by everyone.

The failure of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization particularly highlights the importance of the achievements of the Geneva Conference in restoring peace in Indochina. This is an example of negotiations based on a common desire to reach an agreement and on the actual situation in Asia. Here, the major Far Eastern countries, especially China and India, were able to exert their legitimate influence with the help of the extremely valuable efforts of the Soviet Union. As a result, despite the negative attitude and obstruction of the American delegation, the national independence of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia was recognized, and peaceful methods were found to resolve the relevant political issues. In essence, this is a victory for the Five Principles, and if the Five Principles are observed, the hope contained in the Geneva Accords can be realized.

However, although the Five Principles are superior to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and although the forces of world peace have the ability to stop the "dirty wars" in Korea and Indochina, the people who defend peace should still remain vigilant and on guard. We know that with each victory gained, the minority of people in the United States who hope for war intensify their conspiracies, and they always want to build an iron ring surrounding the Soviet Union, China, and other people's countries. There are many countries that they have set their sights on recruiting into this iron ring, including Asian countries that are still suffering from imperialist interference and rule. From the intentions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, it can be seen that any attempt by the people of these countries to get rid of this heavy yoke will be used as an excuse to attack them. Therefore, all peace-loving people, since they are striving to build a world without war, have an obligation to express their sympathy and support for all struggles for independence, and have an obligation to demand the widest possible implementation of the Five Principles.

There are situations in the Far East that are prone to ignite the flames of war, and if we do not want these to be exploited by those with aggressive intentions, we must ease these situations. Everyone knows that even many independent Asian countries are still subject to the remnants of imperialist rule. In Indonesia, the West Irian issue has not yet been resolved. Some of India's territory is still occupied by foreign countries. Burma is still being harassed by Kuomintang bandit troops supplied by the United States in the northern regions. The Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan have either already become American military bases or are in the process of becoming American military bases. Korea remains divided, and as the Geneva Conference showed, the United States is still striving to make a negotiated settlement impossible. Japan remains a country in a state of semi-occupation, while it is being rapidly armed. Like West Germany, which is being rearmed, Japan, in the hands of militarists, will become one of the main threats to regional and world security. The United States is still occupying China's territory of Taiwan with military force, and is using its own and Chiang Kai-shek's troops to repeatedly provoke our mainland.

These are urgent issues, and these issues must be resolved by the people of Asian countries in accordance with the Five Principles.

For China, the most pressing issue is the Taiwan issue. If peace in Asia and the world is to be guaranteed, the intolerable acts of piracy and attacks being carried out off our coast must be stopped. The Chinese people have declared that we must undertake this task, and we must liberate our compatriots on that suffering island in order to end this threat to peace.

In this regard, it is necessary to briefly discuss the relationship between liberating Taiwan and advocating the Five Principles. Some foreign commentaries on this issue have tried hard to distort the relationship between the two. These commentaries attempt to make our domestic policy and our foreign policy contradict each other. These commentaries say that we are talking about liberating Taiwan by war. By putting the issue this way, they distort both sides of the matter.

From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, our foreign policy has been based on striving for world peace. We have always been committed to promoting consultation, and this is the case for all differences, whether these differences involve our own issues or those of others. We have helped our neighbors defend their sacred territory and stopped the expansion of a war of aggression. We have always advocated broad trade and cultural exchanges and have carried out broad trade and cultural exchanges, with no exceptions, only requiring that they be conducted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. This is our policy today. This will always be our policy. Taking the lead in publishing the Five Principles is just another action we have taken to strive for peace.

It must be stated here that liberating Taiwan is not a foreign policy issue for the Chinese people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and has been for many centuries, a fact that has been recognized by all fair-minded countries in the world today. It is no different from any other part of our motherland that had to be liberated from the tyranny and corruption of Kuomintang rule in the past. Its liberation is purely an internal affair, and does not involve issues beyond our territorial integrity and the completion of our responsibility for the Chinese revolution. It will be resolved in the way we deem fit, because we can never tolerate interference in our internal affairs. This is completely in line with the Five Principles. The broad support of Asian and world opinion for the liberation of Taiwan is proof of this.

It must be added that the Chinese people will never accept any proposal to "neutralize" or "place under supervision" Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. We believe that these proposals violate our right as a sovereign state to resolve our own problems. We believe that these proposals are an old-fashioned colonial attitude, and the true intention of this attitude is that the United States will continue to occupy Taiwan and use Taiwan as a base for conducting harassment activities. We believe that all of these "solutions" violate the Five Principles, and whether the people who put forward these proposals are sincere or not, they are adding obstacles to peace in the Far East and the world.

The Five Principles are the product of great humanism and high reasoning power. They have been applied to relations between countries that have a majority of humanity. We who advocate these Five Principles know that their influence extends far beyond our borders. There is every reason to believe that the number of people who accept and adhere to these principles will continue to increase. This is indeed something worth striving for by every peace-loving person. If this becomes a reality, the Five Principles can be used to solve many problems, thereby normalizing relations between countries that do not currently enjoy this relationship. With further easing of world tensions, there is every hope and possibility of negotiating a solution to the outstanding issues between East and West, avoiding wars large and small, and allowing countries to decide their own destiny in the way they deem fit.

The Five Principles should be actively embraced by everyone who hopes that the world will use its enormous capabilities and resources to build a pleasant and prosperous life. They declare to all mankind: if the Five Principles are used as the standard of international behavior, people will obtain peace, and people will obtain cooperation and friendship.

### 五大原则

    五大原则
    宋庆龄
    远东已经出现了和平运动的新高潮。这个高潮的动力是舆论普遍赞成指导国际关系的五大原则：
    互相尊重领土主权
    互不侵犯
    互不干涉内政
    平等互利
    和平共处
    这五项原则首先是作为中印两国一九五四年四月间签订的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定的一部分而确定下来的。两个月以后，这五项原则成为中、印、缅三国总理发表的关于中印和中缅关系的两项联合声明中的基本内容。一九五四年十月间，苏联和中国发表的关于外交政策的联合宣言中特别提到这五项原则。两国宣布，它们将继续以严格遵守这些原则作为它们同亚洲和太平洋地区的各个国家以及其他国家的关系的基础。
    这些声明和宣言是有伟大历史意义的。它们为整个亚洲地区的关系树立了榜样，而使得有可能扩大实施第五项原则——和平共处——的范围。
    这些对进一步缓和国际紧张局势的贡献得到各地爱好和平的人们的热烈欢迎。这些贡献在全亚洲特别受到欢迎，具有各种不同目的和信仰的社会人物和组织的广泛赞成就证明了这一点。这表明五项原则在各方面表达了亚洲一切国家人民的最珍视的愿望。
    这些原则在远东传播是整个这个地区的历史的直接和必然的结果。我们这些国家的人民自古以来就彼此相亲相爱。这种亲近是世界关系的一种现象。这是长久的和平时期的结果，在那个时期中，文化有了充分的交流，贸易日益昌盛，彼此之间的深切了解不断增进。一些国家——例如中国和印度——之间的关系史持续了几千年，在这期间它们从来没有发生过战争。
    在现代，当远东各国人民遭受西方帝国主义宰割的时候，这样的关系就打断了不少。只有在日本，那里的资本主义发展到垄断控制的高峰，效法了帝国主义的榜样。违反日本人民的利益，仇恨被当作政策工具而加以培育。然而，就是这种障碍，也不能破坏亚洲各国人民相互的兄弟之情。因为我们都在不同时间经受过不同程度的殖民主义的磨难和羞辱，因为我们都一向为一大堆同样的问题所苦，包括我们人民的生计问题在内，所以，这种亲如家人的感情一直不断而且有了增长。
    在目前这个时期——从第一次世界大战和提供了伟大的苏联人民所树立的榜样的十月社会主义革命开始，尤其是第二次世界大战之后，许多亚洲国家都取得了独立。这一地区的各国人民长期以来在争取民族权利和安全，终于为自己确立了世界事务中的平等地位。
    今天已不可设想，讨论和处理牵涉亚洲各国人民福利的问题可以没有他们积极的和主导的参加。现在已经不再可能忽视或抑压亿万人民的意志，因为他们竭力捍卫祖国的荣誉，因为他们努力摆脱殖民主义所造成的落后状态以求对人类的进步作出贡献。相反，这种意志正是一切亚洲事务中的决定性因素。
    五项原则的宣布，立刻成为亚洲各国人民的意志的有力的表白，同时说明他们之间历史悠久的兄弟之情的再度高涨。由于这种意志和互相信任的表现，整个远东局面向前推进了一步。
    五项原则是协商谈判方法进一步发展的基础。我们不受帝国主义干涉者的干涉而自己决定对我们人民具有重要性的问题，这就是巩固广大地区的和平。有了人民民主国家和社会主义国家之间存在的新型的更高类型的关系，并且同一切形式的和平运动保持着联系，我们已经成为增进和平共处的可能性和扩大世界和平的基地的重要因素之一。
    上述关于五项原则的非常实际的阐述，上述关于远东有着不同经济和社会制度的各国保持这种有利关系的情况的阐述，对于那些一味玩弄强权政治的把戏、企图把这一地区分化成对立的集团的人们，是一个警告，它预示着这种阴谋的破产。亚洲普通人的政治觉悟之高，超过历史上任何其他时代；广大人士相信五项原则，这些事实都是政治实况，如果忽视它们就不能不招致悲惨的结果。这些实况足以保证，帝国主义者播下的在亚洲各国人民中间酿造纷争的种子必然不会发芽生长。
    还有什么东西比一九五四年九月为了要拼凑所谓“东南亚条约联盟”的马尼拉会议更清楚地说明了这一点呢？除了同会议的召集者美国有着军事条约的三个国家之外，没有其他主要的亚洲国家参加这个会议。相反地，它们同中华人民共和国和苏联一起，揭露这全部勾当。亚洲各国人民正确地斥责这次会议企图破坏日内瓦会议的结果和干涉亚洲各国的内政。他们坚决认为东南亚条约组织是一个挂着“美国制”字样的军事条约，它的主要对象是中国，但是它将打击每个亚洲国家的福利。
    亚洲各国人民得到这个结论并不困难，因为在他们看来，东南亚条约组织的前提本身就是一种无中生有的捏造。今日美国国内极为猖獗的激烈反共歇斯底里情绪包围着他们。有人告诉他们，说“共产党侵略”威胁着他们，这句话用更明显的话说，就是要他们害怕中国人民战胜封建主义和帝国主义的胜利。这种蛊惑人的说法同亚洲生活的历史事实和目前事实的相差是如此之远，它同中国人民协力确定的五项原则的实际情况是如此的相反，以致于结果反而是进一步揭露了这个会议的卑鄙的意图。
    马上可以看得很清楚的是，威胁并不来自中国，而恰恰来自这个条约的制订者们，这个条约把任何争取民族独立、谋取土地、谋取食物、谋求进步的运动当成是“颠覆性的”；这个条约赋予殖民国家以趁它们高兴随时随地采取军事行动的权利；这个条约使美国大企业可以获得东南亚各国的战略物资，而人民因此得到的报酬却是将受旧式的殖民地办法的统治。很明显，在这整个地区中，只有一小撮政客才愿意签卖身契来换取这种美国的可怕统治。
    因此，那些诚心诚意要了解亚洲实际情况的人不得不承认中国人民丝毫没有在他们的邻居中间引起敌意。亚洲各国人民心中对中国人民只有钦慕和引以为荣，因为我们已经站起来了，世界上没有任何力量能够再把我们打倒。亚洲各国人民已经看到，在中华人民共和国的整个国内外政策纲领中，在我们立国五年多以来采取的任何行动中，没有丝毫东西足以使人相信东南亚条约组织赖以作为基础的那种谎言。事实恰恰相反。东南亚条约组织和美国在这个地区采取的类似的行动是这样违反了亚洲各国人民的愿望和想法，是这样违反了五项原则的文字和精神，以致美国政策遭到了破产，这个政策背后的侵略集团遭到了所有的人的不信任和憎恨。
    东南亚条约组织的失败格外显出了日内瓦会议在恢复印度支那和平方面的成就的重要性。这是以希望取得协议的共同愿望和亚洲的实际情况为基础的谈判的榜样。在这里，主要的远东国家，特别是中国和印度，在苏联极其有价值的努力的帮助之下，能够发挥它们正当的影响。结果是，尽管美国代表团的消极态度和阻挠，越南、老挝和柬埔寨的民族独立还是得到了承认，并且找到了解决有关的政治问题的和平方法。在实质上，这是五项原则的胜利，如果五项原则得到遵守，就能够实现日内瓦协定中包含的希望。
    但是，尽管五项原则比东南亚条约组织优越，尽管世界和平力量有能力使得朝鲜和印度支那的
  “肮脏战争”停止，保卫和平的人们仍然应当保持警惕和戒备。我们知道，随着每次胜利的获得，美国国内少数希望战争的人们就加紧阴谋活动，他们始终想建立包围苏联、中国和其他人民国家的铁圈。有许多国家被他们看中要网罗到这个铁圈中去，其中就有仍然受着帝国主义干涉和统治的亚洲国家。从东南亚条约组织的用意中可以看出，这些国家的人民想摆脱这种重轭的任何尝试，都会被用来作为向他们进攻的借口。因此，一切爱好和平的人民既然努力建设一个没有战争的世界，就有义务表示他们同情和支持一切争取独立的斗争，就有义务要求尽可能广泛地实施五项原则。
    远东存在着容易燃起战火的局势，假如不想让有着侵略意图的人加以利用，就必须缓和这种局势。大家都知道，甚至于许多独立的亚洲国家也仍然受到残余的帝国主义统治。在印度尼西亚，西伊里安问题还没有解决。印度的领土有一些还是被外国占领着的。缅甸仍然受到北部地区由美国供应的国民党匪军的骚扰。菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦不是已经成为美国的军事基地，就是正在变为美国的军事基地。朝鲜仍然分裂，像日内瓦会议所表明的，美国直到现在还竭力使得谈判解决成为不可能。日本仍然是处于半占领状态的国家，同时正在被迅速地武装起来。像正在重新武装的西德一样，在军国主义分子掌握中，日本将成为对于区域安全和世界安全的主要威胁之一。美国仍然用军事力量占领着中国领土台湾，并且使用着它自己的和蒋介石集团的部队一再向我们大陆挑衅。
    这些问题都是迫切的问题，这些问题必须由亚洲各国人民根据五项原则来解决。
    对中国来说，最当前的问题是台湾问题。如果亚洲和世界的和平要得到保证，必须制止在我国沿海进行的不可容忍的海盗行为和袭击行动。中国人民已经宣布，我们一定担负起这个任务，我们一定要解放那个苦难的岛屿上的同胞以结束这个对和平的威胁。
    在这方面必须简单谈一下解放台湾和主张五项原则之间的关系。对这个问题的某些外国评论竭力要歪曲两者之间的关系。这些评论企图使我们的国内政策和我们的外交政策自相矛盾。这些评论说我们谈论用战争解放台湾。由于把问题说成这样，因此把事情的两方面都歪曲了。
    从中华人民共和国开国那天起，我国的外交政策就以争取世界和平为基础。我们一向致力于促进协商，而且对于一切分歧来说都是这样，不论这些分歧涉及我们自己的问题或是别人的问题。我们曾经帮助我们的邻国保卫他们神圣的领土，制止了一场侵略战争的扩大。我们一向主张广泛的贸易和文化交流而且进行了广泛的贸易和文化交流，没有任何例外，只是要求在平等互利的基础上进行。这是今天我们的政策。这将永远是我们的政策。率先发表五项原则，只是我们争取和平的又一个行动而已。
    在这里必须说明一点：解放台湾不是中国人民的一个外交政策问题。台湾是中国的领土，好多世纪以来一直是如此，这一点已为今天世界上一切明白是非的国家所承认。它和过去必须从国民党的暴政和腐化统治中解放出来的我们祖国的任何其他地方并没有什么不同。它的解放纯粹是一个内政问题，并不牵涉到超出我们的领土完整和完成我们对中国革命的责任以外的问题。它将照我们所认为的那样来解决，因为我们决不能容忍对我们内政的干涉。这是完全符合五项原则的。亚洲和世界舆论广泛地支持解放台湾就是证明。
    必须补充一点，中国人民决不接受使台湾和台湾海峡“中立化”或“置于监督下”的任何建议。我们认为，这些建议侵犯了我们作为一个主权国家来解决我们自己的问题的权利。我们认为这些建议是老式的殖民主义态度，这种态度的真正用意是美国将继续占领台湾和使用台湾作为进行骚扰活动的一个基地。我们认为所有这一切“解决办法”都是违反五项原则的，并且不论提出这些建议的人是否出于诚意，它们都是在对远东和世界和平增加障碍。
    五项原则是伟大的人道精神和高度的推理力的产物。它们已经适用于拥有大多数人类的国家之间的关系。我们提倡这五项原则的人知道它们的影响远远超出我们边界以外。有一切理由可以相信：接受和奉行这些原则的人将继续增加。这的确是值得每个爱好和平的人努力实现的。如果这种情况成为事实的话，五项原则可以被用来解决许多问题，从而将使现在并不享有这种关系的国家之间的关系正常化。随着世界紧张局势进一步缓和，完全有希望和有可能协商解决东西方之间的未决问题，避免大大小小的战争，让各国照它们认为适合的方式自行决定命运。
    五项原则应当得到每一个希望世界把它的巨大能力和资源用于建立一种愉快而繁荣的生活的人的积极拥护。它们向全人类宣布：如果把五项原则作为国际行为的标准的话，人们将获得和平，人们将获得合作和友谊。
