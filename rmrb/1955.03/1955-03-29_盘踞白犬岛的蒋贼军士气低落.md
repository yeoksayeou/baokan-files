Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, March 27th: According to Chiang bandit soldiers Lin Maoxiu and Lin Jingmei, who recently crossed the sea to surrender to our army, the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on White Dog Island off the coast of Fujian are suffering from internal morale breakdown and anxiety. Lin Maoxiu and Lin Jingmei said that the powerful military force displayed by the People's Liberation Army in liberating the islands off the coast of Zhejiang has greatly frightened the Chiang bandit troops trapped on White Dog Island. Recently, Chiang bandit officers have been driving soldiers and island residents day and night to rush to build air-raid shelters and artillery shelters, and have also increased the number of landmines buried on the coast. The night sentry posts of the Chiang bandit troops on the island have also been greatly increased compared to before, and they have also coerced the so-called "Civil Defense Team" composed of island residents to come out and stand guard every night to embolden the soldiers, causing panic throughout the island.

Lin Maoxiu and Lin Jingmei said that the Chiang bandit officers and soldiers on the island, seeing the continuous liberation of Yijiangshan, Dachen, and Nanji Islands, had even lower morale and were more pessimistic about the future, so the phenomenon of alcoholism and drug use to numb their nerves became more common. Recently, the number of opium dens on the island has increased from two to three, and morphine is also sold openly on the island. Some Chiang bandit soldiers suffer from "fear syndrome" and secretly pray every day not to be killed by the People's Liberation Army's artillery.

    盘踞白犬岛的蒋贼军士气低落
    【新华社福建前线二十七日电】据不久前越海向我军投诚的蒋贼军士兵林茂秀、林经梅说，盘踞福建沿海白犬岛的蒋贼军内部士气败坏、惶恐不安。林茂秀和林经梅说，人民解放军在解放浙江沿海岛屿的作战中显示的强大军事威力，使困踞白犬岛的蒋贼军十分惊惧。近来，蒋贼军军官不分昼夜地驱使士兵和岛上居民赶修防空洞、防炮洞，并且在海边增埋地雷。岛上蒋贼军夜间的岗哨，也比以前大大增加了，还胁迫岛上居民组成的所谓“民防队”每夜出来陪伴站岗，给士兵壮胆，弄得全岛惊恐不安。
    林茂秀和林经梅说，岛上的蒋贼军官兵看到一江山、大陈、南麂等岛屿连续被解放，士气更加低落，对前途更加悲观，因此酗酒、吸毒借以麻醉神经的现象更加普遍。最近，岛上的鸦片烟馆已由两个增加到三个，吗啡也在岛上公开出卖。有些蒋贼军士兵患“惊惧症”，每天暗地祷告不要被解放军的大炮打死。
