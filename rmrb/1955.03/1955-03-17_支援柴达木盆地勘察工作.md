    Supporting Exploration Work in the Qaidam Basin

    The transportation departments of Qinghai Province are actively planning to support this year's large-scale resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin.

    The Second Qinghai Provincial Transportation Conference held in February decided to renovate the Qinghai-Tibet Highway from Daotanghe to Golmud, which leads to the Qaidam Basin, to maximize transportation efficiency. It also prepared to rush the construction of the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway from Golmud to Aral (the border area between Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces). Based on the specific situation of Qinghai Province having few heavy-duty trucks, the conference studied ways to fully utilize transportation potential. It stipulated that all freight vehicles in the province (including self-owned trucks of various units) should be uniformly dispatched by the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department, allocating vehicles to specific routes based on the model. Branch roads leading to various counties will organize local people's animal-powered carts and pack animals for transportation, in order to free up more trucks to concentrate on transporting the large quantities of grain, non-staple foods, and various daily necessities needed by the exploration personnel in the Qaidam Basin.

    In order to ensure that the Golmud to Aral section of the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway can be completed and opened to traffic as soon as possible, the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department and the Haixi Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized an inspection team as early as January 20th of this year to conduct on-site surveys. On February 22nd, the Qinghai Provincial Transportation Department dispatched another group of engineering and technical personnel to Xiangride to survey and renovate an important project on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

    支援柴达木盆地勘察工作
    青海省交通部门积极筹划支援柴达木盆地今年大规模的资源勘察工作。
    在二月份举行的青海省第二次交通会议，决定整修通到柴达木盆地的倒淌河到噶尔穆段青藏公路，以发挥运输效能，并准备赶修噶尔穆到阿拉尔
  （青海、新疆两省交界处）段青新公路。这次会议根据青海省载重汽车少的具体情况，研究了充分发挥运输潜力的办法，规定全省所有货运车辆（包括各单位的自用卡车），统一由青海省交通处调度，根据车型，分线定车。通往各县的公路支线，将组织当地人民群众的兽力车和驮畜进行运输，以便腾出更多的汽车，集中运输柴达木盆地勘察工作人员需要的大批粮食、副食品和各种日用百货。
    为了使青新公路噶尔穆到阿拉尔段能及早修好通车，青海省交通处和中共海西地方委员会早在今年一月二十日就组织视察组到现场进行了踏测。二月二十二日，青海省交通处又派出一批工程技术人员，前往香日得去勘测整修青藏公路上的一个重要工程。　（新华社）
