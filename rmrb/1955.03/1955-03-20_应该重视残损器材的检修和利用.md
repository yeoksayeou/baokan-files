    Should Emphasize the Repair and Utilization of Damaged Equipment
    To the Editor:
    Due to the bureaucracy of its leadership and poor management, the Beijing Company of the China Transportation Electrical Equipment Corporation has suffered significant damage to and stockpiling of goods. According to incomplete statistics, the company has accumulated damaged telecommunications equipment worth 6.6 billion yuan (old currency, same below) alone. This includes 66 various amplifiers, 107 electricity meters, 21 oscilloscopes, insulation testers, and record players each, 421 universal meters, 4,063 ammeters and voltmeters combined, 221 automatic telephones, and various other equipment such as switchboards, vacuum tube voltmeters, and distortion analyzers.
    The vast majority of these damaged goods can be repaired, and some are very easy to repair and are also in high demand in the market. For example, many of the 66 amplifiers stockpiled in the warehouse produce noise due to faulty potentiometers, which can be fixed simply by replacing the parts. However, they have been treated as irreparable waste products and left in the warehouse for a long time. Similarly, most of the electricity meters have broken glass or inaccurate speeds, which can be fixed simply by replacing the glass and adjusting the speed. However, they have been stockpiled since 1953, and currently, electricity meters worth over 1 billion yuan are stockpiled in the company's warehouse. A microwave signal generator worth 300 million yuan was also put into the damaged goods warehouse as a damaged product simply because one of its rubber knobs was broken. We have repeatedly asked the leadership to quickly inspect and handle these materials, but the company's leaders have consistently failed to listen to the opinions of the masses. I think this is very wrong.

    应该重视残损器材的检修和利用编辑同志：
    中国交通电工器材公司北京市公司，由于领导上的官僚主义和经营管理不善，大批商品受到了残损和积压。据不完全统计，这个公司仅因残损而积压的电讯器材，就值六十六亿元（旧币，下同），其中有各种扩音机六十六部，电度表一百零七部，示波器、绝缘试验器和电唱机各二十一部，万能电表四百二十一部，电流表和电压表共四千零六十三部，自动电话机二百二十一部，其它还有交换机、真空管电压表及失真度测定器等器材多种。
    这些残损的商品绝大部分都是可以修理的，而且有些很容易修理，市场上也很需要。如积压在仓库里的六十六部扩音机，很多都是因为电位器不好而产生杂音，只要换一下零件就行了。可是它们都被当作不可收拾的废品，长期在仓库里放着。又如电度表大部分碰坏了玻璃或者转速不准确，只要换换玻璃和调整一下转速就行了。但从一九五三年以来就开始积压，到目前为止就有价值十亿多元的电度表积压在这个公司的仓库里。有一部价值三亿元的微波信号产生器，不过坏了一个胶钮，也当作残品进了残损商品的仓库。我们曾多次要求领导上迅速把这些物资进行检修和处理，但公司的领导人却始终没有听取群众的意见。我觉得这是很不应该的。  雷毅忠
