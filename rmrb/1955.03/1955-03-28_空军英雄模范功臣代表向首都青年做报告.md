Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Zhang Weiliang, Song Zongzhou, Liu Jianhan, Wang Hongzhi, Lu Shenglin, and Sun Zhongguo, six representatives who participated in the first Hero, Role Model, and Meritorious Representatives Conference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force, reported their heroic deeds to a total of 16,200 young cadres from various agencies, young workers, university and middle school students, and Young Pioneers in the capital on the 27th.

Their reports were warmly welcomed by the youth present. More than 7,000 young cadres from organizations directly under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and directly under the State Council listened to the reports in the open-air labor theater of the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace and the music hall of Zhongshan Park, braving the light spring rain. When Zhang Weiliang and Song Zongzhou, who had repeatedly made meritorious contributions in the struggle to liberate the coastal islands of Zhejiang, talked about how they bombed a Chiang bandit's "Zhong" class landing ship on January 10th, causing it to burst into flames and billows of black smoke, the young people's excited applause lasted for a long time. At the end of the report, the young people enthusiastically presented them with flowers to express their respect. After listening to the story of Sun Zhongguo, a special-class meritorious air force officer, shooting down two enemy planes in the battle to volunteer to resist US aggression and aid Korea, more than 1,200 Young Pioneers were deeply moved. Jia Qinqin, a third-grade student from Beijing Railway Experimental Primary School, ran onto the stage as soon as the report ended and, on behalf of the city's children, tied a red scarf around Sun Zhongguo's neck to express her respect for the Air Force uncles. All the children present stood up and applauded enthusiastically.

    空军英雄模范功臣代表向首都青年做报告
   【新华社二十七日讯】参加中国人民解放军空军首届英雄模范功臣代表大会的张伟良、宋宗周、刘健汉、王洪智、卢胜林、孙忠国等六位代表，二十七日分别向首都各机关的青年干部，青年工人，大、中学生和少年先锋队员共一万六千二百多人，报告了他们的英勇斗争事迹。
    他们的报告受到到会青年的热烈欢迎。中共中央直属机关和国务院各直属单位的七千多青年干部，冒着蒙蒙春雨，在露天的北京市劳动人民文化宫劳动剧场和中山公园的音乐堂里听报告。当在解放浙江沿海岛屿的斗争中屡建战功的张伟良、宋宗周谈到今年一月十日他们把蒋贼中字号登陆舰炸得冒起火焰和团团黑烟时，青年们兴奋的掌声经久不息。报告结束时，青年们热情地向他们献花致敬。一千二百多个少年先锋队员在天桥剧场听了空军特等功臣孙忠国在志愿参加抗美援朝的斗争中击落两架敌机的空战故事后，孩子们深受感动。北京铁路实验小学三年级的小学生贾亲亲在报告刚一结束时就跑上主席台，代表全市的少年儿童，把一条红领巾系在孙忠国的脖子上，表示对空军叔叔的敬意，到会的全体孩子当时都站立起来，热烈地鼓掌欢呼。
