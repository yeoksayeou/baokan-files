    Japanese and British Economic Magazines
    Advocate Japan Expanding Trade with China
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 17th] The March issue of the Japanese magazine "Oriental Economist" published an article on Sino-Japanese trade, titled "Trade with China." The article focuses on the "embargo" restrictions on Japan's foreign trade and argues that solving this problem is an indispensable prerequisite for actually expanding trade with China.
    The article cites twelve items, including galvanized iron sheets, locomotives and railcars, and freighters, for which Japan faces particularly strict export restrictions, and states: "If the restrictions (on these materials) can be modified, exports will increase considerably. Industrial activity will receive impetus, allowing Japanese industry to be saved from the abyss of depression. Moreover, this will make mass production possible, thereby reducing production costs and enabling domestic manufacturers to improve their competitive strength in the world market."
    The article points out that an increase in Japan's exports to China "will inevitably enable Japan to increase its purchasing power from China. ... Before the war, Japan purchased most of its important raw materials, such as coal, iron ore, salt, and soybeans, from China. But since the end of the war, Japan has mainly relied on the United States to supply these materials." The article, based on a survey by the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, says: "Chinese products are, in most cases, much cheaper than American products."
    The article concludes: "We couldn't be more pleased that Chinese products are cheaper and that foreign exchange can be saved as a result. However, expanding purchases requires first greatly increasing sales to China. Therefore, the hoped-for relaxation of export restrictions becomes an absolutely necessary prerequisite."
    [Xinhua News Agency, March 17th] London Dispatch: The British financial weekly "The Statist," published on March 12th, commented on the issue of expanded trade between Japan and China, saying: "The pessimistic view held regarding the range and quantity of goods that China is able to offer for export is tending to prove unfounded." "The Statist" points out, "Both British business and trade missions that visited Beijing last autumn and have just returned have particularly emphasized that China is not lacking in goods available for export." "The Statist" continues, China can supply Japan with a large amount of basic materials it needs. This will save Japan many dollars and greatly reduce the cost of manufacturing processes.
      "The Statist" says: An industrialized China is a much better trading partner than the backward China of the 1930s.
      "The Statist" points out: The main obstacle to trade between Japan and China is the "embargo" forced by the United States. Japanese industrial and trade groups are strongly demanding a relaxation of this "embargo" that restricts free trade.

### 日本和英国的经济杂志  主张日本扩大对中国的贸易

    主张日本扩大对中国的贸易
    【新华社十七日讯】　三月号的日本“东方经济学家”杂志发表了一篇论日中贸易的文章，题目是“同中国的贸易”。文章着重谈到日本对外贸易所受到的“禁运”限制，并且认为：解决这个问题是实际扩大对中国的贸易所不可缺少的前提。
    文章举出镀锌铁板、机车和车皮、货船等十二项日本受到特别严格的出口限制的物资，并且说：“如果（对这些物资的）限制能够修改，出口就会有可观的增加。工业活动将得到推动力，使日本工业可能从萧条的深渊得到拯救。而且，这会使大量生产成为可能，从而使生产成本降低，使本国的制造商能够改善他们在世界市场上的竞争力量。”
    文章指出：日本对中国出口的增加“必然会使日本能够提高它对中国的购买能力。……战前，像煤、铁矿砂、盐和大豆这类的重要原料，日本大部分是从中国购买。但是战争结束以来，日本一直主要依赖美国来供应这些物资。”文章根据日本国际贸易促进协会的调查说：“中国产品在绝大部分情况下都比美国的便宜得多。”
    文章最后说：“中国产品比较便宜，而且外汇可以因而节省，这是最使我们高兴不过的事情。但是，扩大购买就必须先大大增加对中国的销售。因此，人们所期望的放宽出口禁令就成了一个绝对必须的前提。”
    【新华社十七日讯】　伦敦消息：三月十二日出版的英国金融周刊“统计家”在评论日本和中国扩大贸易的问题时说：“对于中国能够提供出口的货物的范围和数量所抱的悲观看法，已有倾向证明是毫无根据的。”“统计家”指出，“去年秋天到北京访问和刚回来的两个英国工商界贸易访问团都格外强调指出，中国并不缺少可供出口的货物”。“统计家”继续说，中国可以供给日本所需要的大量基本物资。这样将会使日本节省许多美元，并且大大地降低制造过程中的成本。
      “统计家”说：一个工业化的中国是比一九三○年时的落后中国好得多的贸易对象。
      “统计家”指出：日本和中国贸易的主要障碍是美国逼迫实行的“禁运”。日本的工业和贸易团体正在极力要求放宽这种限制自由贸易的“禁运”。
