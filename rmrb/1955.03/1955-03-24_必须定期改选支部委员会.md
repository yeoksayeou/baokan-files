Branch committees must be re-elected regularly, as it is a rule of Party life. However, a small number of rural branches have not strictly adhered to this rule. The fact that the Xinli Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujin County, Heilongjiang Province, has not been re-elected for six years is a prominent example. The situation of not re-electing the branch committee for a long time shows that there is no basic democratic life in these branches. The branch committee has not regularly reported its work to all Party members, requesting everyone to examine the work of the branch leadership, and then elect a new branch committee based on the results of the examination. Regular re-election of the branch committee can elect new forces that have truly grown up in actual struggle into the leading body, and replace certain incompetent leaders; through this way, the enthusiasm and creativity of all Party members can be encouraged, and the role of collective leadership can be fully brought into play. The Xinli Village branch has been in a backward state for a long time because it has not re-elected its branch committee for a long time, so the leading body of this branch has been occupied by Li Jiuchen, a selfish, self-interested person who cannot resolutely implement the Party's policies and opposes the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the village.

There are also many rural branches that have regularly re-elected their branch committees, but because they have not fully promoted democracy, have not made work reports with the spirit of self-criticism at the branch meeting, have not mobilized all Party members to put forward criticisms and opinions on the work of the branch leadership, have not put forward opinions on improving the work of the branch leadership, and have not given the list of candidates for branch committee members to everyone for deliberation and discussion in advance. As a result, many of the new branch committees that were elected are still those incompetent branch committee members of the past, or some branch committee members with poor character and style were elected. As a result, the leadership of the branch has not been strengthened, the implementation of the Party's policies is still not guaranteed, and the Party's leading role among the peasant masses cannot be strengthened. Such branches must be re-elected to truly elect Party members with strong Party spirit and good work style to the leading positions of the branch.

The fact that the branch committee cannot be re-elected for a long time, or only conducts formalistic re-elections, is related to the leadership ideology and work style of the county and district committees that directly lead them. Now some county and district committees do not have the view of relying on the branch to play its role, so they do not pay attention to the work of the branch for a long time. Whether the branch has regularly elected the branch committee, whether the core of the branch leadership has been formed, whether the branch committee has played a role in collective leadership, and whether there is criticism and self-criticism in the branch life, these county and district committees rarely pay attention to all of this.

This phenomenon of violating the rules of Party life should be corrected immediately. County and district Party committees should combine with the central work to lead the branches to conduct the work of regularly re-electing the branch committees.

    必须定期改选支部委员会
    唐工
    定期改选支部委员会，是党内生活的规则。但是就有少数农村支部没有严格遵守这一规则，中共黑龙江省富锦县新立村支部六年没有改选，就是一个突出的例子。长期不改选支部委员会的情况，说明了在这些支部里还没有起码的民主生活，支部委员会没有定期向全体党员做工作报告，请求大家检查支部领导工作，而后根据检查结果，选举新的支部委员会。定期改选支部委员会，可以把真正在实际斗争中成长起来的新生力量选拔到领导机构中去，而撤换某些不能称职的领导者；可以经过这种途径，鼓舞全体党员的积极性和创造性，充分发挥集体领导的作用。新立村支部就因为长期没有改选支部委员会，所以这个支部的领导机关，被一个自私自利的、不能坚决执行党的政策的、反对在本村发展互助合作组织的李久臣所占据。这个支部也就长期处于落后状态中。
    还有不少农村支部虽也定期改选了支部委员会，但因为没有充分发扬民主，没有在支部大会上做有自我批评精神的工作报告，没有发动全体党员对支部领导工作提出批评和意见，没有提出改进支部领导工作的意见，也没有事先把支部委员候选名单交给大家酝酿讨论，因而所选举的新支部委员会，仍有不少是过去那些不称职的支部委员，或者选举了一些品质和作风都不好的支部委员。结果，支部的领导力量并没有加强，党的政策的贯彻仍然得不到保证，党对农民群众的领导作用也不能加强。这样的支部就必须重新选举，真正选举党性强、作风好的党员到支部的领导岗位上来。
    支部委员会长期不能改选，或者只是进行形式主义的改选，是和直接领导它们的县、区委的领导思想作风有关的。现在有些县、区委就没有依靠支部发挥支部作用的观点，因而长期不过问支部工作，支部有没有定期选举支部委员会，支部领导核心有没有形成，支部委员会有没有发挥集体领导作用，支部生活有没有批评和自我批评，这一切，这些县区委是很少注意的。
    这种违反党内生活规则的现象应该立即纠正。县、区党委应该结合中心工作，领导支部进行定期改选支部委员会的工作。
