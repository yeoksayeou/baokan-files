    Yunnan's Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture is actively promoting the new Dai script. Cadres in county-level organs and school teachers in the autonomous prefecture have been focusing on learning the Dai language and script. Currently, there are eight Dai script learning classes in the region, with over 600 participating cadres and teachers regularly attending.

    These learning classes last for three months each, with dedicated instructors and four to six hours of instruction per week. Language and script learning are combined. In addition to teachers, ethnic minority cadres from the organs provide tutoring. Regular tests are conducted during the learning process. According to the results of the first phase of testing in Luxi, Lianghe, and Yingjiang counties, the passing rate reached 90 percent.

    At present, the Dai script learning class directly under the autonomous prefecture's organs has completed the first volume of general conversational materials and is about to begin learning the second volume. In addition to the original 120+ participants, more than 80 new participants have recently joined.

    In order to further promote the new Dai script, the autonomous prefecture plans to add Dai script courses in Luxi and Yingjiang ethnic middle schools this year. In March, a Dai script teacher training class will be held in Mangshi, attracting on-the-job cadres, teachers, and rural intellectuals of Dai ethnicity from various counties to participate in the learning.

    云南德宏区推行新傣文
    云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治区积极推行新傣文。自治区各县级机关干部及学校教师已重点展开傣语、傣文学习。现在，全区已有傣文学习班八个，参加学习的机关干部及教师经常有六百多人。
    这些学习班三个月一期，有专人教授，每周学习四小时到六小时。学文字与学语言并进。除教师上课外，并由机关中的民族干部进行辅导。学习中定期举行测验。据第一期潞西、梁河、盈江三县测验的结果，及格的达百分之九十。
    目前，自治区直属机关傣文学习班已学完第一册通用会话教材，即将开始学习第二册。参加学习的除原有的一百二十多人外，最近又增加了八十多人。
    为了进一步推行新傣文，自治区准备今年在潞西、盈江两个民族中学，分别增设傣文课程；三月间并在芒市开办傣文师资训练班，吸收各县傣族在职干部、教师和农村知识分子参加学习。  （新华社）
