    Water
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    When I visited the Yimeng Mountain area, I went to the Yishui County Soil and Water Conservation Bureau. The bureau asked me to take a look at the Taiping Guanzhuang Reservoir. They also said: Not far from this reservoir is the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Quanli Village, and they have increased production quite a bit!
    This reservoir is on the hillside east of Quanli Village, next to Taiping Guanzhuang, hence the name Taiping Guanzhuang Reservoir. The water from this reservoir irrigates the land in Taiping Guanzhuang, Quanli, and Songfeng villages.
    Liu Liansheng, the head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, and I walked towards the reservoir along a small path on the canal. In the shady areas of the mountains and fields, there was still unmelted snow. At a place planted with several small cypress trees, Liu Liansheng suddenly stopped. He pointed to a wheat field west of the canal, the wheat seedlings as thick as a horse's mane, and said:
  “This is our cooperative's wheat. This field had a bumper harvest this year, yielding more than six hundred catties of millet per mu. The millet grew so strong, and I am not short," he paused, "but I could only peek my head above it in this millet field. The millet spikes were thick and long, just like foxtails. Before it ripened, everyone in the cooperative went to see it!"
    In recent years, their branch has been thinking about high yields. At first, hearing that one mu of land yielded more than a thousand catties here, and another mu yielded more than a thousand catties there, it was a bit hard to believe. But labor models elsewhere said that they really harvested more than a thousand catties, and there was an acceptance inspection at harvest time. If they can have high yields there, how can we have high yields on this mountain ridge? Not only is the land poor, but the lack of water will get you!
    Yimeng Mountain has droughts nine years out of ten, and the land is thin mountain land. In the summer, a few days without rain would dry out that little bit of topsoil.
    Liu Liansheng calculated on his fingers:
    From 1948 to 1950, it was: drought resistance every year, drought every year! Many of the people here survived on disaster relief grain. "1951 was okay, with a few timely rains, giving people a breather. But in 1952, we had a drought, and one-third of the millet died, with only a few dozen catties of grain harvested per mu. 1953 was another drought year. In the summer, we had to try our best to carry water to irrigate soybeans, sweet potatoes, and peanuts.
    In the past, people burned incense and kowtowed countless times at the Taishan Temple on the east mountain for water, but the "gods" in the Taishan Temple did not bestow blessings on them. Hunger and poverty still closely chased the people of the Yimeng Mountain area every year, and countless people went to the Northeast!
    "Do you say there is no water on our loess mountains?" Liu Liansheng said, pointing to a small frozen ditch, "There is water, but it all flows away."
    We had already approached the small ditch below the reservoir. Water, clear water, gurgled down from the cracks in the rocks. Indeed, as Liu Liansheng said, for who knows how many years, the water had been flowing like this. The water had smoothed the stones in the riverbeds. The sun had baked this Yimeng Mountain area, turning the crops yellow, drying them to death, and driving the people away! Only in this era, not "gods," but the Communist Party and the People's Government, made the water irrigate the drought-stricken crops, and made the barren loess ridges have high yields.
    We walked along that mountain stream for not far before we saw the sluice gate of the reservoir halfway up the mountain. The front of the sluice gate was already covered by a thick layer of ice. As soon as we reached the reservoir, Liu Liansheng stopped. Pointing to the surface of the reservoir, as if with great pride in the reservoir, he said:
      "Take a look! How about our reservoir!"
      "Are there any fish?" I asked Liu Liansheng.
      "Oh, there are fish, and big fish too! Come back in two years, and I insist on treating you to big carp!" Mentioning fish, he became very excited, gesturing with his hands: "Now the fish in this reservoir weigh three or four catties. The fish were only put in last year. When the fish were transported here, they only weighed a few taels, and they grew so big in one year. Fish, the people in our area can't eat fish! It's one or two hundred li to the east, west, north, and south before you can find fish!"
    Last summer, a man from Juxian County ran thirty or forty li to see the reservoir. He said that he had a small pit at home that could hold sixty or seventy cubic meters of water. He specialized in raising fish there, and in two or three years, he caught six hundred catties of fish in that small pit. It's more cost-effective than raising pigs! This reservoir has 200,000 cubic meters of water. Is there any problem with producing twenty or thirty thousand catties of fish in a year or two! How much income can these twenty or thirty thousand catties of fish bring in... Who would have thought that fish could run to the mountains!
    I asked Liu Liansheng:
      "Why did you build a reservoir here?"
      "Speaking of building this reservoir, it's a long story." Liu Liansheng told me in detail about the situation at the time.
    In the autumn of 1952, some staff members came here. They dug pits in the ground, measured up and down the mountains, and also built some scaffolds on the mountains.
    Soon, the surveying staff held a mass meeting, saying that in order to increase production, they would build a reservoir to turn the dry land on the mountain into irrigated land. At this time, the party members and cadres believed it, but the general masses were still skeptical. Liu Liansheng, as soon as he heard that this dry land would be turned into irrigated land, he was overjoyed! In the past, when he attended meetings in the county, he heard that one mu of Jin Huanghou corn in Dianzi Village yielded 1,200 catties, and some yielded five or six hundred catties, which was really enviable. Without irrigated land, you can't apply more fertilizer, and without fertilizer, how can you have high yields? After that, they looked forward to the start of construction day and night.
    This year, the Party committee and the government saw the severe drought here, and remembered that this was an old revolutionary base area, and the masses had contributed to the revolution, so they used work-for-relief to build the reservoir. This would permanently eliminate the drought here and help the masses tide over the spring famine...
    This place is very close to the Shu River. The Shu River floods every year, and the people downstream are flooded every year. This place saves drought, and Jiangsu in the north saves floods. If everyone were like here, building reservoirs, the Yimeng Mountain area would be free from drought, and the downstream would also be free from floods, how good would that be!
    In March, just after planting the land, the reservoir project started. The Party branch called on the masses: This is work for ourselves, and we must ensure quality. Liu Liansheng was at the construction site every day at that time, leading people to work before dawn, and not returning until long after dark. His wife had just given birth to their second child, and she still cooked and delivered meals to him every day. The stones on this mountain could not be used, so they had to run more than ten li to carry stones from outside. Often, they would arrive there in the morning, load the cart, sleep for a while, and return before dawn.
    The reservoir was completed in the same year, and the canals were also completed. After this reservoir was built, men and women, far and near, all ran to see it. People from other counties and provinces also came to see it. It is said that the masses in other places are also trying to find ways to build small reservoirs themselves! That is also influenced by this reservoir!
    Last winter, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative was established, and everyone elected Liu Liansheng as the head of the cooperative. At this time, he was thinking about high yields day and night.
    In the spring, when everyone else hadn't planted crops yet, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative studied and decided to plant high-yield millet in those two mu of land at the south end of the village. They applied twenty-four catties of fertilizer powder and three hundred loads of manure to that field. After the millet seedlings emerged, the old people in the village said that planting so densely was simply nonsense, and it was sure to only grow stalks and not big spikes. Some members of the cooperative also said that this was not a good idea. There was not much soil in the mountain land, so where would so many millet roots grow! Liu Liansheng was clear in his mind. The higher authorities had explained it countless times, and he had seen other people's high-yield fields, so there was no mistake.
    When the millet was about to head, it became dry again, and the high-yield millet was even more severely affected by the drought, and the leaves curled up. At this critical moment, the sluice gate of the reservoir was opened, and the water flowed down the canal with a rush. At that time, people were so happy that some washed their faces in the water, and young and old alike touched the water with their hands. Not long after the water reached the high-yield field, the millet leaves straightened up. However, Liu Shanwen, an individual farmer next to the cooperative's land, said: This water is too cold, and the crops will have problems. Liu Shanwen insisted on letting the crops dry out and not irrigating them. But when he saw that the millet in the high-yield field was growing well, he asked Liu Liansheng to irrigate his land. The high-yield millet produced thick and long spikes, which drooped heavily. Every day, countless people went to see it. The people in the cooperative were happy to see that the millet was growing well, and the people outside the cooperative were envious. Some said it could yield three hundred catties, and others said it could yield four hundred catties; they were all wrong, it yielded six hundred and forty-eight catties per mu! The irrigated land in the cooperative also yielded more than three hundred to four hundred catties per mu.
    The high yield of the land in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative was a big deal. People who didn't irrigate their land regretted not irrigating it, and they lost so much grain! Now, one mu of land can yield as much grain as two or three mu. Li Wenyi, an individual farmer, also harvested more than six hundred catties of Jin Huanghou corn per mu. But with irrigated land, it is no longer suitable for individual farmers to farm individually. The water is abundant and comes quickly. A few mu of land can be irrigated in a while, and there are not enough people to dig furrows. Many people requested to join the cooperative. Their cooperative has expanded. Of the one hundred households in Quanli Village, only five have not joined the cooperative, and they are now also requesting to join.

    水
    本报记者　陈勇进
    我访问沂蒙山区的时候，曾到过沂水县水土保持所。所里，要我到太平官庄的水库上看一看。还说：离这个水库不远的圈里村有个中苏友好农业生产合作社，他们可增产不少呀！
    这水库在圈里村东面的山半腰，紧靠着太平官庄，因此叫太平官庄水库。这水库的水浇着太平官庄、圈里和松风几个村庄上的土地。
    中苏友好农业生产合作社的社长刘连生和我，沿着水渠上的小路向水库上走去。山野里那些阴背的地方，还盖着没有化完的雪。在一个栽有几棵小柏树的地方，刘连生忽然停下了，他用手指着水渠西边的一块麦田，那麦苗儿厚得像马鬃一样，他说：
  “这就是我们社里的麦子。这块地今年丰产了，谷子每亩地收到六百多斤。那谷子长得真强，我这个儿不算矮吧？”他停了停，“可是到这块谷地里仅能露个头。那谷穗子又粗又长，真像狗尾巴一样。在没成熟的时候，社里的人那个不去看呀！”
    这些年来，他们支部老想着丰产。乍听着这里一亩地打了一千多斤，那里一亩地也打了一千多斤，真是有点不大信，可是别处的劳动模范说过，人家真的收了一千多斤，收割的时候还有验收的呢。人家那里能丰产，这山岗岗上怎样能丰产呢？地薄不说，缺水这一样就把你制住啦！
    沂蒙山，十年就有九年旱，地又是薄山地。夏天，几天不下雨就把那点薄土晒透了。
    刘连生拨弄着指头计算着：
    从一九四八年到一九五○年，这里是：年年抗旱，年年遭旱！这里的不少老百姓，是吃救灾粮度过来的。“一九五一年还算好，下了几场及时雨，叫人缓了缓劲。可是一九五二年赶上了天旱，谷子死了三分之一，每亩才收几十斤粮食。一九五三年又是闹旱灾。夏天只好尽力挑水浇豆子，浇地瓜，浇花生。
    在以往的日子里，人们为了水不知到那东山的泰山庙上烧过多少香，磕过多少头，可是泰山庙里的“神”并没施给他们恩典。饥饿和贫困每年还是紧紧地追赶着沂蒙山区的人民，不知有多少人到东北去了！
    “你说我们这黄土山上没水吗？”刘连生一边说，一边用手指着已经结冰的小沟说：“水还是真有，可是都流跑了。”
    我们已经走近了这个水库下面的小水沟。水，清清的水，从石缝里哗哗地流下来。确实像刘连生说的，也不知道多少年了，水就是这样地流着。水把河沟沟里的石头磨圆了，磨滑了，太阳一代又一代地晒着这沂蒙山区，把庄稼旱黄了，旱死了，把这里的人民旱瘦了旱跑了！只是到了这个时代里，不是“神”，而是共产党和人民政府，使水，把受旱的庄稼浇旺了，使那瘠薄的黄山岗岗上的土地丰产了。
    我俩沿着那条山谷小流，走了没多远，就看到那山腰间水库的水闸了。那水闸的前面，已为厚厚的冰层掩盖着。我们一走到水库边，刘连生就停了下来。刘连生指着那水库的冰面，像是为了这个水库而带有很大的骄傲，他说：
      “看看吧！看我们的水库怎么样！”
      “有鱼吗？”我问刘连生。
      “咳，有鱼，还有大鱼哩！再等二年你来吧，非请你吃大鲤鱼不行！”提起鱼来，他的兴劲可上来了，他用手比着：“现在这水库里的鱼有三、四斤的啦，鱼是去年才放进来的。鱼运来的时候才十来两重，一年里面就长了这样大。鱼，我们这个地方上的老百姓可吃不到鱼呀！东西南北，都离我们一、二百里路才有鱼哩！”
    去年夏天，一个莒县人跑了三四十里来看水库，他说他自家有个小水坑，能盛六、七十公方水。他在这里专门养鱼，二、三年后，在这个小坑里就捉了六百斤鱼。比喂猪还合算哩！这水库有二十万公方水，一、两年里面出个两、三万斤鱼还有问题呀！这两三万斤鱼能收入多少……谁想到鱼能跑到山上来了呢！
    我问刘连生：
      “为什么在你们这里修水库？”“提起修建这个水库，话可就长了。”刘连生把当时情况细细地说给我听了。
    那是一九五二年秋天，这儿来了一些工作人员，他们在地上刨坑，又在山上山下测量，还在山上搭了些架子。
    不久，测量工作人员召开了个群众会，说是为了增加生产要修水库，把山上的旱地改成水浇地。这时党员和干部都相信了，一般群众还是半信半疑。刘连生呢，一听把这片旱地改成水浇地，心里可高兴透啦！过去在县里开会时，听说店子村一亩金皇后玉米打一千二百斤，还有的打五六百斤，真是眼馋。没水浇地就不能多上粪，不上粪怎么能丰产呢？以后他们就黑天白日地盼着开工。
    这年，党委和政府看着这里的旱灾大，又念记这里是老解放区，群众对革命有功，于是就以工代赈，修建水库。这样就能永久消除这里的旱灾，又帮助群众度过春荒……。
    这里离沭河很近。沭河年年发大水，下面的老百姓又年年被淹，这里救旱灾，江苏北面那里是救水灾。要都像这里一样，修起水库，沂蒙山区免了旱灾，下游也免了水灾，这有多好呀！
    三月里，刚种完地，这个水库工程就开工了。党支部向群众号召：这是给自己做的活，一定得保证质量。刘连生那时一天天在工地上，天不明就领着人上工，天黑多久还不回来。他老婆刚生了第二个小孩，每天还给他做饭送饭。这山的石头不能用，还得跑十几里路外去推石头，往往早晨走到那里把车子装上睡一觉再回来，天还是不明。
    水库在当年就修好了，水渠也修好了。这个水库修成后，男的女的，远的近的，都跑来看，外县外省的也来看，听说别的地方的群众也正在自己想办法修小水库哩！那也是受这个水库的影响呀！
    去年冬天，中苏友好农业生产合作社成立了，大家选刘连生当社长，这时候他黑天白日地揣摩着丰产。
    春天，大家都没耩庄稼的时候，中苏友好农业生产合作社就研究好在庄南头那二亩地里种丰产谷子，他们在那块地里上了二十四斤肥田粉，还上了三百担粪。谷子出苗后，村子里老人都说，种这样稠，简直是胡闹，这准是光长秆不长大穗子。社里有些社员也说这不是办法，在山地里没有多厚的土，叫那么多谷子根往那里扎呀！刘连生心里不含糊，上级讲了不知多少遍，又看过别人的丰产地，错不了。
    谷子快要出穗的时候，天又旱了，丰产谷子旱得更厉害，叶子就卷起来了。正在这节骨眼上，水库的闸门打开了，水哗哗地顺着渠道流下来了，那时人们乐得呀，有在水里洗脸的，老的小的都用手摸摸那水。水到了丰产地没大时候，谷子叶就挺起来了。可是紧靠农业社的地旁边的单干户刘善文又说：这水太凉，庄稼要出毛病。刘善文硬是叫庄稼旱着也不浇。但他一见丰产地里的谷子旺起来了，就找刘连生要求浇水。丰产谷子出了又粗又长的大穗子，又沉甸甸地垂下来了。天天不知有多少人去看，社里的人看着这谷子长的好心里乐，社外面的人都羡慕，这个说能打三百斤，那个说能打四百斤；他们猜的都不对，是每亩打了六百四十八斤！社里的水浇地也每亩都打到三百多斤到四百斤。
    中苏友好农业生产合作社的地一丰产不要紧，没有浇水的人，都后悔说不浇水，少收多少粮食呀！眼下这一亩地能顶二、三亩地收粮食。单干户李文一种的金皇后玉米一亩也收到六百多斤。可是一有水浇地，单干户再单干就不合适了。这水大，来的快。几亩地一会就浇完了，人少了扒畦子也忙不过来呀。很多人请求入社，他们的社扩大了，圈里村一百来户，没有入社的只有五家，现在也在要求入社了。
