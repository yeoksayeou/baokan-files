The "National Conference on Workers and Peasants' Rapid Course Secondary Education and the National Conference on Workers' and Staff's Spare-Time Cultural Education," jointly convened by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing starting from February 22nd, concluded on March 7th.

The meeting determined that in the future, cultivating intellectuals from workers and peasants will primarily take the form of spare-time education, that is, establishing a large number of cultural refresher schools for cadres in government offices and spare-time secondary schools for workers and staff, and appropriately running night universities and correspondence schools, while actively and steadily developing workers and peasants' rapid course secondary schools.

The meeting pointed out that the task of workers and peasants' rapid course secondary schools is: to enroll outstanding worker and peasant cadres and young workers who have participated in the revolution or in industrial labor for a certain period, to provide them with secondary-level education, so that they can lay a good foundation in terms of political thought, cultural knowledge, and physical health, so that they can smoothly enter universities and colleges to continue their studies after graduation, and be trained as technical experts and management cadres and backbone forces for various construction projects. After discussing the existing problems in the education of workers and peasants' rapid course secondary schools, the meeting determined that the guiding principle for future work is: to develop actively and steadily, and to strive to improve the quality of education. In order to implement the above-mentioned tasks and guiding principles, and to improve and solve the existing problems, the meeting believes that it is necessary to strengthen the planning of school establishment and enrollment work in the development; it is necessary to strive to improve the quality of education; and it is also necessary to clarify the leadership responsibilities of the education departments and bureaus and universities and colleges for the affiliated workers and peasants' rapid course secondary schools. The meeting focused on discussing the issue of improving the quality of education in workers and peasants' rapid course secondary schools.

According to the requirements of national socialist industrialization and the current situation of workers' and staff's spare-time cultural education, the meeting determined the guiding principle for workers' and staff's spare-time cultural education in the future: closely combine it with the development of industrial production, actively and systematically develop workers' and staff's spare-time secondary schools and higher primary schools, and vigorously eliminate illiteracy among workers and staff, and improve the cultural and scientific level of workers and staff, so as to effectively serve socialist industrialization. The meeting determined that: during the period of the first five-year plan, efforts should be made to basically eliminate illiteracy among the existing industrial workers and the illiteracy among workers in some industries. Specific requirements: by 1957, the number of students in workers' and staff's spare-time secondary schools will reach 550,000, the number of students in spare-time higher primary school classes will reach 1,620,000, and the number of literacy classes will reach 2,580,000. The meeting also discussed and made regulations on issues such as the organization and leadership, the school system, the curriculum, the study time, and the teachers of workers' and staff's spare-time cultural education.
