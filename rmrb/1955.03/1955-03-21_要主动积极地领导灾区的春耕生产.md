It is necessary to actively and proactively lead spring ploughing production in disaster areas
You Qun

    Spring ploughing production has begun successively in various regions. This season, as farmers say, is the season of "three open mouths": "The land opens its mouth for seeds, livestock open their mouths for fodder, and farmers open their mouths for food." During this time, strengthening the leadership of spring ploughing in disaster areas is particularly important. There are many difficulties in spring ploughing production in disaster areas, and all regions must help farmers overcome these difficulties and strive to complete production plans.

    The organs and cadres leading spring ploughing production in disaster areas must have the greatest initiative and enthusiasm. Before this year's spring ploughing, the leading Party and government cadres in many disaster-stricken areas carried forward the tenacious spirit of fighting the severe floods of 1954, organized mutual assistance and relief between farmers in disaster areas and between farmers in disaster and non-disaster areas, organized mutual assistance and relief between agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers, and organized the forces of agriculture, supply and marketing, credit and other departments to help farmers overcome difficulties and tide over the famine, so that spring ploughing production could be carried out smoothly. The Bahe District of Xishui County, Hubei Province, was a severely flooded area, and the extreme shortage of draught cattle became the biggest obstacle to spring ploughing production. The Bahe District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Xishui County discovered this problem and organized agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to appropriately arrange the order of cultivation and rationally allocate the use of draught cattle, which not only solved the problem of the shortage of draught cattle, but also promoted the spirit of mutual assistance among farmers and promoted the consolidation and development of mutual assistance and cooperation. Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, lacked 820,000 jin of cotton seeds. The local leading organs mobilized farmers throughout the county to adjust to each other, plus a portion of the national supply, and also successfully solved the problem of the lack of cotton seeds.

    However, not all leading organs and cadres in disaster areas have played an active and proactive role in spring ploughing production. Some leading organs in disaster areas have shown an extremely irresponsible and erroneous attitude of being indifferent to the difficulties of farmers and sitting and waiting for state relief. The leading organs of Yanggao, Tianzhen, Daren, and Lingqiu, four heavily afflicted counties in the Yanbei Special District of Shanxi, have not properly led farmers in spring ploughing production. Many affected farmers have gone out, and much land has been left barren. Wei Shiheng, deputy director of the Rural Work Department of the Yanggao County Party Committee, helped agricultural production cooperatives in Beixu Village for a long time. He watched many farmers leave, and hundreds of sows and draught animals were slaughtered and sold, but he ignored them, neither seriously dealing with them nor reporting them to higher authorities. The local disaster situation therefore developed, and spring ploughing production could not be carried out. The Xianning County Committee of Hubei Province adopted an irresponsible attitude towards the draught cattle transferred from Jiayu County due to the disaster, resulting in the death of many draught cattle, which greatly affected spring ploughing production in Jiayu County.

    The leading organs and cadres in disaster areas must quickly take action to overcome the style of letting things drift and bureaucracy. They must actively contact the masses, care about their hardships, carry out vivid organizational work among the masses, and help them overcome various difficulties in spring ploughing. Any passive waiting mentality, bureaucracy, and laissez-faire attitude will cause huge losses to the country and the farmers.

    要主动积极地领导灾区的春耕生产
    友群
    各地春耕生产已陆续开始。这个时节，正像农民所说的，是“三张口”的季节：“土地张口要种籽，牲畜张口要饲料，农民张口要口粮”。在这种时节，加强对灾区的春耕领导是特别重要的。灾区春耕生产中有许多困难，各地必须帮助农民克服困难，勉力完成生产计划。
    领导灾区春耕生产的机关和干部，要有极大的主动性和积极性。今年春耕以前，灾区许多地方的党政领导干部，发扬了一九五四年跟严重的水灾作斗争的顽强精神，组织灾区农民之间及灾区和非灾区农民之间的互助互济，组织农业生产合作社和互助组及单干农民之间的互助互济，并组织农业、供销、信贷等部门的力量，帮助灾区农民生产渡荒，使春耕生产顺利地开展起来。湖北省浠水县巴河区是遭受水灾很严重的地区，耕牛奇缺，成为春耕生产的最大阻碍。中共浠水县巴河区委发现了这个问题，组织农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民适当安排耕作次序，合理地调剂耕牛的使用时间，不但解决了耕牛缺少的问题，而且发扬了农民的互助精神，推动了互助合作的巩固发展。陕西盩厔县缺少棉籽八十二万斤，当地领导机关动员全县农民互相调剂，加上国家的一部分供应，也顺利地解决了缺乏棉籽的问题。
    但是，并不是所有灾区的领导机关和干部都在春耕生产中发挥了主动性和积极性。有些灾区的领导机关，表现了对农民的困难漠不关心、坐待国家救济的极不负责的错误态度。山西雁北专区阳高、天镇、大仁、灵邱等四个重灾县的领导机关，就没有好好领导农民进行春耕生产，许多受灾农民外出，不少土地荒无了。阳高县委农村工作部副部长魏世恒在北徐屯乡长期帮助农业生产合作社工作，眼看不少农民外出，几百头母猪和耕畜被宰杀和被出卖，竟不加理睬，既不认真处理，也不向上级报告。当地灾情因此发展，春耕生产开展不起来。湖北省咸宁县委对嘉鱼县因灾转移来的耕牛，采取不负责任的态度，以致耕牛死亡很多，大大影响了嘉鱼县的春耕生产。
    灾区的领导机关和干部，必须赶快行动起来，克服放任自流和官僚主义作风。要主动地联系群众，关心群众疾苦，在群众中进行生动的组织工作，帮助群众战胜春耕中的各种困难。任何消极等待思想，官僚主义和自流放任的作风，都会使国家和农民遭到巨大的损失。
