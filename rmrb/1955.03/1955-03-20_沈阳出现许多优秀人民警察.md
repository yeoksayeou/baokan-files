    Many Outstanding People's Policemen Appear in Shenyang
    In several fire extinguishing operations, the People's Policemen on the fire fighting work posts in Shenyang City demonstrated heroic spirit, recovering losses to the property of the state and the people.
    In every fire scene, the People's Policemen encouraged themselves with "Defend the fruits of the workers' labor," bravely fighting the raging fire. Firefighter Zhou Xishan once fainted in the raging fire while rescuing in a fire. When he was awakened by fire extinguishing water, although he found blood flowing from the burned area, he picked up the water hose gun and continued to rush into the fire scene, cutting off the source of the fire and protecting the safety of five firefighters surrounded by the fire. Fu Xiang, Liu Chunxi, and Zhang Yuzhong were newly joined firefighters. In a fire rescue, they were smoked unconscious. After waking up, they continued to cut obstacles and grab a large number of fabrics. Firefighters Wang Jingyang and Zou Fengben had just been injected with cardiotonics. They avoided the commanders and rushed to the fire scene again, saving the Xinhua Bookstore's warehouse from loss.
    Now, 63 outstanding firefighters and 10 advanced units have emerged in Shenyang City. People's Policeman Wu Defu heroically sacrificed himself in the rescue of the Shenyang Starch Factory fire, in order to stop the spread of the fire and protect the Shenyang Brewery. After his death, he was posthumously recognized as a "People's Policeman Special Class Hero." These outstanding individuals and units have been rewarded by the Shenyang Municipal Public Security Bureau and loved by the people; they have continuously received banners and a large number of thank-you letters from the people.

    沈阳出现许多优秀人民警察
    沈阳市消防工作岗位上的人民警察在几次扑灭火灾中，都表现了英勇的精神，挽回了国家和人民财产的损失。
    人民警察们在历次火场上，都以“保卫工人劳动果实”勉励自己，英勇地和烈火搏斗。消防员周锡山有一次在抢救火灾中，晕倒在熊熊大火里，当他被消火水浇醒后，虽然发觉烧伤的地方流出鲜血，可是他却拾起水管枪继续冲进火场，切断火源，保护了被火包围的五名消防员的安全。傅祥、刘春喜、张玉忠是新参加工作的消防员。他们在一次救火中，被烟火熏晕。清醒以后继续砍断障碍物，抢出大量布匹。消防员汪景阳、邹凤本刚注射完强心剂，他们避着指挥员又冲上火场，使新华书店的仓库免受损失。
    现在，沈阳市涌现出优秀消防员六十三人和十个先进单位。人民警察吴德福在抢救沈阳淀粉工厂火灾中，为了停止火灾蔓延，保护沈阳啤酒厂而壮烈牺牲，死后被追认为“人民警察特等功臣”。这些优秀人物和单位受到沈阳市公安机关的奖励和人民的爱戴；他们曾不断接到人民群众送来的锦旗和大批感谢信。（据新华社讯）
