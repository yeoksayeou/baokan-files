    Our Country Successfully Manufactures Whale Cannon
    Just after noon on March 22nd, a steel cannon-arrow weighing 8.1 kilograms was fired from a brand-new whale cannon. This was the first live round fired from a whale cannon made in our country.
    This whale cannon was manufactured by the workers of the First Branch of the Lüda Mechanical Hardware General Factory, 21 days ahead of schedule according to the plan. A month and a half ago, the workers of this factory were particularly happy to hear that they were going to manufacture whale cannons for the motherland. During the manufacturing process, the workers worked around the clock in shifts.
    At present, the whaling ship is also being built at an accelerated pace. It is expected that China's first whaling ship will be able to speed across the ocean in pursuit of whales in early April.

    我国自制捕鲸鱼炮成功
    三月二十二日的正午刚过，一支八点一公斤重的钢制炮箭，从一门崭新的捕鲸鱼炮里发射出来了。这是我国自造的捕鲸鱼炮发射的第一发实弹。
    这门捕鲸鱼炮是旅大机械五金总厂第一分厂职工按计划提前二十一天制造出来的。在一个半月以前，这个厂的职工们听说要为祖国制造捕鲸鱼炮，就格外高兴。在制造过程中，职工们轮班日夜不停地工作。
    目前，捕鲸鱼的船也正在加紧赶造中。预计在四月初，中国的第一艘捕鲸鱼轮就可飞驶在海洋上追捕鲸鱼了。
