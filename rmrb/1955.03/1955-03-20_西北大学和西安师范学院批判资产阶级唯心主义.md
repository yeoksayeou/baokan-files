Northwest University and Xi'an Normal College have systematically launched studies and discussions on criticizing Hu Shih's bourgeois idealist viewpoints and Hu Feng's bourgeois literary thoughts.

Currently, teachers in the Chinese Language and Literature, History, and Political Science departments, as well as the political teaching and research sections of Northwest University, have begun studying relevant documents. Teachers in the political teaching and research sections have also held preliminary forums to criticize Hu Shih's ideas. Teachers at Xi'an Normal College are also studying the documents.

During the learning and discussion process, Northwest University plans to focus on the Chinese Language and Literature, History, Economics, Law, and Political Science departments, as well as the political teaching and research sections, and combine professional work to separately criticize Hu Shih's reactionary idealist viewpoints as expressed in politics, philosophy, history, and literature. Xi'an Normal College has also formulated a plan to launch criticism of Hu Shih's reactionary idealist thought. Teachers will generally study and discuss articles criticizing Hu Shih's reactionary philosophical, political, and literary thought. Teachers in the Education Department also plan to further criticize Dewey's reactionary educational thought during their studies. (Xinhua News Agency)
