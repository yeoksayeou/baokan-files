    The broad masses of women in our country, after successive large-scale social reform movements and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement since liberation, and after the propaganda of the general task of the state's transition period and the liberation of Taiwan, have seen a significant improvement in their patriotic and socialist consciousness. They have played an active role and exerted tremendous power in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation, in industrial and agricultural production and cultural, educational, and health work, and in the struggle to support the liberation of Taiwan, defend the motherland, and defend peace. The fact that the Chinese people have been able to rapidly achieve a series of great political and economic victories since liberation is inseparable from the active participation of the broad masses of women. In all aspects of struggle and work, many women have grown into outstanding figures. Among them, 147 have been elected as representatives to the National People's Congress, and more than 980,000 have been elected as representatives to the grassroots People's Congresses. Many women also hold leading positions in people's governments at all levels. More than half of the national model workers in the textile industry are women. Women account for 4.17 percent of factory directors in the national machinery industry. Statistics from more than 7,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province show that more than 5,200 women serve as chairpersons or vice-chairpersons. Women account for 17 percent of professors and lecturers in national universities. Women account for 12 percent of the presidents of people's courts at all levels.
    Chinese women promote the revolutionary and construction cause of the people across the country through their heroic struggle and vigorous work. Simultaneously, they gradually achieve their own liberation as the revolutionary and construction cause of the people across the country triumphs. This fact demonstrates that the cause of women's liberation is closely linked to the cause of the entire nation and the people and cannot be separated. Women cannot seek their own liberation in isolation from the struggle tasks of the entire nation and the people, nor can the completion of the struggle tasks of the entire nation and the people be separated from the liberation of women.
    Today, as we celebrate International Women's Day on March 8th, our country's first Five-Year Plan has entered its third year, a year of decisive significance for the successful completion of the Five-Year Plan as scheduled. In order to build and transform our country into a great socialist nation, the Chinese people have many arduous tasks to complete, whether in urban or rural areas, and whether economically, politically, or culturally. At the same time, American imperialism is actively preparing for a new world war, directly threatening the Chinese people with atomic warfare, and intensifying its efforts to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan, and obstructing our socialist construction endeavors. In order to safeguard the security and independence of the motherland, to safeguard the integrity of our territorial sovereignty, and to ensure the smooth progress of the socialist construction cause, the Chinese people must resolutely struggle for the liberation of Taiwan, against aggression, against new wars, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. These tasks are the struggle tasks of the entire nation, and also the struggle tasks of the women across the nation. The women across the nation must more actively participate in the struggle to build a socialist motherland, liberate Taiwan, and defend peace, and at the same time, seek their own further and complete liberation through these struggles.
    In order to mobilize the women across the nation to participate in the struggle for socialist construction, the liberation of Taiwan, and the defense of peace, we must intensify socialist and patriotic education among the masses, and continuously raise the socialist and patriotic consciousness of the masses of women, so that they can ideologically unify the interests of the country with their own interests, and ideologically unify the victory of the socialist cause with their own complete liberation. This ideological education work is the prerequisite for organizing women to participate in the struggle on a larger scale.
    In order to mobilize the broad masses of women, we must also intensify the removal of various obstacles to women's progress, especially obstacles from the social consciousness aspect.
    After several years of large-scale political and social struggles, including the struggle to implement the Marriage Law, the remaining feudal ideas in our country on marriage, family, and women's issues have been gradually eliminated. However, it is clear that these remaining feudal ideas cannot be completely eliminated in a short period. In many areas, these remaining feudal ideas still hinder women's participation in socialist construction and various political activities to varying degrees. Many women are still enduring abuse from their parents-in-law and husbands, unable to make their own decisions about marriage, and their political and productive enthusiasm is suppressed and cannot be brought into play. In order to change this situation, we must thoroughly and conscientiously publicize and guarantee the realization of women's rights as stipulated in the Constitution, and strengthen the regular work of implementing the Marriage Law. This is to relieve women's personal suffering and enable women to truly obtain equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, social, and family life. At the same time, it is also to organize and mobilize women in our country on a larger scale to participate in the struggle for socialist construction, the liberation of Taiwan, and the defense of peace. Party and government leading organs at all levels, as well as youth, women's, and trade union organizations, must effectively assist in guaranteeing women's rights under the Constitution, implement the Marriage Law, combine various tasks to carry out ideological education among the people, continue to eliminate the remaining feudal ideas among the people, and create a favorable environment and conditions for women to participate in social and political activities.
    On the other hand, we must also oppose and criticize the bourgeois ideas reflected in marriage, family, and women's issues. Among men, we should resolutely oppose the bourgeois decadent style of those who discriminate against women, do not treat women with an equal comrade attitude, do not pay attention to protecting women's lives, freedom, and interests, and even use money and status to play with and insult women. We should use the weapon of law to punish those who violate laws and regulations on marriage and family issues, and eliminate the bad influence of their decadent style on the people. Among women, we should criticize the idea of despising labor, not working for food, relying on men, and seeking enjoyment, and promote and develop their new virtues of loving the motherland, loving the collective, loving labor, and caring for public property. Women should be educated to strive to become good workers in factories who actively increase production and practice economy and have high skills; in agriculture, they should strive to become good farmers who actively develop rural production and actively participate in and care for mutual aid and cooperation organizations; in various work positions, they should become advanced workers who love their work and selflessly labor for the people; in schools, they should become good students who are healthy, perform well, and study well; in families, they should become diligent housekeepers who serve the country's construction and support the liberation of Taiwan in all aspects. They should, like men, be highly vigilant against the enemy, resolutely implement the country's policies and laws, dare to speak out righteously about the shortcomings of state staff and work, and dare to expose and fight against illegal and undisciplined behavior. To this end, trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, and women's federations across the country must raise the ideological education of women cadres and the masses of women to the height it deserves. Various propaganda and education work organs and workers should, based on the principle of mobilizing both men and women together, conduct education equally for both men and women, especially in conjunction with the education on the general task of the state's transition period, and conduct long-term and unremitting practical education targeting the ideological characteristics of women, clearly drawing the line between feudalism, capitalism, and socialism in all aspects, encouraging the enterprising spirit of the masses of women, overcoming their sense of inferiority, and highly developing the enthusiasm of the masses of women for self-study and self-transformation.
    Facts should be used to educate women, so that they can see that as long as women are conscious and strive hard, they can show the same abilities and wisdom as men in all aspects of struggle and work. They should have full confidence and courage to participate in all aspects of the country's work and struggle, and strive for their bright and promising future. They should not have the idea of relying on men and looking down on themselves, but should carry forward the heroic spirit of the women of New China, contribute their wisdom and strength to the great cause of socialist construction and the struggle to defend the motherland, defend peace, and liberate Taiwan, and make contributions to the motherland and the people. They should participate in the struggle with men on an equal footing and with equal dignity, and should not degrade themselves to a position subordinate to men. They should resolutely fight against the corrupt and degenerate behavior of some men, and should not accommodate them, let alone affect their revolutionary enthusiasm and fighting will because of this.
    Opposing the remaining feudal ideas and bourgeois ideas on marriage, family, and women's issues is to establish socialist moral principles among people. All the people should understand that the real happiness in marriage and family life lies in mutual respect and love, mutual help, and common struggle for the early realization of a socialist society, and common struggle for the happiness of the people. Neither party should create pain for the other for selfish purposes, and build their own happiness on the pain of others. Truly conscious revolutionary comrades should regard the pain of others as their own pain. If one's own behavior causes pain to others, that is a criminal act for a true revolutionary, and one should feel ashamed. Moreover, it should be seen that the pain inflicted on others by one's own incorrect behavior is not only harm to some individuals, but also harm to the cause of the entire nation and the people. Because that incorrect behavior will affect the normal emotions of other people and the work entrusted to these people by the state and the people in a certain period and to a certain extent. Here, the issue of personal character and morality has political significance. It is one-sided and incorrect to regard marriage and family issues as merely personal private life issues.
    In view of the fact that the ideological viewpoints of feudalism and capitalism are still generally reflected in marriage, family, and women's issues to varying degrees across the country, and affect the marriage and family life of the working people to varying degrees, and affect women's enjoyment of due labor rights and political rights, thereby affecting their enthusiasm and initiative in participating in production and work, the party organizations and state organs across the country must consciously elevate the tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation during the transition period to the same important position as the tasks of socialist ideological education. It must be understood that establishing socialist moral qualities, and treating women, marriage, and family with socialist moral principles, is an important work that cannot be ignored in the entire socialist construction. Therefore, it is necessary to regularly combine the entire socialist ideological education and law-abiding education, adopt propaganda methods that combine reasoning with true stories, carry out propaganda and education work universally and deeply, promote the development of the new atmosphere of advocating socialist moral qualities, so that those who have ideological errors on women, marriage, and family issues can gradually draw a clear ideological line; so that those who are corrupt and degenerate and violate laws and regulations in marriage and family life can wake up and transform themselves. To this end, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, state organ staff, mass organization staff, propaganda and education workers, and literary and art workers should first establish socialist moral qualities, be consistent in word and deed, set an example with action, and literary and art workers should actively create and make greater contributions to establishing the socialist moral qualities of the entire society.
    The degree of women's consciousness is a measure of social civilization, and the improvement of the socialist moral qualities of the entire society is a force to promote women's progress. Therefore, strengthening women's socialist ideological consciousness is inseparable from the entire socialist ideological education. The improvement of the socialist moral qualities of the entire society will be an important guarantee for completing the great socialist construction and liberating Taiwan.
    Now the motherland is advancing rapidly, and all facts foretell an infinitely beautiful future for the people and the women across the country. The women across the country should study hard, further enhance their patriotism and socialist consciousness, and actively participate with men in the struggle to build a socialist motherland and liberate Taiwan, participate in the struggle against the use of atomic weapons, against American imperialist aggression, against war, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. Our country has 300 million women, which is a powerful force to overcome any difficulties and any enemies. The widespread mobilization and active participation of the women across the country will accelerate the great cause of socialist construction in our country and strengthen the forces of peace-loving forces around the world. The women and women workers across the country should work hard!

### 全国妇女动员起来，参加建设社会主义祖国解放台湾、保卫和平的伟大斗争

    全国妇女动员起来，参加建设社会主义祖国解放台湾、保卫和平的伟大斗争
    我国广大妇女经过解放以来各次大规模的社会改革运动和抗美援朝运动，经过国家过渡时期总任务的宣传和解放台湾的宣传，她们的爱国主义觉悟和社会主义觉悟已经有了显著的提高。她们在巩固人民民主专政和进行社会主义建设、社会主义改造的事业中，在工业农业生产和文化教育卫生工作中，在支援解放台湾、保卫祖国和保卫和平的斗争中，都发挥了积极的作用和巨大的力量。我国人民在解放以来能够迅速取得政治上和经济上一系列的伟大胜利，是和广大妇女的积极参加分不开的。在各方面的斗争和工作中，有许多妇女已经成长为杰出的人物。她们当中，有一百四十七人被选为全国人民代表大会的代表，有九十八万多人被选为基层人民代表大会的代表。在各级人民政府中，也有许多妇女担任着领导工作。全国纺织工业劳动模范中有一半以上是妇女。全国机械工业中有百分之四点一七的厂长是妇女。山西省七千多个农业生产合作社统计，有妇女五千二百多人担任着正副社长。全国高等学校的教授和讲师中，妇女占百分之十七。各级人民法院的院长中，妇女占百分之十二。
    我国妇女以自己英勇的斗争和奋发的工作促进着全国人民的革命和建设事业，同时也随着全国人民的革命和建设事业的胜利而逐步完成着妇女自身的解放。这个事实说明：妇女解放的事业是和整个国家和人民的事业紧密地联系在一起，不能分离的。妇女不能离开整个国家和人民的斗争任务而孤立地求得自身的解放，整个国家和人民的斗争任务的完成也不能离开妇女的解放。
    今天，当我们庆祝“三八”国际妇女节的时候，我国的第一个五年计划已经进入第三年，这是对五年计划的如期完成具有决定意义的一年。为了把我国建设和改造成为伟大的社会主义国家，无论在城市或农村，无论在经济上、政治上、文化上，我国人民都有许多艰巨的任务要完成。同时，美帝国主义正在积极准备新的世界战争，并且直接以原子战争威胁我国人民，加紧阻挠我国人民解放自己的领土台湾，阻挠我国的社会主义建设事业。我国人民为了保卫祖国的安全和独立，为了保卫自己领土主权的完整，为了社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，就必须坚决为解放台湾、反对侵略、反对新的战争、保卫远东和世界和平而斗争。这些任务是全国人民的斗争任务，同时也就是全国妇女的斗争任务。全国妇女必须更加积极地参加建设社会主义祖国、解放台湾和保卫和平的斗争，同时经过这些斗争来谋取自身的进一步彻底解放。
    为了把全国妇女动员起来参加社会主义建设、解放台湾和保卫和平的斗争，我们就必须加紧在群众中进行社会主义和爱国主义的教育，不断地提高妇女群众的社会主义觉悟和爱国主义觉悟，使她们把国家的利益和自己的利益在思想上统一起来，把社会主义事业的胜利和自身的彻底解放在思想上统一起来。这种思想教育工作，是在更大的规模上组织妇女参加斗争的前提。
    为了动员广大的妇女群众，我们还必须加紧扫除妇女前进中的各种障碍，特别是来自社会意识方面的障碍。
    经过几年来的各项大规模的政治社会斗争，包括贯彻婚姻法的斗争，我国人民在婚姻、家庭和妇女问题上的残余封建思想已经在逐步肃清。但是很明显，这种残余封建思想是不可能在短期间完全肃清的。在许多地区，这种残余封建思想还在不同程度上障碍着妇女参加社会主义建设和各种政治活动。有许多妇女至今仍在忍受着公婆丈夫的虐待，婚姻不能自主，她们的政治积极性和生产积极性受着压制而不能发挥。为了改变这种情形，我们就必须深入地切实地宣传和保证实现宪法所规定的妇女权利，加强贯彻婚姻法的经常工作，这是为了解除妇女的切身痛苦，使妇女确实能够在政治的、经济的、文化的、社会的、家庭的生活各方面获得同男子平等的权利，同时也是为了在更大的规模上把我国妇女组织和动员起来，参加社会主义建设和解放台湾、保卫和平的斗争，各级党政领导机关和青年、妇女的组织和工会组织，必须切实协助保障宪法上的妇女权利，贯彻婚姻法，结合各种工作对人民群众进行思想教育，继续扫除人民群众中的残余封建思想，为妇女参加社会政治活动创造有利的环境和条件。
    另一方面，我们还必须反对和批判那些反映在婚姻、家庭和妇女问题上的资产阶级思想。在男子中，应该坚决反对那些歧视妇女，不用平等的同志的态度对待妇女、不注意保护妇女的生命、自由和利益，甚至利用金钱和地位来玩弄妇女、侮辱妇女的资产阶级腐朽作风，以法律的武器制裁那些在婚姻和家庭问题上违法乱纪的人，肃清他们的腐朽作风在人民群众中所造成的不良影响。在妇女中，则应该批判那种轻视劳动、不劳而食、依赖男子，贪图享受的思想，提高和发扬她们爱祖国、爱集体、爱劳动、爱护公共财物的新品德。应该教育妇女在工厂中争取成为积极增产节约和技术高强的好工人；在农业上争取成为积极发展农村生产、积极参加和爱护互助合作组织的好农民；在各种工作岗位上成为热爱自己工作、为人民而忘我劳动的先进工作者；在学校成为身体好、工作好、学习好的好学生；在家庭成为勤劳治家、从各方面为祖国建设服务和支援解放台湾的好公民。她们应该同男子一样，对敌人有高度的警惕，对国家的政策法令坚决执行，对国家工作人员和工作上的缺点敢于仗义执言，对违法乱纪的行为敢于揭发斗争。为此，全国各地工会、青年团和妇联组织，必须把加强妇女干部和妇女群众的思想教育工作提到应有的高度；各种宣传教育工作机关和工作者，应该本着男女一齐发动的方针，对男女群众一视同仁地进行教育，尤其必须结合国家过渡时期总任务的教育，针对妇女的思想特点，进行长期不懈的切合实际的教育，从各个方面划清封建主义、资本主义和社会主义思想的界线，鼓励妇女群众的进取心，克服她们的自卑感，高度发挥妇女群众自我学习自我改造的积极性。
    应该用事实教育妇女，使她们看到妇女只要自觉起来，奋发努力，她们就能够在各方面的斗争和工作中表现出同男子一样的能力和智慧。她们应该有充分的信心和勇气来参加国家各方面的工作和斗争，争取自己光明远大的前途。她们完全不应该有依赖男子和看不起自己的思想，而应该发扬新中国妇女的英雄气概，在伟大的社会主义建设事业和保卫祖国，保卫和平，解放台湾的斗争中贡献自己的智慧和力量，为祖国和人民立功。她们应该以平等的地位和平等的人格同男子一道参加斗争，而不应该把自己降低到附属于男子的地位。对于某些男子中的腐化堕落行为，她们应该坚决斗争，而不应该迁就他们，更不应该为此而影响自己的革命热情和战斗意志。
    在婚姻、家庭和妇女问题上反对封建残余思想和资产阶级思想，就是要在人和人之间树立社会主义的道德原则。应该使所有的人民群众了解：在婚姻和家庭生活中的真正的幸福，在于互敬互爱，互相帮助，共同为社会主义社会的早日实现而斗争，共同为人民的幸福而斗争。任何一方都不应该为着自私的目的而给另一方制造痛苦，在别人的痛苦上面建立自己的幸福。真正自觉的革命同志，应该把别人的痛苦当成自己的痛苦。如果自己的行为使别人发生痛苦，那对于一个真正的革命者来说就是犯罪的行为，自己应该感到惭愧。而且应该看到：自己的不正确行为所加于别人的痛苦，不仅是对某一些个人的伤害，而且是对整个国家和人民事业的损害。因为那种不正确的行为在一定时期和一定程度上会影响另一些人的正常情绪和这些人所担负的国家和人民付予的工作。在这里，个人的品质和道德问题就具有了政治的意义。把婚姻和家庭问题看成仅仅是个人的私生活问题，那是片面的和不正确的。
    鉴于目前全国各地在婚姻、家庭和妇女问题上还普遍地不同程度地反映出封建主义和资本主义的思想观点，不同程度地影响着劳动人民的婚姻和家庭生活，影响着妇女享受应有的劳动权利和政治权利，从而影响到她们参加生产和参加工作的热情和积极性，所以全国各地的党组织和国家机关必须有意识地将过渡时期社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务同社会主义思想教育的任务提到同等重要的地位。必须了解：树立社会主义道德品质，以社会主义道德原则对待妇女、婚姻和家庭，是整个社会主义建设中不可忽视的重要工作。因此必须经常结合整个社会主义思想教育和守法教育，采用讲道理结合真人真事的宣传方法，普遍深入地进行宣传教育工作，促进崇尚社会主义道德品质的新风气的发展，使那些在妇女、婚姻、家庭问题上思想错误的人，逐步划清思想界线；使那些在婚姻和家庭生活上腐化堕落、违法乱纪的人，清醒过来，改造自己。为此，共产党员、青年团员、国家机关工作人员、群众团体工作人员、宣传教育工作者和文学艺术工作者，应该首先树立社会主义的道德品质，言行一致，以行动作表率，文学艺术工作者更应该积极创作，为树立整个社会的社会主义道德品质作出更大的贡献。
    妇女的觉悟程度是测量社会文明的标志，而整个社会的社会主义道德品质的提高又是推动妇女前进的力量。因此加强妇女的社会主义思想觉悟同整个社会主义思想教育是不可分离的。整个社会的社会主义道德品质的提高，将是完成伟大的社会主义建设和解放台湾的重要保证。
    现在祖国正在迅速前进中，一切事实都向全国人民和全国妇女预示着无限美好的将来。全国妇女都应该努力学习，进一步提高爱国主义和社会主义觉悟，同男子一道积极参加建设社会主义祖国和解放台湾的斗争，参加反对使用原子武器，反对美帝国主义侵略、反对战争、保卫远东和世界和平的斗争。我国妇女有三万万人，这是战胜任何困难和任何敌人的强大力量。我国妇女的广泛动员和积极参加，将使我国社会主义建设的伟大事业加快，使全世界爱好和平的力量加强。全国的妇女和妇女工作者努力啊！
