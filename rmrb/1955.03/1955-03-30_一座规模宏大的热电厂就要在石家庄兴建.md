Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, March 29th: A large-scale thermal power plant is about to start construction in Shijiazhuang, China's emerging textile industry center. Large quantities of construction materials such as rebar and cement are being continuously transported to the construction site, and construction preparations are proceeding rapidly. This thermal power plant will be built in two phases, and when completed, the electricity and heat energy it generates will be sufficient for four cities the size of Shijiazhuang today.

Shijiazhuang is located in the center of Hebei Province's cotton-producing area, which accounts for more than a quarter of the country's total cotton production, and is the intersection of the Beijing-Hankou, Shijiazhuang-Dezhou, and Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railways. In recent years, the textile industry has developed rapidly. When it was liberated in 1947, there was only one small private textile factory here; now, many new state-owned and locally state-owned textile factories have been established one after another, and the total number of spindles has increased by twenty-two times compared to when it was first liberated. The newly built state-owned Shijiazhuang No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, with approximately 100,000 spindles and 2,500 looms, and the expanded section of the locally state-owned Shijiazhuang Textile Factory, will be completed and put into production in the second half of this year. The degree of mechanized coal mining in the state-owned Jingxing Coal Mine, a coking coal producing area in the suburbs of the city, is also rapidly increasing, and the degree of mechanized coal mining in the first quarter of this year greatly exceeded the level of the same period last year. These rapidly developing industries require more and more electricity supply. The Shijiazhuang Thermal Power Plant is being built to meet this situation. The existing power plants in Shijiazhuang have all reached peak loads, and the demand for electricity for production and capital construction is still increasing. It is expected that the newly built thermal power plant in Shijiazhuang will begin to generate partial electricity next year, and will gradually supply electricity for the city's emerging industries. At the same time, the steam heat energy generated by the thermal power plant can also be supplied to textile, printing, and dyeing factories, etc., to reduce the boiler equipment of these factories and improve urban environmental sanitation.

    一座规模宏大的热电厂就要在石家庄兴建
    据新华社保定二十九日电：一座规模宏大的热电厂，即将在我国新兴的纺织工业中心——石家庄市动工建设。大批钢筋、水泥等建筑器材正源源运到工地，施工准备正在迅速进行。这座热电厂将分两期建设，全部建成后所发出的电力和热能，将足够四个现在石家庄市一样大小的城市使用。
    石家庄市地处棉花产量占全国四分之一强的河北省棉产区的中心，是京汉、石德（州）和石太（原）三大铁路的交叉点。这几年来，纺织工业发展很快，一九四七年刚解放时，这里只有一座小型的私营纺织工厂；而现在，许多国营和地方国营的新纺织厂一个连一个地建立起来了，纱锭总数比刚解放时增加了二十二倍。新建的拥有约十万纱锭和两千五百台布机的国营石家庄第二棉纺织厂、地方国营石家庄纺织厂的扩建部分，今年下半年将完工投入生产。市郊的炼焦煤产地——国营井陉煤矿，机械化采煤程度也在迅速增长，今年第一季度的机械化采煤程度就大大超过了去年同期的水平。这些在飞跃发展中的工业，都需要愈来愈多的电力供应。石家庄热电厂就是适应这种情况建设的。石家庄市原有的发电厂都已达到高峰负荷，而生产和基本建设的用电还是有增无已。石家庄新建的这座热电厂预计在明年开始局部发电以后，就可以逐步供应全市新兴的工业用电。同时，热电厂所产生的蒸汽热能还可以供给纺织，印染等工厂使用，以便减少这些工厂的锅炉设备，并改善城市环境卫生。
