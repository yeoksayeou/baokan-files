    Concerning the question of holding a great power conference,
    Bulganin answers questions from a TASS reporter
   [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th] TASS Moscow, March 26th: A question from a TASS reporter to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, and Bulganin's reply:

    At a press conference held by U.S. President Eisenhower on March 23rd, reporters asked him to explain his views on holding a meeting of the heads of government of the great powers. Eisenhower said that he believed that exploratory talks involving the foreign ministers could be held before such a meeting. As for the question of holding a great power heads of government meeting, the U.S. President said: "One must not abandon hope that some constructive steps can be taken at a new meeting." He believed that a great power heads of government meeting without an agenda could be convened, where all issues could be discussed.

    The TASS reporter informed the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, of this matter and asked him to state the Soviet government's attitude towards the U.S. President's remarks.

    Bulganin's reply to this question was as follows:

    As in the past, the Soviet government takes a favorable view of the U.S. President's proposal to convene a great power conference, if holding such a conference is to promote the easing of world tensions. In this regard, it can be stated first of all that the Soviet government has already proposed holding a four-power conference in the near future, at which the issue of the Austrian peace treaty can be resolved.

    就举行大国会议问题
    布尔加宁答塔斯社记者问
   【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：塔斯社记者向苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁提出的一个问题和布尔加宁给予的答复：
    在美国总统艾森豪威尔三月二十三日举行的记者招待会上，记者们要求他说明他对举行大国政府首脑会议的意见。艾森豪威尔说，他认为在举行这样一种会议以前，可以先举行有外长们参加的探讨性会谈。至于举行大国政府首脑会议问题，美国总统说：“决不能对在一次新的会议上能够采取某种建设性的步骤放弃希望。”他认为，可以召开一次没有议程的大国政府首脑会议，会上可以讨论一切问题。
    塔斯社记者把这件事告知了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，并且要求他说明苏联政府对美国总统这番话采取什么态度。
    布尔加宁对这个问题的答复如下：
    同以往一样，苏联政府以赞同的态度看待美国总统提出的召开大国会议的主张，如果举行这样一次会议是为了促进世界紧张局势的缓和的话。在这方面，首先可以说明，苏联政府已经建议在不久的将来举行一次四国会议，在这个会议上，可以解决对奥和约的问题。
