Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 28th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 27th, the French side continues to refuse a reasonable solution in the discussions regarding the French side handing over the Haiphong area and the Vietnamese side handing over the Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh areas.

　　On March 25th, at the meeting of the Vietnam Central Joint Armistice Commission, the French Union Forces side repeatedly stated its proposal: before the French Union Forces begin to partially withdraw its troops from the Haiphong area, the Vietnam People's Army should completely withdraw its troops from the entire Quang Ngai province and complete the handover of Quang Ngai province.

　　The French Union Forces side insisted on its unreasonable proposal and still disagreed with the correct proposal of the Vietnam People's Army delegation, which is that both sides should simultaneously withdraw troops and complete the handover of the areas under their respective control.

　　This attitude of the French Union Forces side shows that it is unwilling to correctly fulfill the armistice agreement, because everyone is very clear that the difficulties encountered by the Vietnam People's Army in terms of logistical arrangements are far greater than those encountered by the French Union Forces side.

    关于法方移交海防地区问题
    法方制造障碍拒绝合理解决
    【新华社河内二十八日电】据越南通讯社二十七日讯：在关于法方移交海防地区和越方移交广义、平定地区的讨论中，法方仍然拒绝合理的解决办法。
    三月二十五日，在越南中央联合停战委员会会议上，法兰西联邦部队方面反复申述它的建议：越南人民军部队在法兰西联邦部队开始自海防地区部分撤走它的部队以前，应该从广义全省完全撤出它的部队，并完成移交广义全省的工作。
    法兰西联邦部队方面坚持它的不合理的建议，并且仍不同意越南人民军代表团的正确建议，就是双方应该同时撤走军队并完成移交他们各自控制的地区的工作。
    法兰西联邦部队方面的这种态度说明它不愿意正确地履行停战协定，因为每个人都很清楚，关于后勤工作的安排，越南人民军方面遭遇的困难比法兰西联邦部队方面所遭遇到的要多得多。
