    Security and defense organizations in factories and mines in Benxi City have played a role.
    Many model units and individuals have emerged in the struggle against special agents and theft in factories and mines in Benxi City. Forty-seven security models, one security model unit, and nine security groups were rewarded by the Benxi City Public Security Bureau.
    Many factories' mass security and defense organizations cooperate with the security departments of factories and mines to expose hidden counter-revolutionaries. On one occasion, the members of the Li Keyu Security and Defense Group of the Taipinggou Iron Sulfide Mine discovered that eight counter-revolutionaries led by Dong Dengkui were attempting to carry out sabotage activities. The security and defense group immediately reported the situation to the public security department. After investigation and verification by the public security department, they were quickly arrested and two pistols were seized. In the struggle against thieves, the mass security and defense organizations also played a significant role. After a cooperative in a steel factory in Benxi City was robbed, Wang Fu, a member of the security and defense group, actively investigated and discovered clues, which he provided to the public security organ, resulting in the swift cracking of the theft case and the arrest of all five robbers.
    The security and defense organizations of some factories and mines also paid special attention to eliminating accidents and ensuring safe production. Wang Shuqin, the leader of the security and defense group of the Sanba Substation, was very careful in her work and able to conduct serious inspections. Since 1951, she has prevented more than ten accidents from occurring. All members of the security and defense group of a construction engineering company in Benxi City conscientiously implemented various safety systems. Since 1951, they have prevented a total of twenty-three accidents and achieved a record of more than eight hundred days without accidents. (Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    本溪市各工厂矿区
    治安保卫组织发挥了作用
    本溪市各工厂矿区在防特、防盗等斗争中出现许多模范单位和人物。有治安模范四十七人和一个治安模范单位、九个治安小组得到了本溪市公安机关的奖励。
    许多工厂的群众治安保卫组织配合厂矿的保卫部门，检举潜藏的反革命分子。有一次，太平沟硫化铁矿李克玉治安保卫小组的人员，发现了以董登奎为首的八名反革命分子企图进行破坏活动，治安保卫小组立即把情况报告给公安部门；经过公安部门侦察属实以后，很快逮捕了他们，并缴获了短枪两支。在和盗窃分子的斗争中，群众治安保卫组织也发挥了很大作用。本溪市钢厂的一个合作社在一次被抢劫以后，治安保卫小组组员王富积极进行调查，发现了线索，供给公安机关，结果迅速破获了盗窃案件，五名强盗全部落网。
    有些厂矿的治安保卫组织还特别注意消灭事故，保证安全生产。三八变电所治安保卫小组组长王淑琴，在工作中很细心，并能认真检查，她从一九五一年以来共防止了十多起事故的发生。本溪市一个建设工程公司的治安保卫小组全体组员，认真贯彻各项安全制度，从一九五一年以来，他们共防止了二十三起事故的发生，曾创造了八百多天无事故的成绩。　（据新华社讯）
