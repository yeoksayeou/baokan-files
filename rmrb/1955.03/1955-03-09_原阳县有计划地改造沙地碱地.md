Yuanyang County Plans to Transform Sandy and Alkaline Land

    Yuanyang County, Henan Province, is systematically transforming sandy and alkaline land. The county plans to plant rows of forest belts to form a forest network in the 637 square kilometers of low-lying, alkaline, dune, and drought-prone areas. In the higher-lying farmland, terraced fields will be constructed, and in the low-lying areas, ditches and platform fields will be dug. In addition, earthen embankments will be built to appropriately raise the roadbeds for cultivation, and small-scale flood storage ponds will be built on the drainage channels. This plan is to be completed in 1955 and 1956. Currently, nearly half of the protective forest network has been created, and three flood storage pond projects are nearing completion. After this year's summer and autumn harvests, the land consolidation work for the terraced fields, platform fields, and earthen embankments in the planted forest network areas will be completed.
    Yuanyang County is located in the old course of the Yellow River, and its terrain is low-lying, with frequent disasters such as waterlogging, wind and sand, and alkalization. In order to change this natural situation, key experiments have been conducted in this area since 1952, and the results have been good in recent years, with crop yields in the experimental areas increasing rapidly. After summarizing the experience in the winter of 1954, a two-year plan for transforming the county's natural features in 1955 and 1956 was formulated. (Xinhua News Agency)

    原阳县有计划地改造沙地碱地
    河南省原阳县有计划地改造沙地和碱地。全县计划在六百三十七平方公里的低洼、碱化、沙丘和常旱的地区，栽植一条条的林带，构成林网。并在地势较高的农田里构筑畦田，低洼处开掘成沟洫台田；另外再筑些土埂，适当地抬高耕作路基，在排水渠道上建筑起小型蓄洪池。这个计划要求在一九五五、一九五六两年内完成。目前，防护林网已经营造近一半，并有三处蓄洪池工程接近完成。在今年夏收和秋收以后，要完成已栽培的林网区的畦田、台田、土埂等土地整理工作。
    原阳县位于黄河故道，地势低洼，常年有内涝、风沙、碱化等灾害。为改变这一自然状况，从一九五二年起在这一地区进行重点试验，几年来效果良好，试验地区的作物产量都迅速提高。经过一九五四年冬的总结，制定了一九五五、一九五六年的两年改造全县自然面貌的计划。（新华社）
