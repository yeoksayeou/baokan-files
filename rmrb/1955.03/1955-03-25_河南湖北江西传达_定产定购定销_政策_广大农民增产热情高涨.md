Henan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Convey "Fixed Production, Fixed Purchase, Fixed Sales" Policy
    Broad Masses of Farmers' Enthusiasm for Increased Production Soars
    [By Our Newspaper] After over a thousand rural cadres in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, discussed the "Three Fixes" policy for grain, they said: This is a policy that rewards labor and rewards increased production. Lu Guoding, head of the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuangmiao Township, and others, expressed that they would lead cooperative members to actively find ways to increase the yield of wheat and other crops. Two hundred and seventeen agricultural production cooperative heads from Yiyang County, who were studying in the county seat, believed that the state's announcement of the "Three Fixes" policy for grain at the start of spring production was correct and timely and could boost farmers' production enthusiasm. The head of the Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative called the cooperative from the county seat late at night to report the news of the implementation of the "Three Fixes" for grain, instructing the members to study this policy well, do a good job in spring production, and strive for more grain. The Seventh Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongyang Village, Hengjian Township, Meng County, originally planned to plant 111 mu of cotton. After learning that the state would implement fixed sales of grain to better guarantee the grain needs of economic crop areas, they decided to expand the cotton fields by another 20 mu.
    The broad masses of rural cadres and farmers in Hubei Province regard the implementation of the "Three Fixes" for grain as encouraging news. When the Huanggang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of county, district, and township cadres to arrange for spring plowing production, the news of the implementation of the "Three Fixes" for grain arrived, and more than 800 cadres were very happy to welcome this policy. Xiong Yanqing, secretary of the Baiyi Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, said: "The implementation of the 'Three Fixes' for grain has improved the method of unified purchase and sales, making it more fair and reasonable. This will strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses and improve the masses' enthusiasm for production." The cadres attending the meeting unanimously expressed that they would actively lead the masses to do a good job in spring plowing production. Zhang Jiacai, a middle peasant in Zhangjiayan Township, Huangpi County, actively dredged pond mud the day after hearing the news of the implementation of the "Three Fixes" and promoted 15 other households to also dredge more than 1,600 dan of pond mud. The Yichi Yun and Yi Zhilun mutual aid teams in Wangjiazai, Yangmiao Township, in the same county, which had originally collapsed, have now been restored and are actively building water conservancy projects to strive for increased grain production. Under their leadership, local farmers have already built three ponds. After discussing the "Three Fixes" policy, the members of the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xujia Liangting Township, Yingcheng County, were unprecedentedly enthusiastic about production. Each production team immediately checked the growth of crops and generally top-dressed the wheat. The female members of the cooperative were very energetic in their work, with each person increasing from an average of 6.5 work points per day to 7 to 8 points.
    Farmers in Nanchang, Leping, Dongxiang, Anyi, Ji'an, and other counties in Jiangxi Province are unprecedentedly enthusiastic about production under the encouragement of the "Three Fixes" policy for grain. After the Xianjian Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party in Nanchang County conveyed the "Three Fixes" policy for grain on the evening of March 11, the farmer Li Xizai said: "Last year, we suffered a flood here, and grain was supplied in a timely manner. With the implementation of the 'Three Fixes,' we can be more at ease with production." On the first morning after the "Three Fixes" policy was publicized in this township, more than 50 farmers in Huangcun loaded trough carts with water and accumulated pond mud. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhaxia Township, First District, Anyi County, actively discussed and revised its production plan, identifying ten secrets to increase production, raising the original target of 300 jin per mu for early rice and 180 jin for late rice to 320 jin per mu for early rice and 210 jin for late rice, for a total increase of 12,000 jin of rice; in addition, they also planned to plant 20 mu of cotton. The Fifth Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qitang Township, Ji'an County, after studying the fields row by row and hill by hill, proposed a "three changes" plan to transform 22 mu of double-cropping land, 27 mu of double-cropping intercropping land, and 5.7 mu of dry land into paddy fields, striving for more grain. After eliminating some doubts about the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain, Hong Chuangguang, head of the Xingta Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taqian Township, Fourth District, Leping County, took the lead in taking out the money on hand to invest in the cooperative to buy fertilizer, and the members also took active action, completing a water weir in one day that could guarantee more than 160 mu of land.
