Produce More Vegetables to Meet the Needs of the Broad Masses
To produce more vegetables, especially to meet the needs of the broad masses in both urban and rural areas during the spring and winter seasons, a vegetable investigation team composed of agricultural technicians from the Ministry of Agriculture and major industrial and mining areas conducted investigations and research on soil, climate, varieties, and agricultural techniques in the Sijiqing Vegetable Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, the Yuanda Vegetable Production Cooperative in Dongran Village, and You'anmen Township and Xitiejianying Township in the Nan苑 District. The investigation team first learned about the actual conditions of each vegetable production cooperative, grasped the cultivation process of vegetables, and absorbed the planting experience of farmers. Then, they personally conducted planting experiments and scientific analysis to summarize the experience of improving vegetable varieties and increasing vegetable yields, and to spread it to various places.

The work of the vegetable investigation team will end in June this year. Their investigation and research work will greatly help to increase vegetable yields in various places. By Our Correspondent Gao Liang

    生产更多的蔬菜，供应广大人民的需要
    为了生产更多的蔬菜，特别是在春、冬两季供应广大城乡人民的需要，由农业部会同各大工矿区农业技术工作者组成的蔬菜调查团，在北京郊区四季青蔬菜生产合作社、东冉村远大蔬菜生产合作社和南苑区右安门乡、西铁匠营乡等地进行了土壤、气候、品种和农业技术的调查研究工作。调查团首先了解了各蔬菜生产合作社的实际情况，掌握了蔬菜的培育过程，并吸取农民的种植经验，然后再亲自作种植试验和科学分析，以便总结出改良蔬菜品种和提高蔬菜产量的经验，传播到各地去。
    蔬菜调查团的工作将于今年六月份结束。他们的调查研究工作对于提高各地蔬菜产量将有很大帮助。　本报记者　高　粮摄
