    Party unity is based on correct political principles and correct organizational principles, not on unprincipled harmony. Any leading cadre, when considering issues, is inevitably limited by his individual work position, his way of thinking, his level of understanding of the Party's policies, and the information he possesses. Therefore, on any major issue, the views of leading cadres cannot be completely consistent, let alone completely correct, before collective discussion. Only by bringing forward different opinions, engaging in collective discussion, promoting correct opinions, supplementing imperfect opinions, and criticizing erroneous opinions can we truly overcome differences and achieve a consensus. As long as it is for principled issues, as long as the Party's organizational principles are observed, such debates of differing opinions are beneficial and indispensable. If, after discussion, a consensus cannot be reached for the time being, it is of course impossible to endlessly argue, disregarding the needs of the work. At this time, the Party committee should make a resolution in accordance with the Party's principle of the lower level being subordinate to the higher level, the minority being subordinate to the majority, and the individual being subordinate to the organization. In special circumstances where a resolution cannot be made, it should request a decision from the higher-level leading body. This can constantly ensure the consistency of action of the leading core; at the same time, through practice, different opinions will eventually be unified. The benefit and necessity of collective leadership lie in this.

    Of course, not every kind of dispute is conducive to Party unity and advocated by the Party. Disputes conducted for personal purposes are unprincipled disputes; mixing personal motives in the debate of principled issues will also turn principled debates into unprincipled disputes. These unprincipled disputes will seriously undermine Party unity and hinder the cause of the Party and the people. Therefore, the Party resolutely opposes such unprincipled disputes.

    Currently, in some factories and mines, there is a phenomenon of unprincipled disputes to varying degrees between the Party committee secretary and the Party committee member who serves as factory director, between the secretary and deputy secretary of the Party committee, and between the factory director and deputy factory director, and between the manager and deputy manager, so that these units cannot form a strong leading core, and the work of these enterprises suffers. The situation of the Party committee of the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory is like this. The secretary of this Party committee and the member who serves as factory director, and between the secretary and deputy secretary, often stir up unnecessary arguments in the Party committee meetings for personal purposes, or turn principled disputes into unprincipled disputes. Once, the higher-level economic authorities gave the factory an important task of manufacturing a certain product. The factory director delayed it for a long time and refused to actively manufacture it, ignoring the urging of the higher-level authorities several times. When someone was sent by higher authority to urge him, the factory director even scolded the comrade who was sent. According to the instructions of the CPC Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee, the factory's Party committee proposed to give the factory director a Party warning. This matter is a matter of principle, it is not complicated, and the right and wrong are very clear. However, it caused a great dispute at the Party committee meeting, and six or seven Party committee meetings were held specifically for this matter without any result. When discussing the issue of disciplinary action against the factory director, the meeting did not analyze and criticize the factory director's mistakes, but argued about who was trying to get at whom. The factory director said that this was the Party committee secretary trying to get at him, so he found various excuses to refuse to accept criticism and disciplinary action. The other two Party committee members who served as deputy factory directors also dragged the issue to the secretary's attempt to get at the factory director, so they abandoned principles to defend the factory director. Some members tried to please both sides and dared not adhere to the truth. When the Party committee discussed other issues, it often abandoned the theme and argued about whether the Party committee had the final say or the factory director had the final say, whether the factory director was greater or the Party committee was greater, and so on, sometimes even causing the Party committee meeting to break up unhappily, without making a resolution or conclusion. When the Party committee is caught in such unprincipled disputes, it is difficult to pay attention to the serious problems in the work. In 1954, this factory failed to complete or fully complete the state plan for eleven consecutive months, the quality of products was poor, and accidents occurred frequently. Not a single one of the fifty-eight vehicles produced in September was qualified. Regarding these serious problems in production, the Party committee abandoned its responsibilities and let it go.

    The situation of the Party committee of the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory is not an isolated case. In many industrial and mining enterprises, there are some leading cadres who are engaged in unprincipled disputes, hindering unity to varying degrees. They compete with each other for the height of their position, compare the size of their powers, and talk about the quality of their treatment. Therefore, they despise each other, suspect each other, and undermine each other in their work. They often confuse principled issues with personal disputes, using the pretext of discussing issues to attack others and vent their dissatisfaction, which makes it difficult for leading cadres to distinguish right from wrong, and problems cannot be solved. They are also unwilling to respect the opinions of others or make necessary compromises on many small issues that are not related to major principles, and even deliberately pick on and attack each other. Some comrades also know that it is wrong to be disunited. Therefore, they deliberately describe this kind of unprincipled dispute as "administrative cadres resisting the leadership of the Party," or "the Party committee attacking administrative prestige," etc., or deliberately "raise" the issue to the level of guidelines and policies, in order to aggravate the other party's "crimes" and cover up their own ugliness. Some of them even deviate from the Party's organizational principles, saying one thing to one's face and another behind one's back, attacking others to elevate themselves, not hesitating to spread rumors, and even engaging in small factions, seriously undermining Party unity. The result of such unprincipled disputes is, like the Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory, to disintegrate the Party's combat effectiveness, weaken the Party's leading role in the enterprise, and seriously affect the completion of the state plan.

    How should we deal with these unprincipled disputes? Comrade Liu Shaoqi once pointed out in "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists": "We fundamentally oppose unprincipled disputes within the Party. Because it is 'unprincipled,' it is harmful and useless to the Party. Because it is 'unprincipled,' there is not much 'right, wrong, good, and evil' to distinguish, so we should not judge who is right and who is wrong in unprincipled struggles, or care about who is good and who is bad, because this cannot be clarified. We can only fundamentally oppose this kind of struggle, and ask the comrades who are engaged in this kind of struggle to unconditionally stop this kind of struggle and return to principled issues." Comrade Shaoqi also pointed out that if many unprincipled issues are mixed in principled struggles, then it is necessary to focus on solving the principled issues, and not to focus on the unprincipled issues.

    When the Party organizations in enterprises, or the provincial and municipal Party committees, deal with these disunity problems among cadres, they should ask them to immediately stop all kinds of unprincipled disputes, find out the differences of opinion that truly exist between them on principled issues, and lead them to discuss these principled issues, so that everyone's understanding and actions can be consistent. At the same time, the Party organization should also educate these comrades to consciously criticize their individualistic thoughts and arrogant and complacent emotions, and educate everyone to put the interests of the Party first at all times, discard their burdens, see more of the advantages of their comrades, learn more from the strengths of others, and provide comrades with shortcomings with positive, comradely assistance. Educate every Party member to have the courage to safeguard the interests of the Party and wage irreconcilable struggles against all acts that harm the interests of the Party on principled issues; but on non-principled, minor issues, they must be good at compromising with others, be good at respecting each other, and not adhere to their own opinions. For those who seriously affect Party unity and cause serious losses to production due to unprincipled disputes, the Party's leading bodies should also give them appropriate disciplinary action.

    Some leading cadres in enterprises sincerely hope that the leading cadres can unite and avoid all unprincipled disputes. The intentions of these comrades are very good. However, they have adopted methods that violate the Party's principles of life to strive for unity. They hope that there will be no differences or disputes between leading cadres, and that their opinions will be consistent at all times. In fact, this situation will not exist. Therefore, whenever different opinions appear, they rush to cover up differences and avoid disputes. When disputes are unavoidable, they are afraid of being involved; they dare not clearly express their opinions on disputes over principled issues; they dare not criticize or stop unprincipled disputes; they only mediate and persuade, and try to appease people, so that disputes will not unfold. They are afraid that if they have disputes with other comrades, they will be misunderstood as "creating disunity" or "creating relationship problems." This kind of concern is unnecessary. It is right to be wary of getting involved in unprincipled disputes. However, for principled struggles, every Communist Party member should be brave and fearless. In order to clarify the truth and safeguard the interests of the Party, even if others temporarily misunderstand them as "creating disunity," the truth will eventually come to light. It must be pointed out that some provincial and municipal Party committees see that there are often disputes and struggles among the leading cadres of some factories, and sometimes, without clarifying the facts or distinguishing whether these disputes are principled struggles or personal disputes, they simply treat them as relationship problems. This bureaucratic work style does indeed increase the concerns of some comrades when conducting principled struggles. This must also be corrected.

    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out that Party unity is the life of the Party. At present, with the work in factories and mines being so complex and the tasks being so arduous, there is a particular need for a united and strong leading core. In order to smoothly promote the great cause of our socialist industrialization, the Party organizations in enterprises, every leading cadre, the leading bodies of the Party at all levels, and the economic leading bodies at all levels should always pay attention to preventing and eliminating unprincipled disputes among leading cadres, and safeguard the unity of the leading core in factories and mines.

### 必须消除无原则纠纷

    必须消除无原则纠纷
    党的团结是在正确的政治原则和正确的组织原则基础上的团结，而不是无原则的一团和气。任何一个领导干部，在考虑问题时，都不免受他个人的工作岗位、思想方法、对党的政策理解的水平、以及所掌握情况的限制。因此，任何一个重大问题，在没有经过集体的讨论以前，领导干部的看法就不可能都是完全一致的，更不可能都是完全正确的。只有把不同的意见提出来，经过集体的讨论，发扬正确的意见，补充不完善的意见，批判错误的意见，才能真正克服分歧而取得一致的认识。只要是为着原则性的问题，只要是遵守党的组织原则，这样的不同意见的争论是有益的，而且是不可少的。有些问题经过讨论，如果一时不能取得一致的认识，当然不能不顾工作的需要而无休止地争论下去，这时党委会就应当按照党的下级服从上级、少数服从多数、个人服从组织的原则做出决议，在不能做出决议的特殊情况下就应当请求上级领导机关决定。这样就可以经常保证领导核心行动的一致；同时，经过实践，也终于会把不同的意见最后统一起来。集体领导的利益和必要，正在于此。
    当然，并不是任何一种争论都是有利于党的团结而为党所提倡的。为了个人的目的去进行的争论，就是无原则纠纷；在争论原则问题时掺杂个人目的，也会把原则争论弄成无原则纠纷。这些无原则纠纷会严重地破坏党的团结，妨碍党和人民的事业。因此，党是坚决反对这种无原则纠纷的。
    目前，在一部分厂矿企业中，党委书记和担任厂长职务的党委委员之间、党委的书记副书记之间、厂长副厂长、经理副经理之间，程度不同地存在着闹无原则纠纷的现象，以致这些单位不能形成坚强的领导核心，这些企业的工作受到损害。大连工矿车辆厂的党委会的情况就是这样。这个党委会的书记和担任厂长职务的委员之间、书记和副书记之间，他们常常为了个人目的在党委会议上掀起不必要的争论，或者把原则性的争论弄成无原则纠纷。有一次，上级经济机关给予该厂制造某种产品的重要任务。厂长长期拖延不肯积极制造，上级几次催办他都置之不理。上级派人来催促，厂长竟把派来的同志骂了一顿。工厂的党委会根据中共旅大市委会的指示，提出要给厂长以党内警告处分。这件事情是原则问题，它并不复杂，是非也非常清楚。但是，却在党委会上惹起了很大的纠纷，为这件事专门召开了六七次党委会议还是没有结果。在讨论对厂长的处分问题时，会议上没有分析批判厂长的错误，而在争吵着谁整谁的问题。厂长说这是党委书记在整他，因而找出种种借口不肯接受批评和处分。另外两位担任副厂长职务的党委委员也把问题扯到书记整厂长上面，于是放弃原则去替厂长辩护。有的委员则两面讨好，不敢坚持真理。党委会在讨论其他问题时，也常常抛开主题，去争论究竟是党委说了算还是厂长说了算，是厂长大还是党委大等等，有时甚至弄得党委会议不欢而散，做不出决议和结论。党委会陷入这种无原则的纠纷中，就很难去关心工作中的严重问题。一九五四年，这个工厂一连十一个月没有完成或没有全面完成国家计划，产品质量低劣，事故频繁，九月份生产的五十八辆车没有一辆合格。对于生产中的这些严重问题，党委会却放弃了自己的职责，听之任之。　　像大连工矿车辆厂党委会这样的情况并不是个别的。在不少工矿企业中都有这么一些领导干部，闹着无原则的纠纷，程度不等地妨害着团结。他们彼此争地位的高低，比职权的大小，讲待遇的好坏，因此，在工作中互相瞧不起，互相猜忌，互相拆台。他们常常把原则问题和个人纠纷混搅在一起，借讨论问题为名去打击别人，发泄自己的不满，这就弄得领导干部之间是非不清，问题没法解决。他们在许多与重大原则无关的细小问题上，也不肯尊重别人的意见，也不做必要的妥协，甚至故意挑剔，互相攻击。有些同志也知道闹不团结是错误的，于是，他们就把这种无原则纠纷故意说成是什么“行政干部对抗党的领导”，什么“党委打击行政威信”等等，或者故意把问题“提高”到方针政策上来，用以加重对方的“罪过”和掩盖自己的丑恶。他们中有的人甚至离开了党的组织原则，当面一套背后一套，打击别人抬高自己，不惜散布流言蜚语，以至拉拉扯扯搞小宗派，严重地破坏党的团结。这样闹无原则纠纷的结果，就是像大连工矿车辆厂那样，涣散党的战斗力，削弱党在企业中的领导作用，严重地影响国家计划的完成。
    应该怎样来对待这些无原则纠纷呢？刘少奇同志在“论共产党员的修养”中曾经指出：“党内无原则的纠纷，我们是在根本上反对的。因为它‘无原则’，对党有害无益。因为它‘无原则’，所以没有多大‘是、非、善、恶’可分，所以我们不要在无原则斗争中去评判谁是谁非，去计较谁好谁歹，这是弄不清楚的。我们只有在根本上反对这种斗争，要求进行这种斗争的同志，无条件地停止这种斗争，回到原则问题上来。”少奇同志同时指出，如果在原则斗争中夹杂着许多无原则的问题，那么，就必须着重解决原则问题，而不要去着重无原则问题。
    企业中的党组织，或省、市党委会来处理干部中的这些不团结问题时，就应该这样要求他们立即停止各种无原则纠纷，找出他们之间真正在原则问题上的分歧意见，领导他们对这些原则问题展开讨论，使大家的认识和行动都能一致起来。同时，党组织还应该教育这些同志自觉地去批判自己的个人主义思想和骄傲自大情绪，教育大家在任何时候都应该把党的利益放在前面，丢掉自己的包袱，多看同志们的优点，多学习别人的长处，对有缺点的同志应该进行同志式的积极的帮助。教育每一个党员在原则问题上，要有维护党的利益、向一切损害党的利益的行为做不调和斗争的勇气；但是在非原则的细小问题上，又要善于和别人妥协、善于互相尊重，而不要坚持己见。对于那些因为闹无原则纠纷而严重地影响党的团结使生产受到严重损失的人，党的领导机关还应给他们以适当的纪律处分。
    有一部分企业领导干部，他们诚心诚意地希望领导干部之间能够团结一致，避免一切无原则纠纷。这些同志的用心是很好的。但是，他们却采取了违犯党的生活原则的办法去争取团结。他们希望领导干部之间没有分歧、没有争论，任何时候意见都是一致的。事实上，这种情况是不会有的。于是，一遇到不同的意见出现，他们就赶忙设法掩盖分歧，避免争论。当争论不可免时，他们又生怕牵扯到自己；对原则问题的争论，他们不敢明确地表示自己的意见；对于无原则的纠纷，他们也不敢批评制止；只是从中调和劝解，息事宁人，使争论不要展开。他们害怕如果和别的同志有争论，就会被别人误认为是“闹不团结”，是“闹关系问题”。这种顾虑是不必要的。警惕到不卷入无原则纠纷是对的。但是，对于原则斗争，任何一个共产党员都应该是勇敢无畏的。为了辨明真理、维护党的利益，即使被别人暂时误会为“闹不团结”，但问题终究会水落石出的。必须指出，有一些省、市党委看到有些工厂的领导干部中经常有争论有斗争，有时不弄清事实，不分辨这些争论究竟是原则斗争还是个人纠纷，就简单地当做关系问题处理，这种官僚主义作风也确实使某些同志进行原则斗争时增加了顾虑。这也是必须纠正的。
    党的七届四中全会指出，党的团结是党的生命。在目前厂矿中的工作如此复杂、任务如此艰巨的情况下，特别需要一个团结一致的坚强的领导核心。为了顺利推进我们社会主义工业化的伟大事业，企业中的党组织、每一个领导干部、各级党的领导机关和各级经济领导机关都应该时刻注意防止和消除领导干部间的无原则纠纷，维护厂矿企业中领导核心的团结一致。
