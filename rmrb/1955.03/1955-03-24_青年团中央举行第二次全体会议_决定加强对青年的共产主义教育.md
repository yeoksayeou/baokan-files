Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd:

    The Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League was held from February 16th to 26th. The central topic of the meeting was how to further strengthen communist education for youth.

    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a work report at the meeting, which was discussed by the attendees.

    Before and during the meeting, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the current situation of the Youth League's work and gave instructions.

    The meeting held that in the past year or so, the Youth League has achieved new successes in mobilizing and organizing the vast number of young people to participate in various undertakings of socialist construction and socialist transformation, and has played the role of an assistant to the Party. The Youth League's work has also paid more attention to the characteristics of young people and their special requirements; at the same time, the Youth League's organization has been further developed, and there are now 13 million Youth League members nationwide; the Youth League's leadership style has also become more practical, specific, vivid, and lively than before.

    The meeting discussed in detail the issue of strengthening communist education for youth. The meeting pointed out that the Youth League has always been an organization that assists the Party in educating youth in the spirit of communism. At present, when the country is carrying out socialist construction in a comprehensive and systematic way, the Party and the state have greater expectations for the younger generation. Especially at present, there is still a bourgeoisie in our country, and building our country into a great socialist country is an extremely complex and acute struggle. However, the Youth League organizations have not done enough in communist education for youth, and the political, cultural, and technical levels of young people cannot meet the requirements of the Party and the state. Therefore, strengthening communist education for youth in a long-term and in-depth manner has become an important task for Youth League organizations at all levels.

    Regarding how to strengthen communist education for youth, the meeting held that labor education is the fundamental issue for carrying out communist education for youth. Therefore, the Youth League must first further organize and give play to the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of young people in building a socialist society, and overcome the ideas and behaviors of young people who despise manual labor, are not content with ordinary labor, and do not abide by labor discipline. When carrying out labor education, advanced young people in production and work should be discovered, cultivated, and publicized, advanced youth shock brigades and youth teams and groups should be promoted, various activist conferences should be held well, and public welfare labor should be appropriately promoted. At the same time, attention should be paid to mobilizing and helping young people to engage in technical learning.

    Strengthening national defense education for youth is also an important part of communist education. The Youth League should encourage and stimulate the patriotic enthusiasm of young people through various forms of education, and should conduct propaganda on military service for young people so that every young person realizes that defending the motherland is their sacred duty. Military sports activities should be appropriately increased in the activities of the Youth League, the ties between young people in the front and rear should be strengthened, and the great history of the motherland and the stories of various revolutionary struggles should be used to cultivate the patriotic enthusiasm and revolutionary heroism of young people.

    The meeting pointed out that the work that has already been launched in various places to cultivate the communist moral character of young people and resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology needs to be carried out steadily and in depth in combination with various struggles. Youth League organizations at all levels should explain to young people what communist moral character is, promote the spirit of diligence, thrift, integrity, and honesty among young people, and resolutely fight against hooligans, bandits, and illegal capitalists who seduce young people to commit crimes. When carrying out this work, various typical cases should be fully utilized for education, and the policy of persuasion and education should be adhered to. The meeting also emphasized that it is necessary to resist and criticize bourgeois idealist viewpoints among young intellectuals, and to organize young people to study dialectical materialism in a step-by-step manner. At the same time, in the work of resisting the erosion of bourgeois ideology, young people are encouraged to fight against bad people and bad deeds, and to bravely expose various phenomena of corruption, waste, and violation of laws and discipline.

    The Youth League should also comprehensively care for and step by step meet the special requirements of young people. At present, the main thing is to care about the lives of young people, strengthen young people's spare-time cultural activities, so that young people can get comprehensive development and become happy, healthy, and brave young people. The content of spare-time cultural activities should be rich and diverse. At present, the focus is on carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy among young people, as well as organizing and guiding young people to read books and newspapers, and carry out art and sports activities. When carrying out these activities, the principles of spare time and voluntariness should be observed, and they should be carried out in a measured manner, so as not to affect the central work and the health of young people.

    This meeting also made provisions for the tasks of the Youth League's organizational construction. In the future, it is still necessary to continue to implement the policy of consolidating and developing forward, to strengthen the Youth League's organization in a planned way, and to improve the Youth League's combat effectiveness. The meeting also required all Youth League cadres to establish a style of daring to work, never being proud, going deep into reality, collective leadership, and learning with an open mind.

    The meeting finally adopted the "Decision on Convening a National Conference of Young Socialist Construction Activists" and the "Decision on Strengthening Young People's Spare-time Cultural Work."

    Ninety-five members of the Central Committee of the Youth League, thirty-five alternate members of the Central Committee, and one hundred and nine responsible cadres of the League attended the meeting.

    青年团中央举行第二次全体会议
    决定加强对青年的共产主义教育
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会在二月十六日到二十六日举行了第二次全体会议。会议的中心议题是关于进一步加强对青年的共产主义教育问题。
    青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦在会上作了工作报告，到会的人讨论了这个报告。
    在会议以前和会议中间，中国共产党中央委员会书记处研究了当前团的工作情况，并作了指示。
    这次会议认为，一年多来，青年团在动员和组织广大青年参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各项事业方面，获得了新的成绩，发挥了党的助手作用；青年团的工作也较前更加注意了照顾青年特点和重视青年的特殊要求；同时在这一期间，青年团的组织也进一步得到了发展，全国现在已有青年团员一千三百万人；青年团的领导作风也较前切实、具体、生动、活泼了。
    会议详细地讨论了加强对青年的共产主义教育问题。会议指出，青年团从来就是协助党以共产主义精神教育青年的组织。在当前国家正全面地系统地进行社会主义建设中，党和国家对年轻一代期望更大。特别是目前我们国内还存在着资产阶级，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，这是一个极复杂极尖锐的斗争。但是青年团组织对青年的共产主义教育做得还不够，青年的政治、文化、技术水平还不能适应党和国家的要求。因此，长期地、深入地进一步加强对青年的共产主义教育，就成为各级团组织的重要任务。
    关于如何加强对青年的共产主义教育问题，会议认为，劳动教育是对青年进行共产主义教育的根本问题。因此，青年团首先要进一步组织和发挥广大青年建设社会主义社会的劳动热情，克服青年中轻视体力劳动，不安心于平凡劳动，不遵守劳动纪律等思想和行为。在进行劳动教育时，应发现、培养和宣传在生产和工作中的先进青年，推广先进的青年突击队和青年班、组，开好各种积极分子大会，并适当地提倡公益劳动。同时，应注意动员和帮助青年进行技术学习。
    加强对青年的国防教育，也是共产主义教育的一个重要部分。青年团应通过各种教育鼓励和激发青年的爱国主义热情，应对青年进行服兵役的宣传，使每个青年都认识到保卫祖国是他们的神圣职责。要在青年团的活动中适当增加军事体育活动，加强前后方青年的联系，并且要善于用祖国伟大的历史和各种革命斗争的故事来培养青年的爱国热情和革命英雄主义。
    会议指出，目前各地已经展开的培养青年共产主义道德品质，抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的工作，需要结合各种斗争稳步地深入下去。青年团各级组织都应当向青年解释什么是共产主义的道德品质，在青年当中提倡勤劳、俭朴、正直、诚实的作风，并且向勾引青年犯罪的流氓、盗匪和不法资本家作坚决的斗争。在进行这项工作时，应当充分运用各种典型事例进行教育，并应坚持贯彻说服教育的方针。会议还着重指出，要在知识青年中抵制和批判资产阶级唯心观点，有步骤地组织青年进行辩证唯物论的学习。同时，在抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的工作中，鼓励青年和坏人坏事进行斗争，勇敢地揭发各种贪污、浪费和违法乱纪的现象。
    青年团还应全面地关心和有步骤地满足青年的特殊要求。目前，主要是关心青年的生活，加强青年业余文化活动，使青年们能得到全面的发展，成为愉快、健壮而勇敢的青年。业余文化活动的内容应该丰富多样，目前着重是在青年群众中进行扫除文盲的工作，以及组织和指导青年阅读书报、开展艺术和体育等活动。在开展这些活动时，应遵守业余和自愿的原则，并有节制地进行，以免影响中心工作和青年的健康。
    这次会议对团的组织建设任务也作了规定，今后仍需继续贯彻巩固地向前发展的方针，有计划地壮大团的组织，提高团的战斗力。会议并要求青年团全体干部要树立大胆工作，永不骄傲，深入实际，集体领导和虚心学习的作风。
    会议最后通过了“关于召开全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的决定”和“关于加强青年业余文化工作的决定”。
    出席这次会议的青年团中央委员九十五人，候补中央委员三十五人；列席会议的团的负责干部一百零九人。
