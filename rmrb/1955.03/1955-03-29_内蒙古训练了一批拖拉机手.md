    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region now has a new group of Mongolian and Han tractor drivers.
    The first class of more than sixty students in the tractor driver training course held by the Autonomous Region graduated on March 15 after ten months of study. Most of these students have been assigned to the Hulunbuir League and the fertile West Liao River Plain in the Autonomous Region, and a small number of students will be sent to the Daqing Mountain area of Inner Mongolia. Some of them will work in agricultural machinery stations and state-owned mechanized farms in agricultural areas, and some will work in state-owned ranches and grassland work stations in pastoral areas. Now, this group of new tractor drivers is heading towards their glorious posts with full confidence. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古训练了一批拖拉机手
    内蒙古自治区已有一批新的蒙族和汉族男女拖拉机手了。
    自治区举办的拖拉机驾驶员训练班第一期六十多名学员，经过十个月的学习，三月十五日已经毕业。这些学员大部分被分派到自治区的呼伦贝尔盟和土地肥沃的西辽河平原，少数学员将被派赴内蒙古大青山地区。他们有的到农业区的农业机器站和国营机耕农场工作，有的到牧业区的国营牧场和草原工作站工作。现在，这批新的拖拉机手已满怀信心地走向自己光荣的工作岗位。　（新华社）
