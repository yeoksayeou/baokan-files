Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives recently issued instructions on supply work during the spring plowing season. The instructions stated: The main task of supply and marketing cooperatives during the spring plowing season is, under the unified leadership of the Party and government, to continue to deeply implement the policy of serving agricultural production. They should concentrate their main efforts and, in accordance with the changes in farmers' needs in the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, promptly ensure the supply of spring plowing production materials and means of livelihood, in order to achieve the planned promotion of increased agricultural production and the development of mutual aid and cooperation. Supply and marketing cooperatives in disaster areas should help disaster victims do a good job in supplying and adjusting draught animals, seeds, and feed. To complete these tasks, it is also necessary to implement the policy of transforming rural private merchants, enlivening the rural economy, smoothing the exchange between urban and rural areas, and leading the entire rural market to serve the current spring plowing production.

The instructions continued: In terms of the supply of agricultural production materials, assisting farmers to increase the application of fertilizer is a major task to ensure increased agricultural production. Supply and marketing cooperatives must cooperate with the government to conscientiously implement the principle of "farmers' manure as the main source, commercial fertilizer as a supplement." They should tap the potential of local miscellaneous fertilizers and conscientiously manage miscellaneous fertilizers. Chemical fertilizers and cake fertilizers should be centrally supplied to grain-producing areas and areas that mainly produce industrial raw materials, according to the state's agricultural production increase plan. At present, draught animals are still the main power for agricultural production, and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively organize feed supply in cooperation with grain departments to ensure the supply of feed for spring plowing draught animals and organize the adjustment of draught animals.

The instructions pointed out that in terms of agricultural implements, supply and marketing cooperatives should do a good job in promoting double-wheeled, double-shared plows. In areas where they have been adopted and promoted, it is necessary to supply parts at the same time and solve farmers' difficulties in repair and maintenance, such as organizing repair stations and mobile repair teams. In addition, the instructions made detailed arrangements for the supply of pesticides, agricultural machinery, old-style agricultural implements, and building materials.

The instructions emphasized that in spring plowing production, supply and marketing cooperatives should closely integrate with agricultural production cooperatives and sign pre-purchase or combined contracts with them. Major production materials such as commercial fertilizers and new-style animal-powered agricultural implements should be given priority in supply. The needs of general mutual aid organizations and individual farmers should also be met as much as possible in terms of the supply of general production materials.

The instructions concluded: In order to assist farmers in doing a good job in spring plowing production, supply and marketing cooperatives must improve the supply of general means of livelihood, continue to overcome the conservative idea of being reluctant to sell, guarantee timely supply according to plan, and actively consult with relevant departments to meet farmers' requirements in terms of variety and quantity.

    合作总社指示所属做好春耕期间物资供应
    【新华社九日讯】中华全国供销合作总社最近发出关于春耕期间供应工作的指示。指示说：春耕期间供销合作社供应工作的主要任务是在党、政统一领导下，继续深入地贯彻为农业生产服务的方针。集中主要力量，根据农业生产互助合作运动发展中农民需求的变化，及时地做好春耕生产资料和生活资料的供应，以达到有计划地促进农业增产和互助合作的发展。灾区供销合作社要帮助灾民做好耕畜、种籽、饲料的供应和调剂工作。要完成上面这些任务，还要贯彻改造农村私商的政策，活跃农村经济，畅通城乡交流，领导农村整个市场来为当前的春耕生产服务。
    指示接着说：在农业生产资料供应方面，协助农民增施肥料是保证农业增产的一项主要工作。供销合作社必须配合政府认真贯彻“农家积肥为主，商品肥料为辅”的方针。挖掘地方杂肥潜力，认真经营杂肥。化学肥料和饼肥应根据国家的农业增产计划，集中地供应到粮食产区和主要生产工业原料的地区。目前耕畜仍是农业生产的主要动力，供销合作社要协同粮食部门积极组织饲料供应，保证春耕耕畜饲料供应和组织耕畜调剂工作。
    指示指出，在农具方面，供销合作社要做好双轮双铧犁的推广工作。在已经采用和推广的地区，必须同时供应零件和解决农民修配的困难，如组织修配站和流动修配组等。此外，对农药、农械、旧式农具和建筑材料等的供应工作，指示都作了详细的安排。
    指示强调指出，在春耕生产中，供销合作社要和农业生产合作社密切结合，和他们订立预购或结合合同。主要的生产资料如商品肥料、新式畜力农具等应优先予以供应。对一般互助组织和个体农民在一般生产资料供应方面也要尽量满足他们的需要。
    指示最后说：为协助农民搞好春耕生产，供销合作社必须改善一般生活资料的供应，继续克服保守惜售思想，按计划保证及时地供应并主动地和有关部门协商，从品种、数量上满足农民要求。
