Everyone Must Conserve Grain

      Grain is a material that is most closely related to the people's lives and national construction. It is a matter of course to conserve grain and not waste it; as the entire national economic construction progresses and the people's living standards continue to improve, the need for grain continues to increase, and we must conserve grain even more.

      Before agricultural cooperation and mechanization are realized nationwide, it will be difficult to significantly increase grain production for a time, and it will also be impossible for the state to significantly increase the amount of grain purchased from farmers. Under these circumstances, if anyone wastes grain, even if they waste less than in the past, it is still unforgivable.

      There is great potential for conserving grain in both urban and rural areas. To conserve grain, farmers must first strictly obey the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, sell all the surplus grain that should be sold, and resolutely refuse state supply of grain that should not be purchased, in order to help the state balance the grain revenue and expenditure plan. For urban residents and transportation and industrial departments, large amounts of grain can be saved from the following three aspects: first, eliminate the waste of grain and false reporting and fraudulent receipt of grain in daily life; second, eliminate losses, backlogs, and acts of corruption, favoritism, and connivance in grain storage, processing, transportation, and supply work; and third, change the unreasonable habits of using grain in various industries and handicrafts that use grain as raw materials.

      We must eliminate the phenomenon of wasting grain in daily life. In some units, the phenomenon of wasting grain is still very serious. According to incomplete statistics from Zhejiang University, from September to December 1954, more than 6,000 catties of grain were wasted. In the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and other units in Shanxi, nearly 4,000 people were falsely reported in October and November 1954, and nearly 60,000 catties of grain were purchased excessively. This bad phenomenon exists to varying degrees in many places and units. Many people, while recklessly wasting the fruits of people's labor and undermining the state's grain system, still believe that this is a "minor matter in life," "not a big deal," and even say, "I bought it with my own money, I can do whatever I want with it." This is the utter tone of an exploiter! Is wasting grain really a "minor matter"? If the urban people across the country save an average of one tael of grain per person per day, they can save more than 200 million catties a year, enough for more than 5 million people to eat for a year. How can this be a "minor matter"! Can you do whatever you want just because you have money? Trampling on the fruits of other people's labor is something that any worker will be indignant about! Our hundreds of millions of farmers have spent so much hard labor to increase grain production and have carried out such heroic struggles against various natural disasters! In order to support the great cause of national socialist industrialization and to create a beautiful socialist society, they have enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. Farmers tighten their belts, work hard, and fight hard. Are they doing this to support these wasters? The phenomenon of wasting grain in some units has already aroused the dissatisfaction and righteous indignation of the surrounding masses, especially the peasant masses. This feeling of indignation is completely justified. It must be reminded to those who waste grain: your shameful behavior is by no means a personal lifestyle detail, but a major event directly related to the worker-peasant alliance; failure to stop this behavior will seriously harm the revolutionary cause!

      Some people think that "a little waste of grain is inevitable," which is an extremely harmful idea. Facts have proved that it is entirely possible to save more grain. The only question is whether the important significance of this issue has been sufficiently recognized, whether the atmosphere of thrift and frugality has been universally promoted, whether serious thought has been given to methods, and whether effective methods have been persistently implemented to the end. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Court and other units have put forward guarantees for planned grain use, controlling the amount of food grain, and the phenomenon of wasting grain has been significantly reduced. In public canteens, making the steamed buns smaller, dividing the rice into bowls of different sizes, rationally using leftover rice and steamed buns, and accurately counting and grasping the number of people eating are all effective ways to save grain, and many agencies have already implemented them with great results.

      In order to conserve grain, it is also necessary to eliminate loopholes in storage, processing, and transportation. The situation in many grain warehouses is now very bad. According to materials from eight special districts in Hebei Province, in 1954, 360,000 catties of grain rotted and deteriorated in 163 grain stacks and 43 granaries. Many grain processing enterprises do not pay attention to improving the output rate. Their output rate has not only not steadily increased, but has sometimes decreased. In the third quarter of 1954, Jinan City's flour mills simply pursued output, resulting in a lower flour yield and a loss of 820,000 catties of flour. The phenomenon of wasting grain during transportation also occurs frequently. Some grain-transporting trains in Northeast China leak grain along the way, which is completely intolerable.

      Grain departments and cooperatives directly manage the state's grain, and cherishing grain should become the sacred duty of all staff members of these departments. If the staff of relevant units cherishes the state's grain with a highly responsible attitude, many losses can be avoided, and further savings can be made in many aspects. The rice mills in Changsha City seriously studied the advanced experience of Soviet grain processing and mobilized employees to study methods to improve the rice yield rate. The rice yield rate of No. 3 rice has increased from 70% to 73%. In the third quarter of 1954 alone, more than 5,825,000 catties of rice were produced, enough for 194,000 people to eat for a month. In 1954, the Baoji City Grain Company Flour Mill in Shaanxi Province produced three more catties of flour per hundred catties of wheat. According to statistics for ten months, a total of 2,080,000 catties of wheat were saved. If the grain departments across the country can strive to reduce the loss of grain they manage by one percent, or even one-thousandth, they can save the state hundreds of millions of catties of grain.

      All industrial departments that use grain as raw material must make great efforts to save grain. In the biscuit workshop of the Beijing Public-Private Joint Venture Yili Food Company, 18 or 19 catties of flour and biscuit crumbs fall on the ground every day and are burned; if these things are properly treated, the loss of five or six thousand catties of flour can be reduced in a year. The grain consumed in winemaking nationwide each year is also several billion catties; in the past year or two, many regions have begun to promote winemaking with substitute raw materials, which has saved the state a lot of grain. The soy sauce brewing industry usually consumes grain to make "soy sauce color," making the soy sauce look beautiful; recently, a few cities have begun to promote brewing soy sauce without adding "soy sauce color," which can not only save grain but also reduce the cost and price of soy sauce. The soy sauce industry in Wanxian, Sichuan implemented this method and estimates that it can save nearly 160,000 catties of rice a year. Of course, to reduce this type of grain consumption, which has become a habit for many years, some people may feel uncomfortable at first; however, habits can be changed. Since doing so is beneficial and harmless to the country and consumers, as long as the reasons are explained clearly, the broad masses will actively support it.

      Everyone must eat grain, and everyone requires a reliable guarantee of grain supply; therefore, everyone has a sacred responsibility to save grain.

      All personnel of state organs, people's organizations, enterprises, schools, and the army, set an example by taking the lead! Eliminate all wasteful grain behavior in your units, eliminate any phenomenon of false reporting, fraudulent receipt, and backlog of grain, and mobilize public opinion to wage a persistent struggle against various wasteful grain behaviors!

      Canteen staff and housewives, use your brains and think of good ways to eliminate waste and further save grain! Saving one point of grain is one point of contribution to the country!

      All personnel of grain work departments and transportation departments, better assume your glorious responsibilities! Resolutely, strictly, and meticulously implement the system, and do your best to save every grain of grain!

      All personnel of grain processing and reproduction industries, think of more ways to save grain and apply substitutes! Give full play to creativity, break down all obstacles, and fight against all unreasonable bad habits and conventions! Every person in the country must support the struggle against wasting grain and support the action of saving grain. Everyone must take their own responsibility and completely eliminate the phenomenon of wasting grain from every place and every corner!

    人人都要节约粮食
      粮食是同人民生活和国家建设关系最密切的一种物资。应该节约粮食，不应该浪费粮食，这是天经地义的事；随着整个国家经济建设的进展，人民生活水平的不断提高，对于粮食的需要不断增加，我们就更要节约粮食。
    在农业合作化和机械化还没有在全国范围内实现以前，粮食生产一时很难大量增加，国家向农民收购的粮食也不可能大量增加。在这种情况下，任何人如果浪费粮食，那怕是比过去浪费得少了，也仍然是不可饶恕的。
    节约粮食，无论城市和乡村，都有极大的可能。农民节约粮食，首先要严格服从国家的粮食统购统销政策，该卖的余粮一定卖足，不该买的粮食坚决不要国家供应，以便帮助国家平衡粮食收支计划。就城市居民和交通、工业部门来说，可以从下面三个方面节约大量的粮食：一是消除在日常生活中浪费粮食和虚报冒领的行为；二是消除粮食保管、加工、运输和供应工作中的损耗、积压和徇私舞弊、放纵套购的现象；三是在以粮食为原料的各种工业、手工业中改变不合理地使用粮食的习惯。
    我们必须消灭日常生活中浪费粮食的现象。在某些单位，浪费粮食的现象还是十分严重的。浙江大学从一九五四年九月到十二月，据不完全统计，共浪费粮食六千多斤。山西太原钢铁厂等单位，一九五四年十月十一月两个月共虚报人口近四千人，多购粮食近六万斤。这种恶劣的现象，在许多地方许多单位都或多或少地存在着。许多人在放肆地糟蹋人们的劳动果实和破坏国家的粮食制度的时候，还认为这是“生活小事”，“无伤大体”，甚至说“我花钱买的东西，我想怎么办就怎么办”。这是彻头彻尾的剥削者的口吻！浪费粮食真的是
  “小事”吗？全国城市人民如果平均每人每天节约一两粮食，一年就可以节约二十多万万斤，足够五百多万人吃一年。这怎么是“小事”！有钱就可以为所欲为吗？糟践别人的劳动成果，这是任何一个劳动者都要愤慨的！我国的几万万农民，为了增产粮食，花费了多少艰苦的劳动，对各种自然灾害进行了多么英勇的斗争！为了支援国家社会主义工业化的伟大事业，为了创造美好的社会主义社会，他们踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。农民节衣缩食，艰苦奋斗，难道是为了支援这些浪费者吗？有些单位浪费粮食的现象，已经引起周围的群众、特别是农民群众的不满和义愤。这种愤慨的情绪是完全正当的。必须提醒浪费粮食的人们：你们的可耻行为，决不是个人生活细节，而是直接有关工农联盟的大事；不制止这种行为，是会严重地危害革命事业的！
    有人认为“浪费一点粮食在所难免”，这种想法是极其有害的。事实证明，更多地节约粮食是完全可能的。问题只在于是不是足够地认识了这个问题的重要意义，是不是普遍地发扬了俭朴节约的风气，是不是认真地想了办法，是不是把有效的办法坚持实行到底。江西省人民法院等单位提出了按计划用粮的保证，对食粮数量加以控制，浪费粮食的现象就显著地减少了。公共食堂里把馒头做的小些，把米饭分成大小不同的碗，合理利用剩饭剩馍，确实统计和掌握吃饭人数，都是节约粮食的有效方法，许多机关已经实行了，很有成效。
    为了节约粮食，还必须消除在储藏、加工、运输方面所发生的漏洞。现在许多粮食仓库的情况是很不好的。根据河北省八个专区的材料，一九五四年一年中，在一百六十三个粮囤和四十三个粮仓中，竟有三十六万斤粮食霉烂变质了。许多粮食加工企业对于提高出品率是不重视的，它们的出品率不但没有稳定地提高，反而有时下降了。济南市各制粉厂在一九五四年第三季度单纯追求产量，结果降低了出粉率，损失了八十二万斤面粉。运输过程中浪费粮食的现象，也是经常发生的。东北地区有些运粮的火车，沿途漏下粮食，这种损失是完全不能容忍的。
    粮食部门和合作社直接掌管着国家的粮食，爱护粮食应当成为这些部门的全体工作人员的神圣职责。如果有关单位的工作人员以高度负责的态度爱护国家的粮食，许多损失都是可以避免的，而且在许多方面还可以进一步节约。长沙市各制米厂认真地学习了苏联粮食加工的先进经验，发动职工研究提高出米率的办法，三号米出米率已由百分之七十提高到百分之七十三；仅一九五四年第三季度就多出了五百八十二万五千多斤米，可供十九万四千人吃一个月。陕西宝鸡市粮食公司面粉厂一九五四年每百斤小麦多出三斤面粉，据十个月的统计，共节约小麦二百零八万斤。如果全国粮食部门都能够努力把经管的粮食损耗降低百分之一，甚至千分之一，那就可以给国家节约数以亿斤计的粮食。
    所有以粮食为原料的工业部门都要用大力节约粮食。北京市公私合营义利食品公司饼干车间，每天工作时落地的面粉和饼干头有十八、九斤，都被烧毁了；如果把这些东西加以适当的处理，一年就可减少五六千斤面粉的损失。全国每年在酿酒方面消耗的粮食也有数十亿斤；最近一两年来，许多地区开始提倡以代用原料酿酒，就给国家节省了许多粮食。酱油酿造业通常要耗费粮食制造“酱色”，使酱油颜色美观；近来少数城市开始提倡酿造酱油不加“酱色”，这不仅可以节约粮食，而且可以降低酱油的成本和价格。四川万县酱园业实行了这个办法，估计一年可节约大米近十六万斤。当然，要减少多年来已成为习惯的这一类粮食消耗，对于某些人来说，开始时可能感觉不习惯；但是，习惯是可以改变的。既然这样做对国家、对消费者都有利无害，那末，只要讲清道理，广大群众是会积极赞助的。
    人人都不能不吃粮食，人人都要求粮食供应有可靠保证；因此，人人都有节约粮食的神圣责任。
    国家机关、人民团体、企业、学校、军队的全体人员，以身作则地做出榜样来吧！要消灭本单位里一切浪费粮食的行为，消灭任何虚报冒领积压粮食的现象，要动员社会舆论向各种浪费粮食的行为作坚持不懈的斗争！
    食堂工作人员们，家庭妇女们，多动脑筋想些消除浪费粮食和进一步节约粮食的好办法吧！节约一分粮食就是对国家的一分贡献！
    粮食工作部门、运输部门的全体人员，更好地负起你们的光荣责任吧！要坚决地严格地一丝不苟地执行制度，尽最大努力节约每一粒粮食！
    粮食加工业、复制业的全体人员，多想办法节约粮食和应用代用品吧！要充分发挥创造性，打破种种障碍，同一切不合理的陋习陈规进行斗争！全国每一个人，都要支持反对浪费粮食的斗争，支持节约粮食的行动。人人都负起自己的责任，把浪费粮食的现象从每个地方每个角落彻底消灭！
