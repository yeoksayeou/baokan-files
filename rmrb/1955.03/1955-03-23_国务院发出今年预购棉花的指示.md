Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd: The State Council of the People's Republic of China recently issued instructions on pre-purchasing cotton in 1955. The instructions state: In order to continue implementing the policy of unified purchase of cotton and to complete the state's purchase plan through pre-purchase methods, all cotton subject to unified purchase, excluding cotton retained by cotton farmers for their own use and cotton used to pay agricultural taxes, will be pre-purchased by the state from cotton farmers in 1955. The Ministry of Commerce will entrust the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives with the responsibility of handling cotton pre-purchase work. In areas where cotton production is extremely low and the purchase task is very small, pre-purchase may not be carried out after the approval of the Provincial (Municipal) People's Committee.

The instructions stipulate that, in order to encourage cotton farmers to produce and sell cotton in accordance with the state plan, while pre-paying a deposit (the average proportion of the pre-paid deposit is 10 percent), the state will increase the supply of 10 jin of grain and 10 chi of cotton cloth beyond the fixed quota for grain and cotton cloth rationing for every dan of ginned cotton pre-sold by cotton farmers, and will guarantee the supply of fertilizer equal to or slightly higher than the local cotton field fertilization level last year. When allocating cake fertilizer this year, all provinces must ensure that cotton farmers are supplied with 50 to 100 jin of cake fertilizer for every dan of ginned cotton sold (1 jin of chemical fertilizer is equivalent to 2.5 jin of cake fertilizer). If the amount of ginned cotton pre-sold by cotton farmers exceeds or falls short of one dan, the preferentially supplied grain, cotton cloth, and guaranteed fertilizer should be converted according to the above ratio. The supply and marketing cooperatives will issue cotton farmers with certain vouchers for the grain, cotton cloth, and fertilizer when signing the pre-purchase contract. From the time of pre-sale to the time of sale, cotton farmers can use the vouchers to purchase from local supply and marketing cooperatives, their distribution and sales stores, state-owned stores, and state-owned grain companies. The supply and marketing cooperatives should also take into account the needs of cotton farmers in terms of variety as much as possible. In addition to the above-mentioned in-kind benefits, the state also guarantees the supply of coal needed by cotton farmers in terms of quantity (and also considers the variety as much as possible). In addition, the supply of other materials in cotton-producing areas must also be improved.

The instructions emphasize: The pre-purchase contract system is a complex economic organizational task. The procedures and systems should be simple and orderly to establish the seriousness of the contract. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives should promptly formulate a unified system and necessary management measures. The Provincial (Municipal) People's Committees should strengthen their leadership over cotton pre-purchase work, and combine this year's spring plowing production arrangements down to the household level. All relevant departments, such as grain, commerce, agriculture, supply and marketing cooperatives, and banks, should closely cooperate and, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and People's Committees, do a good job in cotton pre-purchase work. In the pre-purchase work, propaganda and education for farmers should be strengthened to explain in detail the benefits of pre-purchase for the country and farmers; cotton farmers should be effectively educated to produce and sign pre-purchase contracts in accordance with the state's plan, preventing a small number of cotton farmers from underreporting and over-collecting deposits during pre-sale; education for cadres should be strengthened so that they fully understand the importance of pre-purchase work and strive to do a good job in cotton pre-purchase work.

    国务院发出今年预购棉花的指示
    【新华社二十二日讯】中华人民共和国国务院最近发出关于一九五五年预购棉花的指示。指示说：为了继续贯彻棉花统购的政策，通过预购的方法，完成国家的收购计划，一九五五年除棉农留用棉和交农业税的棉花外，统购的棉花全部由国家向棉农预购。棉花预购工作由商业部委托全国供销合作社负责办理。在棉花产量极少，收购任务很小的地区，经省（市）人民委员会决定后，也可不进行预购。
    指示规定，为了鼓励棉农按照国家计划生产与出售棉花，在预付定金（预付定金的比例平均是百分之十）的同时，凡棉农预售一担皮棉，国家即在粮食、棉布统销的定额以外，增加十斤粮食和十尺棉布的供应量，并保证供应相等于或稍高于去年当地棉田施肥水平的肥料。各省在分配今年饼肥时，必须尽可能保证棉农每出售一担皮棉，供应五十斤至一百斤饼肥（化肥一斤折二斤半饼肥）。如棉农预售皮棉超过或不足一担时，优待供应的粮食、棉布和保证供应的肥料，应按上述比例加以折算。此项粮食、棉布与肥料，均由供销合作社在签订预购合同时，发给棉农一定的凭证，棉农自预售至出售棉花期间，可执证向当地供销合作社或供销合作社的经销、代销店、国营商店和国营粮食公司购买，供销合作社并应在品种上尽量照顾棉农的需要。除上述实物优待外，国家并在数量上保证棉农所需的煤炭供应（品种也尽可能照顾）。此外，产棉区的其它物资供应工作也须予以改进。
    指示强调指出：预购合同制是一件复杂的经济组织工作，手续制度应该简而不乱，以树立合同的严肃性，供销合作总社应及时规定出一套统一的制度和必要的管理办法。各省（市）人民委员会应加强对棉花预购工作的领导，结合今年春耕生产布置到户，各有关部门如粮食、商业、农业、供销合作社、银行等应该密切配合，在当地党委和人民委员会的统一领导下，做好棉花预购工作。在预购工作中，应加强对农民的宣传教育，详细解释预购对于国家和农民的好处；切实教育棉农按照国家的计划进行生产与订立预购合同，防止少数棉农预售时以少报多、多领定金的现象；加强对干部的教育，使其充分认识预购工作的重要性，努力做好棉花预购工作。
