To the Editor:

    Liuzhou is the largest city in central Guangxi Province. In recent years, with the prosperity and development of industry and commerce, the city's population has increased significantly. However, the vegetable supply work in this city is very chaotic, and vegetable prices have remained surprisingly high. For example, Chinese cabbage currently sells for 1.4 jiao per jin (斤), and cauliflower sells for 1.2 jiao per jin. However, first-grade rice in this city costs only a little over 1.2 jiao per jin, and second-grade rice costs only 0.108 jiao per jin. This means that the price of ordinary vegetables is even higher than rice, which has greatly affected the lives of the vast number of workers and citizens.

    A long time ago, people had already reported this issue to the local government and suggested that relevant departments pay attention to mobilizing suburban farmers to grow more vegetables and strengthen the leadership and management of the vegetable market. However, the relevant departments did not give due attention to these issues and only adopted a "treat the head when it hurts" approach. They transported batches of vegetables from other places at very high freight rates and sold them in bulk to vegetable vendors. In this way, the vendors made a profit of nearly double the original price with just one transaction.

    The Liuzhou Municipal People's Government should actively take correct measures to do a good job in vegetable production and management so that citizens can eat inexpensive vegetables.

    柳州市蔬菜价格太高编辑同志：
    柳州是广西省中部最大的一个城市，几年来，随着工商业的繁荣和发展，市内人口增加很多。可是这个城市的蔬菜供应工作却存在着十分混乱的现象，蔬菜价格一直贵得惊人。如目前市场上卖的大白菜就是一角四分一斤，白菜花一角二分一斤，而这个城市的头机大米每斤不过一角二分多，二机大米每斤只有壹角零八厘，这就是说普通蔬菜的价钱比大米还高，广大工人和市民的生活因此受到了很大的影响。
    在很久以前，就有人向当地政府反映过这一问题，并建议有关方面重视发动郊区农民多种蔬菜，加强对蔬菜市场的领导和管理。但有关方面对这些问题却没有给予应有的重视，而只是采取“头痛医头”的办法。他们以很高的运价从外地把一批一批的蔬菜采运回来，又成批地卖给蔬菜商贩，这样菜贩们一转手之间就获得了将近原价一倍的利润。
    柳州市人民政府应该积极采取正确的措施，做好菜蔬生产管理工作，让市民们吃到廉价的蔬菜。
