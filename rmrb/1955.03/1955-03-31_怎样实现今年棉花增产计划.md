    How to Achieve This Year's Cotton Production Increase Plan

    The cotton sowing season is approaching. Rural cadres and the broad masses of farmers in cotton-producing areas should take urgent action to quickly prepare the necessary means of production and livelihood, and promptly prepare the cotton fields to ensure that all cotton fields are sown on time.

    Based on the experience of cotton production over the past five years, increasing cotton production must implement the principle of "ensuring planting, ensuring harvest, and ensuring the improvement of unit yield." Provinces and regions with cotton planting tasks should strive to complete the planting tasks; except in the event of irresistible natural disasters, they should try their best to plant one mu and harvest one mu; take appropriate technical measures to meet and exceed the state-specified unit area yield targets. During the spring plowing season, "ensuring planting" is the central link in striving for increased cotton production. If there is no sowing in spring, there is no point in talking about ensuring harvest and improving unit yield. At present, some cotton farmers are unwilling to grow cotton because they have encountered some difficulties, such as the lack of feed. Local food and supply and marketing cooperatives must do a good job in supplying feed, and what should be supplied must be supplied. When formulating production plans, some crops that can be used as feed (such as millet, alfalfa, etc.) should be planted in a planned way under the principle of rational land use. In this way, on the one hand, cotton-producing areas can gradually achieve self-sufficiency in forage; on the other hand, wheat fields can be properly rotated. In areas where it is indeed difficult to expand cotton fields, the cotton planting tasks between districts and townships should be immediately and appropriately adjusted. Some rural cadres in some areas believe that they can complete the cotton planting task by "storming" during sowing, which is a wrong idea. Forcing farmers to grow cotton will inevitably result in cotton being planted on unsuitable land, or create false phenomena of reporting less as more, wasting manpower and money, and outweighing the gains.

    Doing a good job in economic work in cotton-producing areas is the key to ensuring sowing and increasing cotton production. Experience over the years has proved that the quality of economic work directly affects the stability and increase or decrease of cotton field area. Staff in cotton-producing areas and other economic crop areas should clearly recognize the economic characteristics of these areas. Cotton and other economic crops are all commodities. Most of the things farmers produce must be sold. The grain and means of production they need must be purchased in a timely manner after selling their products. Therefore, these areas need more trading activities than general areas. Party committees and governments in these areas should adapt to this characteristic and strive to do a good job in economic work. Only by doing a good job in procurement and supply can the completion of the cotton production plan be reliably guaranteed. Some leading cadres in some areas do not recognize these characteristics and have adopted some wrong methods in the unified purchase and sale of grain, the unified purchase of cotton, and the supply of materials. For example, mobilizing farmers who grow a lot of cotton to sell surplus grain, the grain supplied to cotton farmers is insufficient or the variety is inappropriate, and the policy of paying agricultural tax with cotton is not conscientiously implemented. This increases farmers' ideological concerns about growing cotton and encourages the phenomenon of reducing cotton fields or planting grain in good fields and cotton in bad fields. In order to encourage farmers to expand cotton fields in accordance with state plans, it is necessary to guarantee the grain supply to cotton farmers as much as possible, and to supply appropriate types of grain as much as possible according to the living habits of the masses in various places. In addition, it is also necessary to do a good job in the supply of fuel and daily necessities. Recently, the State Council has stipulated specific measures to encourage cotton planting and cotton sales: in conjunction with the cotton pre-purchase work, it is guaranteed to supply commercial fertilizers equivalent to or slightly higher than the amount of fertilizer applied to local cotton fields last year; farmers who pre-sell one dan of ginned cotton should increase the supply of ten jin of grain and ten chi of cotton cloth. Party and government organs in various places must widely publicize these measures to the peasants and earnestly implement the policy of encouraging cotton planting in order to enhance the enthusiasm of the masses for cotton planting.

    In order to ensure increased cotton production, production materials should be quickly supplied to cotton farmers. This year, the state has greatly increased the supply of production materials to cotton areas. The commercial fertilizers increased this year will be given priority to cotton-producing areas. The pesticides prepared this year are three times more than last year, and it is estimated that half of them will be used on cotton fields. In addition to widely promoting double-wheel double-share plows in cotton areas, it is also planned to widely promote cotton field cultivators. Agricultural departments at all levels should immediately sign specific plans with supply and marketing cooperatives for the supply of fertilizers, machinery, and agricultural tools, and supply them in a timely manner, without delaying the farming season. Last year, in many areas, due to insufficient preparation, the machinery and medicines had not been transported to the countryside during the pest control season; the fertilizers were not delivered to the farmers until after the fertilization season. This phenomenon must be avoided this year.

    The phenomenon of insufficient quantity and low quality of cotton seeds must be overcome in this year's cotton planting season. This year, the state is preparing to supply more than 400 million jin of cotton seeds. Agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should step up the transportation work and supply them to cotton farmers who are indeed short of seeds in a timely manner. However, the cotton seeds supplied by the state are only a small number after all. To completely solve the cotton seed problem, we should also mobilize the masses to exchange them locally, and this method should be the main one. The quality of cotton seeds is generally low this year. In order to ensure full seedlings, agricultural departments and technology promotion stations at all levels should widely introduce techniques to improve germination rate to farmers. In areas where cotton seeds are insufficient, we should also study and promote sowing methods that save seeds and do not cause seedling shortages, suitable for local conditions. Preparations such as land preparation and moisture conservation before sowing should also be done well to ensure that the seeds emerge smoothly.

    Cotton is a technical crop with a long growing season. In order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest, we must strengthen year-round uninterrupted technical guidance and overcome the bias of only paying attention to completing the sowing task while relaxing field management and technical guidance. All cotton-producing provinces, especially cotton-producing counties, should formulate annual cotton production increase technical measures plans based on local characteristics and the production increase experience of farms and the masses, and effectively popularize them to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers. At present, the level of cotton planting technology in various places is still very inconsistent. In some areas, many effective technical measures, such as seedling protection, close planting, pruning, and pest control, have not been well promoted. Therefore, it is very necessary to establish and improve technical promotion stations in cotton areas and widely conduct technical training. This year, many cotton areas have been newly expanded, and many improved cotton varieties have been newly promoted. It is an even more urgent task to do a good job in technical guidance in these areas. This spring, the Yuci cotton area in Shanxi Province has trained 600 technical cadres who have gone to various counties to teach cotton planting techniques to more than 60,000 key members of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. This spring, cotton-producing counties in Jiangsu Province have universally held training classes for technicians of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, teaching cotton planting techniques, and the deputy secretaries of the county party committees presided over this work. These methods are all worth promoting.

    Striving for a bumper cotton harvest and truly completing the cotton production increase plan is one of the important tasks of cotton-producing areas throughout the year. As long as we carry forward the spirit of being actively responsible to the country and the masses, and adopt working methods suitable for the economic life characteristics of cotton areas, it is entirely possible to complete this year's cotton production increase plan.

### 怎样实现今年棉花增产计划

    怎样实现今年棉花增产计划
    棉花播种季节就要到来了。产棉区的农村工作干部和广大农民，应该紧张行动起来，赶快准备好必要的生产资料和生活资料，把棉田迅速整理妥当，争取全部棉田按时播种。
    根据五年来棉花生产的经验，增产棉花必须贯彻“保种、保收、保证提高单位产量”的方针。凡有植棉任务的省区，要努力完成播种任务；除了遇到不可抗拒的自然灾害以外，应该尽力作到种植一亩，收获一亩；采取适当的技术措施，达到和超过国家所规定的单位面积产量指标。在春耕期间，“保种”是争取棉花增产的中心环节，如果春季没有播种，就根本谈不到保收和提高单位产量。现在有些棉农不愿意种植棉花，是因为遇到了一些困难，例如缺乏饲料的困难。各地粮食和供销合作部门，必须做好饲料供应工作，该供应的必须供应。在制订生产计划的时候，应在合理利用土地的原则下，有计划地种植一些可作饲料的作物（如谷子、苜蓿等）。这样，一方面可以使产棉区逐渐作到饲草自给；另一方面可以使麦田适当倒茬。在扩大棉田确有困难的地区，要立即适当调整区、乡之间的植棉任务。部分地区的农村工作干部认为只要在播种时“突击”一下，就可以完成植棉任务，这种想法是错误的。强迫农民种植棉花，必然会使棉花种在不适宜的土地上，或者造成以少报多的虚假现象，劳民伤财，得不偿失。
    作好棉产区的经济工作是保证播种和增产棉花的关键。几年来的经验证明，经济工作做得好坏，直接影响棉田面积的稳定和增减。棉产区和别的经济作物区的工作人员，应当明确地认识这些地区经济生活的特点。棉花和别的经济作物都是商品。农民生产这些东西，绝大部分都要出卖。他们需要的粮食和生产资料，都要在出卖生产品后及时购买。因此，这些地区比一般地区需要更大量的交易活动。这些地区的党委和政府，应该适应这种特点，努力作好经济工作。只有作好了收购工作和供应工作，棉花生产计划的完成才有可靠的保证。有些地区的领导干部不认识这些特点，在粮食统购统销、棉花统购和物资供应工作中，曾经采取若干错误的办法。例如动员种棉很多的农民出卖余粮，供应棉农的粮食不够或品种不当，不认真执行以棉花代缴农业税的政策等等。这就增加了农民种植棉花的思想顾虑，助长了缩减棉田或以好田种粮以坏田种棉的现象。为了鼓励农民按照国家计划扩大棉田，必须尽最大可能保证对棉农的粮食供应，并且要根据各地群众的生活习惯，尽可能供应适当种类的粮食。此外，还要作好燃料和日用百货的供应工作。最近国务院规定了鼓励植棉和售棉的具体办法：配合棉花预购工作，保证供应相等于或稍高于去年当地棉田施肥量的商品肥料；农民预售一担皮棉，就应增加十斤粮食和十尺棉布的供应量。各地党政机关必须向农民广泛宣传这些措施，切实贯彻鼓励植棉的政策，以提高群众植棉的积极性。
    为了保证棉花增产，应该赶快把生产资料供应到棉农手中。今年国家供应棉区的生产资料大大增加了。比去年增多的商品肥料将优先供应棉产区。今年准备的农药比去年多了三倍，预计用到棉田上的将占一半。棉区除大量推广双轮双铧犁以外，还计划大量推广棉田中耕器。各级农业部门应该立即和供销合作社订出供应肥料、药械、农具的具体计划，及时供应下去，不能违误农时。去年很多地区由于准备不够，到了治虫季节，还没有把药械运到农村；已过施肥季节，才把肥料送到农民手里。今年必须极力避免这种现象。
    棉花种籽数量不够，质量不高的现象，在今年植棉季节中必须加以克服。今年国家准备供应的棉花种籽达四亿斤以上，各级农业部门和供销社要加紧进行调运工作，及时供应给确实缺乏种籽的棉农。但是，国家供应的棉花种籽毕竟只占少数，要彻底解决棉花种籽问题，还应该发动群众就地串换，并且应该以这种方法为主。今年棉花种籽的质量一般较低，为了保证全苗，各级农业部门和技术推广站要向农民广泛介绍提高发芽率的技术。棉花种籽不充足的地区，还应当研究和推广适合当地条件的节省种籽而又不致缺苗的播种方法。播种前的整地保墒等准备工作也要作好，保证种籽顺利出苗。
    棉花是技术作物，生长季节较长。为了争取棉花丰收，必须加强全年的不间断的技术指导，克服那种只注意完成播种任务，而放松田间管理和技术指导的偏向。各产棉省份，特别是产棉县份，应该根据当地特点以及农场和群众的增产经验，因地制宜地订出全年棉花增产技术措施计划，切实普及到农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民中去。目前各地的植棉技术水平还很不一致。有些地区对于许多行之有效的技术措施，如保苗、密植、整枝、治虫等还没有很好地加以推广。因此，建立和健全棉区的技术推广站，广泛进行技术传授是十分必要的。今年新扩大了不少棉区，新推广了许多优良棉种，做好这些地区的技术指导工作，更是迫切的任务。山西省榆次棉区今年春季已集训六百名技术干部，分赴各县对六万多名农业生产合作社和互助组的骨干传授植棉技术。江苏省各产棉县今年春季普遍举办农业生产合作社和互助组的技术员训练班，传授植棉技术，并由县委副书记主持这项工作。这些方法都是值得提倡的。
    争取棉花丰收，确实完成棉花增产计划，是棉产区全年的重要任务之一。只要发扬对国家对群众积极负责的精神，采取适合棉区经济生活特点的工作方法，完成今年棉花的增产计划是完全可能的。
