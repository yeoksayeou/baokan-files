Hu Feng's Idealist Worldview
Shao Quanlin

They say: We are basically Marxists, but we want to "improve" Marxism, to make it abandon certain basic principles. In fact, they hate Marxism, because they are trying to destroy the theoretical foundation of Marxism, although they deny their hatred of Marxism with hypocritical words, and continue to call themselves Marxists with a double-dealing attitude. … The more hypocritical this criticism of destroying the theoretical foundation of Marxism is, the more dangerous it is to the Party, because it is more and more closely linked with the reactionary forces' general offensive against the Party and against the revolution. ….

Thus, Marxists are faced with an extremely urgent task: they must give a due refutation to these renegades who betray Marxist theory, tear off their masks, and completely expose them, so as to maintain the theoretical foundation of the Marxist party. ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," Chapter IV, Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House)

For more than ten years, Hu Feng and his clique have been propagating an anti-Marxist theory under the guise of "Marxism." The basic characteristic of this theory is the denial of the basic principle of "existence determines consciousness" in Marxism. They not only take a supra-class subjective spirit as the starting point of literary creation, deny the role of class stand, social thought, and worldview in creation, and deny the class nature and party spirit principles of literature; but also take this subjective spirit as the driving force of history, deny the decisive significance of social material living conditions, mode of production, and class struggle in historical development, and also deny the great role of advanced social thought reflecting the development trend of social material life and class struggle in history and the masses, and deny the great role of consciousness and organization in the mass struggle. The foundation of Hu Feng's erroneous literary theory is this completely anti-Marxist subjective idealist worldview.

Denial of Materialism

One of Hu Feng's most basic views is to regard the subjective role of man as the determining factor of the objective world. Materialism believes that man's spiritual consciousness is determined by social material living conditions, and in turn affects social existence and the development of material living conditions. Social economic relations develop according to objective laws, and this objective law is a reflection of the objective process that does not shift with people's will; people can discover, understand, study, and utilize these laws, but they cannot formulate or create these laws. However, Hu Feng's opinion is exactly the opposite. He said in "On the Road of Realism" (page 101):

　　Man created history, but this history, which was created by man and is still being created, is moving within the limitation of material relations created by man, that is, the law. … Man lives in this material relationship, struggles, produces that law and develops that law, and continues to create history under the limitation of that law. What historical materialism wants to explain is this problem.

This is Hu Feng's so-called "historical materialism"! It is not very clear here whether Hu Feng is saying that man created material relations, or that man created laws, but his purpose is clear: to deny the objective nature of material relations or the laws of material relations. Since he believes that man can generate and develop the objective laws of history, that is to say, man's subjective consciousness determines the development of objective existence, and is not determined by the development of objective existence. This fundamentally destroys the basic principles of materialism. He uses this anti-materialist point of view to understand history and the people, and therefore cannot but fall into a series of fundamental errors.

How does Hu Feng view history?

　　The people who live in the social relations based on economic relations, bear the heavy burden of labor under heavy exploitation and enslavement, bear it kindly, bear it strongly, cannot live without sweating, and even cannot live without bloodshed, but they "stand on the ground" and bear it with sweat and blood. This great spirit is the spine of the world. Is there anything healthier than this when it comes to health? However, this strength and kindness that bear the burden of labor also contains various concrete manifestations of feudalism, such as the spirit of accepting fate. The former side produces the liberation requirements for creating history, but the latter side imprisons, paralyzes, and even suffocates that requirement in the "free" state; this unified but contradictory content, which is often surrounded by the latter side, stirs, entangles, and interacts, forming a vast ocean. The content of every people is such a vast ocean. Otherwise, looking only at the former, those exploitation and enslavement would not be possible, and we would not have a history of feudal China; looking only at the latter, the history of feudal China would be calm and uneventful, and just talking about modern history, the successive bloody struggles since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom would not have been possible. ("On the Road of Realism" 116-117)

Hu Feng believes that there are two spirits in the people that are fighting each other in a "mutually generating and overcoming" manner: one is the so-called "strength and kindness that bear the burden of labor," and the other is the so-called "spirit of accepting fate." The contradiction and struggle between these two spirits, like a vast ocean, "stirs," "entangles" in the people, constitutes the content of people's lives, and also constitutes the content of the entire history of Chinese feudal society and even the entire history of mankind.

According to Hu Feng, the reason why feudal enslavement and exploitation are possible seems to be not because the feudal class controls the land and other means of production, and controls political and economic power, but only because the people themselves have this "spirit of accepting fate" and are willing to be beasts of burden; the reason why the people's demands for liberation cannot be realized is not because of the cruel oppression of the ruling class and the lack of new productive forces, but only because this requirement is suffocated by the people's own "spirit of accepting fate." In this way, all historical responsibilities are pushed onto the people, and the crimes of the feudal ruling class in oppressing and exploiting the people are lightly written off.

Secondly, what is his so-called "strength and kindness that bear the burden of labor"? Hu Feng here seems to be talking about a kind of will and desire for survival of the people under heavy enslavement and exploitation, and this is what Hu Feng calls the driving force for promoting history. In his view, the reason why successive revolutionary struggles have appeared in history is because the people have this will and desire to survive; if this will and desire were not restrained by their own "spirit of accepting fate," then feudal enslavement and exploitation would not have been able to exist long ago, and we would not have a history of feudal China. He attributes the reason for historical development to people's wishes and spirit, and calls this spirit the "spine of the world."

Hu Feng said in "Short Thoughts on Winter Nights": "Hoping that the future is better than the past, hoping that one's life will always have a happy day. This is also a humble feeling, but even though it is a humble feeling, mankind has multiplied by it, history has developed by it, and to put it exaggeratedly, all the great struggles of social reform have also been generated by it." The meaning is the same as above. Hu Feng replied to the criticism against him that he was talking about the driving force of class struggle; but class struggle is not driven by "hoping that the future is better than the past," because in socialist society people hope that the future is better than the past, but class struggle does not occur, so this driving force can only be the objective existence of class and class contradictions. Hu Feng also said that it was "just a small essay," but "On the Road of Realism" is a special book on theory, so why is the argument exactly the same?

It can be seen that Hu Feng's point of view is consistent. He believes that the content of history is only the contradiction and struggle in the human spiritual world: the driving force of historical development is people's will and desire to survive; the obstacle to historical development is people's "spirit of accepting fate." The contradiction and struggle between these two spirits or consciousnesses dominates and determines the fate of the people and the development of history. It is not the social material living conditions that determine people's spiritual consciousness, but people's spiritual consciousness that determines the development of history. Hu Feng uses this anti-historical idealist point of view to explain history!

Denial of Class Struggle

Starting from this idealist view of history, Hu Feng has actually canceled the role of class struggle, because everyone knows that class struggle is a reflection of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, and not a reflection of the contradiction between the "spirit of accepting fate" and the "desire to survive." But since Hu Feng wanted to wear the cloak of Marxism, it was difficult to simply deny class struggle. Therefore, he tried to extract their true meaning from the terms of class and class struggle.

In his book "On the Road of Realism," Hu Feng once quoted many words of Marx and Engels to analyze the relationship between society and the individual. Finally, he reached a conclusion that "class exists in or through the living individual class members, and there is no class without concrete living class members," and thus inferred that "everyone is a world," "anyone is a typical," and must "see the world from a grain of sand, … and it must be so." In this way, the individual and the class are equated by him. We know that people in class society live in the middle of the class and cannot be independent without the class. People's consciousness is dominated by their class life, so to understand people, they must be understood from the social relations in which they are located. But Hu Feng said that the class lives in the individual, saying that the society can only be seen from the individual, but the individual cannot be seen from the society. His so-called "a person is a world," "anyone is a typical," "seeing the world from a grain of sand," and what he said that everyone has two spirits that generate and overcome each other have the same meaning, and the purpose is nothing more than to prove that class struggle is only carried out in everyone's heart. This actually negates the significance of the class, reduces class struggle to the struggle in the individual's spiritual world, and reduces social people to individual people.

Historical materialists never regard people as abstract people, but as concrete people, social people. The so-called social person is because people are in social association. Marx said in his criticism of Feuerbach that he "did not grasp people in the social association in which they are located, did not grasp people under the conditions of life that have made people exist as they are now, and therefore he can never reach the realistically existing active people, but rather stops in front of the abstract object of 'man', and what he has achieved is only the recognition of 'real people of flesh and blood' in the feeling, that is, besides sexual love and friendship, he does not know any other 'human-to-human' 'human relationship', and even this is idealized." Hu Feng quoted this passage from Marx, but in fact, he refuted himself!

Hu Feng's "Hope" often promoted his absurd theory of class and class struggle. For example, it said: "The so-called class consciousness is an abstract and typical thing … no specific person has the class consciousness as analyzed by theorists." (Shu Wu); for example, it said: "Where there is life, there is struggle" (Hu Feng); for example, it said: "In today's class society, life is struggle. The reason why life is struggle is because today it contains class nature." (A Long) And their so-called life refers not to social life, but to personal daily life. Therefore, by inference, they even think that "quarreling" and "courtship" are also class struggles! Is not abstracting, vulgarizing, and caricaturing class struggle in this way for canceling class struggle, or what is it for?

Hu Feng's point of view of abstracting class struggle and dissolving it into the struggle in the individual's spiritual world is most clearly expressed in his analysis of the "May Fourth" Movement. In his view, the basic content of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle since the "May Fourth" Movement is "to make the liberation requirements of the people's creation history … break out, liberate, struggle out, and develop forward from under the layers of heavy spiritual enslavement wounds, and become a material force" ("On the Road of Realism" 117).

This passage is difficult to understand and needs to be annotated: What are the "spiritual enslavement wounds"? According to his own explanation, "in scientific analysis, it can be pointed out by 'shortcomings'," that is, referring to the shortcomings among the people. To put it more clearly, it is the ignorance, ignorance, numbness, vulgarity, etc. left to the people by the feudal ruling class for a long time, and the "spirit of accepting fate" is actually the same kind of thing. Hu Feng believes that to liberate the people, it is first necessary to peel off those "wounds" on the people "layer by layer," to criticize those "wounds" "bloodstain by bloodstain," and then to find out the "potential force that dominates the fate of history" from under the dense layers of "wounds." And this is also the basic content of the "May Fourth" Movement recognized by Hu Feng. May I ask, who can see a trace of class struggle from here?

Hu Feng actually completely does not see the power of the oppressed class, does not see the heroism and wisdom of the people, and only sees that the people are full of so-called "spiritual enslavement wounds." He said to the writers: "Although their spiritual requirements extend to liberation, the wounds of thousands of years of spiritual enslavement are lurking or expanding at any time and place. To penetrate them, the writers must have the critical power to fight with the content of their lives in order not to be submerged by this ocean of sensory existence (referring to the ocean of the people - author)." ("Days of Adversity" 26) The working people are actually like an ocean of "lurking or expanding wounds of thousands of years of spiritual enslavement," and this ocean can actually "submerge" the writers. What has he regarded the people as, and to what extent has he exaggerated the shortcomings of the people!

We know that although the working people have suffered cruel spiritual enslavement and ideological poisoning under the long-term rule of the exploiting class, this spiritual enslavement and ideological poisoning have indeed hindered their revolutionary consciousness, but in any case, their own class consciousness and power cannot be conquered, and their struggle against the ruling class will not stop. Historical materialists believe that history is created by the people, and the people have unlimited prospects. New things are growing day by day, and old things are declining day by day; even if new things are small, they will eventually grow up irresistibly. Therefore, we must look forward and be good at identifying new and revolutionary things in life, so that we can have a vigorous and optimistic fighting spirit and see the bright future of the revolution. Only those reactionary individualists who are separated from the masses regard the masses of the people as ignorant, ignorant, vulgar, and selfish beings, as if only he himself is the savior carrying the cross. This is one of the characteristics of the idealist worldview of the declining bourgeoisie.

However, Hu Feng is not only like this. He even described the people's so-called "spiritual enslavement wounds" as "terrible butcher knives that massacre millions of lives." He said:

　　When the spiritual enslavement wounds are "potentially" present, what kind of force is it that imprisons, plays with, paralyzes, and even suffocates millions of lives? When "expanding," especially when expanding on the members who have entered the practical process (referring to the members of the revolutionary ranks - author), what kind of terrible butcher knife will it become that slaughters millions of lives? Is it so? The glorious but painful and bloody historical road of the past thirty years will stand up to testify. ("On the Road of Realism" 118)

The history of the past thirty years is still in front of us, and the bloody struggle of the past thirty years has not been forgotten by the people. Is it not imperialism, not Chiang Kai-shek, but the people themselves who have suffocated and massacred millions of lives? Is it the members of the revolutionary ranks? Is it their own shortcomings that are slaughtering themselves? Is the murderous butcher knife not in the hands of the enemy, but in the hands of the members of the revolutionary ranks? We cannot but ask, when Hu Feng wrote this passage, what exactly was his murderous pen pointing at?

It seems to be clear: Although Hu Feng has canceled class struggle from history, he himself is carrying out class struggle, but he is not fighting against the enemies of the people, but fighting against the people!

Denial of the Role of Revolutionary Theory and Revolutionary Organization

Although Hu Feng tried his best to exaggerate the backwardness of the people, he did not therefore believe that the people must be armed with revolutionary theory and revolutionary organization in order to get rid of the lack of consciousness and backward state. On the contrary, he tried his best to deny the role of revolutionary theory and revolutionary organization, and believed that spontaneous struggle was the way out for the people. This is the inevitable result of his denial of historical materialism, denial of class struggle, denial of the historical status and bright future of the people.

Since Hu Feng regards people's desire to survive as the driving force for promoting history, he also regards the spontaneous resistance struggle among the people as the foundation of revolutionary force. We have already seen that when he explained the significance of the "May Fourth" Movement, he deliberately tampered with the proposition that revolutionary theory grasps the masses and becomes a material force into the proposition that people's desire to survive becomes a material force; like this, he said in "For Tomorrow" (page 103): "For materialists, spontaneous struggle is a signal for the transformation of ideals into material force, and is the base for ideals to move towards victory, …. In a specific historical category, materialists have the obligation to see the typical principled significance from the spontaneous struggle."

Marxists attach importance to the role of theory because theory reflects the objective laws of historical development, enabling human actions to consciously conform to the requirements of objective laws. Precisely because of this, Marxism has always opposed the worship of spontaneity. However, Hu Feng believes that worshiping spontaneity is the obligation of materialists. What kind of "materialism" is this?

Gorky said: "'Spontaneity', according to its essence, is actually nothing else but the instinctive anarchism of the individual. This is what the class state has taught the individual under hundreds of years of oppression." Therefore, revolutionary leadership must never rely on it as a "foundation," but only guide the spontaneous struggle of the people to the path of consciousness through education and propaganda methods.

In order to defend his point of view, Hu Feng deliberately distorted Lenin's words in his "Opinions on Literary and Art Issues." He said, what is spontaneity? It is enough to explain this with a sentence from Lenin: "The 'spontaneous component' is actually nothing more than the sprouting of consciousness." But he deleted the following sentence from Lenin; the following sentence is: "But this behavior is ultimately mostly a manifestation of desperate struggle and revenge, and it is difficult to say that it is a struggle." ("Selected Works of Lenin" Volume 1, page 201, Moscow Edition, 1949) He also quoted Lenin as saying that "all the drops and trickles of the angry mood of the masses" should be "collected and concentrated" and "collected into a huge torrent," but he also deleted the following sentence: "As for the possibility of realizing this task, the large-scale growth of the workers' movement and the desire of workers for political publications already pointed out above have already proved it very surely." ("Selected Works of Lenin" Volume 1, page 244, Moscow Edition, 1949) It can be seen that Lenin's meaning is to emphasize the role of revolutionary propaganda and organization work, and to oppose the worship of spontaneity. Lenin's "What is to be Done?" was originally written to criticize the theory of worshiping spontaneity, but Hu Feng actually tried to find the theoretical basis for his theory in this classic work. This is not because Hu Feng is too stupid, but because he regards the readers as too stupid and too easy to deceive!

It is worth noting that the time when Hu Feng most actively promoted this theory of worshiping spontaneity was in 1948, precisely when the Chinese people's liberation struggle had already shaken the whole country, and not only in the liberated areas, but also in the Kuomintang-ruled areas, the revolutionary masses' struggle with leadership and organization had also been very high. At this time, Hu Feng issued a call to the writers in the Kuomintang-ruled areas: "Discovering and reflecting this spontaneity is the solemn task of the writers who are unfortunately placed in the big 'quagmire' where they can only open up a way to survive based on it." ("On the Road of Realism" 123) The problem is not whether to describe spontaneous struggle (a writer can of course describe these struggles), but what attitude to take towards spontaneous struggle. 1948 was the eve of the demise of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. In this "specific historical category," Hu Feng still believed that only relying on spontaneity can open up a way to survive for the people in the Kuomintang-ruled areas. What does this mean?

Hu Feng's theory of worshiping spontaneity is not only due to his idealist worldview, but also due to his strange attitude towards actual politics. He deliberately obliterates the specific historical struggle situation at that time, obliterates the expansion of the Party's influence and the high tide of the masses' conscious movement. The motive of Hu Feng's deliberate distortion of reality, in fact, is not so much due to his worship of spontaneity as it is due to his antipathy towards the material force created by the revolutionary theory grasping the masses, that is, the people's struggle with leadership and organization?

From the above brief analysis, it can be seen that the main characteristics of Hu Feng's idealist worldview are to unilaterally emphasize the role of man's subjective spirit and obliterate its dependence on the objective world; and in his view of history, it is to unilaterally emphasize the role of the individual and obliterate the role of class and class struggle, to regard the masses of the people as a passive force, to obliterate the role of the masses of the people as creators of history; to emphasize the spontaneity in the people's struggle and to obliterate the role of revolutionary theory. These are all incompatible with Marxism. But he insisted on using "Marxism" to disguise himself and deceive readers, so he had to painstakingly distort and destroy Marxist theory. The harmfulness of this kind of thought lies mainly in this.

Hu Feng's thought is a stubborn, systematic, and persistent anti-Marxist bourgeois idealist thought that has lasted for more than ten years. It is obviously not the same as the unstable tendencies of subjectivism and individualism that are common among ordinary petty-bourgeois elements. The harmful effect of Hu Feng's thought is not only because it has caused a series of confusions and errors in the field of literature and art, but more importantly, because it has spread idealist viewpoints among young people under the guise of "Marxism," using the young people's desire to pursue truth and lack of social struggle experience, inducing them to take erroneous or even antagonistic views towards revolutionary struggle, the masses of the people, and the Party, thus harming the interests of the revolution. Precisely because of this, thoroughly criticizing Hu Feng's anti-Marxist thought is not only an important task for the literary and art circles, but also one of the important tasks for the entire ideological front at present.

    胡风的唯心主义世界观
    邵荃麟
    他们说：我们基本上是马克思主义者，不过我们想把马克思主义“改善”一下，想使它抛弃某些基本原理。其实，他们是仇视马克思主义的，因为他们极力想摧毁马克思主义底理论基础，虽然他们口头上是用一种虚伪辞句否认其对马克思主义的仇视，并继续用两面派态度自称为马克思主义者。……这种破坏马克思主义理论基础的批评愈虚伪，则它对党也愈加危险，因为它愈益与反动势力反对党和反对革命的总进攻密切结合起来……。
    于是在马克思主义者面前就摆着一个极迫切的任务：必须对这种背叛马克思主义理论的变节分子给予一个应有的驳斥，撕破他们的假面具，把它们彻底揭穿，这样来保持住马克思主义党的理论基础。（“联共（布）党史简明教程”第四章，莫斯科外国文书籍出版局）
    十多年以来，胡风和他的小集团，一直以“马克思主义”的姿态，宣传着一种反马克思主义的理论。这种理论的基本特征就是否认马克思主义的
  “存在决定意识”的基本原则。他们不但以一种超阶级的主观精神作为文艺创作的出发点，否认阶级立场、社会思想和世界观对于创作的作用，否认文学的阶级性和党性原则；而且以这种主观精神作为历史的原动力，否认社会物质生活条件、生产方式、阶级斗争在历史发展中的决定意义，也否认反映社会物质生活和阶级斗争的发展趋势的先进社会思想对于历史和群众的伟大作用，否认觉悟性和组织性在群众斗争中的伟大作用。胡风的错误文艺理论的基础，就是这种完全反马克思主义的主观唯心主义的世界观。
    否认唯物主义
    胡风的一个最基本的观点，就是把人的主观作用看作是对客观世界的决定因素。唯物主义认为人的精神意识由社会物质生活条件所决定，又反转来影响社会存在，影响物质生活条件的发展。社会经济关系是按照客观规律而发展的，这种客观规律是不以人们的意志为转移的客观过程的反映；人们可以去发现、认识、研究和利用这些规律，但并不能去制定或创造这些规律。可是胡风的意见恰好相反。他在“论现实主义的路”（一○一页）里说：
      人创造了历史，但这个被人创造了而且还在创造
  着的历史，却是运动在被人所创造出的物质关系的限
    制性即规律性里面。……人就活在这个物质关系里
    面，斗争着，产生了那规律性也发展那规律性，在那
    规律性底限制下面继续地创造着历史的。历史唯物论
    所要说明的就是这个问题。
    这就是胡风的所谓“历史唯物论”！胡风在这里究竟是说人创造了物质关系，还是说人创造了规律性，不很明了，但是他的目的却是明了的：否认物质关系或物质关系的规律性的客观性质。他既然认为人是可以产生和发展历史的客观规律，那也就是说，人的主观意识决定着客观存在的发展，而并不是被决定于客观存在的发展。这样就从根本上破坏了唯物主义的基本原则。他用这种反唯物主义的观点去认识历史和人民，因而不能不陷入于一系列的根本错误。
    胡风是怎样来看历史的呢？
      生活在以经济关系为基石的社会诸关系里面的人民，在重重的剥削和奴役下面担负着劳动的重负，善良地担负着，坚强地担负着，不流汗就不能活，甚至不流血也不能活，但却“脚踏实地”地站在地球上面流着汗流着血地担负了下来。这伟大的精神就是世界底脊梁。要说健康，还有比这更健康的么？然而，这承受劳动重负的坚强和善良，同时又是以封建主义底各种各样的具体表现所造成的各式各态的安命精神为内容的。前一侧面产生了创造历史的解放要求，但后一侧面却又把那个要求禁锢在、麻痹在、甚至闷死在“自在的”状态里面；这个惯常是被后一侧面所包围的统一着但却对立着的内容，激荡着、纠结着、相生相克着，形成了一片浩漫的大洋。每一个人民底内容都是这样一片浩漫的大洋。要不然，单看前者，那些剥削和奴役就不可能，我们也不会有一部封建主义旧中国底历史；单看后者，封建主义的旧中国底历史就会平静无波，仅仅就近代史说罢，太平天国以来的前仆后继的流血斗争就没有出现的可能。（“论现实
    主义的路”一一六—一一七页）
    胡风认为人民身上有两种精神在进行着“相生相克”的斗争：一种是所谓“承受劳动重负的坚强和善良”，一种是所谓“安命精神”。这两种精神的矛盾和斗争，像一片浩漫的大洋一样，在人民身上
  “激荡着”、“纠结着”，构成了人民的生活内容，同时也构成了整个中国封建社会历史乃至整个人类历史的内容。
    照胡风看来，封建奴役剥削之所以可能，似乎并不是因为封建阶级掌握了土地和其他生产资料，掌握了政治和经济的权力，而只是因为人民自己身上有这种“安命精神”，甘心做牛做马；人民的解放要求之所以不能实现，也并不是因为统治阶级的残酷压迫以及新的生产力还没有产生，而只是因为这种要求被人民自己的“安命精神”所闷死。这样一来，就把一切历史责任都推在人民身上，把封建统治阶级压迫人民剥削人民的罪恶轻轻地一笔勾消了。
    其次，他所谓“承受劳动重负的坚强和善良”又是什么呢？胡风在这里似乎是说人民在重重的奴役和剥削下的一种求取生存的意志和愿望，而这就是胡风所谓推进历史的动力。历史上之所以出现前仆后继的革命斗争，在他看来，就是因为人民有这种求生意志和愿望；如果这种意志和愿望不是受着他们自己的那种“安命精神”所克制，那末封建奴役剥削早已不能存在，我们也不会有一部封建主义旧中国的历史了。他把历史发展的原因归结到人的愿望和精神，并且把这种精神说成是“世界底脊梁”。
    胡风在“冬夜短想”里说：“希望未来比过去好，希望自己的生活总有变得幸福的一天。这也是卑微的感情，然而，尽管是卑微的感情罢，人类是靠它繁衍下来的，历史是靠它发展下来的，说得夸张一点，一切轰轰烈烈的社会改革的大斗争，也是靠它生发起来的。”同上文的意思一样。胡风答复对他的批评说，他这是说阶级斗争的动力；但是阶级斗争并不是以“希望未来比过去好”为动力的，因为在社会主义社会人们更希望未来比过去好，却并不发生阶级斗争，可见这动力只能是阶级和阶级矛盾的客观存在。胡风又说那“不过是一则小杂文而已”，可是“论现实主义的路”却是谈理论的专书，为什么论点却毫无二致呢？
    由此可见，胡风的观点是一贯的。他认定历史的内容只是人的精神世界中的矛盾和斗争：推动历史发展的就是人的求生意志和愿望；阻碍历史发展的就是人的“安命精神”。这两种精神或意识的矛盾和斗争，支配着、决定着人民的命运和历史的发展。不是社会的物质生活条件决定人的精神意识，而是人的精神意识在决定历史的发展。胡风就用这种反历史的唯心主义观点来解释历史！
    否认阶级斗争
    由这种唯心主义的历史观出发，胡风已经在实际上取消了阶级斗争的作用，因为谁都知道，阶级斗争是生产力和生产关系的矛盾的反映，而不是什么“安命精神”和“求生愿望”的矛盾的反映。可是胡风既然要披着马克思主义的外衣，干脆否认阶级斗争是困难的，因此，他就力图在阶级和阶级斗争的词句下面抽掉它们的真实含义。
    胡风在“论现实主义的路”一书中曾经引用马克思、恩格斯的许多话，分析社会与个人的关系，最后他达到一个论断，认为“阶级是在活的个别的阶级成员里面，或通过他而存在的，离开了具体的活的阶级成员就没有阶级”，因而推论下去，认为“每一个人就是一个世界”，“任何一个人都是一个典型”，必须“从一粒砂里看世界，……而且非如此不可”。就这样，个别的人和阶级就被他等同起来了。我们知道，阶级社会的人生活在阶级中间，不能离开阶级而独立。人的意识受他的阶级生活所支配，所以要理解人，必须从他所处的社会关系中去认识。而胡风却说是阶级活在个别的人身上，说是只能从个人去看社会，而不可能从社会去看个人。他所谓
  “一个人就是一个世界”，“任何一个人都是一个典型”，“从一粒砂里看世界”，和他所说的每个人身上都有两种精神在相生相克的意思是相通的，目的无非要证明阶级斗争只是在每个人的心里进行着。这实际上是否定了阶级的意义，把阶级斗争还原为个人精神世界中的斗争，把社会的人还原为个别的人了。
    历史唯物主义者从来不把人看作抽象的人，而是看作具体的人，社会的人。所谓社会的人，就是因为人是处在社会的关联里。马克思在批判费尔巴哈时说，他“没有在人所处的社会关联里去把握人，没有在把人造成了现在这样存在着的生活诸条件下面去把握人，因而他决不能达到现实存在的活动的人，毋宁说是停止在‘人’这个抽象物前面，他所成就的不过是仅仅在感觉里承认了‘现实的有着个人的血肉的人’而已，即，除了性爱和友情以外，他不知什么其他的‘人对人的’‘人的关系’，而且，连这也是观念化了的。”胡风引用了马克思的这一段话，但实际上恰恰是反驳了自己！
    胡风主编的“希望”上经常地宣传着他的这种荒谬的阶级和阶级斗争的理论。例如说：“所谓阶级意识是一种抽象的、典型的东西……没有任何一个具体的人，具有如理论家所分析的阶级意识的。”（舒芜）；例如说：“哪里有生活，那里就有斗争”（胡风）；例如说：“在今天的阶级社会当中，生活就是斗争。生活之所以是斗争，就是由于今天它是含有阶级性质在里面。”（阿垅）而他们的所谓生活，指的却不是社会生活，而是个人的日常生活。因此，推论下去，他们甚至认为“吵架”和“求爱”也是阶级斗争！把阶级斗争这样地抽象化、庸俗化、漫画化，不是为着取消阶级斗争，又是为着什么呢？
    胡风把阶级斗争抽象化并且解消成为个人精神世界的斗争的观点，在他对于“五四”运动的分析中表现得最为露骨。在他看来，“五四”以来的反帝反封建斗争的基本内容，就是“使人民创造底历史的解放要求……从一层又一层的沉重的精神奴役的创伤下面突围出来，解放出来，挣扎出来，向前发展，变为物质的力量”（“论现实主义的路”一一七页）。
    这段话很难懂，需要注释一下：什么是“精神奴役的创伤”呢？据他自己解释说，“在科学的分析上，可以用‘缺点’去指明”，那末就是指人民中间的缺点了。说得明白一点，就是长期以来封建统治阶级遗留给人民的愚昧、无知、麻木、庸俗等等，和“安命精神”实际上是同一类的东西。胡风认为要解放人民，首先必须“一层又一层的”去剥掉人民身上的那些“创伤”，必须“一鞭一血痕的”去批判那些“创伤”，然后才能从密密层层的“创伤”下面去寻找出“支配历史命运的潜在力量”。而这也就是胡风所认识的“五四”运动的基本内容。试问，谁能从这里看到一点阶级斗争的影子呢？
    胡风实际上完全看不见被压迫阶级的力量，看不见人民的英勇和智慧，只看到人民满身都是所谓“精神奴役的创伤”。他向作家说：“他们底精神要求虽然伸向着解放，但随时随地都潜伏着或扩展着几千年的精神奴役底创伤。作家深入他们，要不被这种感性存在的海洋（指人民的海洋—作者）所淹没，就得有和他们底生活内容搏斗的批判的力量。”（“逆流的日子”二六页）劳动人民群众竟然像一片“潜伏着或扩展着几千年的精神奴役底创伤”的海洋，而这片海洋竟然可以“淹没”作家，他把人民群众看成了什么，把人民的缺点夸张到了什么程度！
    我们知道，劳动人民尽管在剥削阶级的长期统治下遭受过残酷的精神奴役和思想毒害，这种精神奴役和思想毒害也确实阻碍过他们革命的自觉，但无论如何他们自己阶级意识和力量却是不能被征服的，他们反抗统治阶级的斗争是不会停止的。历史唯物主义者认为历史是人民创造的，而人民是有无限前途的。新的东西是一天天在生长，旧的东西是一天天在衰老；新的东西即使微小，但终究不可克服地要成长起来。所以我们必须向前看，善于辨别出生活中新的东西、革命的东西，才能使我们具有生气勃勃的乐观主义的战斗精神，看到革命的光明前途。只有那些脱离群众的反动的个人主义者，才把人民群众看作是愚昧、无知、庸俗、自私的芸芸众生，仿佛只有他自己才是背着十字架的救世主。这正是没落时期资产阶级的唯心主义世界观的特点之一。
    然而胡风还不仅如此。他甚至把人民的所谓
  “精神奴役的创伤”说成是“虐杀千万生灵的可怕的屠刀”。他说：
        那精神奴役的创伤，当“潜在着”的时候，是怎样
    一种禁锢、玩弄、麻痹、甚至闷死千千万万的生灵的
  力量，当“拓展着”，特别是在进入了实践过程的成
    员身上（指革命队伍的成员身上——作者）拓展着的时
  候，会成为一种怎样的虐杀千万生灵的可怕的屠刀。
  是不是如此，三十年以来的光辉而又痛苦的鲜血淋漓
    的历史道路当会站出来作证的。（“论现实主义的
    路”一一八页）
    三十年来的历史还在我们眼前，三十年来鲜血淋漓的斗争并没有被人民所忘记，那曾经闷死过、虐杀过千千万万生灵的，难道不是帝国主义，不是蒋介石，反而是人民自己吗？反而是革命队伍中的成员吗？反而是他们自己的缺点在屠杀他们自己吗？那杀人的屠刀不是掌握在敌人的手里，反而是掌握在革命队伍的成员手里吗？我们不能不追问一下，当胡风写下这段话的时候，他那杀气腾腾的笔锋，究竟是指向着什么？
    看来似乎是明白的了：胡风虽然从历史上取消了阶级斗争，但是他自己却是在进行着阶级斗争的，不过他不是向人民的敌人斗争，而是向人民斗争罢了！
    否认革命理论和革命组织的作用
    胡风虽然竭力夸张人民的落后，却并不因此而认为人民必须用革命理论和革命组织武装起来，以便脱离缺乏觉悟的落后状态。相反的，他竭力否认革命理论和革命组织的作用，认为自发斗争才是人民的出路。这正是他否认历史唯物主义、否认阶级斗争、否认人民的历史地位和光明前途的必然结果。
    胡风既然把人的求生愿望看成是推进历史的动力，因此他也就把人民中间那种自发的反抗斗争看作是革命力量的基础。我们已经看到，他在解释“五四”运动的意义时故意把革命理论掌握群众变为物质力量的命题涂改成为使人民的求生愿望变为物质力量的命题；和这一样，他在“为了明天”中（一○三页）说：“对于唯物主义者，自发性的斗争是理想转变为物质力量的信号，是理想走向胜利的基地，……。在特定的历史范畴上，唯物主义者是有义务从自发性的斗争里面看出典型性的原则上的意义的。”
    马克思主义者重视理论的作用，是因为理论反映了历史发展的客观规律，使人类的行动得以自觉地符合于客观规律的要求。也正因为这样，马克思主义从来是反对崇拜自发性的。胡风却认为崇拜自发性是唯物主义者的义务。这是一种什么“唯物主义”呢？
    高尔基说：“‘自发性’，按照它的本质，其实并不是什么别的，正是个性的本能的无政府主义。这是阶级国家对于个性的几百年的压迫下所教养出来的。”所以革命的领导决不能依靠它作为“基础”，而只有通过教育宣传方法把人民这种自发性斗争引导到自觉的道路上来。
    胡风为了辩护他的观点，在他“对文艺问题的意见”中故意曲解列宁的话。他说，什么是自发性？这只须用列宁一句话来说明就够了：“‘自发的成分’实际上无非是觉悟性底萌芽”。但他却把列宁下面一句话删掉了；下面一句话是：“但这种行为终究多半是拚命挣扎与报复底表现，而很难说是斗争。”（“列宁文选”两卷集第一卷二○一页，一九四九年莫斯科版）他又引用列宁说过的，应当把“民众愤怒情绪底一切水滴和细流收集和集中起来”“将其汇集成为一条巨流”，可是同样又把下面一句话删掉了：“至于这个任务可能实现，则工人运动大规模的增长以及上面已经指出的那种工人渴望政治刊物的情形，都已经十分确凿地证明了。”（“列宁文选”两卷集第一卷二四四页，一九四九年莫斯科版）可见列宁的意思正是强调革命的宣传和组织工作的作用，反对自发性的崇拜。列宁的“做什么？”本来就是为批判那种崇拜自发性的理论而写的，而胡风居然企图从这本经典著作里去找寻他的理论根据，这并不是胡风太愚蠢，而是他把读者看得太愚蠢，太容易欺骗了！
    值得注意的是胡风最积极地宣传这种崇拜自发性的理论的时候是在一九四八年，正是中国人民解放斗争已经震荡全国的时候，不但解放区、而且国民党统治区革命群众有领导有组织的斗争也已经十分高涨的时候。胡风就在这个时候向国民党统治区作家提出号召：“发现并反映这个自发性，正是不幸置身在只有依据它才能开辟生路的大‘泥沼’里面的作家们底庄严的任务。”（“论现实主义的路”一二三页）问题并不在于能否描写自发性斗争（一个作家当然可以描写这些斗争），而在于对待自发性斗争采取什么样的态度。一九四八年是蒋介石匪帮统治灭亡的前夜，在这个“特定的历史的范畴上”，胡风却依旧认为在国民党统治区只有依据自发性才能为人民开辟生路，这是什么意思呢？
    胡风这种崇拜自发性理论，不仅是由于他的唯心主义的世界观，并且由于他对于实际政治的奇异态度。他故意抹煞当时的具体历史斗争情况，抹煞党的影响的扩大和群众的自觉运动的高涨。胡风这种故意歪曲现实的动机，实在说来，与其说是由于他对于自发性的崇拜，还不如说是由于对于革命理论掌握了群众所造成的物质力量即人民群众有领导的有组织的斗争的恶感吧？
    从以上简略的分析中，可以看出胡风的唯心主义世界观的主要特征，就是片面地强调人的主观精神的作用，抹煞它对于客观世界的依赖关系；而在他对于历史的看法上，就是片面地强调个人的作用，抹煞阶级和阶级斗争的作用，把人民群众看成消极力量，抹煞人民群众作为历史创造者的作用；强调人民斗争中的自发性，抹煞革命理论的作用。这些都是和马克思主义绝不相容的。但是他偏要用
  “马克思主义”来伪装自己，欺蒙读者，因此他就不得不处心积虑地来曲解和破坏马克思主义理论。这种思想的危害性，主要就在这里。
    胡风这种思想，是一种顽强的、有系统的、坚持了十多年之久的、反马克思主义的资产阶级唯心主义思想，和一般小资产阶级分子所常有的主观主义和个人主义的不稳定的倾向，显然是不能同日而语的。胡风这种思想的危害作用，不仅是由于它在文艺领域上曾经造成了一系列的混乱和错误，更重要的是由于它在“马克思主义”的伪装下，利用青年人追求真理的热望和缺乏社会斗争经验，在他们中间散布了唯心主义的观点，引诱他们对于革命斗争、对于人民群众、对于党采取错误的甚至对立的看法，因而损害了革命的利益。正因为这样，彻底批判胡风的反马克思主义思想，不但是文艺界，而且是整个思想战线当前的重要任务之一。
