Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st — Unofficial results of the Japanese Diet House of Representatives election held on February 27th have been announced.

According to a Kyodo News Agency report on March 1st, the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is as follows: Democratic Party 185 seats, Liberal Party 112 seats, Left-wing Socialist Party 89 seats, Right-wing Socialist Party 67 seats, Labor-Farmer Party 4 seats, Communist Party 2 seats, other parties and independents a total of 8 seats.

The election results show that the Japanese people's desire to break free from American control and implement a policy of peace and independence has been reflected to a considerable extent.

The Liberal Party, associated with the name of former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, lost 68 seats in this election. This right-wing party has been spurned by the Japanese people for pursuing a pro-American and humiliating policy for many years.

The currently ruling Hatoyama Democratic Party gained 61 seats. As the "Yomiuri Shimbun" pointed out, voters cast their ballots for the Democratic Party because it had promised in the election campaign to restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union.

It is worth noting that the Democratic Party's gains do not even offset the Liberal Party's losses. These two conservative parties originally hoped to obtain two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives so that they could amend the Japanese Constitution's provisions on renouncing war after the election, in order to proceed freely with rearmament. Now, this hope has been dashed.

The Japanese Communist Party, which put forward a positive program for peace and independence in the election campaign, achieved a significant victory despite being in extremely difficult conditions. Not only was incumbent House member Kanichi Kawakami re-elected, but also Yoshio Shiga, a leader of the Japanese Communist Party who had long been persecuted, was elected as a member of the House of Representatives.

The left- and right-wing Socialist Parties, which advocated the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union and opposed the conclusion of a war treaty with the United States, gained 15 and 6 seats respectively in this election. Thus, after this election, a new situation has emerged in the Japanese House of Representatives: the Communist Party and the left- and right-wing Socialist Parties and the Labor-Farmer Party, which oppose Japan's return to the path of war, together hold 162 seats, exceeding one-third of the total number of seats. This number of votes will be able to defeat any conspiracy by the conservative parties to amend the constitution.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 1st — According to an announcement by the Japanese National Police Agency on February 28th: As of February 28th, a total of 1,181 cases of violations of election laws had been reported in this election, and a total of 2,066 people had been arrested. The number of illegal incidents reached the highest record since the war. Among these illegal incidents, the number of people involved in vote-buying cases was the largest. The situation of violations of election laws was so serious that even on the morning of February 27th when voting was taking place, the police authorities had to arrest some conservative party campaign workers who were obviously engaged in bribery. Democratic Party candidate Toyoji Matsuoka (transliteration) was also arrested on suspicion of bribery.

During the election campaign, the election activities of progressive forces in Japan were persecuted. For example, on February 26th, the fascist group "Shunkoku Youth Corps" in Kumamoto City, Kumamoto Prefecture, used violence to prevent a Japanese Communist Party candidate from giving a campaign speech, injuring one member of the Japanese Communist Party. On the same day, this fascist group also smashed the windows of the Kumamoto Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party and injured Eiji Inoue, a member of the Japanese Communist Party who had once prepared to participate in the election. However, the police turned a blind eye to the above-mentioned atrocities.

### 日本众议院议员选举的非正式结果揭晓  媚美屈辱的外交政策遭到唾弃，恢复日中日苏邦交主张受欢迎

    日本众议院议员选举的非正式结果揭晓
    媚美屈辱的外交政策遭到唾弃，恢复日中日苏邦交主张受欢迎
    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：二月二十七日举行的日本国会众议院议员选举的非正式结果已经揭晓。
    据共同社三月一日发表的统计，众议院议席的分配如下，民主党一百八十五席，自由党一百一十二席，左派社会党八十九席，右派社会党六十七席，劳农党四席，共产党二席，其他党派和无党派共八席。
    从选举的结果中可以看得出，日本人民要求摆脱美国控制和实行和平、独立的政策的愿望在相当的程度上得到了反映。
    和前首相吉田茂的名字联系在一起的自由党在这次选举中失去了六十八席，这个右翼政党因为在过去多年来执行媚美屈辱的政策，受到了日本人民的唾弃。
    目前执政的鸠山民主党增加了六十一席。正如“读卖新闻”指出，选民投民主党的票，是因为它曾在竞选中许下了要同中国和苏联恢复邦交的诺言。
    值得注意的是，民主党所增加的议席还抵不过自由党所减少的议席。这两个保守党派原来希望能够取得众议院三分之二的议席，以便在大选后能够修改日本宪法关于弃绝战争的规定，好放手进行重新武装。现在，这种希望已落空了。
    在竞选中提出了争取和平和独立的积极纲领的日本共产党，虽然处在极端困难的条件下，仍然获得了意义重大的胜利。不但原众议员川上贯一继续当选，而且长期遭受迫害的日本共产党领导人志贺义雄也被选为众议员。
    在竞选中主张日本同中苏两国恢复邦交，反对同美国缔结战争条约的左、右派社会党，在这次大选中分别增加了十五席和六席。这样，这次大选后，在日本众议院已出现了新的形势：反对日本重新走战争道路的共产党和左、右两派社会党以及劳农党一共拥有一百六十二个议席，超过全部议席三分之一以上。这个票数将能击破保守党派任何修改宪法的阴谋。
    【新华社一日讯】东京消息：据日本警察厅二月二十八日宣布：截至二月二十八日为止，在这次大选中被告发的违反选举法的事件共有一千一百八十一件，被逮捕的人共二千零六十六人。违法事件达到战后的最高纪录。在这些违法事件中，以收买选票案件所牵连的人数为最多。违反选举法的情况如此严重，甚至在二月二十七日早晨投票的时候，警察当局又不得不逮捕了一些明显地进行贿选的保守党派竞选工作人员。民主党候选人松冈丰二（译音）也因贿选嫌疑被捕。
    在竞选期间，日本进步力量的竞选活动受到了迫害。例如，在二月二十六日，熊本县熊本市的法西斯团体“殉国青年队”为了阻止日本共产党候选人发表竞选演说，竟施用暴力，打伤日本共产党员一人。在同一天，这个法西斯团体还捣毁日本共产党熊本县委员会的玻璃窗，打伤了曾经一度准备参加竞选的日本共产党员井上荣治。但警察对上述的暴行，竟然熟视无睹。
