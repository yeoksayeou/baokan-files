To the Editor:

I am a finance worker. Last year, I assisted in inspecting the financial work of the China Department Store Company's Shenyang Regional Wholesale Station and found that the phenomenon of commodity backlog was very serious. For example, the overstocked (i.e., the stock beyond reasonable inventory) gold and steel nib pens amounted to more than 141,000 dozens, worth more than 2.7 million yuan. According to past market sales experience and estimates of future market development, it would take more than two years to sell these gold and steel nib pens. By then, the three expenses of interest, insurance, and storage fees alone would waste more than 370,000 yuan of state funds. In addition, there were a total of 62,287 pairs of men's and women's leather shoes in stock, worth more than 540,000 yuan. Due to poor storage, all of these leather shoes had become moldy and grown mildew, and many of them had deteriorated and been damaged. There were also more than 810,000 cans of canned goods in stock, worth more than one million yuan. Most of these canned goods were meat and fruit, with a short shelf life, and some had already begun to deteriorate.

The above are examples of the backlog of several major commodities, and the backlog of other commodities is also very serious.

Why does the China Department Store Company's Shenyang Regional Wholesale Station have a large backlog of inventory? This is mainly due to their lax procurement system and blind purchasing. They do not have enough understanding of market sales, and they are unclear about the inventory of goods. They unilaterally pursue famous brands, which makes the purchasing plan too large, resulting in a large backlog of goods. At the end of 1953, the number of various gold nib pens in stock at the China Department Store Company's Shenyang Wholesale Station could be sold for at least nine months based on the sales situation at that time. However, because they did not have a clear understanding of the inventory and unilaterally pursued famous brands, they believed that the so-called six famous brands such as Jin Xing, Xin Min, Jie Fang, Xin Hua, You Lian, and Bo Shi were insufficient, so in the first quarter of 1954, they signed a contract with the above-mentioned gold nib pen factories for 2,150 dozens of the six famous brand gold nib pens. As a result, 1,345 dozens of Jin Xing pens were purchased, and the insufficient number was made up with miscellaneous brands. Although the department knew that there were many miscellaneous brand gold nib pens in stock, in order to pursue famous brands, they did not hesitate to allow a large backlog of miscellaneous brand gold nib pens. In order to pursue famous brands, they also requested an additional 6,000 dozens of orders. Later, the factory only gave 540 dozens of Jin Xing pens. As a result, the famous brands were still insufficient, while miscellaneous brand gold nib pens were piled up in large quantities.

I believe that the commodity backlog situation at the Shenyang Regional Department Store Wholesale Station is very serious. After this matter was inspected, although the leaders of the Shenyang Regional Department Store Wholesale Station have paid attention to it and have taken some measures to improve it, this is a lesson worth learning for commercial departments in various places.

### 沈阳百货批发站的过错在哪里

    沈阳百货批发站的过错在哪里编辑同志：
    我是一个财务工作者，去年我曾配合检查过中国百货公司沈阳地区批发站的财务工作，发现商品积压的现象很严重。例如超储积压（即合理库存以外的积压）的各种金笔、钢笔就有十四万一千余打，价值二百七十余万元。按照过去市场销售的经验和结合将来的市场发展情况估计，这批金笔、钢笔就需要两年多的时间才能销完。到那时仅利息、保险费、保管费等三项费用就要浪费国家资金三十七万余元。又如，积压男女皮鞋共有六万二千二百八十七双，价值五十四万多元，由于保管不善，这些皮鞋已经全部发霉、长毛，有不少的皮鞋已经变质损坏。积压罐头八十一万多桶，价值一百多万元。这些罐头大部都是肉食和水果的，保效期较短，已经有一部分开始变质。
    以上是几种主要商品积压的实例，其他商品的积压情况也是很严重的。
    为什么中国百货公司沈阳地区批发站库存商品大批积压呢？这主要是由于他们采购制度不严和盲目进货所造成的。他们对于市场销售情况了解不够，对库存的商品也摸不清底，片面地追求名牌货，使进货计划偏大，造成商品大量积压。在一九五三年底中国百货公司沈阳批发站库存的各种金笔的数字，按照当时的销售情况至少可供九个月的销售，但由于他们对库存不摸底，片面地追求名牌货，认为金星、新民、解放、新华、友联和博士等所谓六大名牌货不足，便在一九五四年第一季度同上列金笔厂签订了二千一百五十打六大名牌金笔的合同。结果，购进了一千三百四十五打金星笔，不足的数目都用杂牌货凑数。该部虽然知道杂牌金笔库存很多，但为了追求名牌货，不惜让杂牌金笔大量积压，他们为了追求名牌货又追补了六千打的订货计划，后来厂方也仅仅给了五百四十打金星笔，结果是名牌货仍然不足，而杂牌金笔却大量地积压起来。
    我认为沈阳地区百货批发站的商品积压情况是十分严重的。这件事情经过检查以后，虽然沈阳地区百货批发站领导上已引起重视，并已采取了一些措施设法改进，但这是值得各地商业部门吸取的教训。
