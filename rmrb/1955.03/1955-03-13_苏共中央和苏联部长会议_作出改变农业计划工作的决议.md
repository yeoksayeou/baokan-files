Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 10th: TASS reports: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR have made a resolution "On Changing Agricultural Planning Work."

The resolution points out that the existing planning system is not in line with the needs of the country because of its excessive concentration and the large number of indicators stipulated for collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. This centralized planning has led to incorrect distribution of crops, preventing collective farms from more correctly organizing the raising of public livestock, and hindering the initiative of the staff of machine tractor stations.

The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers believe that a new system of planning work must be carried out in collective farms, and the starting point of this planning system should be the output of commodity products. The planning of agricultural production should be formulated directly by collective farms (in conjunction with machine tractor stations) and state farms, and should consider how to better utilize agricultural land.

Taking into account that collective farms only hand over a portion of their products to the state according to the system of sales, payments in kind, and sales, and that a large portion of the products are left at the disposal of the collective farms, the new planning system will provide collective farms with great possibilities to exert management initiative in order to better utilize the production potential of collective farms.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the USSR Council of Ministers decided that the state development plan for agriculture approved by the USSR Council of Ministers should stipulate the total amount of agricultural and livestock products to be purchased that can guarantee the needs of residents for food and the needs of industry for agricultural raw materials, and stipulate the total amount of tractor work that machine tractor stations should carry out in collective farms.

The resolution points out that, according to the state plan, the tasks for the second year should be notified to collective farms and machine tractor stations no later than September 1 of the current year. Each collective farm, with the participation of the machine tractor station, will independently decide the scope of the sown area of various crops, as well as the productivity of livestock production and the number of various types of livestock, based on the task of delivering agricultural and livestock products to the state and based on ensuring the needs of the collective farm and collective farm members for such products.

The resolution continues, the sowing plan and the plan for developing animal husbandry jointly formulated with the machine tractor station should be discussed and approved by the general meeting of all collective farm members.

The resolution also stipulates a new system for planning the work of machine tractor stations.

The resolution instructs the USSR State Planning Committee to focus on the following points in planning agriculture: formulating future plans, correctly allocating agricultural production according to domestic economic regions and natural geographical regions, so that agriculture can develop in a balanced manner with other sectors of the national economy.

### 苏共中央和苏联部长会议  作出改变农业计划工作的决议

    苏共中央和苏联部长会议
    作出改变农业计划工作的决议
    【新华社十一日电】　据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议作出了“关于改变农业计划工作”的决议。
    决议指出，现有的计划制度由于过分集中以及替集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场规定了大量的指标，所以是不切合国家需要的。这种由中央进行的计划工作造成了农作物分布不正确的现象，使集体农庄不能更加正确地组织公有牲畜的饲养工作，束缚了机器拖拉机站的工作人员主动性的发挥。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议认为必须在集体农庄中进行计划工作的新制度，这种计划制度的出发点应当是商品产品的产量。农业生产的计划应当直接由集体农庄（会同机器拖拉机站）和国营农场开始制定，并且应考虑如何更好地利用农业用地。
    由于考虑到集体农庄按照交售、实物支付和出售的制度交给国家的只是它们所生产的一部分产品，而很大一部分产品是留给集体农庄支配的这种情况，新的计划制度将为集体农庄提供巨大的可能来发挥经营积极性，以便更好地利用集体农庄的生产潜力。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议决定，在苏联部长会议批准的国家发展农业计划中，应规定能够保证居民对食品的需要和工业对农业原料的需要的农业和畜牧业的产品的征购总量，并且规定机器拖拉机站在集体农庄应进行的拖拉机工作的总量。
    决议指出，根据国家计划，第二年的任务最迟应当在当年九月一日之前就通知集体农庄和机器拖拉机站。各集体农庄在机器拖拉机站的参加下，根据向国家交售农业和畜牧业产品的任务和根据保障集体农庄和集体农庄庄员对这种产品的需要，自行决定各种农作物播种面积的范围以及畜牧业的产品生产率和各类牲畜的数量。
    决议接着说，和机器拖拉机站共同制定的播种计划和发展畜牧业的计划应该由集体农庄庄员全体大会加以讨论和批准。
    决议还规定了计划机器拖拉机站工作的新制度。
    决议责成苏联国家计划委员会在计划农业方面要集中注意下列几点：制定未来的计划，按照国内的经济区域和自然地理区域来正确配置农业生产，使农业能和国民经济其他部门均衡发展。
