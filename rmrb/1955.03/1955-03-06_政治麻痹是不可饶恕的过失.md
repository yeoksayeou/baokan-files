Political Paralysis is an Unforgivable Fault
To the Editorial Comrades:

    With extremely indignant feelings, we expose to you a serious incident of bureaucratic elements condoning bloodless counter-revolutionary criminals in persecuting revolutionary cadres. This incident occurred at the Shanxi Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School and has been going on for a long time, yet it has not been finally dealt with.

    The Shanxi Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School is a school for training worker-peasant revolutionary cadres, but the school's clinic has long been controlled by bad elements, becoming a place where crimes are committed against the people.

    The clinic's doctor, Qi Fengshan, was originally the chief of the medical corps of the puppet Yan army. Since Qi Fengshan infiltrated the Shanxi Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School in October 1952, he has used his position to frequently insult and rape female students. One female student, because she had some swelling, was deliberately told by Qi Fengshan: "The swelling is related to the malposition of the uterus." During the "moving of the uterus," Qi Fengshan raped her. Qi Fengshan habitually used despicable means such as exaggerating illnesses, examining the uterus, and using irritant drugs to treat female students, in order to achieve his evil purpose of rape. One female student had uterine bleeding due to excessive exercise on the playground, and Qi Fengshan raped the student under the pretext of examining her uterus. Qi Fengshan refused to treat women who resisted his insults and spread rumors to slander their character; he even maliciously damaged patients' bodies and harmed fetuses. For example, when female student Shi Yuying sought treatment from Qi Fengshan for her illness, Qi, as usual, insisted on examining her uterus and intentionally punctured her genitals, causing her to bleed profusely on the spot. It has now ulcerated, and she has lost her reproductive function. There are many similar cases.

    Originally, the actual person in charge of the clinic, Liu Puguang, was also a reactionary medical officer of the puppet Yan regime. He joined the workforce after liberation but was dismissed twice for smoking opium and embezzling public funds. Later, he infiltrated the Shanxi Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School and brought in the bad element Qi Fengshan. They colluded and committed evil deeds together, causing serious losses to the Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School.

    Many students reported Qi's criminal behavior to the school leadership, but the bureaucratic elements not only did not consider the demands and calls of the masses and promptly rectify the clinic and severely punish the criminals, but instead openly defended Qi Fengshan, saying, "Qi Fengshan is a good doctor." "We cannot demand too much from old personnel; bad work styles should be reformed slowly." "His skills are good; if we get rid of him, we won't find such a good doctor again." These bureaucratic elements even criticized the masses who offered opinions for "not being kind to others" and "not having the attitude of treating comrades." For example, after a female student named Jiang was raped by Qi, she reported Qi's evil deeds to Li Tianshou, the secretary of the general branch committee of the CCP Shanxi Worker-Peasant Rapid Course Middle School, but Li Tianshou not only did not listen to her accusations but instead blamed her for not forgiving old personnel, saying: "Qi is an old member, we cannot demand too much from him." In a fit of anger, the female student attempted suicide by taking poison (but was rescued). Afterwards, the leadership did not investigate the cause of her suicide but instead listened to Qi's rumors, saying that she "has a mental illness" and "has a bad work style," and forced her to withdraw from the school. Last year, when we sued Qi for his crimes in court, General Branch Secretary Li Tianshou even took a hindering attitude, saying: "This matter does not need to be publicized, let's report to the higher authorities and transfer Qi Fengshan away." These bureaucratic elements are so indifferent to the suffering and cries of the masses, and so concerned and caring for the criminals who are against the people. It can be seen how serious their political paralysis and failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves have become. Now Qi has been arrested by the court under our active struggle. In addition to demanding that the government severely punish this heinous criminal, we also demand that the relevant leaders give necessary punishment to those negligent personnel who are politically paralyzed and fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves.

### 政治麻痹是不可饶恕的过失

    政治麻痹是不可饶恕的过失编辑同志：
    我们以十分愤恨的心情，向你们揭发一件严重的官僚主义分子纵容杀人不见血的反革命罪犯摧残革命干部的事件。这一事件发生在山西工农速成中学，已经很久了，到现在还没有得到最后的处理。
    山西工农速成中学是培养工农革命干部的学校，而学校的医务所却长期在坏分子的把持下，成为对人民犯罪的地方。
    医务所的医生祁凤山原来是阎伪军军医处长，祁犯自一九五二年十月混进山西工农速成中学后，就利用职权经常侮辱和强奸女学生。有个女学生因身上有些发肿，祁凤山故意说：“身上发肿是子宫不正的关系。”在“搬子宫”时，祁犯就强奸了她。祁凤山惯用夸大病情、检查子宫以及使用刺激性药品等恶劣手段对待女生，以达到奸污的罪恶目的。有个女生因在操场上运动过度而子宫出血，祁犯在检查子宫的借口下奸污了这个学生。祁犯对于抗拒污辱的妇女就拒绝给她医病，并放出谣言对她们进行人格上的诬蔑；甚至恶意摧残病人的身体和残害胎儿。如女生石玉英因病给祁犯医治，祁照例要检查子宫，并有意将她的生殖器戳坏，当场流血不止，现已溃烂，并失去了生殖的机能。类似这样的事还很多。
    原来，医务所的实际负责人刘普光也是阎伪的反动医官，他在解放后参加工作，曾因吸食毒品，贪污公款等而两次被开除；后来混入山西工农速成中学，又把坏分子祁凤山拉进来，他们勾结一起，为非作恶，使工农速成中学遭到了严重损失。
    许多同学纷纷把祁犯的罪恶行为向学校领导方面反映，可是官僚主义分子不但没有考虑群众的要求和呼声，及时整顿这个医务所，严厉处理犯罪分子，相反地还公开替祁凤山辩护说：“祁凤山是个好医生。”“对旧人员不能要求过高，作风不好要慢慢改造。”“人家技术不错，把他弄走，再找不到这样的好医生了。”这些官僚主义分子甚至还批评提意见的群众“不是与人为善”，“不是对待同志的态度”。如有个姓江的女学生被祁犯奸污后，向中共山西工农速成中学总支委员会书记李天寿揭发祁犯的恶行，可是李天寿不但没有很好听取她的控诉，反而责怪她不原谅旧人员。说：“祁是旧人员，我们对他不能要求太高。”这个女同学在气愤不过的情况下就服毒自杀（遇救未死）。事后领导方面也不研究她自杀的原因，反听信祁犯的谣言，说她“有神经病”“作风不好”，而强迫她退出学校。去年，当我们向法院控诉祁犯的罪行时，总支书记李天寿还采取阻挠的态度说：“这事件不必声张，等我们报告上级把祁凤山调走算了。”这些官僚主义分子对于群众的痛苦和呼声是这样的冷淡，而对于反人民的罪犯却是如此地关怀和照顾。可见他们的政治麻痹、敌我不分达到如何严重的地步。现在祁犯已在我们积极斗争下被法院逮捕起来了，我们除了要求政府严厉地惩办这个罪大恶极的凶犯外，我们也要求有关领导方面对政治麻痹、敌我不分的失职人员予以必要的处分。
