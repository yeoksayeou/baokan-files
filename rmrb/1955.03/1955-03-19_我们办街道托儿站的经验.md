    Our Experience in Running Street-Level Nurseries
    Bai Ju-ru, Deputy Director of the Women and Children's Welfare Department of the Tianjin Municipal Democratic Women's Federation

    In recent years, the number of women participating in various work has increased, and the issue of childcare has become increasingly important. How well this problem is handled directly or indirectly affects production. For example, a cooperative in the Eighth District of Tianjin had forty female members, and because the childcare problem was not resolved, twelve female members requested to withdraw from the cooperative. Many mothers cannot concentrate on production because they have nowhere to leave their children. More importantly, because mothers are busy with work, many children do not receive adequate care, which affects their health. At the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress meeting, a total of twenty-eight comprehensive proposals regarding the establishment of nurseries were submitted by more than two hundred and forty units, groups, and individuals, covering almost all industries. This is enough to show the urgent demand of the majority of female workers for the establishment of childcare facilities.

    However, under the present circumstances, we cannot rely on and wait for the government to allocate a lot of funds to establish large-scale formal nurseries and kindergartens, because our country is carrying out large-scale socialist construction, and limited funds must first be used in the heavy industry sector. This requires us to find appropriate ways to solve the childcare problem according to needs and possibilities.

    According to the spirit of the Women and Children's Welfare Work Conference convened by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation in 1951, Tianjin began piloting street nurseries in 1952. Now there are twenty-nine such nurseries, taking in one thousand and ninety-nine children aged one to six. Most of the children's mothers are factory workers, and some are female cadres in government agencies, schools, and cooperatives, as well as some other working women. The size of the nurseries varies, generally taking in thirty to fifty children. The smallest takes in more than ten, and the largest takes in more than one hundred.

    The establishment of nurseries in Tianjin began with investigation work. The investigation work was presided over by the women's representative assembly and the street residents' committee. The content of the investigation included the mother's production and income, the human and material resources of the street, and the general situation of the mother's work unit. Only by grasping these situations in advance can we put forward correct construction plans and avoid blindness in the construction.

    It is very important to do a good job in ideological mobilization during the construction process. Tianjin encountered the following ideological obstacles during the construction process: If the mother's work unit is a state-owned factory, it emphasizes that the mother should solve the childcare problem herself, or advocates that the factory should run a formal nursery. The main concern of the capitalists of private small factories is the fear of spending money, and they often use "no precedent" as an excuse to shirk responsibility. The mothers' demands are urgent, but some people are afraid of spending too much money, and have the idea of relying on their own units and the government to solve funding problems or waiting for subsidies. Some mothers are also worried that the nurseries will not take good care of their children, so they adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Grassroots cadres and some people who are enthusiastic about childcare are generally enthusiastic, but lack experience, often do not proceed from reality, and want to engage in large-scale formal nurseries, so they have the idea of "no money, no work" and relying on the government. In response to these ideas, the problem should be solved from three aspects: clearly put forward the slogan "Rely on your own strength to solve your own problems" to mothers, and persuade them to overcome the idea of dependence. At the same time, we must persuade the mother's work unit to actively support the construction of the station. Tianjin used the method of holding forums for female workers to let the relevant leaders understand the actual difficulties of the female workers and realize the importance of establishing nurseries. For the grassroots cadres and activists in the streets, the main thing is to inspire their enthusiasm and confidence in building the station, and repeatedly explain to them the construction policy of gradual development and opposing greed for more and bigger, and call on them to rely on the masses and overcome difficulties.

    Through the above work, street nurseries have gradually developed. The characteristic of this kind of street nursery is that it is neither state-run nor private, but a mutual aid organization of the working masses themselves. It is production-oriented and serves working women. It is under the leadership of the Party committee and the government, and with the direct assistance of the Democratic Women's Federation and the trade union, it is jointly formed by the grassroots organizations of the street, people who are enthusiastic about childcare, the mothers of the children, and factories or government agencies with childcare problems. It not only undertakes the responsibility of educating and raising children, but also cultivates child educators and accumulates childcare experience.

    The funds of the nursery are based on the principle of self-sufficiency, and the amount of fees is determined according to the mother's economic ability and the necessary expenses for running the nursery. It neither relies on government subsidies nor puts too much burden on the mother. The children's living standards are neither too high nor lower than their families. The general fee for street nurseries in Tianjin is ten to twelve yuan. All stations have achieved self-sufficiency and have a slight surplus.

    The organizational structure of the nursery is based on the principle of being lean and simple. The staffing is mostly six (children) to one (staff), including the head of the station, child care workers, and cooks; generally, there are no accountants and other administrative personnel. Most of the staff are activists from the street women's representatives. Although their professional level is not high, they have a certain political awareness and a certain understanding of the childcare cause, so they are generally enthusiastic and responsible in their work.

    The nurseries are mostly located near factories and in streets with a large number of female workers, making it convenient for mothers to pick up and drop off their children. The time for childcare is from six or seven o'clock in the morning to six or seven o'clock in the afternoon, which is also suitable for the mother's working hours. At the same time, the children's diet and sleep in the nursery are regular, and there is also a certain amount of time for playing games, singing, and listening to stories. Each station can also ensure that children wash their hands and faces when they enter the station. The children's physical and mental health can be developed in a relatively healthy way, and the children's mothers are generally satisfied with the work of the nursery.

    Street nurseries are a work involving many aspects, and it is necessary to establish a strong leading body. Each street nursery in Tianjin has established a nursery management committee, which is mainly composed of the street office and the women's federation, including parent representatives, activists, and medical personnel. At the same time, a station director is also set up to be responsible for the daily management of the nursery. The leadership work of the nursery is based on such a broad mass base, so on the one hand, it can unite social forces to support the work of the nursery, and on the other hand, it is also convenient to solicit opinions from all parties and improve the work of the nursery.

    Continuously improving the professional level of the nursery is the key to running the nursery well. The district health section, the district democratic women's federation, the district trade union, and the district cultural and educational section should care about the work of the nursery, help the nursery establish various systems, such as scientific work and rest time, in-station education system, and health principles, so that the staff of the nursery can work and have the opportunity to improve their professional level, and at the same time organize the staff of the nursery to study politics and establish the professional ideology of childcare work. In leading the work of the nursery, all relevant departments should also pay attention to clearly defining the division of labor and unified planning to avoid confusion.

    Since 1954, Tianjin, in close cooperation with the health department, has adopted the method of cultivating typical examples to lead the general, and has held professional meetings, seminars, etc., and has also held amateur training classes for preschool children's education and nursery educators; therefore, in the past six months or so, the health care work and education work of each nursery have been significantly improved. Since the professional meeting of station directors, the democratic management of each station and the unity of the staff have been strengthened.

    At present, the twenty-nine nurseries in Tianjin are all full, but there are twenty to eighty or more children applying for admission to each nursery. In order to meet the requirements of the majority of female workers, this type of childcare institution should be developed in a planned and led manner in the future.

    To develop this type of childcare institution, we must first rely on the support of the Party committee and the government, and at the same time strive for the assistance of the administrative leaders and trade unions of the childcare units.

    In the development process of the nursery, housing will inevitably become a difficult problem, which mainly depends on the masses to solve; but the Municipal Housing Management Committee and the District Construction Section should give appropriate consideration according to the characteristics of the region, and give the nursery the right to rent preferentially as much as possible.

    我们办街道托儿站的经验
    天津市民主妇女联合会妇女儿童福利部副部长　白菊如
    这几年，妇女参加各项工作的人数越来越多，孩子的寄托问题越来越显得重要了。这个问题处理的好坏，直接间接地影响着生产。例如天津八区的一个合作社有四十个女社员，因为孩子寄托问题得不到解决，有十二个女社员要求退社。不少母亲因为孩子无处寄托，不能安心生产。更值得注意的是由于母亲忙于工作，有不少的孩子得不到适当的照顾，影响到身体的健康。在天津市第一次人民代表大会会议上，有关设立托儿所的综合案共二十八件，是由二百四十多个单位、小组和个人提出的，几乎包括了各个行业。这足以说明广大女职工要求建立托儿机构的迫切。
    但在今天的情况下，我们还不能依赖和等待政府拿出许多经费来大规模地举办正规托儿所和幼儿园，因为我们的国家正在进行大规模的社会主义建设，有限的资金必须首先使用到重工业部门。这便要求我们，根据需要和可能，找出解决托儿问题的适当办法。
    根据一九五一年中华全国民主妇女联合会召开的妇女儿童福利工作会议的精神，从一九五二年起，天津试办街道托儿站，到现在已有二十九处，收托一岁到六岁儿童一千零九十九名。儿童的母亲大多数是工厂女工，也有一部分机关、学校、合作社的女干部，还有一些其他的劳动妇女。托儿站的规模大小不等，一般都收托三十到五十名儿童，最少的收十多名，多的也有收到百名以上的。
    天津市建立托儿站是从调查工作入手的。调查工作由妇女代表会、街道居民委员会主持；调查的内容包括母亲的生产、收入情况，街道上群众的人力物力情况，以及母亲们所在工作单位的一般情况。只有在事先掌握了这些情况，才能提出正确的建站计划，避免建站中的盲目性。
    在建站过程中作好思想动员工作是十分重要的。天津市在建站过程中曾遇到以下几种思想障碍：母亲所在单位如果是国营工厂，就强调由母亲自己解决托儿问题，或主张由工厂办正规的托儿所。私营小厂资方的主要顾虑是怕花钱，常常以“没有前例”来推托。母亲们的要求是迫切的，但是也有一些人怕花钱多，有依赖本单位和政府解决经费问题或等待补助的思想。还有些母亲怕托儿站带不好孩子，因而抱观望态度。基层干部和一些热心保育事业的人士一般是热情的，但缺少经验，往往不从实际出发，想搞大规模的正规托儿所，因此有“无钱不办事”和依赖政府的思想。针对这些思想，应该从三个方面来解决问题：向母亲们明确地提出“依靠自己的力量，解决自己的问题”的口号，说服她们克服依赖思想。同时要说服母亲所在工作单位积极支持建站工作。天津市在建站过程中曾用召开女工座谈会的方式，使有关领导方面了解了女工的实际困难，认识了建立托儿站的重要性。对于街道的基层干部和积极分子，主要是启发他们的积极性和建站的信心，并向他们反复说明逐步发展、反对贪多图大的建站方针，号召他们依靠群众，克服困难。
    经过上述的工作，街道托儿站就逐步发展起来了。这种街道托儿站的特点是：它既不是国家举办的，也不是私立的，而是劳动群众自己的互助组织，它是面向生产，为劳动妇女服务的。它是在党委和政府的领导下，民主妇女联合会和工会的直接协助下，由街道基层组织、热心保育事业的人士、儿童的母亲、有孩子问题的工厂或机关合力组成的。它不仅担负着教养儿童的责任，而且在培养着儿童教养员，积累着托儿经验。
    托儿站的经费以自给自足为原则，根据母亲的经济能力和开办托儿站的必需费用来决定收费多少。既不依赖政府补助，也不使母亲有过重的负担。儿童生活水平既不过高，也不低于他们的家庭。天津街道托儿站一般收十元到十二元。各站都已做到自给自足，并稍有盈余。
    托儿站的组织机构根据精而简的原则，编制多为六（孩子）比一（工作人员），包括站长、保育员、炊事员；一般不设会计和其它事务人员。工作人员大部分是街道妇女代表中的积极分子，她们的业务水平虽然不高，但是有一定的政治觉悟，对保育事业有一定的认识，所以在工作上一般是热情的、负责的。
    托儿站多分布在工厂附近和女工较多的街道上，母亲接送儿童都方便。托儿的时间是从早晨六、七点钟到下午六、七点钟，也适合母亲的工作时间。同时，儿童在托儿站里的饮食、睡眠都有定时，也有一定时间作游戏、唱歌、听故事。各站并能做到儿童入站洗手洗脸。儿童的身心能得到比较健康的发展，孩子的母亲们对托儿站的工作一般都比较满意。
    街道托儿站是一项牵涉多方面的工作，建立一个强有力的领导机构十分必要。天津市各街道的托儿站都设立托儿站管理委员会，以街道办事处和妇代会为主，包括家长代表、积极分子、医务人员等。同时，还设一个站长负责托儿站的日常管理工作。托儿站的领导工作是建立在这样广泛的群众基础上，因而它一方面可以团结社会力量支持托儿站的工作，一方面也便于征求各方面的意见，改进托儿站的工作。
    不间断地提高托儿站的业务水平是办好托儿站的关键。区卫生科、区民主妇女联合会、区工会以及区文教科要关心托儿站的工作，帮助托儿站建立各种制度，如科学的作息时间、站内的教养制度、卫生原则，使得托儿站的工作人员一面工作，一面有机会提高业务水平，同时还要组织托儿站的工作人员学习政治，树立保育工作的专业思想。各有关部门在领导托儿站的工作中，还应当注意明确分工、统一计划，以避免发生混乱现象。
    自一九五四年以来，天津市在卫生部门密切配合下，采取了培养典型、带动一般的方式，分别召开了专业会议、座谈会等，并举办了学前儿童教育、托儿站教养员业余训练班；因此，最近半年多以来，各托儿站的卫生保健工作、教育工作，都有显著的改进。自站长专业会议以来，更加强了各站民主管理和工作人员的团结。
    目前天津市的二十九个托儿站都已满额，但是申请入站的儿童，每一托儿站都有二十到八十多名。为满足广大女职工的要求，今后应有领导、有计划地发展这类托儿机构。
    要发展这类托儿机构，首先必须依靠党委和政府的支持，同时应争取托儿单位的行政领导方面和工会的协助。
    在托儿站的发展过程中，房屋必然变成一个困难问题，这主要依靠群众来解决；但市房产管理委员会和区建设科，应根据地区特点，给予适当照顾，尽可能使托儿站有权优先租用。
