Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 13th: The Austrian Unity and Independence Congress was held in Vienna on March 13th. The congress was initiated by the "League of Austrian People's Opposition" and was attended by more than 1,000 representatives from various political parties, people's organizations, and trade unions.

Professor Dobretsberger, chairman of the "League of Austrian People's Opposition," delivered a report to the congress. He condemned the Austrian government for completely obeying the Western countries' war preparations plans and actively taking war preparation measures, encouraging the establishment of various militaristic organizations, and condoning the invasion of Austria by West German capital and militaristic forces. He noted that the Western countries are allowed to build military bases in western Austria. Dobretsberger pointed out that Austrian Chancellor Raab believes that negotiations on the Austrian treaty should only be conducted after the establishment of the German Bundeswehr, which shows that the Austrian government is more concerned with the establishment of the German Bundeswehr than with the conclusion of the Austrian treaty.

Dobretsberger spoke in detail about the great significance of the Soviet government's proposals for a rapid solution to the Austrian question and the Austrian government's attitude towards these proposals. He emphasized that the Austrian people demand a clear and concrete decision from the government. He said that the people should demand that the government approve the immediate convening of a four-power conference, with Austrian participation, to discuss the Austrian treaty. The government should require the great powers to take measures to ensure that there is no German-Austrian merger, and at the same time, it should undertake the obligation not to participate in any military or political conventions.

Dobretsberger concluded by saying that this congress should lay the foundation for launching a patriotic movement to strive for Austria's freedom, independence, and security. The aim of this movement should be to strive for the establishment of a European collective security system and to strive for peace and international cooperation.

A discussion of Dobretsberger's report followed. More than fifty representatives spoke during the discussion.

The participants finally adopted several resolutions. The first resolution stated that the Austrian Unity and Independence Congress warmly welcomes the new Soviet proposals for solving the Austrian question and demands that the government support the Soviet proposals. The congress requests the government to send a delegation to Moscow, in accordance with Molotov's initiative, in order to establish direct contact and discuss the initiation of preliminary negotiations on the signing of the Austrian treaty and on guaranteeing Austria's independence. The congress also passed a resolution expressing its welcome and support for the World Peace Council Standing Committee's Appeal to the People of the World, and calling on all Austrians to sign the Appeal to the People of the World, thereby promoting the cessation of atomic warfare and guaranteeing peace. Another resolution of the congress demanded that the government oppose turning Tyrol into an American occupation zone, oppose involving West Austrian territory in the military system of the Atlantic bloc, and oppose the establishment of military bases on Austrian territory.

    奥地利统一和独立大会通过决议
    欢迎苏联关于解决奥地利问题的新建议
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十三日讯：三月十三日在维也纳举行了奥地利统一和独立大会。这个大会是由“奥地利人民反对派联盟”发起的，参加大会的有各政治党派、人民团体、工会组织的一千多名代表。
      “奥地利人民反对派联盟”主席多布雷茨伯格教授在大会上作了报告。他谴责奥地利政府完全听命于西方国家的备战计划，并且积极采取备战措施，鼓动建立各种军国主义组织，纵容西德资本和军国主义势力侵入奥地利。允许西方国家在奥地利西部建筑军事基地。多布雷茨伯格指出，奥地利总理拉布认为只有在建立德国国防军之后才应该就对奥和约进行谈判，这说明奥地利政府更多关心的是建立德国国防军，而不是缔结对奥和约。
    多布雷茨伯格详细谈到苏联政府提出的迅速解决奥地利问题的建议的巨大意义和奥地利政府对这些建议的态度。他着重指出，奥地利人民要求政府作出明确而具体的决定。他说，人民应该要求政府，要它赞成立即召开有奥地利参加的讨论对奥和约问题的四国会议。政府应该要求大国采取措施以保障不发生德奥合并，同时自己也应该承担不参加任何军事性和政治性公约的义务。
    多布雷茨伯格最后说，这一次大会应该为展开争取奥地利自由、独立和安全的爱国运动打下基础。这个运动的目的应该是力求建立欧洲集体安全体系、争取和平和国际合作。
    接着对多布雷茨伯格的报告进行了讨论。在讨论中发言的共有五十多个代表。
    与会者最后通过了几项决议。第一项决议说，奥地利统一和独立大会热烈欢迎苏联关于解决奥地利问题的新建议，并且要求政府支持苏联的建议。大会要求政府根据莫洛托夫的倡议，派遣代表团前往莫斯科，以便建立直接接触，商讨开始举行关于签订对奥和约和关于保障奥地利独立的初步谈判。大会还通过决议，表示欢迎和拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会的告全世界人民书，并且号召全体奥地利人在告全世界人民书上签名，从而促进制止原子战争和保障和平。大会的另一项决议要求政府反对把蒂罗尔变为美国的占领区，反对让西奥地利的领土卷入大西洋集团的军事体系，反对在奥地利的领土上建立军事基地。
