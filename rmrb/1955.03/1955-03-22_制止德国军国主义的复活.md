    Curbing the Revival of German Militarism
    By Ye. Sdaliez, International Commentator for the Polish "People's Tribune"
    The West German Bundesrat has approved the Paris Agreements on March 18th. The French Council of the Republic is also about to debate the Paris Agreements. Whether the Paris Agreements are implemented or not will have a significant impact on the development of the European and world political situation. This issue is of vital interest to the Polish people, so the Polish public is closely watching the developments in West Germany and France.
    One of the main purposes of the Paris Agreements is to arm West Germany, to revive the Hitlerite Wehrmacht, which will be equipped with modern weapons of mass destruction, including atomic weapons.
    What German militarism is, does not need to be explained to the Polish people. The massacre of millions of Poles is the result of the crimes of the Hitlerite occupiers in Poland. It must be known that the heads of the new Bundeswehr are all generals who formerly served Hitler and have never changed their beliefs, and the West German rearmament movement is also carried out under the slogan of revenge, accompanied by rude anti-Polish and anti-Soviet slander campaigns.
    Every Pole regards German militarism as an irreconcilable enemy. Every Pole condemns the Washington protectors of German militarism and fully supports the policies of their government. The Polish government, together with the Soviet Union, is tirelessly fighting against West German militarism. And it can be said without exaggeration that the people of all European countries are joining us in this struggle.
    The people of Western European countries are firmly opposed to the Paris Agreements. Firstly, because the Paris Agreements, which are directed against the Soviet Union, Poland, and other people's democracies, increase the danger of war, which no European resident wants. Secondly, because, as historical experience has already shown, the spearhead of German militarist aggression is not only aimed at Eastern countries, but also at Germany's western neighbors. For example, Bonn officials have recently made territorial demands on France.
    The French people have written a glorious page in the history of the struggle against militarist Germany. Efforts to force France to agree to revive the German Wehrmacht in the form of the so-called "European Defense Community" have continued for several years. However, Dulles' oppression, threats, and intimidation could not subdue the French people. The French people answered, "No!" The Paris Agreements, which were used to replace the defunct "European Army" plan, were also rejected after fierce debates in the French National Assembly. Later, only under the very rude interference and pressure from the United States and Britain, the National Assembly voted on the motion of confidence proposed by Mendès-France, and passed the Paris Agreements with a narrow majority, but less than half of the total number of deputies voted in favor. The struggle is still continuing. Because of forcing the parliament to pass the Paris Agreements, Mendès-France lost his position as Prime Minister. The other three candidates who announced the same platform also failed after Mendès-France. Faure finally took this position, but is still very unstable. No matter who he is, as long as he is a supporter of the Paris Agreements, he will not be able to overcome the many difficulties.
    How do these people justify their betrayal of the people's interests?
    They cited the so-called "guarantees" of Britain included in the Paris Agreements. The Poles can talk about this. In the 1930s, when British imperialists, together with their American and French partners, supported Hitler, they also gave Poland "guarantees." And the value of this "guarantee" was witnessed by the Polish people in September 1939 when the first bombs fell on Warsaw. And the French have finally asked: Why give the fire to the arsonist and seek "guarantees" from those who oppose the arsonist? Isn't it safer not to give the fire to the arsonist?
    The supporters of the Paris Agreements then cited Adenauer's "guarantees" and the reservations regarding the quantitative restrictions on the Bundeswehr. However, first, these reservations are very unclear; second, these reservations can be changed by a majority vote, and the United States and France, unlike others, will always be able to obtain such a majority. As for the "guarantees" put forward by Adenauer, the French public is not difficult to see through the purpose of this "guarantee." The Paris Agreements include a Saar Agreement. The ink on these documents is not yet dry, and Adenauer and the West German Bundestag have already expressed doubts about it.
    Finally, the French ruling clique is also trying to deceive the people with such guarantees: it seems that once the Paris Agreements are ratified, it will be possible to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve the German question. This is deliberately lying. If the west of Germany is to become a breeding ground for war, a base and a shooting range for aggressive forces, how can negotiations be conducted on the establishment of a unified, democratic Germany? Ratifying the Paris Agreements and unifying Germany are mutually exclusive. This is what the Soviet government has emphasized more than once, and it is also what the declaration of the Moscow Conference of European countries pointed out.
    All these facts are penetrating deeper and deeper into the consciousness of the French public. The movement against the Paris Agreements includes the broadest strata of residents. Washington and London do not conceal their concern about this development of events. On February 28th, representatives of the United States and Britain visited Prime Minister Faure in Paris. The United Press International openly reported that the purpose of this visit was to "urge speedy ratification" of the Paris Agreements to militarize West Germany. The next day, Faure requested to determine that the debate would be held in the Council of the Republic on March 22nd.
    Even in West Germany, the struggle against militarization has reached a scale that the zealots who are restoring the Bundeswehr did not expect. As a result of the 1953 election, the Adenauer group formed a situation of absolute majority in the parliament. However, local elections held in various regions of West Germany show that Adenauer has lost the majority of voters. The Social Democratic Party, which represents nearly half of the residents, demanded negotiations with the Soviet Union before making any decisions on the Paris Agreements, and did not approve of the Paris Agreements. The West German Trade Union Federation, which has six million members, severely condemned militarization. There are serious conflicts within the government alliance. In various cities in West Germany, young people are holding large-scale demonstrations against militarism. The public speeches of Adenauer's representatives and Hitler's generals are often criticized.
    How to explain these situations? First of all, the German public of all classes has also drawn conclusions from the lessons of history. The two recent wars have brought terrible disasters and suffering to the German people, and a new war means national disaster. In particular, this war will be a war of fratricide.
    This war is in line with the intentions of Mr. Dulles or Mr. Adenauer, but the majority of the German people long for unity and peace.
    In all other Western European countries, the struggle against the militarization of Germany is also going on non-stop. March 10th this year—the International Day of Struggle against the Paris Agreements—is a strong expression of this struggle.
    The unity of the people of European countries has been strengthened in this struggle. The close friendly cooperation between Poland and the German Democratic Republic is an excellent example of this unity. It should be known that, as a result of the policies of the past ruling classes, these two countries have been hostile for centuries. At the same time, the friendship between our people and the French people, which was consolidated in the anti-Hitler war, is currently being enriched in the common struggle against the revengeful German militarism.
    It is obvious that if the intimidators from across the Atlantic and their Western European partners insist on forcibly ratifying the Paris Agreements regardless of the will of the people, then we will not stand idly by. The eight countries participating in the Moscow Conference clearly and unequivocally pointed out that once the Paris Agreements are ratified, the eight countries will take all necessary measures to safeguard peace and security in Europe. The Polish people fully agree with and are satisfied with the decisions of the Moscow Conference. We will never allow the historical events of 1939 to be repeated. We are part of a great and strong democratic camp. The invincible Soviet Union, which completely annihilated Hitler's military power, is a powerful fortress for the European people in the struggle against German militarism.
    Imperialists are keen on establishing military blocs and dangerous sources of war. This policy has aggravated the tension in the international situation, but it has been opposed by the people. Whether in Asia or Europe, the anger and resistance of the people of all countries to this policy are growing more and more. History will prove that those who play with fire will burn themselves.

    制止德国军国主义的复活
    波兰“人民论坛报”国际评论员  叶·斯达列茨
    西德参议院已在三月十八日批准了巴黎协定。法国的共和国参议院也即将对巴黎协定进行辩论。巴黎协定的实施与否，对于欧洲和世界政治局势的发展将有重大的影响。这个问题对于波兰人民有着切身的利害关系，因此波兰公众正在密切注意着西德和法国的局势的发展。
    巴黎协定的一个主要目的，就是武装西德，就是复活希特勒国防军，它将装备着现代化的杀人武器，包括原子武器在内。
    什么是德国军国主义，这对于波兰人来说是不需要解释的。数百万波兰人的被屠杀，就是希特勒占领者在波兰的罪行的结果。要知道，新的国防军的首脑，都是由那些从前为希特勒服务的、并且从来也不曾改变过自己信仰的将军们充任的，而西德重整军备的运动也是在复仇的口号下，伴随着横蛮无理的反波和反苏的诬蔑运动进行的。
    每一个波兰人都把德国军国主义看作是不共戴天的敌人。每一个波兰人都谴责德国军国主义的华盛顿保护人，并且完全拥护自己政府的政策。波兰政府同苏联一起为反对西德军国主义不倦地进行着斗争。而且也可以毫不夸张地说，欧洲各国人民都同我们一起参加这个斗争。
    西欧各国人民是坚决反对巴黎协定的。首先因为，反对苏联、波兰和其他人民民主国家的巴黎协定增加了战争的危险，而战争是任何一个欧洲居民所不愿意的。其次是因为，如历史经验所已经表明的，德国军国主义的侵略矛头不仅仅针对着东方各国，同时也针对着德国的西方邻国。例如，波恩的官方人士就曾在最近几年中对法国提出过领土的要求。
    法国人民在反对军国主义德国的斗争史上写下了光辉的一页。强使法国同意以所谓“欧洲防务集团”的形式复活德国国防军的努力已继续了几年。但是，杜勒斯的压迫、威胁和恫吓都不能使法国人民屈服。法国人民回答说：“不行！”用来代替死亡了的“欧洲军”计划的巴黎协定在法国国民议会中经过激烈的辩论之后，也遭到了否决。后来只是在美英十分粗暴的干涉和压力之下，国民议会就孟戴斯—弗朗斯提出的信任案又进行表决，才以微弱的多数通过了巴黎协定，但投赞成票的议员不到总数的一半。斗争还是在继续着。由于强使议会通过巴黎协定，孟戴斯—弗朗斯丢掉了总理的职位。其他三个宣布同样政纲的候选人也跟在孟戴斯—弗朗斯的后面失败了。富尔最后总算登上了这个职位，但仍是十分不稳的。无论是谁，只要他是巴黎协定的拥护者，就无法克服重重的困难。
    这些人用什么来为他们背叛人民利益的行为辩解呢？
    他们援引了包括在巴黎协定内的英国的所谓“保证”。对于这一点，波兰人是能够谈一谈的。在三十年代，当英国帝国主义分子同美国和法国的伙伴一起把希特勒扶植起来的时候，也曾给波兰以
  “保证”。而这种“保证”的价值，在一九三九年九月当第一颗炸弹落在华沙的时候，波兰人就亲眼看见了。而法国人也终于发问了：为什么把火交给放火的人，又寻求反对放火的人的“保证”呢？不把火交给放火的人，这不是更安全吗？
    巴黎协定的拥护者接着引证了阿登纳的“保证”和关于国防军的数量上限制的保留条件。但是，第一，这些保留条件规定得非常不清楚；第二，这些保留条件能够用多数投票来改变，而美国和法国不同，是永远能够得到这样的多数的。至于阿登纳所提出的“保证”，法国公众是不难识破这种“保证”的目的的。巴黎协定包括一个萨尔协定。这些文件上面的墨迹还没干，阿登纳和西德联邦议院就已经对它表示怀疑了。
    最后，法国当政集团还竭力用这样的保证来欺骗人民：似乎一旦巴黎协定获得批准，同苏联谈判解决德国问题就有可能了。这是在故意撒谎。如果德国的西部将变成战争温床，变成侵略势力的基地和打靶场，怎能够进行关于建立一个统一的、民主的德国的谈判呢？批准巴黎协定和统一德国是互相对立的。这是苏联政府不止一次所强调指出的，也是欧洲国家莫斯科会议宣言所指出的。
    所有这些事实，越来越深刻地渗入到法国公众的意识中去。反对巴黎协定的运动包括了最广泛的居民阶层。华盛顿和伦敦也不隐瞒对于事件的这种发展的忧虑。二月二十八日美国和英国的代表去巴黎访问富尔总理。合众社公开报道说，这个访问的目的是“催促尽速批准”使西德军国主义化的巴黎协定。第二天富尔就要求确定在三月二十二日在共和国参议院进行辩论。
    就是在西德，反对军国主义化的斗争，也达到了使恢复国防军的狂热者所意想不到的那样广泛的规模。由于一九五三年选举的结果，在议会中形成了阿登纳集团占有绝对多数的情势。但是在西德各个地区举行的地方选举表明，阿登纳已失去了多数的选民。代表近半数居民的社会民主党要求在就巴黎协定问题作出任何决定以前，同苏联进行谈判，并且不赞成巴黎协定。拥有六百万会员的西德工会联合会严厉地谴责军国主义化。政府联盟的内部存在着严重的冲突。在西德各个城市，青年们都举行声势浩大的反对军国主义的示威游行。阿登纳的代表们和希特勒的将军们的公开演说，常常受到抨击。
    怎样来解释这些情况呢？首先，各个阶层的德国公众也从历史的教训中得出了结论。最近的两次战争给德国人民带来了可怕的灾难和痛苦，新的战争就是意味着民族的灾难。特别是这次战争将是兄弟阋墙的战争。
    这种战争是符合杜勒斯先生或阿登纳先生的意图的，然而大多数的德国人民却渴望着统一和和平。
    在所有其他西欧国家中，反对德国军国主义化的斗争，也在一刻不停地进行着。今年三月十日——反对巴黎协定国际斗争日，是这个斗争的强有力的表现。
    在这个斗争中加强了欧洲各国人民的团结一致。波兰和德意志民主共和国的亲密的友好合作，是这种团结一致的出色例子。要知道，由于过去统治阶级政策的结果，这两个国家在几世纪中一直都是敌对的。同时，我国人民同法国人民在反对希特勒战争中巩固起来的友谊，目前在反对复仇的德国军国主义的共同斗争中更加丰富起来了。
    事情是很明显的，如果来自大西洋彼岸的恫吓者和他们的西欧伙伴不顾人民的意志而竟然强行批准巴黎协定的话，那么我们是不会置之不理的。参加莫斯科会议的八个国家清楚而明确地指出，一旦巴黎协定获得批准，八国将采取一切必要措施来保障欧洲的和平和安全。波兰人民十分赞同和满意地拥护莫斯科会议的决定。我们决不容许一九三九年的历史事件重演。我们是伟大坚强的民主阵营的一部分。曾经彻底歼灭希特勒军事威力的不可战胜的苏联，是欧洲人民反对德国军国主义斗争的强大堡垒。
    帝国主义分子热中于建立军事集团和危险的战争策源地。这个政策已加剧了国际局势的紧张，但却遭到了人民的反对。不论在亚洲或欧洲，各国人民对于这个政策的愤怒和反抗是愈来愈增长了。历史将证明：玩火者必自焚。
