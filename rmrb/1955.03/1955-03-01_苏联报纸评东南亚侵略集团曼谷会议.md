Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th (TASS): Moscow newspapers on the 27th published commentaries on the results of the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting which concluded in Bangkok on the 25th.

	M. Avienin published an article in "Pravda" stating: Behind the appearance of superficial unity, profound contradictions exist between the participating countries of the Bangkok meeting. Agence France-Presse noted the sharp divisions between Britain and the United States. It reported that the United States wanted to expand the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to include Taiwan and South Korea, and wanted to make the Manila Treaty applicable not only to Taiwan and South Korea, but also to Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu Islands once they were "attacked." The United Kingdom expressed opposition, pointing out that the geographical scope of the Southeast Asia Treaty defined in Manila was unchangeable, and that Taiwan and South Korea were outside this scope.

	Avienin pointed out that, however, it would be wrong to think that Britain's attitude meant abandoning its aggressive policy of following the United States. Considering its specific interests, Britain adopted the same aggressive approach as the United States on the Taiwan issue. However, at the same time, the British ruling group was afraid of going all the way with its American partners. This aggressive bloc, aimed at suppressing the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, suited Britain, but Britain absolutely did not want to extend its military obligations to the Taiwan and Korean regions.

	Avienin continued, saying that the conflict between the major countries participating in the meeting was not limited to disputes over different formulations in the communique. There was disagreement on a more important question: What is the main purpose of this treaty? Dulles insisted that the treaty signatories should immediately begin working on military issues, which clearly implied immediately beginning preparations for a large-scale war of aggression. On the other hand, Eden said that a more pressing issue was to organize a joint struggle against "subversive activities."

	Avienin pointed out that, finally, one cannot fail to notice that the Bangkok meeting also exposed contradictions between the partners of the aggression bloc on economic issues. Some "small countries" participating in the meeting – Thailand and Pakistan – hoped that their participation in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization would bring them large amounts of dollars. However, the meeting only passed a vague resolution on establishing an economic committee.

	Avienin concluded by writing that all the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies have encountered an insurmountable obstacle: the Asian people's determination to defeat conspiracies that endanger peace, their freedom, and national independence. It would be beneficial for the imperialists to remember that a new situation has emerged in Asia. Now, it is not the colonial countries, regarded by most Asian countries as stranglers of their freedom and independence, but the Asian people themselves who decide the fate of Asia.

	Therefore, it is clear that the plans formulated by the colonialists at the Bangkok meeting are doomed to failure.

	F. Kudryavtsev published an article in "Izvestia" entitled "The Colonialists' Bangkok Secret Meeting," stating: The Bangkok meeting was a secret meeting of colonialists attempting to prop up their collapsing rule in Asia. The Bangkok meeting has clearly shown that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is primarily a product of the United States' "position of strength" policy, mainly serving the interests of American imperialists in Asia.
	The attitude taken by the United States in Bangkok can be explained by the phrase "sweep away everything," that is, to make the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization completely subordinate to the interests of American expansionists. For the British and French colonial countries, whose pursuit of imperialist policies in Malaya and Indochina is suffering a disastrous defeat, it would be acceptable to receive American support to regain their rule in these regions of Southeast Asia. At the same time, the ruling groups of the Philippines, Pakistan, and Thailand, unable to resolve their domestic contradictions, also hope to strengthen their position by relying on American military and economic "aid." But this is not the purpose of the American rulers at all; they use their "aid" not to support the crumbling colonial regimes of Britain and France, but to establish their own rule in these countries.
	The Bangkok meeting once again showed that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool for American imperialism to suppress national liberation movements in Asia and exclude America's colonial rivals. The United States has reserved the right to act freely in Southeast Asia, while at the same time gaining the right to use the armed forces and territories of its Southeast Asia Treaty Organization partners at will.
	The Bangkok meeting once again showed that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was established to prevent the implementation of the Geneva Indochina Accords, because, despite these accords, it also promised to extend the actions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

	Kudryavtsev concluded by writing that, finally, the Bangkok meeting is openly confronting the upcoming Bandung Conference of Asian and African countries, which aims to strengthen peace and ease international tensions.

    苏联报纸评东南亚侵略集团曼谷会议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日电：二十七日莫斯科各报就二十五日在曼谷闭幕的侵略性的东南亚条约集团会议的结果发表评论。
    米·阿弗宁在“真理报”上发表文章说：在表面上表现一致的后面，曼谷会议参与国之间存在着深刻的矛盾。法新社注意到英美之间的尖锐的分歧。它报道说，美国想要扩大东南亚条约组织，把台湾和南朝鲜包括在内，并且想要使马尼拉条约不仅在台湾和南朝鲜而且在金门岛和马祖岛一旦“受到进攻”时也能适用。联合王国表示反对，它指出，在马尼拉确定了的东南亚条约的地理范围是不可变更的，而台湾和南朝鲜是在这个范围以外的。
    阿弗宁指出，但是，要是认为英国的这种态度意味着放弃了它那种追随美国的侵略政策的话，那就错了。考虑到它的某些具体的利益，英国在台湾问题上采取了和美国一样的侵略方针。不过同时，英国统治集团又害怕同它的美国伙伴干到底。目的在于镇压东南亚民族解放运动的这个侵略集团是适合于英国的，但是，英国绝不希望把它承担的军事义务扩大到台湾和朝鲜地区。
    阿弗宁继续说，在参加会议的主要国家之间的冲突并不限于关于公报的不同的提法的争论上。在一个更为重要的问题上存在着分歧，这个问题就是：这个条约的主要目的是什么？杜勒斯坚持说，条约签字国应该立即开始就军事问题进行工作，这显然暗示，立即开始准备一场大规模的侵略战争。另一方面，艾登说，一个更为迫切的问题是组织对付“颠覆活动”的联合斗争的问题。
    阿弗宁指出，最后，人们不能不注意到，曼谷会议也暴露了侵略集团的伙伴之间在经济问题上的矛盾。参加这个会议的“一些小国”——泰国和巴基斯坦——怀着这样的希望：它们参加东南亚条约组织，将会得到大量的美元。可是会议只通过了一项关于设立一个经济委员会的暧昧的决议。
    阿弗宁最后写道，帝国主义者的一切侵略阴谋碰到了一个不可逾越的障碍：亚洲人民决心击败危害和平、他们的自由和国家独立的阴谋。帝国主义者记住现在在亚洲已经出现了一种新的形势，是会有好处的。现在决定亚洲命运的已经不是被大多数亚洲国家看做是它们的自由和独立的扼杀者的殖民国家，而是亚洲人民自己。
    因此很清楚，殖民主义者在曼谷会议上制订的计划是注定要遭到失败的。
    弗·库德里雅夫采夫在“消息报”上以“殖民主义者的曼谷秘密会议”为题发表文章说：曼谷会议是殖民主义者企图支撑住他们在亚洲的正在垮台的统治的一个秘密会议。曼谷会议已经清楚地表明，东南亚条约组织首先是美国“实力地位”政策的产物，主要是为美帝国主义者在亚洲的利益服务的。　　
    美国在曼谷所采取的态度可以用“扫除一切”这句话来解释，这就是说，使东南亚条约组织完全服从美国扩张主义者的利益。对于在马来亚和印度支那推行帝国主义政策正在遭到惨败的英法殖民国家来说，能够得到美国的支持来重新取得它们在东南亚这些地区的统治，那是没有什么不可以的，同时，无法解决他们国内矛盾的菲律宾、巴基斯坦和泰国的统治集团，也希望靠美国的军事和经济“援助”来加强他们的地位。但是这根本不是美国统治者的目的，他们使用他们的“援助”不是为了支持英法的摇摇欲坠的殖民政权，而是为了建立他们自己在这些国家中的统治。
    曼谷会议再一次表明，东南亚条约组织是美帝国主义打算在亚洲镇压民族解放运动和排斥美国的殖民对手的工具。美国保留了在东南亚行动自由的权利，同时却获得了随心所欲地使用它的东南亚条约组织伙伴的武装部队和领土的权利。
    曼谷会议再一次表明，建立东南亚条约组织是为了阻止履行日内瓦印度支那协定，因为，尽管有着这些协定，它还答应把东南亚条约组织的行动扩大到南越、老挝和柬埔寨。
    库德里雅夫采夫最后写道，最后，曼谷会议是公开同即将在万隆举行的目的在于加强和平和缓和国际紧张局势的亚非国家会议相抗衡的。
