An Event of Historical Significance
Song Qingling

Recently, our delegation led by General Peng Dehuai to Lushun-Dalian witnessed a truly historic event in Sino-Soviet relations, which is also significant for the entire Asia and the world. For five years, the Soviet Union has faithfully and selflessly fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the historic Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance signed in 1950: to jointly with China ensure the security of this port and its port facilities to prevent "the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression by Japan or other countries that may directly or indirectly unite with Japan in acts of aggression."

Today, due to the changes in the Far East situation after the end of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and due to the enhancement and modernization of China's national defense to a certain extent, the Soviet Union, in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, announced its readiness to withdraw its troops from Lushunkou. This is a symbol of the great friendship and fraternal cooperation between our two countries. Moreover, it is transferring all the equipment it has restored and newly built to China free of charge.

This action by our comradely neighbor, the great Soviet Union, is just one of a series of unprecedented assistance given by it to the Chinese people during the years of our national liberation struggle and peaceful construction. This will be recorded in history as one of the countless examples of the Soviet Union impeccably fulfilling all its obligations. What we particularly cherish is that the Soviet Union demonstrated its extreme importance to the fraternal alliance between our two countries and their peoples in this action. The Soviet Union has once again made a brilliant contribution to the new diplomacy based on proletarian internationalism, which is growing among countries where the people hold power. The Soviet Union has once again demonstrated with vivid examples how it is pursuing a foreign policy that is based on the principles of equality among all nations, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

At this moment, one cannot help but recall those days after the announcement of the Sino-Soviet Treaty in 1950. Even then, it was already obvious that this was an unusual treaty. The Chinese people had never experienced such international relations, which in both action and word, implemented mutual assistance conducive to the development of the two countries' economies and cultures. Here, the key is the word "mutual assistance." The Chinese people quickly understood the full meaning of these two words and the role it played in strengthening the fraternal friendship with the great Soviet people. We quickly saw the importance of this friendship to peace and progress in the Far East and the world. Similarly, this is the assessment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty by all peace-loving people in the world.

But there were also others in the world who were extremely embarrassed and angered by the announcement of this treaty. They deliberately distorted the words and purpose of the treaty, especially the Soviet Union's stationing of troops in Lushunkou. They clamored that Chinese territory was being violated, they shed hypocritical tears, and they spoke volumes about the fate of China. All of this makes one wonder if we had just touched a raw nerve. To put it bluntly, the fact that the Soviet army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army jointly used the Lushunkou naval base powerfully demonstrated an unprecedented friendship and cooperation, which completely shattered the imperialists' conspiracy to break into Chinese territory from this strategic bridgehead. Of course, this was painful for them!

Now, as the heroic Soviet army, having completed its mission here, prepares to return to its homeland, those guys have lost the false basis for their clamoring. What can they say about this matter? Facing a China that is fully capable of defending its borders and ports, facing a Soviet Union that has indisputably fulfilled all its obligations, what else can they say? Obviously, they are speechless.

But we know that the threat from this side is not over. They have not given up their plan to revive Japanese militarism. They keep this country in a state of semi-occupation so that they can always gather cannon fodder for further military adventures in the Far East. Disregarding the demands of the people of the world—including their own people—to ease international tensions and take measures to gradually normalize relations between countries, they are hindering the resolution of the Korean issue. They are engaged in the most provocative act of forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan, and they are shamelessly interfering in China's internal affairs. They have signed a series of military treaties that are entirely for the purpose of aggression. All of this is in preparation for an all-out war.

These are actions that make all honest and peace-loving people around the world uneasy and sickened. Undoubtedly, the vast majority of humanity feels this way, especially when they consider the prospect of war with "thermonuclear" weapons, which the American monopoly groups are trying to force them to believe is inevitable. The people of China and the Soviet Union have always resolutely opposed these provocations. We must resolutely oppose all these provocations. We put forward our sincere suggestion: countries with different views, habits, and systems can coexist peacefully. Facts have proven that this is entirely possible. The people of China and the Soviet Union do not need war, but we absolutely will not allow others to interfere in our internal affairs. We have repeatedly stated that if all these interferences are stopped, and if the armed forces of all countries can be gradually reduced and limited to their own territory purely for defensive purposes, then international tensions can be alleviated.

The people of China and the Soviet Union cooperate closely in the cause of defending the new life we are building, fighting for peace shoulder to shoulder. This cooperation is of historical significance, as Chairman Mao Zedong wrote in commemoration of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army: "The close unity of the great Soviet and Chinese peoples and their armed forces is a reliable guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world." It can be seen that this unity has already turned the entire balance of power in the world in favor of peace and progress.

Now, as the Soviet army stationed in Lushunkou prepares to leave us, we take this opportunity to express our deep gratitude for the exemplary example they have shown in performing their duties here. For the past five years, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have been enthusiastically and conscientiously learning this attitude, learning how to be responsible to their motherland and to the working people of the world. In the process of learning from the advanced methods of the Soviet Union, we have not only delved deeply into the science of construction, but also learned the military science of the Soviet Union. Needless to say, these have proven to be of great value to us. Now we pledge to continue and strengthen this learning. Together with the Soviet people, we will surely be able to advance in the cause of the permanent happiness of mankind. Together with the Soviet people, we will surely be able to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

    一件有历史意义的事
    宋庆龄
    最近在彭德怀将军率领下前往旅大的我国代表团亲眼看到了中苏关系上的一个真正的具有历史意义的事件，同样，也是对整个亚洲和全世界富有意义的事件。五年来，苏联忠实和无私地履行了一九五○年所签订的有历史意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约中所确定的义务：同中国共同保障这个港口和港务设施的安全，以防止“日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”。
    今天，由于远东局势在朝鲜战争结束和印度支那和平恢复之后所起的变化，由于中国国防在一定程度上的增强和现代化，苏联遂遵照条约的规定，宣布准备把它的部队撤出旅顺口，这是我们两国之间伟大的友谊和兄弟般合作的一个标志。不但如此，它还把它所恢复的和增建的全部设备无偿地移交给中国。
    我们的同志般的邻邦——伟大的苏联的这一行动，只不过是它在我们国家进行解放斗争和和平建设的年月中所给予中国人民一系列的、史无前例的援助之一。这将作为苏联无瑕地履行它的全部义务的无数事例之一载入史册。使我们特别感到珍贵的是：苏联在这一行动上表现了它对我们两国及其人民的兄弟同盟的极端重视。苏联又一次对以无产阶级国际主义为基础的新外交作了辉煌的贡献，这种外交正在由人民掌握政权的国家之间增长着。苏联又一次以鲜明的实例说明，它是怎样在奉行以各国平等、互利及互相尊重国家主权及领土完整的原则为基础的外交政策。
    此刻，人们不能不回想起一九五○年中苏条约公布后的那些日子。即使在当时，这已经很明显是一个不寻常的条约了。中国人民从来也没有经验过这样的国际关系，它无论是在行动和言词上都贯彻了有利于发展两国经济和文化的互助。这里，关键性的是“互助”两个字。中国人民很快就了解到这两个字的全部意义以及它在加强同伟大的苏联人民兄弟般的友谊中所起的作用。我们很快就看到这种友谊对远东及世界和平和进步所具有的重要性。同样，这也是世界上所有爱好和平的人民给予中苏条约的估价。
    但是世界上却还有另外一些人，他们因为这个条约的公布而极端狼狈和激怒。他们有意歪曲条约的字句和目的，特别是对苏联在旅顺口驻军这一点。他们大嚷，说什么中国领土被侵犯，他们淌着伪善的眼泪，并为中国的命运大放厥辞。这一切都使人怀疑是否因为我们刚好触痛了他们的伤口。明白地说，苏军和中国人民解放军共同使用旅顺口海军根据地这一事实，有力地表现出了史无前例的友谊和合作，这就彻底粉碎了好叫嚣的帝国主义者企图从这个战略桥头堡闯入中国领土的阴谋。当然，这对他们说来是痛心的！
    现在，当英勇的苏军在这里完成了使命而准备回到自己的祖国的时候，那些家伙们失去了借以叫嚣的虚伪依据。对于这一件事他们能说些什么呢？面对着一个已经完全能够保卫它的边疆和港口的中国，面对着一个无可非议地履行了它一切义务的苏联，他们还能说些什么呢？很明显，他们是哑口无言了。
    但是我们知道来自这方面的威胁还没有完结。他们没有放弃复活日本军国主义的计划，他们使这个国家处在半占领的状态，以便能随时搜罗炮灰来在远东作进一步的军事冒险。他们不顾世界人民——包括他们自己的人民在内——缓和国际紧张局势并采取措施使各国关系逐步正常化的要求，他们阻碍朝鲜问题的解决；他们从事于用武力霸占中国的领土台湾这一最富有挑衅性的勾当，并无耻地在干涉中国的内政，他们签订了一连串完全是为了侵略目的的军事性的条约。所有这一切都是为了准备着一个全面的战争。
    这是令全世界正直和爱好和平的人民感到不安和作呕的行动。毫无疑问，绝大多数人类都是这样感到的，尤其使他们产生这种感觉的是“热核子”武器的战争的前景，美国垄断集团正企图强使他们相信这种战争是不可避免的。中苏两国人民一向坚决反对这些挑衅。我们要坚决反对所有这些挑衅。我们提出我们真诚的建议：一切观点、习惯、制度不同的国家都可以和平共处。事实证明这是完全可能的。中苏两国人民不需要战争，但是我们绝对不容许别人来干涉我们的内政。我们一再表示，如果所有这些干涉得到制止，如果各国武装力量能逐步裁减并纯粹为了防御的目的，把它限制在自己国土之内，那么国际的紧张局势就能减轻。
    中苏两国人民在为保卫我们正在建立的新生活的事业中紧密合作，肩并肩地为和平而斗争。这种合作具有历史的意义，如同毛泽东主席为纪念苏军建军节三十五周年所写的：“伟大的苏中两国人民及其武装力量的亲密团结是远东及世界和平的可靠保障”。可以看到，这种团结已经使世界上的整个力量对比转为有利于和平和进步方面。
    现在，当驻旅顺口的苏军准备要离开我们的时候，我们趁这个机会对他们在这里执行任务时所表现的值得效法的榜样表示深切的感谢。过去五年来中国人民和中国人民解放军一直都热情地和十分认真地在学习着这种态度，学习如何对自己祖国和对全世界劳动人民负责的态度。在学习苏联先进方法的过程中，我们不但深入钻研了关于建设的科学，而且也学习了苏联的军事科学。不消说，这些已经证明对我们是有极大价值的。现在我们保证要继续和加强这种学习。同苏联人民在一起，我们一定能够为了人类永久幸福的事业向前推进，同苏联人民在一起，我们一定能够保卫远东和世界和平！
