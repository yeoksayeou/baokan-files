    Where is the Planning Perspective?
    Jin Tongzhen
    Opening the national state-owned pharmaceutical industry's total output value and product plan completion report, it is found that most factories and products exceed the plan every month, some by a large margin. At first glance, this is a gratifying phenomenon, because generally speaking, the more the state plan is exceeded, the more social wealth is increased.
    However, based on the actual situation of the pharmaceutical industry, this phenomenon of "exceeding" the plan is not so "gratifying," because what is "exceeded" are "glucose," "ephedrine," "sulfathiazole," "…sulfa…". According to the national supply and sales balance, the state's requirements for these products are only to improve quality, ensure the plan, and reduce costs, and does not require "exceeding" the output value plan; what is required to exceed the plan are new products such as "procaine penicillin" and "phenacetin," but these products have not completed the plan.
    As a result, the more the total output value plan for producing products is exceeded, the greater the loss to the state. The reason is clear: the "excess" part is stockpiled due to lack of sales, and is frozen in warehouses. Over time, these stockpiled products may deteriorate or even be scrapped. According to statistics, by the end of 1954, the value of products stockpiled by state-owned and joint state-private pharmaceutical factories under the Ministry of Light Industry accounted for 77% of the China Pharmaceutical Company's annual sales, and the rework and scrapping of drugs occurred constantly.
    Our enterprise leaders are not unaware of these situations. At least most comrades are aware of them. So, why do they blindly pursue "exceeding" the plan, regardless of product stockpiling and waste? The production summary report of Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory for February answered this question. The output of "phenacetin" (a new product) that the state required to increase in February only completed slightly more than 40% of the plan due to quality problems, while "calcium gluconate," for which the state controlled output value, exceeded the plan by 69%, one of the reasons being: "In order to make up for the lack of output value, it is necessary to overproduce it!"
    Some people say that the leaders of Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory who adopted the same "compensatory" measures have a very "strong" view of completing the plan. However, we want to ask where their planning perspective is? Our view is the opposite: these comrades are very lacking in the national planning perspective. If the national planning perspective is "strong," they should overcome various difficulties and organize production strictly according to the requirements of the plan, and they should make every effort to complete the quality improvement and cost reduction targets set by the state. Like the leaders of Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory and others with the same views, they do not organize production according to the requirements of the state plan, but only overproduce those products that are easy to produce, and do not produce those with difficulties, and pay even less attention to quality plans and cost plans. This proves that their planning perspective is not "strong," but very weak.

    计划观点在哪儿
    金同珍
    翻开国营制药工业总产值和产品计划完成表，发现大部分工厂和产品都是月月超额完成计划，有的还超额很多。乍看起来，这真是一种可喜的现象，因为一般地说，国家计划超额完成得越多，社会财富也就增加得越多。
    然而，从制药工业的实际情况出发，这种“超额”完成计划的现象并不那么“可喜”，因为所
  “超额”的都是“葡萄糖”、“麻黄素”、“磺胺噻唑”、“……磺胺……”……。根据全国供产销平衡情况，国家对这些产品的要求只是提高质量、保证计划、降低成本，而不要求“超额”完成产值计划；要求超额完成计划的是“普洛卡因青霉素”、“非那昔汀”等新产品，而这些产品却没完成计划。
    结果，生产产品的总产值计划超额得越多，给国家带来的损失便越大了。这道理是明白的，因为“超额”的部分，都因为没销路而积压了，被冻结在仓库里。时间久了，这些积压品还可能变质甚至报废。据统计，至一九五四年底，轻工业部所属国营和公私合营制药厂所积压的产品价值就占中国医药公司全年销售额的百分之七十七，药品的返工报废更是不断发生。
    这些情况，我们的企业领导同志并不是不了解。至少大部分同志是了解的。那么，为什么他们不顾产品积压浪费，而盲目追求“超额”呢？山东新华药厂二月份的生产总结报告回答了这个问题，这个厂二月份国家要求增产的“非那昔汀”
  （新产品）的产量，因质量问题没有解决，只完成计划的百分之四○强，而国家控制产值的“葡萄糖酸钙”却超额完成计划百分之六九，理由之一是：“为了弥补产值的不足，所以要使它超产！”
    有人说，和山东新华药厂领导同志采取同样
  “弥补”措施的人，完成计划的观点是很“强”的。但是，我们要问他们的计划观点在哪儿呢？我们的看法却相反：这些同志非常缺乏国家计划观点。要是国家计划观点“强”的话，就应该克服各种困难严格按照计划要求组织生产了，就应该尽一切努力来完成国家规定的提高质量和降低成本等指标。像山东新华药厂的领导同志和其它有着同样看法的人，他们不是按照国家计划要求组织生产，只看哪些产品容易生产就超额增产，有困难的就不去生产，更不注意质量计划、成本计划。这就证明他们的计划观点并不是“强”，而是很不强的。
