Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th: The U.S. Seventh Fleet and the Chiang bandit navy held a large-scale joint naval exercise in Taiwan on March 6th. U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump also personally participated. The U.S. giant aircraft carriers "Midway" and "Wasp," which were originally operating in the Philippines, also recently arrived in Taiwan under the escort of a destroyer squadron to participate in the exercise, dispatching large numbers of aircraft based on the aircraft carriers to operate over Taiwan for days. Chiang bandit officials shamelessly declared that this exercise demonstrated that a huge strike force was sufficient to "resist aggression."

People here point out that the U.S. authorities' provocative military actions are clearly intended to intensify tensions in the Far East and vainly attempt to exert military pressure on us, hindering our liberation of Taiwan. This attempt has failed in the past and will continue to fail in the future. No threat can shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, March 7th: After the Bangkok Conference, the U.S. is stepping up its aggressive military deployments for the long-term occupation of Taiwan. People remember that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at the Bangkok Conference described Taiwan as one of the "three lines of defense" for the U.S. to carry out aggression against Asia and China.

After the U.S. and Chiang bandit military conference, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Carney said that the U.S. would transport military supplies to the Chiang bandits as soon as possible, and that he and the Chiang bandit clique had discussed the establishment of a U.S.-Chiang joint command in preparation for military adventures. After Dulles and Carney left Taiwan one after another, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump and Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, who had planned the military deployment in Taiwan with them, continued to stay in Taiwan to carry out conspiratorial activities. Stump and other senior U.S. military officers held another meeting on the 6th to further study the specific issues of the U.S. strengthening its aid to the Chiang bandit troops. They also continued to hold talks with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. It is reported that the conspiracy to establish a U.S.-Chiang joint command is also underway. On the 6th, Stump went to Matsu Island to "inspect." According to Stump's spokesman, Stump spied on the Chinese mainland from Matsu Island.

At the same time, according to the International News Service, U.S. Army communications and engineering units have arrived in Taiwan to establish a communications center as part of the U.S.-Chiang treaty. More U.S. communications and engineering units are expected to continue to arrive in Taiwan soon. The purpose of establishing this communications center is to strengthen the military aggression links between U.S. forces in the Pacific region and the Chiang bandit troops.

U.S. weapons support for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is increasing. It is reported that the U.S. has again handed over two batches of landing craft, a total of twenty-two vessels, to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    美国舰队和蒋贼海军在台湾举行联合演习
    美国这种挑衅行动显然是要加剧远东紧张局势
    【新华社北京七日讯】　三月六日，美国第七舰队和蒋贼海军在台湾举行了大规模的海军联合演习，美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普亦亲自参加。原在菲律宾活动的美国巨型航空母舰“中途岛”号及“黄蜂”号亦于近日在一支驱逐舰队的护航下驶抵台湾参加演习，连日出动大批以航空母舰为基地的飞机活动于台湾上空。蒋贼官员竟无耻地宣称：这次演习表明了巨大的打击力量足以“抵抗进攻”。
    此间人士指出：美国当局这种挑衅性的军事行动，其目的显然是要加剧远东紧张局势，并妄图对我施加军事压力，阻挠我解放台湾。这种企图过去已经失败，今后将继续失败。任何威胁都不能动摇中国人民解放台湾的决心。
      【新华社七日讯】在曼谷会议以后，美国正在加紧长期侵占台湾的侵略性军事部署。人们记得，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾在曼谷会议上把台湾说成是美国对亚洲和中国进行侵略的“三条战线”之一。
    在美国和蒋贼的军事会议结束后，美国海军作战部长卡涅就说美国要尽快运送军事物资给蒋贼，并说他和蒋贼集团曾讨论了成立准备军事冒险的美蒋联合司令部的问题。在杜勒斯和卡涅先后离开台湾以后，曾经和他们一起策划在台湾的军事部署的美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普、第七舰队司令普赖德等人，继续留在台湾进行阴谋活动。斯图普和美国其他高级军官六日再次举行会议，进一步具体研究美国加强对蒋贼军的援助问题。他们还同蒋介石卖国集团继续举行会谈。有消息说，成立美蒋联合司令部的阴谋策划也在进行中。六日，斯图普曾到马祖岛“视察”。据斯图普的发言人透露，斯图普在马祖岛曾窥视了中国大陆。
    与此同时，据国际新闻社透露，美国陆军的通讯和工程部队已经到达台湾，准备建立一个通讯中心，以作为美蒋条约的一个部分。更多的美国通讯和工程部队预计最近将继续到达台湾。消息说，建立这个通讯中心的目的是加强太平洋地区美国部队和蒋贼军之间在军事侵略方面的联络工作。
    美国对蒋介石卖国集团的武器支援正在增加。有消息说，美国又拨交蒋介石卖国集团登陆艇两批，共计二十二艘。
