    Hebei Mechanical Irrigation and Drainage Projects Start Construction One After Another
    This year, Hebei Province is newly establishing seven pumping stations and drainage stations. Among them, five stations in Daxing, Jixian, Zhuoxian, Changli, and Dacheng have now started construction one after another. Ten boiler-trolley machines of 75, 25, and 7 horsepower and six diesel engines purchased from Shijiazhuang have been transported to the construction sites separately. The entire station construction project will be completed by the end of April. This will turn more than 7,000 mu of barren alkaline land into paddy fields, protect more than 8,000 mu of dry upland from drought, and also drain 2,000 mu of waterlogged low-lying areas, ensuring spring planting. The two newly built stations in Yuxian and Tangshan City, and the expansion project in Zhuoxian will also start construction successively in April. After the completion of these three projects, more than 15,000 mu of dry land can be turned into paddy fields. After all these stations are completed, it is estimated that grain production can be increased by 4.6 million catties per year. (Ren Jie)

    河北机械排灌工程陆续开工
    河北省今年新建立七处抽水机站和排水站。其中大兴、蓟县、涿县、昌黎、大城等五站现已陆续开工。从石家庄购买的七十五、二十五和七匹马力的锅驼机十部，柴油机六部，都已分别运到工地。到四月底即可完成全部建站工程。这可使七千多亩荒碱土地变为稻田，八千多亩干旱高地免受旱灾威胁，还可排除二千亩洼地积水，保证春播。在蔚县、唐山市两处新建的站和涿县扩建工程在四月份也可陆续开工。这三处工程完成后，可保证一万五千多亩旱地变成水田。这些站全部建成后，估计每年可增产粮食四百六十万斤。（任杰）
