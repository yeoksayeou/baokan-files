The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently handled the incident of Wang Zisheng, secretary of the Party branch of the Coke Oven Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant (hereinafter referred to as Taigang), and others suppressing criticism and retaliating against the whistleblower Zhang Baotong.

In 1952, with the efforts of all workers and masses, the Coke Oven Department of Taigang achieved certain results in production, but the phenomenon of leading cadres engaging in deception and falsely reporting achievements was also very serious. For example, the completion of the sulfuric acid argon task in the first quarter, the completion of the tar task in December, the elimination of black-headed coke, the reduction of coal washing ash, and the study of the Soviet advanced experience "conical curve fire adjustment method" all had exaggerations and fabrications. In the second half of 1952, after the Shanxi Daily and Taiyuan Daily continuously published untrue reports about Qu Bingrui's model deeds, it aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. In January 1953, when selecting labor models, due to the undemocratic nature of the leading cadres of the department and their failure to adopt the opinions of the workers who selected labor models based on facts, many workers openly expressed their opinions to the leadership. Zhang Baotong, head of the security section of the department and a Communist Party member, also reflected the situation to the Party branch and administrative leading cadres. The Party and administrative leading cadres of the department not only did not humbly listen to the workers' opinions and correct their mistakes, but instead held meetings to reprimand the workers who raised opinions as "treating steamed buns as dog feces" and "evil suppressing righteousness," and used the words "to prevent bad elements from taking advantage of loopholes" to intimidate the masses. They criticized Zhang Baotong for reflecting the opinions of the masses as "following the backward masses" and having "impure motives," etc. After the list of labor models was approved and announced, the workers became even more dissatisfied, especially with Qu Bingrui, who was selected as a special provincial labor model, and Liu Tianjin, the squad leader of the fire adjustment team, who was a representative of the factory model group. Zhang Baotong successively reported the problems existing in the selection of labor models in the Coke Oven Department to the Taigang Party Committee, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. After Wang Zisheng, secretary of the Party branch of the Coke Oven Department, and others learned about this situation, they took repressive measures against Zhang Baotong and held a Party branch committee meeting to criticize him. Therefore, Zhang Baotong also appealed to Chairman Mao, the People's Supervision Committee of the State Council, the Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the People's Daily, and Pei Lisheng, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Government.

Subsequently, the Provincial and Municipal Committees formed an inspection team. The working group of the Steel Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, which was assisting the central work in Taigang at the time, also formed an inspection team of several people in accordance with the instructions of the bureau after receiving the letter of complaint written by Zhang Baotong to Chairman Mao forwarded by the bureau. The Steel Bureau inspection team worked in the spirit of seeking truth from facts, conducted serious investigations and research, talked and held discussions with more than 60 employees, and paid attention to listening to opinions from all parties. Therefore, they quickly clarified the truth and believed that the accusations of Zhang Baotong and other comrades were basically consistent with the facts. However, during the inspection process, Wang Zisheng and other Party and administrative leading cadres of the Coke Oven Department, fearing the exposure of false phenomena and the loss of so-called "honor," passively resisted the inspection by the superiors. Wang Zisheng and others were particularly dissatisfied with the Steel Bureau inspection team, saying that they and Zhang Baotong were "interrogating labor models, creating confusion, and affecting production." Wang Jingsheng, head of the Provincial and Municipal Committee inspection team and Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee, and Hu Kai, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Taigang Party Committee, biasedly believed the reflections of the leading cadres of the Coke Oven Department that distorted the facts and also harbored dissatisfaction with the Steel Bureau inspection team. At the report meeting of the two inspection teams presided over by the responsible comrades of the Taigang Party Committee, Hu Kai even rudely criticized the Steel Bureau inspection team, saying that they were "specifically looking for faults" and that "the purpose of the inspection was questionable," etc. Afterwards, Wang Jingsheng and Li Shaoxun, director of the office of the Provincial Industrial Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee (who had made exaggerated and untrue reports on the model deeds of the Coke Oven Department in the newspaper), in the name of the Provincial and Municipal Committee inspection team, wrote an inspection report to the Provincial and Municipal Committee. The report was not discussed within the team, nor was it solicited from other comrades. Some comrades in the team had raised correct opinions, but they were not adopted by them, nor were they reported to the higher authorities. Because Wang Jingsheng and others did not conduct serious investigations and research, and did not humbly listen to the opinions of the workers and masses, but rather biasedly believed Wang Zisheng and others, this report only stated that the Coke Oven Department had shortcomings in the selection of labor models, and that the model deeds of Qu Bingrui and others published in the newspaper were indeed exaggerated and untrue, and that the Party and administrative leading cadres of the Coke Oven Department had complacency and undemocratic work styles, etc. At the same time, this report, in addition to repeating the rude and erroneous criticism of the Steel Bureau inspection team, made completely erroneous conclusions about Zhang Baotong, saying that his correct accusation was "individual heroism, guild thinking, dissatisfaction with the Party," "inciting workers to make trouble for welfare," and "attempting to overthrow the leadership," etc.

The Taiyuan Municipal Committee, biasedly believing the reflections of Wang Jingsheng and others that distorted the facts, approved this inspection report and, based on this report, made a special report to the Shanxi Provincial Committee. Although the Municipal Committee's report pointed out the shortcomings and mistakes existing in the Coke Oven Department and ordered Wang Zisheng and others to make self-criticisms, the conclusion on Zhang Baotong was erroneous, and it was recommended that he be given appropriate Party disciplinary action. At the same time, the Municipal Committee also made erroneous accusations against the Steel Bureau inspection team. The Shanxi Provincial Committee knew about the principled differences of opinion between the Steel Bureau inspection team and the Provincial and Municipal Committee inspection team regarding the issue of the Coke Oven Department, but the Provincial Committee did not listen well to the opinions of the Steel Bureau inspection team. Instead, it lightly believed the untrue and erroneous criticisms of them in the report of the Provincial and Municipal Committee and the report of the Municipal Committee, and approved the special report of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee. At this time, Wang Jingsheng had been transferred to the Taigang Party Committee as Deputy Secretary, and he personally led the implementation of the Municipal Committee's report approved by the Provincial Committee. In the process of implementation, Wang Zisheng and others not only did not seriously examine the errors in the leadership of the Party branch, but instead used the report as a weapon to further attack Zhang Baotong. They convened meetings several times to criticize him and asked the workers Ma Jinxi, Song Ting, Zhang Laiwen, and Xu Zhicai, whom they believed to be "colluding" with Zhang Baotong, to "confess their mistakes" and expose Zhang Baotong's "facts of non-organizational activities." They also threatened Zhang Baotong, saying, "If you continue to engage in non-organizational activities, you will be dealt with according to Party discipline and state law." Wang Jingsheng also threatened Zhang Baotong, saying, "You like to file lawsuits, I'll give you a place!" Under this unbearable situation, Zhang Baotong went to Beijing via Datong in October 1953 to complain to the relevant Party and government organs, including the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. After Zhang Baotong left, Wang Zisheng immediately asked for instructions from Yan Jiade, Deputy Secretary of the Taigang Party Committee. Yan immediately firmly supported him and said to him, "Don't hold back, punish them if they should be punished! Expel them if they should be expelled! Don't worry about lawsuits, lawsuits are inevitable." Wang Zisheng immediately convened an enlarged meeting of the Party branch committee and passed a resolution to "expel Zhang Baotong from the Party," "recommend administrative dismissal," and "eliminate the thoughts of Zhang Baotong and his ilk within and outside the Party." He then convened a Party member meeting and passed the expulsion of Zhang Baotong from the Party. Wang Zisheng and others absorbed some of the masses to participate in the Party member meeting, including several politically bad elements who usually had opinions about Zhang Baotong, and let one of them be the group leader to lead the discussion on the issue of expelling Zhang Baotong from the Party. At the same time, they also appointed Cheng Zhanhai, the propaganda committee member of the Party branch, to actively collect materials on Zhang Baotong as the basis for the decision to expel him from the Party. In order to please the leadership, Cheng Zhanhai did not hesitate to fabricate, distort right and wrong, and collect a lot of distorted facts or even fabricated so-called "anti-Party, anti-leadership, and non-organizational activities" materials of Zhang Baotong. Wang Jingsheng then exaggerated these materials and used them as Zhang Baotong's crimes and supplied them to the Taigang Party Committee as the basis for expelling Zhang Baotong from the Party. For example, these materials said: Zhang Baotong "held secret meetings behind the back of the branch, engaged in non-organizational activities"; Zhang Baotong "faked illness, asked for leave, but often incited on the scene during the day and held meetings in the dormitory at night, specializing in creating an anti-leadership atmosphere"; Zhang Baotong "incited employees, violated operating procedures, and disrupted labor discipline"; Zhang Baotong "groundlessly insisted that there was a sign of 'No Admittance to Idlers' hanging at the entrance of the branch"; and so on. In short, there were many counts of crimes, and after subsequent investigation and verification, none of them were true. However, the Taigang Party Committee also followed behind the Coke Oven Department branch and made the erroneous decision to expel Zhang Baotong from the Party. Zhang Baotong disagreed with the punishment. When the Provincial Committee, the Municipal Committee, and the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Taigang Party Committee went to the Coke Oven Department to correct the situation, Wang Jingsheng arrogantly guaranteed with his "Party spirit" that the "factual basis for expelling Zhang Baotong was absolutely correct" and stated that the punishment of Zhang Baotong would not be shaken. Wang Zisheng used the excuse of "fear of disturbing the emotions of the workers and affecting production" to resist. When the correction result negated the eight "facts" in the original basis for punishment and solicited his opinion, he rudely and arbitrarily, without regard for the organization, wrote "completely one-sided distortion, not in accordance with the facts" on the correction materials, expressing his firm resistance.

After Zhang Baotong came to Beijing to complain, the North China Bureau specially established a "Zhang Baotong Case Handling Committee" and transferred the parties involved and other relevant comrades in this case to Beijing to investigate and verify the facts. After more than three months of repeated corrections, the truth was finally clarified, proving that the problems in Taigang Coke Oven Department reported by Zhang Baotong were basically true, except for slight discrepancies in the details of individual non-essential issues. At the same time, it was proved that the Taigang Party Committee's handling of the expulsion of Zhang Baotong from the Party was not based on facts, but was fabricated, reversed right and wrong, caught wind and shadows, and forced together.

After the facts were clarified, both the Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Committee made written self-criticisms, acknowledging that they had made mistakes of subjectivism and bureaucratism in handling this case, and that there were varying degrees of complacency. With the approval of the higher Party committee, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee made a decision, negated the decision of the Taigang Party Committee to expel Zhang Baotong from the Party, and decided to give different Party disciplinary actions to the following erring Party members:

Wang Zisheng, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Coke Oven Department, should bear direct and major responsibility for the occurrence and formation of this case. The errors he committed are by no means general errors in his work, but a despicable error of bourgeois individualism. In order to obtain personal honor, he did not hesitate to falsely report achievements, create false models, and in order to maintain personal "honor," he has developed from complacency to extremely bad behaviors such as resisting inspection, suppressing democracy, and retaliating. This is absolutely not allowed by Party discipline. Especially until the end of the investigation, he was still cunningly denying it. This proves that he has lost the basic conditions of a Communist Party member, and it is decided to expel him from the Party.

Cheng Zhanhai, Propaganda Committee Member of the Party Branch of the Coke Oven Department, his mistake was to be opportunistic, sow discord, and even fabricate "facts," which played a role in promoting the formation of this case. His character is bad, and it is decided to give him a punishment of probation within the Party for two years.

Shi Li, Director of the Coke Oven Department, is one of the direct persons responsible for this case. He colluded with Wang Zisheng and others to suppress democracy and retaliate against Zhang Baotong and other informants. His speculative thinking and his mistakes are serious. He can still admit his mistakes during the inspection, but his understanding is not deep enough. It is decided to give him a punishment of probation within the Party for one year and recommend administrative dismissal.

Wang Jingsheng, Deputy Secretary of the Taigang Party Committee, bears leadership responsibility for the formation of this case. His personal individualism and complacency are very serious. Whether he participated in inspection work or led the implementation of the Provincial Committee's report, he fully demonstrated a subjective, arbitrary, and self-righteous bad work style. However, in view of the fact that the nature of the errors he committed is different from Wang Zisheng, Cheng Zhanhai, etc., and he was able to admit his mistakes during the inspection, it is decided to give him a punishment of probation within the Party for one year.

Yan Jiade, Deputy Secretary of the Taigang Party Committee, when assigned to the Coke Oven Department to help with work, in order to show himself, boasted and exaggerated some achievements in the department's work. He adopted bad methods of suppression, attack, and appeasement against those who reported the Coke Oven Department's deception. On the issue of expelling Zhang Baotong from the Party, he supported Wang Zisheng and said, "Lawsuits are inevitable." His bourgeois individualism is serious, and he directly supported and promoted Wang Zisheng and others' suppression of democracy and retaliation against informants. He can basically admit his mistakes during the inspection, but his understanding is not very deep. It is decided to give him a punishment of demotion.

The decision also pointed out that: Cao Pu, the current factory director of Taigang, who was the secretary of the Party Committee and factory director at the time, never seriously inquired about Zhang Baotong's report. He failed to promote democracy at the Party Committee meeting he chaired to discuss the expulsion of Zhang Baotong from the Party and committed a serious error of bureaucratism. Hu Kai, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Taigang Party Committee, made rude and erroneous criticisms of the Steel Bureau inspection team and later defended some of Cheng Zhanhai's mistakes. Li Shaoxun, Director of the Office of the Provincial Industrial Department and one of the persons in charge of the Provincial and Municipal Committee inspection team, made exaggerated and untrue reports on the model deeds of the Coke Oven Department and harbored dissatisfaction with the Steel Bureau inspection team. He made an untrue report to the Municipal Committee on the issue of Zhang Baotong. All three of them should make written self-criticisms to the Party and make public self-criticisms at certain cadre meetings. In this incident of deception and suppression of democracy, all members of the Party branch of the Coke Oven Department, except for Zhang Baotong, none of the other branch committee members adhered to the truth. Some echoed, and some were liberal. Therefore, they should make written self-criticisms to the Party. The Taigang Party Committee not only failed to timely discover, seriously check, and correct the problems and errors existing in the Party branch of the Coke Oven Department and the main cadres of the branch, but instead biasedly believed and made the erroneous decision to expel Zhang Baotong from the Party. The Party Committee should make a profound self-criticism.

The decision also pointed out that: According to the results of this investigation, it is proved that most of the model deeds of Qu Bingrui, an engineer in the Coke Oven Department, are exaggerated and fabricated, and basically do not meet the conditions of a labor model. It is decided to recommend that the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee revoke his title of Special Provincial Labor Model. Zhang Baotong, who was retaliated against for exposing the false achievements of the Coke Oven Department, should not only have his reputation restored, but also his spirit of adhering to the truth and making irreconcilable struggles against bourgeois ideological behaviors within the Party should be commended. Regarding the retaliatory actions suffered by Ma Jinxi, Song Ting, Zhang Laiwen, Xu Zhicai, and other comrades who supported and assisted Zhang Baotong in the struggle against unhealthy tendencies, such as unreasonable punishments and transfers, the Taigang Party Committee should promptly handle and correct them based on the actual situation, restore their reputations, and provide appropriate comfort and encouragement.

    中共太原市委处理一个严重压制批评的事件
    太原钢铁厂炼焦部党支部书记王自生等受到党纪处分，共产党员张宝桐等受到表扬
    中共山西省太原市委员会最近处理了太原钢铁厂（以下简称太钢）炼焦部党支部书记王自生等人压制批评、打击报复检举人张宝桐的事件。
    太钢炼焦部一九五二年在全体职工群众的努力下生产有一定成绩，但该部领导干部弄虚作假、虚报成绩的现象也是十分严重的。如第一季度硫酸氩任务的完成，十二月份焦油任务的完成，消灭黑头焦，降低洗煤灰粉，学习苏联先进经验“锥形曲线调火法”均有夸大虚构之处。一九五二年下半年，山西日报、太原日报连续登出关于曲炳瑞模范事迹的不真实报道以后，引起工人群众的不满。一九五三年一月评选劳动模范时，又由于该部领导干部不民主，不采纳工人依据事实评选劳动模范的意见，不少工人公开向领导上提出意见，该部保卫股长、共产党员张宝桐也向党支部和行政领导干部作了反映。该部党政领导干部不但不虚心倾听工人的意见，纠正错误，反而召开会议，斥责提意见的工人是“把蒸馍当成狗屎”、“邪气压倒正气”，并用
  “要防止坏分子钻空子”的话来威吓群众；批评张宝桐反映群众意见是“跟着落后群众跑”、“动机不纯”等。劳动模范名单批准公布后，工人群众更加不满，特别是对被评选为省特等劳动模范的曲炳瑞和厂模范小组代表调火班长刘天金有意见。张宝桐又相继向太钢党委会、中共太原市委会、中共山西省委纪律检查委员会反映了炼焦部评选劳动模范中存在的问题。炼焦部党支部书记王自生等人知道这一情况后，便对张宝桐采取了压制手段，召开党支部委员会斗争他。因此，张宝桐又向毛主席、政务院人民监察委员会、中央重工业部钢铁工业局、人民日报社、山西省人民政府主席裴丽生控诉。
    接着，省、市委组成检查组进行了检查，当时正在太钢协助中心工作的中央重工业部钢铁工业局工作组接到局内转来的张宝桐向毛主席写的控诉书以后，也遵照局里的指示，分出几个人组成检查组进行了检查。钢铁局检查组本着实事求是的精神进行工作，认真地作了调查研究，先后和六十多个职工谈话、座谈，并且注意听取了各方面的意见，因而迅速弄清了事实真相，认为张宝桐等同志的控告基本上符合事实。但是在检查过程中，以王自生为首的炼焦部的党政领导干部怕暴露虚假现象，失掉所谓“荣誉”，对上级的检查消极对抗。王自生等人特别对钢铁局检查组表示不满，说他们和张宝桐一起“质问劳模，造成混乱，影响生产”。省、市委检查组负责人、太原市委组织部副部长王景生和太钢党委会组织部副部长胡凯，偏信了炼焦部领导干部的歪曲事实的反映，也对钢铁局检查组抱有不满情绪。在太钢党委负责同志主持的两个检查组的汇报会议上，胡凯竟粗暴地批评钢铁局检查组，如说他们是“专找岔子”、“检查目的值得怀疑”等。之后，王景生和省、市委检查组另一负责人、山西省委工业部办公室副主任李绍勋（他在报纸上对炼焦部劳动模范事迹作过夸大不实的报道），即以省、市委检查组名义向省、市委写了检查报告，报告未在组内讨论，也未征求其他同志的意见；组内有些同志曾提出过正确的意见，未被他们采纳，也没有向上反映。由于王景生等人没有作过认真的调查研究，不虚心听取工人群众的意见，而是偏听偏信王自生等人，因而这个报告只说炼焦部在评选劳动模范中有缺点，报纸所载曲炳瑞等人的模范事迹确有夸大不实之处，炼焦部的党政领导干部有骄傲自满情绪、作风不民主等，同时，这个报告除了重复了对钢铁局检查组粗暴的错误的批评，对张宝桐更作了完全错误的结论，把他的正确控告说成是“个人英雄主义，行会思想，对党不满”，“煽动工人闹福利”，“企图推翻领导”等。
    太原市委偏信了王景生等人的歪曲事实的反映，批准了这个检查报告，并且根据这个报告向山西省委作了专题报告。市委的报告虽然指出了炼焦部存在的缺点和错误，令王自生等人检讨，但对张宝桐的结论则是错误的，并且建议给他以适当的党纪处分；同时市委也对钢铁局检查组作了错误的指责。山西省委对于钢铁局检查组和省、市委检查组关于炼焦部问题的原则性的分歧意见是知道的，但是省委没有很好地听取钢铁局检查组的意见，反而轻信了省、市委检查组和市委报告中对他们的不符事实的错误的批评，批准了太原市委的专题报告。这个时候，王景生已调到太钢党委会任副书记，由他亲自领导贯彻经省委批准的市委的报告。在贯彻过程中，王自生等人不但没有认真检查党支部领导上的错误，反而把报告作为进一步打击张宝桐的武器，曾经几次召集会议斗争他，并且要他们认为和张宝桐有“勾结”的工人马金喜、宋廷、张来文和徐治才等“坦白错误”，揭发张宝桐“非组织活动的事实”，并且威胁张宝桐“如再进行非组织活动，要以党纪国法处理”。王景生也威胁张宝桐说：“你好告状给你个地方！”在这种忍无可忍的情况下，张宝桐于一九五三年十月绕道大同亲来北京向前中共中央华北局等有关党政机关控诉。张宝桐走后，王自生当即请示太钢党委副书记阎家德，阎当即坚决支持他，对他说：“不能搁住，该处分就处分！该开除就开除！不要顾虑打官司，打官司在所难免。”王自生随即召开了党支委扩大会议，通过了
  “开除张宝桐党籍”，“建议行政撤职”，“在党内外肃清张宝桐一类思想”的决议。并即召开党员大会，通过了开除张宝桐的党籍。王自生等人吸收了部分群众参加党员大会，其中包括平时对张宝桐有意见的几个政治品质恶劣的分子，并且让他们中的一个当小组长，领导讨论开除张宝桐党籍的问题。同时他们还指派党支部宣传委员程占海积极收集张宝桐的材料，作为开除他党籍决定的根据。程占海为了讨好领导，不惜无中生有，颠倒是非，收集了许多歪曲事实的、甚至凭空捏造的所谓张宝桐
  “反党反领导和非组织活动”的材料，王景生又将这些材料加以夸大，当作张宝桐的罪状，供给太钢党委会作为开除张宝桐党籍的根据。例如这些材料说：张宝桐“背转支部召开秘密会议，进行非组织活动”；张宝桐“假借有病，请假休息，但经常白天在现场煽动，晚间在宿舍开会，专门制造反领导空气”；张宝桐“煽动职工，违反操作规程，破坏劳动纪律”；张宝桐“无中生有的硬说支部门口挂过‘闲人免进’的牌子”；等等。总之，罪状有好多条，经过以后调查对证，没有一条是真实的。但是太钢党委会也跟在炼焦部支部的后面，错误地作出了开除张宝桐党籍的决定。张宝桐对处分不服，省委、市委和太钢党委纪律检查委员会去炼焦部进行订正时，王景生竟狂妄地以他的“党性”保证开除张宝桐的“事实根据绝无差错”，表示对张宝桐的处分决不动摇。王自生则借口“怕波动了工人的情绪，影响了生产”，进行抵抗。当订正结果否定了原处分根据中的八条“事实”，征求他的意见的时候，他竟粗暴蛮横、目无组织地在订正材料上批上“完全片面曲解，不符事实”，表示坚决抵抗。
    在张宝桐亲来北京控诉以后，华北局专门成立了“张宝桐案处理委员会”，先后将这个案件的当事人和其他有关同志调来北京，调查对证事实。经过三个多月的反复订正，终于弄清了事实真相，证明张宝桐所检举的太钢炼焦部的问题，除个别非本质问题的情节稍有出入外，基本属实；同时证明太钢党委会开除张宝桐党籍的处理根据均非事实，而是无中生有，颠倒是非，捕风捉影，强拉硬凑成的。
    事实弄清以后，山西省委和太原市委都作了书面检讨，承认他们在处理这个案件中犯了主观主义、官僚主义的错误，并且存在着不同程度的骄傲自满情绪。经过上级党委的批准，太原市委作出决定，否定了太钢党委会开除张宝桐党籍的决定，并且决定给予下列犯错误的党员不同的党纪处分：
    王自生，炼焦部党支部书记，对本案的发生和形成应负直接的主要的责任。他所犯的错误决不是工作上的一般性的错误，而是一种卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义的错误，为了骗取个人荣誉，不惜虚报成绩，制造假模范，以及为了维护个人的“荣誉”，已经由骄傲自满情绪发展到抵抗检查、压制民主、打击报复等极其恶劣的行为，这是党的纪律所绝对不能容许的。尤其是直到查对结束时，他还是狡猾抵赖。这就证明他已经丧失共产党员的起码条件，决定开除其党籍。
    程占海，炼焦部党支部宣传委员，他的错误是投机买好，播弄是非，甚至捏造“事实”，对本案的形成起了助长作用。他的品质是恶劣的，决定给予留党察看二年处分。
    史励，炼焦部主任，是本案的直接责任者之一。他和王自生等人同流合污，压制民主，打击报复张宝桐等检举人，他的投机思想和他的错误是严重的。在检查中还能承认错误，但认识很不深刻。决定给予留党察看一年处分，并建议行政上给予撤职处分。
    王景生，太钢党委会副书记，对本案的形成负有领导上的责任。他的显露自己的个人主义骄傲情绪很严重，不论是在参加检查工作或领导贯彻省委的报告中、都充分表现了主观、武断、自以为是的不良作风。但鉴于他所犯错误的性质同王自生、程占海等有所不同，并且在检查中能够承认错误，决定给予留党察看一年处分。
    阎家德，太钢党委会副书记，分工到炼焦部帮助工作时，为了显露自己，对该部工作上的某些成绩吹嘘夸大；对反映炼焦部弄虚作假的人，采取压制、打击、拉拢的恶劣手段；在开除张宝桐党籍的问题上，他给王自生撑腰，并且说“打官司也在所难免”。他的资产阶级个人主义是严重的，直接支持和助长了王自生等人压制民主和对检举人的打击报复。检查中基本上还能承认错误，但很不深刻，决定给予撤销工作处分。
    处理决定还指出：太钢现任厂长、当时党委书记兼厂长曹普，对张宝桐的检举从未认真过问，在他主持的讨论开除张宝桐党籍的党委会上未能发扬民主，犯了严重的官僚主义错误；太钢党委组织部副部长胡凯，对钢铁局检查组作了粗暴的错误的批评，以后还为程占海的某些错误辩护；省委工业部办公室主任、省、市委检查组负责人之一的李绍勋，对炼焦部模范事迹作过夸大不实的报道，对钢铁局检查组持有不满情绪，向市委作过关于张宝桐问题的不真实报告，他们三人都应向党作书面检讨，并在一定干部会上作公开检讨。在这个弄虚作假、压制民主的事件中，炼焦部党支部所有委员，除张宝桐一人外，其他支委无一人坚持真理，有的随声附和，有的自由主义，因此他们应向党作书面检讨。太钢党委会对炼焦部党支部和该支部主要干部存在的问题和发生的错误，不但不能及时发现，认真地检查纠正，反而偏听偏信，作出开除张宝桐党籍的错误决定，党委会应作深刻检讨。
　　处理决定还指出：根据此次查对结果，证明炼焦部工程师曲炳瑞的模范事迹，大部系夸大虚构，基本上不够劳动模范的条件，决定建议山西省人民委员会撤销其省特等劳动模范称号。因揭露炼焦部虚报成绩而遭到打击报复的张宝桐同志，除应给他恢复名誉外，对他坚持真理、对党内资产阶级思想行为作不调和斗争的精神，应当加以表扬。对支持与协助张宝桐进行反不良倾向斗争的马金喜、宋廷、张来文、徐治才等同志遭到的打击报复，即受到的不合理的处分和调动等问题，应由太钢党委会根据实际情况，迅速处理和纠正，恢复他们的名誉，并给予适当的安慰和鼓励。
