    Ignoring Existing Mines is a Serious Mistake
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun
    Jixi Coal Mine, located on the frontier in the northeast corner of our country, possesses large quantities of high-quality prime coking coal and industrial power coal. It is one of the earliest liberated coal mines in our country. As early as the Liberation War, it made many contributions to the people, and now it supplies a large amount of coking coal to Anshan Iron and Steel, our country's iron and steel industrial base.
    While building modern mines, Jixi Coal Mine is also actively carrying out a comprehensive restoration and reconstruction of existing mines. Under the leadership of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the help of Soviet experts, the Mining Bureau has formulated a plan for the comprehensive restoration and reconstruction of the mines, deciding to restore and rebuild thirty-nine mines with restoration and reconstruction value. Most of these mines have now started construction one after another. This work is of extremely important significance to Jixi Coal Mine. By 1957, it will increase the annual output of existing mines by about one-half compared to the original plan (the plan before actively carrying out the restoration and reconstruction of existing mines), and by 1962 it can be increased by more than double. According to calculations, the investment required for restoration and reconstruction is only one-third of the investment for new construction. If the increased output from restoration and reconstruction were to be entirely borne by newly built large-scale vertical shafts, it would require the state to increase investment by at least 100 million yuan in old currency. Restoration and reconstruction work can also bring forward the time of coal production – it will be basically completed in the next three years, and some mines can be handed over for production this year. Implementing restoration and reconstruction can also more rationally utilize underground resources. The coal left behind by the closed and unrestored mines of Jixi Coal Mine amounts to a huge 110 million tons. Now, these abandoned coal resources can be used for the country's industrial construction.
    In the past few years, Jixi Coal Mine blindly pursued "large scale" in capital construction, leading the coal mine to a situation of declining production year by year. A strange phenomenon appeared here: on the one hand, many people were working diligently day and night to build modern large vertical shafts, while at the same time, many normally producing mines were being closed down one after another.
    In 1951, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, based on the situation of national economic recovery at that time, proposed that the guiding principle for coal mine industrial production and construction should be: "Focusing on restoration and reconstruction, giving full play to the potential of existing production equipment, and preparing for new well construction in key areas in a step-by-step manner." This guiding principle was also completely applicable to Jixi Coal Mine, because at that time, exploration data was insufficient, technical strength was weak, and the state's funds were limited. Especially in the case of urgent coal demand, wanting to build large-scale vertical shafts with an annual output of more than 600,000 tons to ensure the supply of coal was unreliable both in terms of time (it takes five to seven years to build a large vertical shaft) and other conditions. Therefore, in the next few years, it was necessary to mainly rely on existing mines to produce coal to meet the needs of the country. From the perspective of Jixi Coal Mine, the production of existing mines will still occupy a major position in the next two five-year plans. By 1957, the output of existing mines will account for more than 80% of the total mine output, and by 1962 it will still account for more than 60%.
    However, the leaders of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration and the Jixi Mining Bureau at that time not only did not actively carry out the restoration and reconstruction of existing mines, but also adopted a reckless approach to the construction of new mines, regardless of subjective strength and objective conditions. For example, after hearing that the Guangyi area, more than 200 li away from Jixi, was once called "Fushun Second" by the Japanese invaders, they everywhere promoted that "this is the hope of Jixi Coal Mine," and rashly made a huge plan to build large-scale vertical shafts in the Guangyi area, which was more than 200 li away, uninhabited, without water sources, without power sources, and where "even drinking cold water requires state investment," concentrating a large amount of drilling force. After nearly a year of drilling, it was confirmed that the ideal large coalfield was not reliable, and they had to cancel the plan.
    The Jixi Xiaohengshan vertical shaft, which started construction in 1950, now appears from all aspects that it would have been more reasonable to build two pairs of inclined shafts than to build a vertical shaft. Not only could the production task be completed in the same way, but also because the coal seam was closer to the ground, if inclined shafts were opened, coal could be mined only 50 meters in front of the outcrop, which would save investment and produce coal quickly. More seriously, due to a lack of understanding of the geological situation, it was arbitrarily believed that the recoverable reserves in the vertical shaft construction area were far from meeting the design requirements. In order to ensure the construction of large-scale vertical shafts, four production inclined shafts were closed down at the expense of including the inclined shaft's mining area into the vertical shaft.
    Because they were single-mindedly pursuing "large scale" and ignoring the important role of existing mines, they adopted a policy of eliminating and closing down large numbers of mines one by one, causing coal mine production to move towards a deformed state of atrophy and regression. From 1950 to 1954, Jixi Coal Mine closed down a total of 57 mines, accounting for one-half of all production inclined shafts in the mine. According to the mine's long-term plan, ten more old wells will continue to be closed down by 1962. The output of existing mines is only equal to 80% of the annual output in 1953. Taking Hengshan Mine, the largest mine in Jixi Coal Mine, as an example, the mine originally had 32 inclined shafts, but by 1953, 12 had been closed down. If the original plan to continue closing down had been followed, then by 1962 there would only be four mines left, and the output would only be one-third of that in 1953.
    At that time, the leaders of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration and the Jixi Coal Mine also mistakenly concluded that inclined shafts "had to be stopped one by one." In fact, the development of inclined shafts or vertical shafts must be determined based on geological conditions and other conditions, and cannot be handled mechanically.
    After closing down a large number of mines that were considered too small and dispersed, Jixi Coal Mine put forward the "centralized production theory," and carried out "merger and reconstruction" of a few larger inclined shafts. In fact, the so-called "centralized production" reduced the production capacity of the entire coal mine. For example, the Didao Mine originally had five normally producing inclined shafts. In order to realize the "four major concentrations" – "centralized production, centralized ventilation, centralized transportation, and centralized drainage," a merger and reconstruction project was carried out to change "small scale" to "large scale," taking three years and investing more than 30 billion yuan in old currency. As a result of the merger, the original output decreased by one-third. Workers called this strange "centralized production" a "waste of manpower and money."
    Under the guidance of erroneous thinking, the existing mines of Jixi Coal Mine were severely damaged. In 1950 alone, the lives of 22 mines were lost in one fell swoop. This was not enough, and the task was repeatedly increased. For example, the No. 1 inclined shaft of the No. 6 pit of Jixi Hengshan Mine had been restored for nearly two years, the equipment had been installed, and coal could be produced immediately, but it was hastily closed down! The No. 3 inclined shaft of the No. 4 pit of Hengshan was in production and had more than one million tons of reserves, but because the Xiaohengshan vertical shaft under construction needed equipment, the well was closed down and the equipment was pulled away! More seriously, many mines were abandoned simply because they were "too small," "too many," or "too troublesome."
    Another serious consequence of Jixi Coal Mine's neglect of fully exploiting the potential of existing mines was the abandonment of production geological work in existing mines, which brought passivity and chaos to coal mine production work. Since 1950, the geological force has been turned to "new construction," and the production geological work of existing mines has been basically stopped, which has seriously affected the normal progress of coal mining and tunneling work. For example, Sun Tielun, director of the Didao Mine, said: "Due to the unclear geological situation, production work is like 'a blind man riding a blind horse,' not knowing how many coal seams can be mined? Nor knowing where the boundaries of the mining area are?" Some mines can only move forward in depth, not develop on both wings, because the direction of the coal seam is unknown, and the life of existing mines cannot be extended. For example, the No. 6 pit of Chengzihe could have been mined for 25 years, but because it only developed in depth, it can only be mined for 15 years. After the old No. 9 pit of Chengzihe encountered a fault, it no longer continued to develop forward, thinking that the coal had been exhausted. In fact, there were 3 million tons of coal in front, and the upper coal seam had not yet been mined. As a result, because the old well had been scrapped and could not be restored, it was necessary to reinvest more than 30 billion yuan in old currency to open a new well next to it. Because the geological situation was not clarified, Jixi Mashan Mine has always been considered to be "low in coal quality" and "cannot be mined for a few years." The policy of "waiting for the end of life" was adopted for the mine. The employees were all waiting for "closing the door and moving," and their mood was very negative. In fact, Mashan coal is an extremely high-quality coking coal, and the recoverable reserves can be increased at least three times. It was originally a promising mine. It is precisely because the coal seam situation is not understood that only the lower coal seam with thicker coal seam and better coal quality is selected for mining, regardless of the upper coal seam, causing huge damage to resources. According to preliminary investigations, in the upper part of the coal seams mined in the three mines of Hengshan, Didao, and Chengzihe, there are at least four to seven coal seams that can be mined. Now, due to long-term random mining and mining, the upper coal seams have been damaged to varying degrees. Some of the upper coal seams cannot be taken out at all. For example, after the lower coal seams of five mines in Hengshan Mine were mined, the upper coal seams collapsed and can never be mined.
    Jixi Coal Mine has not managed many closed and unrestored old wells for a long time, allowing mountain fires to burn. When the coal seam starts to catch fire, it is very easy to extinguish, but because no one cares about it and no active fire extinguishing work is carried out, the fire continues to spread. The area of five fire areas is 350,000 square meters, and the geological reserves threatened by fire are about 13 million tons. The coal threatened by fire in Hengshan is more than 8 million tons, and only more than 2 million tons can be taken out now. The old No. 4 pit of Didao has more than 5 million tons of coal, which is extremely valuable prime coking coal, but it has been allowed to be burned by fire for eight years.
    The erroneous practice of blindly pursuing "large scale" by the leaders of Jixi Coal Mine has been resisted by many employees. Lu Zhonghai, an old worker of Chengzihe Mine, cried bitterly for this. He said: "Although the output of inclined shafts is small, coal is not easy to generate! The country has spent a lot of money, and we have worked hard to restore it with drops of sweat and blood. How can it be abandoned casually!" Later, he and other workers secretly kept the pit entrances that the Mining Bureau had ordered to be scrapped, and the "black pit entrances" appeared. When the country needed a large amount of coal during the "Resist America and Aid Korea," it was secretly opened. Under his protection, this "black pit entrance" was never damaged for two months. Regarding the mistakes of Jixi Coal Mine, some cadres wrote letters to complain to the higher authorities, and some technicians also put forward different opinions, but they were not accepted by the leaders at that time. After the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party inspected the work of Jixi Coal Mine and explained the correct policy to the employees, the employees actively provided information on closed old mines, inspected the collapse of roadways in scrapped mines, and actively contributed old mine data to assist the higher leading organs in correcting mistakes and recovering losses.
    Now, the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have stopped this mistake, reversed the situation of declining production year by year in Jixi Coal Mine, and led the mine to a new road of prosperity. The employees of Jixi Coal Mine are actively and conscientiously implementing the correct policy of the Central Committee. The erroneous policy delayed the progress of construction in Jixi Coal Mine by ten years (according to calculations, if Jixi Coal Mine had actively implemented the policy of focusing on restoration and reconstruction from 1950, it could have reached the annual output of 1962 stipulated in the original long-term plan by 1953), and now the active implementation of the restoration and reconstruction project has advanced the delayed progress by five years. However, the task of Jixi Coal Mine in the future is still very arduous, because it is easiest to close down a mine, but it is a hundred times more difficult to restore these mines. In particular, the safety coal pillars of some mines have been dismantled, making it difficult to restore them. The situation of non-convergence between the new and old in some mines in the next few years is still not easy to change. However, we firmly believe that all employees of Jixi Coal Mine will be able to make up for the huge losses caused by the erroneous policies of the past leaders with redoubled efforts.

    忽视现有矿井是严重的错误
    本报记者　金雨困
    鸡西煤矿位于我国东北角的边陲上，有着大量优良的炼焦用的主焦煤和工业动力用煤，是我国最早解放的煤矿之一。远在解放战争时期，就为人民作了许多贡献，现在又为我国钢铁工业基地——鞍钢供应着大量的炼焦煤。
    鸡西煤矿在建设现代化矿井的同时，也在积极进行现有矿井的全面恢复改建工作。在燃料工业部和中共黑龙江省委的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，矿务局已制订了矿井全面恢复改建的方案，决定将三十九个有恢复改建价值的矿井进行恢复改建工作。现在这些矿井大部已先后动工。这一工作对鸡西煤矿具有极其重要的意义，到一九五七年，它将使现有矿井的年产量，较原来的计划（就是没有积极进行原有矿井恢复改建以前的计划）产量约增加二分之一，到一九六二年可增加到一倍以上。根据计算，恢复改建所需投资，仅及新建投资的三分之一，如果将恢复改建后所增加的产量，全部由新建大型竖井负担，至少要使国家增加旧币一亿万元以上的投资。恢复改建工作，也能提早出煤的时间，——在今后三年内即将基本上完成，有些矿井今年就可移交生产。实行恢复改建，也可以更合理地利用地下资源。鸡西煤矿停废和未恢复的矿井所丢下的煤达一亿一千万吨之巨。现在这些被丢下的煤炭，又可为国家工业建设所用。
    鸡西煤矿过去几年来在基本建设上曾盲目追求“大规模”，把煤矿引向了逐年减产的绝境。在这里曾出现过一种奇怪的景象：一方面许多人正在日夜辛勤地建设现代的大竖井，而同时许多正常生产着的矿井，却一个随着一个地被封闭了。
    一九五一年，政务院财政经济委员会根据当时国家经济恢复时期的情况，提出煤矿工业生产建设的方针是：“以恢复改建为主，发挥现有生产设备的潜在能力，有步骤地选择重点进行新井建设的准备工作。”这一方针对于鸡西煤矿也是完全适用的，因为当时勘探资料不足，技术力量薄弱，国家资金困难，特别在用煤急迫的情况下，想建设年产六十万吨以上的大型竖井来保证煤炭的供应，无论从时间上（建设一个大竖井需要五年到七年）及其它条件上看都是靠不住的。因此，在今后若干年内，就不得不主要依靠现有矿井生产煤，以满足国家的需要。从鸡西煤矿来看，在今后两个五年计划内现有矿井的生产仍占着主要的地位。到一九五七年，现有矿井的产量要占全矿总产量的百分之八十以上，至一九六二年仍要占百分之六十以上。
    但当时东北煤矿管理局和鸡西矿务局的领导人不仅不积极对现有矿井进行恢复改建工作，而且对新建矿井也采取了不顾主观力量和客观条件的蛮干做法。例如他们听说离鸡西二百多里的光义地区曾被日本侵略者称为“抚顺第二”，便到处宣扬：“这是鸡西煤矿的希望”，贸然地对远在二百华里外，没有人烟，没有水源，没有电源，“连喝口凉水都需国家投资”的光义地区，作出了建设大型竖井的庞大计划，集中了大量钻探力量。经过近一年的钻探，证实理想的大煤田并不可靠，才不得不撤销这个计划。
    在一九五○年就着手建设的鸡西小恒山竖井，现在从各方面的条件看，如果当时建立两对斜井则比建立竖井更为合理。不仅同样可以完成产量任务，而且由于煤层离地面较近，如果开斜井，只要顺着露头前五十公尺即可采到煤炭，这样既可节省投资，又能很快出煤。更严重的是由于不了解地质情况，曾武断地认为建设竖井地区的可采埋藏量远远不能满足设计需要量，为了保证大型竖井的建设，就不惜封闭四个生产斜井，将斜井的井田范围划入竖井。
    由于他们一心追求“大规模”，忽视现有矿井的重要作用，因此对现有矿井采取了逐一消灭大量停废的方针，使煤矿生产走向畸形的萎缩和倒退的状态。鸡西煤矿从一九五○年到一九五四年停废的矿井共有五十七个，占该矿全部生产斜井的二分之一。根据该矿的远景计划，到一九六二年还将继续停废旧井十个。现有矿井的产量只等于一九五三年年产量的百分之八十。以鸡西煤矿最大的恒山矿为例，该矿原有斜井三十二个，到一九五三年已停废至十二个，如按原打算继续停废下去，那么到一九六二年便只剩下了四个矿井，产量仅及一九五三年的三分之一。
    当时东北煤矿管理局和鸡西煤矿的领导人还错误地作出了斜井“不得不逐一停止”的结论。其实，开拓斜井或竖井必须根据地质情况和其他条件来确定，而不能机械地处理。
    鸡西煤矿将大量被认为太小和分散的矿井停废之后，又提出了“集中生产论”，将少数较大的斜井进行“合并改建”，实际上所谓“集中生产”，反而使整个煤矿生产能力下降。例如，滴道矿原有五个正常生产的斜井，为实现“四大集中”——“集中生产、集中通风，集中运输、集中排水”进行了变“小型”为“大型”的合并改建工程，费时三年，投资旧币三百多亿元。合并的结果，反使原有的产量下降了三分之一。对这种奇怪的“集中生产”，工人们称为“劳民伤财”。
    在错误的思想指导下，鸡西煤矿的现有矿井遭到严重破坏。仅在一九五○年，一次就葬送了二十二个矿井的生命。这样还嫌不够，一再追加任务。像鸡西恒山六坑一斜井，进行恢复工作近二年，已安装好设备，马上就可以出煤，却被草率地停废了！恒山四坑三斜井正在进行生产，并有百余万吨的埋藏量，但因在建设中的小恒山竖井需要设备，即将该井停废，把设备拉走了！更严重的是有许多矿井只是因为“嫌小”、“嫌多”、“嫌麻烦”，便被废掉了。
    鸡西煤矿忽视充分发挥现有矿井潜力的另一严重后果，就是放弃了现有矿井的生产地质工作，给煤矿生产工作带来了被动和混乱。自一九五○年开始，将地质力量都转向了“新建”，基本上停止了现有矿井的生产地质工作，因而严重地影响了采煤和掘进工作的正常进行。如滴道矿矿长孙铁轮说：“由于地质情况不清，生产工作就像‘盲人骑瞎马’，不知有多少煤层可采？也不知井田的边界在那里？”有的矿井因煤层走向不明，只能向纵深前进，不向两翼发展，无法延长现有矿井寿命。如城子河六坑本可采二十五年，由于只向纵深发展，只能采十五年就完了。城子河老九坑遇到断层后，还不再继续向前发展，以为煤已采尽，实际上前边就有三百万吨煤，同时上层煤还没有开采，结果因旧井已报废，无法恢复，不得不重新投资旧币三百多亿元在旁边另开新井。鸡西麻山矿由于没有弄清地质情况，一直被认为是“煤质低劣”“没有几年可采了”。对该矿采取了“坐待寿终正寝”的方针。职工们都等待着“关门搬家”，情绪非常消极。事实上，麻山煤是极其优良的炼焦煤，可采埋藏量至少还可增加三倍以上，原是大有希望的矿山。正由于不了解煤层情况，便只拣煤层较厚、煤质较好的下层煤开采，毫不顾及上层煤，使资源遭到巨大的破坏。据初步调查，在恒山、滴道、城子河三个矿所采煤层的上部，至少还有四至七个煤层可采。现在由于长期乱开乱采在不同程度上破坏了上层煤，有的上层煤已根本无法取出，如恒山矿有五个矿井下层煤采完后上层煤塌落，已永远不能开采了。
    鸡西煤矿对许多停废和没有恢复的旧井，长期不加管理，听任山火燃烧。当煤层开始着火时本极易扑灭，但由于无人过问、没有积极进行消火工作，致使大火不断蔓延。五处火区面积达三十五万平方公尺，受火威胁地质埋藏量约达一千三百多万吨。恒山受火威胁的煤炭有八百余万吨，现能取出的煤仅二百余万吨。滴道老四坑有煤五百万吨以上，都是极为贵重的主焦煤，但听任其为大火烧了八年。
    鸡西煤矿领导人员盲目追求“大规模”的错误做法，曾遭到许多职工的抵抗。城子河矿老工人陆忠海为此痛哭流涕。他说：“斜井产煤虽少，可是煤是不容易生成的呀！国家花了很多钱，我们一滴汗
  一滴血好容易把它恢复起来，怎么能随随便便废弃掉！”后来他又和其他工人把矿务局命令报废的坑口暗暗地保留下来，于是出现了“黑坑口”，在“抗美援朝”国家需要大量煤炭时，便偷偷地打开，开了两个月，这个“黑坑口”在他的保护下始终未遭到破坏。对于鸡西煤矿的错误，有的干部曾写信向上级控告，有的技术人员也曾提出了不同的意见，但都没有为当时的领导上接受，当燃料工业部和中共黑龙江省委检查鸡西煤矿工作、向职工们讲清了正确的方针后，职工们积极提供停废旧矿井的情况，到报废矿井中检查井巷塌落情况，并积极贡献旧井资料，协助上级领导机关纠正错误，挽回损失。
      现在，燃料工业部和中共黑龙江省委已制止了这个错误，扭转了鸡西煤矿逐年减产的局面，把矿山引向了新的繁荣的道路。鸡西煤矿的职工正积极认真贯彻中央的正确方针。错误的方针曾使鸡西煤矿在建设的进度上推迟了十年时间（根据计算，鸡西煤矿如果自一九五○年就开始积极贯彻恢复改建为主的方针，到一九五三年就可以达到原来远景计划中所规定的一九六二年的年产量），现在由于恢复改建工程的积极进行，又使推迟了的进度提前了五年。但是鸡西煤矿今后的任务仍然是非常艰巨的，因为要停废一个矿井原是最轻易的事情，但要恢复这些矿井就要困难百倍。特别是有些矿井保安煤柱都被拆除，已难于恢复。有些矿井今后若干年内新旧不相衔接的局面仍然不易改变。但是我们深信鸡西煤矿全体职工一定能以加倍的努力，来弥补过去领导上的错误方针所造成的巨大损失。
