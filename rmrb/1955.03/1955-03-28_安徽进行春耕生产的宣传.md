    More than 600 cultural centers and stations, approximately 10,000 amateur theatrical troupes, and numerous film projection teams, distributed throughout Anhui Province, have launched cultural propaganda activities related to spring ploughing production.
    The Mapu Cultural Center in Jinzhai County is widely publicizing spring ploughing production through blackboard newspapers, local broadcasts, and slide shows. They have also written local mountain songs and ditties promoting the high-yield crops "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes and potatoes, and distributed them to agricultural production cooperatives, people's schools, and amateur theatrical troupes throughout the area for singing. Recently, cultural centers and stations have also organized farmers to listen to Anhui Province Governor Huang Yan's broadcast address to the people of the province: "Urgently mobilize, develop a great production movement relying on cooperation and mutual assistance, and actively promote the 'Three Changes' (changing the ratio of summer and autumn harvests, changing to planting high-yield, water-resistant, and drought-resistant crops, and changing the habit of extensive planting with low yields)." Fifty mobile film projection teams dispatched by the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau are touring rural areas screening films such as "Harvest." Preliminary statistics from February to the present indicate that audiences have reached two million people. Xinhua bookstores in various regions have distributed 130,000 copies of Anhui agricultural "Three Changes" and related spring ploughing production reference books to farmers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    安徽进行春耕生产的宣传
    分布在安徽省的六百多个文化馆、站，约一万个业余剧团和许多电影放映队，展开了有关春耕生产的文化宣传活动。
    金寨县麻埠文化馆利用黑板报、土广播、幻灯等方式广泛地宣传春耕生产；还编写了推广高产作物“胜利百号”甘薯、马铃薯的山歌小调，印发到全区农业生产合作社、民校和业余剧团里演唱。各文化馆、站最近还组织农民收听了安徽省省长黄岩向全省人民播讲的“紧急动员起来，开展依靠合作互助，积极推行‘三改’（改变夏、秋两季收成比重，改种高产作物、耐水作物和耐旱作物，改变广种薄收的习惯）办法的大生产运动。”安徽省文化局出动的五十个流动电影放映队，正在各地农村巡回放映“丰收”等影片，从二月份到目前初步统计，观众已达二百万人。各地新华书店已把安徽农业“三改”及有关春耕生产参考书十三万册发行到农民手里。（新华社）
