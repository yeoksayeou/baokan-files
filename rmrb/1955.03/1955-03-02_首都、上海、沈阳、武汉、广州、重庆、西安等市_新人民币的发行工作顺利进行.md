Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: Around 8:00 AM on the 1st, more than 500 exchange stations in the capital began exchanging new RMB for citizens. People lined up and exchanged their money in order. Many workers from the Fengtai Bridge Factory went to the bank exchange station located at the factory to exchange their money right after finishing their night shift. At the construction site of the Department Store, a bricklayer named Shen Genyuan exchanged all of his savings of 300,000 old RMB for new RMB. After exchanging for the new currency, Gala Nema, a Tibetan resident of Yonghe Temple, repeatedly looked at the patterns and Tibetan characters on it. He said, "We ethnic minorities are respected everywhere. The new RMB even has our language on it. That's wonderful!" More than 1,500 activists from the residents' committees of Xuanwu District spent the whole day doing publicity and assisting with the exchange work at more than 30 exchange stations.

On this day, state-owned stores, cooperatives, and private stores all used the new currency for pricing to welcome customers, and market prices remained stable as usual. Large conversion tables of new and old currencies were posted at the entrances of various branches of the China Department Store Beijing Company and many stores. The prices of all tens of thousands of commodities in department stores and cooperatives, as well as 50 major commodities such as grain, non-staple food, and cotton cloth in the city, were exactly the same as the day before the order to issue the new currency was announced, and were sold according to the new-to-old currency ratio. All more than 500 private businesses in Dong'an Market marked the prices of their commodities in new currency at a converted rate and conducted business as usual. The wholesale and retail prices in all 16 vegetable markets in the city were also the same as on February 28th.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 1st: This morning, when the clock tower of the Shanghai Customs Building on the Bund struck nine, the gate of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China slowly opened, and the new RMB that the people of Shanghai had been waiting for many days began to be issued. Financial personnel from many factories, government agencies, public utilities, and commercial units successively entered the business department of the bank, as usual, to collect the cash they needed for production, commodity circulation, and daily needs. Through here—the business department of the branch, as well as more than 400 offices, sub-offices, business offices, and savings offices of the People's Bank in the city, the new RMB was transported to the city in bundles and packages.

The 119 exchange stations spread throughout the city also started operating this morning. Among them, there were special ones set up for the military, ethnic minorities, and foreigners, as well as a mobile exchange station in the aquatic area. People who exchanged for the new currency happily circulated it among themselves and talked about it as soon as they got it. Today, more than 30,000 people exchanged for new currency at the exchange stations. Many factories paid wages in new currency today.

Today, the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China on the Bund posted the exchange rate table with the new RMB as the standard. This new exchange rate table shows that the conversion ratio between the RMB and the currencies of various countries is still the same as before the issuance of the new currency. For example, yesterday the selling price of the pound was 69,270 old RMB per pound, and today it is 692.7 yuan per 100 pounds. The person in charge of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China told reporters: The reasonable exchange rate of the RMB against foreign currencies has greatly promoted Shanghai's export trade. Now, when state-owned companies or export merchants ship a batch of goods abroad, they can exchange the foreign exchange earned at a reasonable exchange rate for RMB and purchase export commodities in the domestic market. Last year, the total value of Shanghai's export commodities was more than 300% of that in 1936 before the war. Shanghai, the largest port of entry surplus in history, has now become a port of entry surplus.

[Our newspaper Shenyang dispatch, March 1st] The people of Liaoning Province love the new RMB. People in Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, and other places have been going to the exchange stations in an orderly manner from early in the morning to exchange for the new currency. Many people praised the new currency, saying that it is both easy to recognize and beautiful. In various exchange stations in Shenyang, people carefully looked at the new RMB they exchanged for and carefully put it in their wallets. Chen Shimei, a cadre from the Finance Section of the First Engineering Department of the Northeast Second Engineering Company, said after receiving the new currency: "When we did the final accounts last year, there were errors in the accounts, and it took a lot of time to check and clarify them; today, we are using the new currency, we must improve our business skills, shorten business time, and improve work efficiency." Li Fengwen, a boiler worker at Fushun Steel Plant, said after exchanging for the new currency: "The country's prices are becoming more and more stable, and money is becoming more and more useful. We must work hard and build our country well." Economic departments in various places have made full preparations before the issuance of the new currency. The employees of the Shenyang Municipal People's Bank exchanged an average of one transaction per minute, which is three times higher than the planned work efficiency.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 1st: Today, the citizens of Wuhan exchanged their old currency for new currency with joy. At 9:30 AM, more than 140 exchange stations throughout the city opened their doors to receive the exchange crowd. At this time, more than 20 mobile exchange teams and mobile exchange trucks decorated with colorful silk also set off to factories, construction sites, dike construction sites, and rural areas in the suburbs of the city. Today, more than 65,000 kinds of commodities in the city's shopping malls, shelves, and windows, with price cards and price tags marked in new and old currencies, aroused great interest among customers.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 1st: The new currency that the citizens of Guangzhou have been waiting for for eight days has finally started to be issued today. In Huangpu, Dongdi, Nandi, Changdi, Xindi, Xidi, Fangcun, Shamian, and other places, thousands of water residents paddled their small boats to exchange for new currency today. Their exchange amounts were not large, and the purpose was to take a look at the beautiful new currency. Today, some citizens received new currency from the change when they bought things in state-owned department stores and cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 1st: More than 170 exchange stations in Chongqing City were decorated with colorful flags and slogans today. Thousands of people exchanged the new currency into their hands in anticipation. Before liberation, Jiaochangkou in Chongqing was the largest financial speculation market. Today, in front of the exchange counter of the People's Bank Savings Office there, colorful flags fluttered and red lanterns hung high, and the exchange crowd was full of joy.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 1st: The issuance of the new RMB has brought a new atmosphere to the Xi'an market. Today, state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives distributed throughout the city have all used the new RMB to mark prices and sell goods. Private distribution and wholesale stores throughout the city also marked prices in new RMB according to state-owned prices. According to statistics from the Xi'an Municipal Commercial Management Department: Taking February 20th as the base period, today the wholesale price index of 47 major commodities such as flour, edible oil, coal, salt, and towels in the city is 99.99; the retail price index of 58 major commodities such as rice, flour, edible oil, soap, and pork is 99.82.

    首都、上海、沈阳、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等市
    新人民币的发行工作顺利进行
    据新华社一日讯：一日上午八时前后，首都五百多个兑换站开始向市民兑换新人民币了。兑换新币的人们排着队伍，顺序兑换。丰台桥梁工厂许多工人，刚下了夜班就到驻厂的银行兑换所去兑换新币。在百货大楼工地，瓦工沈根元把节余的三十万元旧币都换成了新币。雍和宫的藏族居民嘎拉呢玛换到新币后，反复地看着上面的图案和藏族文字。他说：“我们少数民族到处受到尊敬，新人民币上还有我们的文字，这多好啊！”宣武区各街道居民委员会的一千五百多个积极分子，整天都在三十多个兑换所里做宣传和协助兑换工作。
    这一天，国营商店、合作社和私营商店都以新币标价迎接顾客，市场物价稳定如常。中国百货公司北京市公司各门市部和许多商店的门口都贴着大幅的新旧币折算表。百货公司、合作社所有几万种商品和全市粮食、副食品、纱布等五十种主要商品的价格同发行新币的命令公布的前一天完全一样，只是依照新旧币比价折为新币计算出售。东安市场五百多家私营商户，今天一律在商品上折换了明码的新币标价，正常成交。全市十六个菜市场，批发和零售价格，也都和二月二十八日一样。
    据新华社上海一日电：今天清晨，上海黄浦滩海关大厦钟楼上时钟敲了九响的时候，中国人民银行上海市分行的大门徐徐开启，上海人民等待了好多天的新人民币开始发行了。许多工厂、机关、公用企业和商业单位的财务人员陆续进入银行的营业部，像往常一样，领取他们为了生产、为了商品流转和日常需用的现金。通过这里——分行营业部，以及人民银行设在全市的四百多个办事处、分理处、营业所、储蓄所，新的人民币被一捆捆、一包包地运往全市。
    遍布全市的一百十九个兑换所今天早上也开始活动。其中有专为部队、少数民族、外侨设立的，还有一个水上区流动兑换所。兑换新币的人们一拿到新票就高兴地相互传阅、交谈起来。今天有三万多人在兑换所兑了新币。许多工厂今天用新币发了工资。
    今天，上海外滩中国银行上海分行挂出了新人民币为标准的外汇牌价表。这个新的牌价表表明：人民币和各国货币的折合比率仍然和新币发行前一样。比如昨天英镑卖出价，每一英镑合旧人民币六万九千二百七十元，今天每一百英镑合新人民币六百九十二元七角。中国银行上海分行负责人对记者说：人民币对外币的合理的汇率，已大大促进了上海的出口贸易。现在国营公司或出口商人以一宗商品运出国外，卖得外汇后，可以按合理的汇价换取人民币，在国内市场购买出口商品。去年上海出口商品的总值相当于战前一九三六年的百分之三百以上。历史上最大的入超口岸——上海，现在已成了出超口岸了。
    【本报沈阳一日电】辽宁省人民热爱新人民币。沈阳、旅大、鞍山等地人民从清早起就有秩序地到兑换所兑换新币。许多群众赞美新币，说它既好认又美观。在沈阳各个兑换所里，人们仔细地端详着兑换到的新人民币，小心地把它放在钱袋里。东北第二工程公司第一工程处工地财务科的干部陈士美拿到新币以后说：“去年我们搞决算的时候，账目还出过差错，浪费了不少时间才查对清楚；今天使用新币了，我们要改进业务技术，缩短业务时间，提高工作效率。”抚顺钢厂锅炉工人李凤文换到新币以后说：“国家物价越来越稳定，钱也越来越顶用，我们一定要努力工作，好好地建设我们的国家。”各地经济部门在新币发行以前，都进行了充分的准备工作。沈阳市人民银行的职工平均一分钟兑换一笔款子，比预定的工作效率提高三倍。
    据新华社武汉一日电：武汉市民今天怀着喜悦的心情用旧币换得了新币。上午九时半，全市一百四十多处收兑站打开大门接待了兑换的人群。这时，二十多个流动收兑组和用彩绸装饰着的流动收兑卡车，也出发到工厂、建设工地、堤防工地和市郊农村去了。今天，武汉全市商场的货架、橱窗里六万五千多种商品，用新币和旧币标明的价目卡片和价签，引起顾客们很大兴趣。
    据新华社广州一日电：广州市民整整期待了八天的新币今天开始发行了。黄浦、东堤、南堤、长堤、新堤、西堤、芳村、沙面等处，今天有数千名水上居民划着小船去兑换新币，他们的兑换数目都不大，目的是在于看一看美丽的新币。今天有一部分市民在国营百货商店和合作社里买东西时，从找零钱中拿到了新币。
    据新华社重庆一日电：重庆市一百七十多个兑换站今天被彩旗和标语装饰一新。成千上万的人在期待中把新币兑到手里了。解放前，重庆较场口是最大的一个金融投机市场。今天那里的人民银行储蓄所兑换专柜前彩旗缤纷，红灯高挂，兑换的人群喜气洋洋。
    据新华社西安一日电：新人民币的发行，给西安市市场带来了新的气象。今天，分布在全市的国营公司和供销合作社，已全部用新人民币标出价格出售商品。全市私营的经销、批销店也都按照国营牌价，以新人民币标出价格。据西安市商业管理部门的统计：以二月二十日为基期，今天全市的面粉、食油、煤、盐、毛巾等四十七种主要商品批发价格指数为九九点九九；大米、面粉、食油、肥皂、猪肉等五十八种主要商品零售价格指数则为九九点八二。
