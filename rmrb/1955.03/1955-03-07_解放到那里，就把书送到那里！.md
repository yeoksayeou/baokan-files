"Wherever liberation reaches, books should be sent there!"

To meet the cultural needs of the troops guarding the front lines of Zhejiang's coast defense, the Haimen Branch of Xinhua Bookstore has specially dispatched salesmen Chen Shengou and Tong Chengzong to supply books to the troops stationed on various islands since July 1954. For more than half a year, they have frequently braved the sea winds and waves to deliver a large number of books to the troops stationed on various islands, which has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of officers and soldiers.

When they first arrived at the troops, the leaders, to take care of their fatigue, wanted them to supply books at a fixed location, and have each company send people to buy them. Chen Shengou and Tong Chengzong thought: The soldiers are either fighting, building fortifications, attending meetings or studying all day long. We are here to serve the troops, how can we make them run back and forth just to buy books? So the two of them carried the books on their backs and went to the companies, crossing mountains and ridges. When the comrades in the companies saw them coming from afar, they happily ran down the mountain to welcome them, vying to carry the books for them and usher them into the barracks. Some soldiers even busily moved their bedding away to make room on the bed to display the books.

In their work of supplying books, they often investigate and understand the needs of the officers and soldiers and purchase books according to their needs. Once, a cultural instructor told them that the company needed arithmetic textbooks very much, so they immediately transported a large package of textbooks there. The soldiers loved to read comic strips, so they purchased a large number of comic strips from brother branches and sent them to the island. Once, they went to a company where the officers and soldiers needed more than sixty copies of "Dedicate Everything to the Party." They only brought nineteen copies. Those who didn't get to buy them were very disappointed, saying: This book is so good, I want to read it again after reading it, and every time I read it, I feel like I've gained new strength. The soldiers' enthusiasm for learning from heroic figures deeply moved them. After selling the books, they disregarded their fatigue and rushed back to their residence that night, and the next morning, they climbed the mountain again to deliver the books. The soldiers gratefully held their hands and said: You are too good to us, we must intensify our studies and training to repay your warm concern.

For more than half a year, they have traveled almost all the islands on the front line of Zhejiang, delivering valuable cultural nourishment to every company. In the long-term contact, they have established a deep friendship with the officers and soldiers defending the islands. Many officers and soldiers correspond with them and exchange souvenirs. Many soldiers always visit them at the bookstore whenever they have the opportunity, which greatly encourages them. Tong Chengzong said: "We must ensure that wherever liberation reaches, books should be sent there!" They kept their promise: Shortly after the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, they sent books to the island. On the third morning after the liberation of Dachen Island, they brought more than 8,000 books and a large number of pictures and boarded the transport ship to Dachen Island. Now, they are preparing to transport books to Pishan Island and Yushan Islands.

    “解放到那里，就把书送到那里！”
    新华社记者　张济生
    为了满足守卫在浙江海防前线的部队的文化要求，从一九五四年七月起，新华书店海门支店专门派遣了营业员陈盛苟和童承宗，到各海岛部队进行书籍供应工作。半年多来，他们经常冒着海上风浪，把大量的书籍送到驻守在各个海岛的部队中去，受到广大指战员的热烈欢迎。
    当他们刚到部队的那一天，部队领导上为了照顾他们的疲劳，要他们固定在一个地方供应，让各个连队自己派人来买。陈盛苟和童承宗想：战士们一天到晚，不是战斗就是修工事，还要开会、学习，我们是来为部队服务的，还能让他们再为了买书来回奔跑吗？于是他俩就背起书籍，翻山越岭到连队里去。连队的同志们老远看到他们走来，都高兴得纷纷跑下山来迎接他们，抢着给他们背书，把他们拥进营房里。有些战士还忙着将自己的被褥搬开，把床位让出来摆书。
    他们在供应图书的工作中，经常调查了解指战员们的要求，根据需要采购图书。有一次，一个文化教员告诉他们连队里很需要算术课本，他们便马上运去一大包课本；战士们爱看连环画，他们就向兄弟支店采购了大批的连环画送到岛上去。有一次，他们到一个连队去，那里的指战员需要六十多本“把一切献给党”，他们只带去十九本，没买到的人很失望，说：这本书实在太好了，看了还想看，每看一次都好像增加了新的力量。战士们要求向英雄人物学习的热情，使他们十分感动。卖完了书以后，他们不顾疲劳，当晚赶回住处，第二天一早又翻山把书送去。战士们感激地拉着他们的手说：你们太好了，我们一定要加紧学习、锻炼，来回答你们的热情关怀。
    半年多来，他们几乎走遍了浙江最前线所有的海岛，把宝贵的文化食粮送到每一个连队。在长期的交往中，他们和防守海岛的部队指战员们建立了深厚的友谊，不少指战员和他们通信、互送纪念品。许多战士一有机会，总要到书店去看望他们，使他们受到很大鼓舞。童承宗说：“我们一定保证：解放到那里，就把书送到那里！”他们恪守了自己的诺言：在一江山岛解放后不久，他们就把书送到岛上去了；大陈岛解放的第三天上午，他们又带了八千多本书和大量画片，登上了到大陈岛去的交通船。现在，他们正准备把书运到披山岛和渔山列岛去。
