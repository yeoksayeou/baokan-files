The overhaul of No. 3 blast furnace at the Xinjiang Bayi Steel Plant was completed on February 15th, thirteen days ahead of schedule. This overhaul was carried out in the severe cold season, and the workers often operated in temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius. They said, "It doesn't matter if our hands and feet are cold, the quality of the overhaul comes first." On the morning of the 17th, the blast furnace produced the first batch of molten iron, and after inspection, the quality of the molten iron was fully up to standard.

The planned pig iron production of the Xinjiang Bayi Steel Plant this year has increased by 30.3 percent compared with the actual output last year. Among them, the planned output of foundry pig iron for casting agricultural tools and machine parts has increased by more than double that of last year. Due to the early start-up of the No. 3 blast furnace, a large number of foundry pig iron required by the South Xinjiang Agricultural Implement Factory, the Production and Construction Corps, and cooperatives in various places will be supplied in advance.

    新疆八一钢铁厂将增产生铁
    新疆八一钢铁厂第三号高炉的检修工作，已在二月十五日提前十三天完成。这次检修是在严寒的季节里施工的，工人们经常在零下二十度的气候中操作。他们说：“手冻脚冷没关系，检修质量是第一。”十七日早晨，高炉炼出第一炉铁水，经过检验，铁水质量完全合格。
    新疆八一钢铁厂今年生铁的计划产量比去年实际产量增加了百分之三十点三。其中铸造农具和机件的铸造生铁产量计划，比去年增加了一倍多。由于三号高炉的提前开炉，将提前供应南疆农具厂、生产建设部队以及各地合作社所需要的大批铸造生铁。
