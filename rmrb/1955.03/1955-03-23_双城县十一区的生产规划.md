Problems Raised

The Eleventh District of Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, borders the Songhua River to the north and the Lanling River to the west. The land is fertile and the resources are abundant. The district has fourteen administrative villages, with a total of 4,325 households, 14,684 hectares of land, 4,794 male laborers, 3,228 female laborers, and 3,263 horses and over 1,000 head of cattle for plowing.

From the autumn of 1954 to the present, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in this district has increased from ten to seventy-eight, and the number of households participating in the cooperatives has increased from 218 to 2,020, accounting for 46.7 percent of the total number of households.

The development of agricultural production cooperatives has brought new circumstances to rural production: productivity has increased, and existing production projects can no longer meet the needs of the development of cooperatives. This is prominently manifested in the fact that the potential of labor, livestock, and capital cannot be fully utilized.

Labor: According to the general situation in the first year of establishment, agricultural cooperatives can increase labor efficiency by 15 to 20 percent compared to mutual aid teams due to their ability to rationally organize labor. Male laborers in mutual aid teams worked about 150 days a year, while in cooperatives they work 200 to 230 days. The number and days of female participation in labor generally increases nearly doubled compared to mutual aid teams. At the same time, the use of new farm implements also saves some manpower. Putting these together, if calculated by cultivated land, according to the existing cultivation level in the area, each laborer in a mutual aid team can cultivate an average of 3 hectares of land, while each laborer in a cooperative can cultivate 4 to 4.5 hectares of land. However, at present, each laborer in the cooperatives in the district averages only 2.9 hectares of land, and more than 30 percent of the labor potential has not been utilized.

Livestock: With the same level of cultivation, an average horse in a mutual aid team can cultivate 4 hectares of land, while an average horse in a cooperative can cultivate 5 hectares of land. However, at present, each draft horse in the cooperatives in the district averages only 4.5 hectares of land, and there is still 10 percent of the draft horse potential, in addition, there are fifty to sixty head of cattle not factored in.

Capital: Due to the increased efficiency of the use of productive materials such as livestock and farm implements in the cooperatives, the existing productive materials such as livestock and farm implements of the members are basically sufficient, and some even have a surplus. This allows for a large amount of capital to be saved and invested in expanded reproduction. However, at present, the members are unwilling to invest in the cooperatives due to the lack of new production content. The members still have a considerable amount of capital in their hands. According to a survey of seven cooperatives in Wujia Village, 30 percent of the members have a surplus of over 60 million old currency. It is estimated that the surplus capital in the hands of the members in the seventy-eight cooperatives in the district is around 450 million old currency.

The above situation fully illustrates that with the great development of cooperation, it is necessary to reform agricultural technology accordingly and enrich the production content in a planned way. This requires the leading organs to make overall plans, make long-term plans, and lead agricultural cooperatives to develop production in a planned way. However, at present, the leadership of rural production is far from adapting to this new situation. First of all, there is a lack of a developmental perspective, insufficient understanding of the new situation, and the current production is still treated with the views of leading mutual aid teams and trial agricultural production cooperatives. Secondly, there is a lack of overall planning and long-term plans. They are only busy with the present, ignoring the future, and looking at problems in isolation from the perspective of one cooperative or one village, without long-term construction goals. Therefore, the current production and long-term construction, this year's and next year's, and the production and construction of the previous quarter and the next quarter cannot be closely linked. Thirdly, there is insufficient awareness of the new change from individual operation to cooperative operation in the responsibility of operation and production after the transition from teams to cooperatives, and they have not deeply entered the production process of the cooperatives to specifically lead the economic activities of the cooperatives.

These new situations and new problems require us to solve them seriously.

Trial Implementation of Production Planning Centered on Cooperation

In order to solve the above problems, the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shuangcheng County Committee organized a joint working group to try out production planning centered on cooperation in the Eleventh District of Shuangcheng County in coordination with the district committee.

The main content of the plan includes four aspects. First, find the key to increasing production, first increase the yield per unit area, and then develop resources. Second, in order to rationally utilize resources, conduct unified zoning based on the production conditions of each village to determine which villages should focus on which key to increasing production, which productions should be developed, and which wastelands, pastures, water conservancy, forest lands, and fish ponds should be reclaimed and operated by which villages. Third, based on the requirements of national construction and the development plan of mutual aid and cooperation, formulate a one-year and three-year production and construction plan for the district and the village. Fourth, formulate the main measures to ensure the realization of the plan and the current specific action plan. The mutual aid and cooperation development plan has already been planned once before, and this plan is an agricultural production plan centered on cooperation.

The county first formulated a preliminary draft plan for the entire county based on existing materials, and the district formulated a production plan for the district based on the county's preliminary plan. The production plan for the Eleventh District was carried out in the form of a mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting. The participants included the Communist Party branch secretaries of each village, village chiefs, directors of agricultural production cooperatives, some members of the cooperative management committee, and leaders of mutual aid teams. At the meeting, they first exchanged experience in running the cooperatives, inspected the work of the cooperatives, and studied the four standards for running the cooperatives well. This improved socialist consciousness and the enthusiasm for running the cooperatives, and provided ideological motivation for carrying out production planning centered on cooperation. Then, the county's draft plan (mainly the Eleventh District part) was conveyed, and a full discussion was launched.

In the discussion on increasing the yield per unit area, the experience in increasing production created by various cooperatives was exchanged in more than 20 items, including the use of new farm implements, the reform of cultivation methods, the introduction of superior seeds, the application of more fertilizer, and the prevention and control of natural disasters. Among them, the production increase achieved by using new animal-powered farm implements was the most prominent. The Languohuan Cooperative used animal-powered farm implements to sow 25 hectares of superior wheat, with an average yield of 2,900 jin per hectare, which was 900 jin more than the average mutual aid team in the area. Wind and flood disasters are an important reason for the reduction of production in the area. If a sluice gate is built in Shiligouzi, more than 2,000 hectares of land in six villages in the district can be exempted from the flooding of the river. More than 2,000 hectares of land in the district are attacked by wind disasters every year, and it is estimated that at least 1,500 shi of grain will be reduced. If a 40-li shelterbelt is planted along the river dike, the threat of wind disasters will gradually be reduced after a few years. In order to improve the quality of manure fertilizer, each cooperative has expressed its willingness to establish manure pits and set up special personnel to accumulate fertilizer.

After discussing the reclamation and expansion of cultivated land, everyone's horizons were opened, and their enthusiasm for land reclamation was increased. A joint land reclamation plan was formulated on the spot, and more than 750 hectares of reclaimable land were found in the district. In order to rationally utilize the wasteland, more than 200 hectares of wasteland were adjusted between villages.

When studying the development of animal husbandry, more than 1,000 hectares of grassland were found in the district, and the produced tooth grass and sheep grass are the best livestock feed. In this way, more than 1,500 hectares of pasture were found, which can graze more than 3,000 livestock (currently, there are only 1,500 livestock in the district). In order to rationally utilize the pasture, reasonable adjustments were also made.

When discussing fish farming, a total of six places were found at the meeting where fish can be raised, four of which are jointly operated by the village, and two of which are determined to be jointly operated by two villages. The natural conditions of these fish farms are very good, and they are all deep-water ponds connected to the river. As long as a gate is built and natural fish fry from the river are used, each pond can raise tens of thousands of fish, which does not require a lot of cost.

When discussing afforestation, everyone was very supportive of building field protection forests and dike protection forests. The meeting specifically determined which section of the field protection forest and dike protection forest should be built by which village, and the economic forest area was also zoned. However, at the beginning, everyone thought that the economic forest would take a long time to benefit, and they were not very interested. After calculating the detailed accounts and conducting long-term construction education, it was decided to plant willow branches and poplar trees with quick returns first, and plant less elm trees.

After full discussion, not only was the production planning plan of the district initially formulated at the meeting, but also the production planning draft of the village was initially formulated to facilitate the organization of mass discussions.

Production Plan of Wujia Village

The production plan of Wujia Village is mainly carried out under the leadership of the branch and relying on the cooperatives to drive the vast number of farmers. In order to better carry out the production planning work of the village, the district also held a party member congress of the whole district to summarize the work of cooperation and grain purchase, and at the same time mobilized for production planning.

After the backbone members of the cooperatives and teams who participated in the district representative meeting returned to the village, they brewed among the members of the cooperatives and teams. With the assistance of county and district cadres, the branch organized mass discussions in the form of large-scale communication and sub-cooperative group discussions. First, they led the masses to study the cooperative charter, and then communicated the district's planning plan (mainly the part of the village) and began to find ways to increase production and tap resource potential. After the masses were mobilized, they took the initiative to request the county and district to send technicians to help the village survey resources. The experienced farmers and technicians in the village organized a survey team to conduct on-the-spot surveys and research on the resource situation of wasteland, pasture, fish ponds, forest land, etc. in the village's economic zone. It was initially confirmed that the use of Lanling River water could turn about 400 hectares of dry land into paddy fields, which does not require a lot of engineering. There are more than 60 hectares of reclaimable land, exceeding the district's estimate of 20 hectares.

The branch mobilized cooperatives and teams to formulate production and construction plans. Larger basic construction is jointly planned by the whole village. For example, there are two fish ponds, which are planned to be jointly constructed by the whole village and will start construction after the ice melts. Fish fry will be harvested from the river by the fishing teams of each cooperative. It is planned to raise 50,000 carp, grass carp, crucian carp, etc., which can produce 150,000 jin of fish every year after three years, worth about 400 million old currency. The seven cooperatives in the village voluntarily invested 10 million old currency to buy a waterwheel and dig a water diversion pool. In 1955, they will first try to plant 10 hectares and 5 mu of paddy fields. After three years, when there are better conditions, the whole village will build a large water conservancy project to develop paddy fields on a large scale. Production and construction that can be carried out independently are planned separately by cooperatives and teams. For example, for land reclamation, after the whole village determines the land reclamation address of each cooperative and team, each cooperative and team plans and implements it by itself. The three better cooperatives have all formulated one-year and three-year construction plans, and the two mutual aid teams have also formulated an annual production plan. Through the masses' formulation of production and construction plans, production potential has been further tapped. The village's four sets of new farm implements were originally planned to sow an average of 30 hectares per set. This time, the joint use was studied, and the livestock was fully utilized. Each set can sow 40 hectares.

Combined with the formulation of production and construction plans, the cooperatives and mutual aid teams were rectified. In order to enrich the new production content, old and weak laborers and female laborers who were excluded from the cooperatives were absorbed, and some draft horses were also absorbed. When formulating the financial plan, the production investment problems of each cooperative were solved; when studying the development of animal husbandry, the phenomenon that the cooperative excluded mares, which affected the reproduction of horses, was corrected. Finally, when arranging the current production, the new cooperative was helped to initially establish a labor organization, so that production was on the right track. At the same time, through organizing production and construction with cooperatives leading teams, the original cooperative planning was further enriched and consolidated. For example, the Cong Xiyou mutual aid team has signed a contract with the Ma Fu'en Cooperative, and will definitely merge into the cooperative after the autumn. The Zhang Xueming mutual aid team has dispersed and joined the other three cooperatives, and the targets have been determined. By then, all farmers in the village will join the agricultural production cooperative. According to the requirements of the production and construction plan, the whole village has formulated the current production plan and is actively acting.

Comprehensive Village Plans and Formulation of District-Wide Production Plan

Through the bottom-up mobilization, the district's production planning centered on cooperation and long-term construction was further enriched and enriched. For example, in terms of resource potential, 1,800 hectares of paddy fields can be developed by using the Songhua River and Lanling River water, which is a new content that was not originally thought of at all; the district can reclaim 1,000 hectares of land, which is 250 hectares more than the district's original number; the grasslands and pastures found by each village total 2,900 hectares, which is 400 hectares more than the district's original number; there are 8 fish ponds in the district, which is 2 more than the district's original number; the district plans to afforest 900 hectares of land, which is 800 hectares more than the district's original number. After the discussions in each village, the village and the village adjusted more than 300 hectares of wasteland (including those given to other districts), more than 400 hectares of pasture, and 3 fish ponds, and at the same time, appropriate arrangements were also made between the cooperatives and teams in the village.

According to the general indicators of the district's production plan: this year's total grain output will reach 22,256 tons, an increase of 11.1 percent compared to last year; by 1957, the total grain output will reach 27,665 tons, an increase of 7,674 tons compared to 1954, which is an increase of 38 percent. In terms of developing animal husbandry, horses: this year's plan is to increase from last year's 3,932 to 4,245; by 1957, the plan is to increase to 5,379. Cattle: this year's plan is to increase from last year's 1,082 to 1,245; by 1957, the plan is to increase to 1,817. Pigs: this year's plan is to increase from last year's 3,774 to 9,716; by 1957, the plan is to increase to 18,411. In addition, in the next three years, forestry and fish farming will have considerable development.

The realization of the above plan will more powerfully support the country's industrial construction. By 1957, the district will be able to sell 12,000 tons of commodity grain to the state (excluding agricultural tax), which is more than 60 percent more than the current grain sales. At the same time, the average income of each member can be increased to about 400 yuan (currently more than 250 yuan).

The production plan also pointed out that the realization of the above production and construction plan must rely on the development of the rural cooperative cause. According to the agricultural cooperation plan of each village, the district will concentrate its efforts this year to run the existing 78 agricultural cooperatives well, and at the same time cultivate 38 mutual aid teams that are preparing to establish cooperatives this fall, and prepare to expand the existing 55 cooperatives (it has now been specifically drafted: which cooperative will absorb which members of the mutual aid teams). In 1956, the plan is to increase the number of cooperatives in the district to 116, and the number of households participating in the cooperatives will account for about 75 percent of the total number of households in the district. By 1957, the number of cooperatives will increase to 122, and the number of households participating in the cooperatives will account for about 90 percent of the total number of households.

Secondly, it is necessary to develop supply and marketing and credit cooperation in corresponding way. The existing five supply and marketing cooperatives are still appropriately distributed. The current problem is mainly to improve quality and develop business. In terms of credit cooperation, there are currently three credit cooperatives and four credit departments, with a total share capital of 6,000 yuan, and members accounting for 50 percent of the total number of households. This year, the main task is to do a good job of consolidation and establish prestige. In 1956, the plan is to merge the credit cooperation organizations in the district into five credit cooperatives, expand the share capital to more than 10,000 yuan, and members account for 70 percent of the total number of households. In 1957, the number of cooperatives will not be developed, mainly to expand business.

In order to realize the production plan, technical guidance must also be strengthened. Therefore, it was decided to improve the work of the existing technical promotion stations, breeding stations, and livestock epidemic prevention stations; add technicians for paddy fields, fish farming, animal husbandry, and forestry to the technical promotion stations, and at the same time help agricultural production cooperatives train specialized technicians in various aspects.

After the Trial Implementation of Production Planning

Through production planning, production potential has been widely tapped, and the direction of production development has been specifically pointed out to cooperatives and the broad masses of farmers, overcoming the ideas of "no way out for production" and "reaching the top of production increase" that are common among farmers. The farmers generally felt: "The prospects are bright" and "I feel bright in my heart," and their enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved.

Production planning has consolidated and promoted the cooperative movement. First of all, it has enriched the new production content of the cooperatives, so that cooperation and technical reform are combined to expand production, overcoming the phenomenon of wasting labor and livestock, so that members are more guaranteed to increase income. For example, the production plan of the Languohuan Cooperative this year stipulates that the output will increase by 30 to 50 percent compared to last year. Production planning has made the members and the broad masses of farmers see the bright prospects of rural cooperation and established the idea of relying on cooperatives to create a happy life. Before the planning of Aiguo Village, many members did not care about the cooperative's production and were unwilling to invest in the cooperative. After the planning, five cooperatives voluntarily invested 10 million old currency to develop paddy fields. Secondly, through production planning, new cooperatives can be helped to formulate production and construction plans, establish labor organizations, and financial systems, so that the production of new cooperatives begins to move on the right track. Finally, through production planning, the relationship between cooperatives and teams is closer, making cooperatives the core of uniting mutual aid teams and individual farmers. Cooperatives and teams jointly reclaim land, jointly use new farm implements, and jointly raise fish. This combines all farmers from an economic relationship.

Through production planning, the country's five-year construction plan is specifically deployed to the villages, so that the development of agricultural production is further linked to the country's industrial construction. Overcame the blind development trend of some cooperatives.

The sense of responsibility and work initiative of district and village cadres have been improved. They generally reflected: "There is something to work for, and I am happy to work." The wife of the Wanlong Village branch secretary complained that he did not rest during the Spring Festival, and he said: "Production planning is a major event, and the Spring Festival is a minor event!" The Wujia Village branch secretary said: "This time I know what to do when I get there; before, the district arranged to do something, and I would push it and move it."

Production planning has enriched the content of spring ploughing and production, and vigorously promoted spring ploughing and production. Some said: "This year's spring ploughing is really promising." Some said: "I really have to work hard!" Picking up manure, digging manure, sending manure, and exchanging seeds are all actively acting.

    双城县十一区的生产规划
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部  中共双城县委  联合工作组
    问题的提出
    黑龙江省双城县十一区北靠松花江，西靠兰陵河，土地肥沃，资源丰富。全区十四个行政村，共有农户四千三百二十五户，土地一万四千六百八十四垧，男劳力四千七百九十四名，女劳力三千二百二十八名，耕畜：马三千二百六十三匹，牛一千多头。
    从一九五四年秋天到现在，这个区的农业生产合作社已由十个发展到七十八个，入社农户已由二百一十八户增加到二千零二十户，占总农户百分之四十六点七。
    农业生产合作社的发展，给农村生产带来了新的情况：生产能力提高了，现有的生产项目已满足不了合作社发展生产的要求。这突出地表现在：劳力、畜力和资金潜力不能充分发挥。
    劳动力：根据建社头一年的一般情况，由于合作社能够合理组织劳动，劳动效率可以比互助组提高百分之十五到二十。男劳动力在互助组时一年劳动一百五十天左右，在合作社劳动二百天到二百三十天。妇女参加劳动的人数和天数一般比在互助组时增多将近一倍。同时使用新农具也节省了一些人力。这些集中起来，如果以耕种土地计算，根据当地现有耕种水平，互助组的每个劳动力平均可种三垧地，合作社每个劳动力可种四垧地到四垧半地。但现在全区合作社平均每个劳动力只担负二垧九亩地，还有百分之三十以上的劳动潜力没有发挥。
    畜力：同样的耕种水平，互助组平均每匹马可耕种四垧地，合作社平均每匹马可耕种五垧地。但现在全区合作社平均每匹耕马只担负四垧半地，还有百分之十的耕马潜力，另外，还有五、六十头耕牛没有计算在内。
    资金：由于合作社对畜力、农具等生产资料运用效率提高了，社员现有的畜力和农具等主要生产资料已基本够用，有的甚至有余，这样就可以节省出很大一批资金投入扩大再生产。但目前由于合作社缺乏新的生产内容，社员也不愿向社投资。目前社员手中还有相当数量的资金。据调查吴家村七个社百分之三十社员手中就有余资旧币六千多万元，全区七十八个社，估计社员手中的余资可有旧币四亿五千万元左右。
    上述情况充分说明，随着合作化的大发展，必须相应地改革农业技术和有计划地充实生产内容。而这就要求领导机关通盘筹划，做长远打算，有计划地领导农业社发展生产。但目前对农村生产的领导，还远不能适应这个新情况。首先，缺乏发展观点，对新情况认识不足，仍以领导互助组和试办农业生产合作社的观点对待当前生产。其次，缺乏通盘筹划和长远打算。只忙眼前，不顾将来，从一社一村出发孤立地看问题，没有长远建设目标。因此就不能把当前生产和长远建设，本年度的和下年度的，上季度的和下季度的生产建设紧密地联系起来。再次，对由组转社后，经营生产的责任已由个体经营转到合作经营这个新的变化认识不足，没有深入到合作社的生产过程中去，具体领导合作社的经济活动。
    这些新的情况和新的问题，要求我们认真解决。
    试行以合作化为中心的生产规划
    为了解决上述问题，中共黑龙江省委农村工作部和双城县委组织了联合工作组，在双城县十一区协同区委试行了以合作化为中心的生产规划。
    规划内容主要包括四个方面。第一、找增产关键，首先增加单位面积产量，其次是开发资源。第二、为了合理地利用资源，根据各村的生产条件进行统一的区划，确定哪些村抓住哪些增产的关键，发展哪些生产，哪些荒地、牧场、水利、林地、鱼池由哪些村去开垦、经营。第三、根据国家建设要求和互助合作发展计划，订出本区本村一年的和今后三年的生产建设计划。第四、订出保证实现计划的主要措施和当前的具体行动方案。互助合作的发展计划，已经在这以前进行过一次规划，这次规划是以合作化为中心的农业生产规划。
    县里首先根据已有材料制订了全县的初步规划草案，区根据县的初步规划方案，订出区的生产规划。十一区的生产规划，是通过互助合作代表会议的形式进行的。参加会的人员，包括各村的中共支部书记、村长、农业生产合作社主任和部分社务管理委员、互助组长等。会上首先交流办社经验，检查社的工作，学习了办好社的四条标准。这样提高了社会主义觉悟和办社的积极性，给进行以合作化为中心的生产规划提供了思想动力。接着传达县的规划草案（主要是十一区部分），展开充分的讨论。
    在讨论提高单位面积产量时，交流各社创造的增产经验不下二十多项，包括采用新式农具、改革耕作方法、引种优良种籽、增施肥料、防治自然灾害等各个方面，其中采用新式畜力农具的增产成绩最为突出。蓝国焕社用马拉农具播种二十五垧优种小麦，每垧平均产二千九百斤，较当地一般互助组多产九百斤。风灾、水灾威胁是当地减产的一个重要原因。如果在十里沟子修一道水闸就可使全区六个村的两千多垧地免除江水泛滥。全区有二千多垧地年年受风灾的袭击，估计至少要减产一千五百多石粮食。如果能沿江堤植四十里防护林带，几年后就可使风灾威胁逐渐减轻。为了提高粪肥质量，各社都表示要建立沤粪坑和设专人积肥。
    在讨论开荒扩大耕地面积后，才打开了大家的眼界，提高了大家垦荒的积极性，当场订出了联合开荒计划，全区共找到七百五十多垧可垦荒地。为了合理利用荒地，村和村之间调整了二百多垧荒地。
    在研究发展牧畜业时，全区共找到一千多垧草场，出产的牙草和羊草都是最好的牲畜饲料。这样就找到了一千五百多垧牧场，共可放牧三千多头牲畜（目前全区牧畜还不过一千五百头）。为了合理利用牧场，也进行了合理调剂。
    在讨论养鱼时，会上共找出六处可以养鱼的地方，有四处由村共同经营，有两处确定由两个村联合经营。这些鱼场的自然条件非常好，都是通江的深水泡子，只要修起一道闸门，用江内自然鱼苗，每池即可养成万条鱼，不需要很大成本。
    在讨论造林时，大家对营造护田林和护堤林都非常拥护。会上具体地确定了哪段护田林和护堤林，由哪个村负责营造，对经济林区也进行了区划。但开始时大家认为造经济林收益慢，兴趣不大，后经算细账和进行长远建设教育，决定先种收益快的柳条子和杨树，少种榆树。
    经过充分讨论，在会上不但初步订出了区的生产规划方案，而且帮助各村初步订出了村的生产规划草案，以便组织群众讨论。
      吴家村的生产规划
    吴家村的生产规划主要是在支部领导下，依靠合作社带动广大农民进行的。为了更好地进行村的生产规划工作，区还召开了全区党员大会，总结合作化和购粮工作，同时对生产规划也进行了动员。
    吴家村参加区代表会的社、组骨干分子回村后，便在社员、组员中酝酿，支部在县、区干部协助下，采取大会传达、分社组座谈的方式组织群众讨论。首先领导群众学习社章，然后便传达区的规划方案（主要是本村部分），便开始找增产窍门、挖资源潜力。群众发动起来以后，主动要求县、区派技术员来帮助本村勘察资源。由村里有经验的农民和技术员组织了勘察组，对本村经济区划内的荒地、牧场、鱼池、林地等资源情况，进行实地勘察和研究。初步证实，利用兰陵河水可以把四百垧左右的旱田改变成水田，并不需要很大工程。可垦荒地六十多垧，超过区估计数二十垧。
    支部发动社、组订出了生产建设计划。较大的基本建设全村共同计划进行。例如有两处鱼池，计划由全村共同建设，解冻后就动工。鱼苗由各社打鱼小组从江里捞取，计划养鲤鱼、草根鱼、鲫鱼等五万尾，三年后每年可产十五万斤鱼，价值旧币四亿元左右。全村七个社，自愿联合投资旧币一千万元，买一台水车，挖一个引水池，一九五五年先试种十垧零五亩水田，待三年后，有了更好的条件时，再由全村兴修大的水利工程，大量发展水田。可以单独进行的生产建设，由社、组分别计划进行。如开荒，全村确定各社、组开荒地址后，由各社、组自己计划进行。三个较好的社，都订了一年的和三年的建设计划，两个互助组也订了一个年度的生产计划。通过群众订生产和建设计划，进一步挖掘了生产潜力。全村四套新农具，原计划平均每套播种三十垧，这次研究联合使用，充分运用牧畜，每套可种四十垧。
    结合订生产建设计划，对合作社和互助组进行了整顿。为充实新的生产内容，吸收了排斥在社外的老弱劳动力、妇女劳动力，还吸收了一部分耕马。订财务计划的时候，解决了各社的生产投资问题；研究发展牧畜业时，顺便纠正了合作社排斥母马因而影响马的繁殖的现象。最后，在安排当前生产时，帮助新社初步建立了劳动组织，使生产走上了轨道。同时通过组织以社带组的生产建设，进一步充实和巩固了原来的合作化规划。如丛希有互助组已和马福恩社订好合同，秋后一定并入社里。张学明互助组分散加入到另外三个社里，已确定了对象。到时全村农户将全部加入农业生产合作社。根据生产建设计划的要求，全村都订了当前生产计划，并且积极行动起来。
    综合各村计划，制定全区的生产规划
    经过自下而上的发动，更加充实和丰富了区的以合作化为中心的生产规划和长期建设。例如在资源潜力方面，利用松花江和兰陵河水，可开发水田一千八百垧，这是原来根本没想到的新内容；全区可垦荒地一千垧，比区原定数字多二百五十垧；各村找到的草场和牧场共二千九百垧，比区原定数字多四百垧；全区有鱼池八处，比区原定数字多两处；全区计划造林地九百垧，比区原定数字多八百垧。经过各村讨论结果，村和村调整了荒地三百多垧（包括给外区的）、牧草场四百多垧、鱼池三处，同时村内社、组之间也进行了适当的安排。
    按照全区的生产规划的大致指标：今年粮食总产量将达到二万二千二百五十六吨，比去年提高百分之十一点一；到一九五七年，粮食总产量将达到二万七千六百六十五吨，比一九五四年增加七千六百七十四吨，即增加了百分之三十八。在发展牧畜业方面，马：今年计划由去年的三千九百三十二匹增加到四千二百四十五匹；到一九五七年，计划增加到五千三百七十九匹。牛：今年计划由去年的一千零八十二头增加到一千二百四十五头；到一九五七年，计划增加到一千八百一十七头。猪：今年计划由去年的三千七百七十四口增加到九千七百一十六口；到一九五七年，计划增加到一万八千四百一十一口。另外，在今后的三年中间，林业、养鱼业都有相当的发展。
    上述计划的实现，将更有力地支援国家工业建设。到一九五七年，全区将可以卖给国家一万二千吨商品粮（不包括农业税），超过现在卖粮数百分之六十。同时平均每个社员的收入可增加到四百元左右（现在二百五十余元）。
    在生产规划中还指出：上述生产建设计划的实现，必须依靠农村合作化事业的发展。根据各村的农业合作化的规划，全区今年将集中力量办好现有的七十八个农业社，同时培养好三十八个准备今秋建社的互助组，并准备扩大现有的五十五个社（现已具体拟定：哪个社吸收哪一些互助组的组员）。一九五六年计划全区社数增加到一百一十六个，参加社的农户将占全区总农户的百分之七十五左右，到一九五七年社数将增加到一百二十二个，入社农户将占总农户的百分之九十左右。
    其次，要相应地发展供销、信用合作事业。现在五个供销合作社分布还适当，现在的问题主要是提高质量，发展业务。信用合作方面，现有三个信用社，四个信用部，股金共有六千元，社员占总农户百分之五十，今年主要是作好巩固工作，建立威信。一九五六年计划将全区信用合作组织合并为五个信用合作社，股金扩大到一万余元，社员占总农户的百分之七十。一九五七年社数不发展，主要是扩展业务。
    为了实现生产规划，还必须加强技术指导。因此决定改进现有的技术推广站、配种站、牧畜防疫站的工作；在技术推广站内增设水田、养鱼、牧畜、林业等技术员，同时帮助农业生产合作社培养各方面的专门技术员。
    试行生产规划以后
    通过生产规划，广泛挖掘了生产潜力，给合作社和广大农民群众具体地指出了发展生产的方向，克服了在农民中间普遍存在的“生产没出路”“增产到顶”的思想，农民们普遍感到：“前景美满”“心里亮堂”，生产积极性大大提高。
    生产规划巩固和推动了合作化运动。首先，它给合作社充实了新的生产内容，使合作化和改革技术扩大生产结合了起来，克服了浪费劳力、畜力的现象，使社员增加收入更有保证。如蓝国焕社今年的生产计划规定：产量比去年增加百分之三十到五十。生产规划使社员和广大农民看到农村合作化的美好前景，树立了依靠合作社创造幸福生活的思想。爱国村规划前有很多社员对社生产不关心，不愿向社投资，规划后五个社自愿联合投资旧币一千万元开发水田。其次，通过生产规划可以帮助新社订出生产建设计划、建立劳动组织、财务制度，使新社生产开始走向正轨。最后，通过生产规划，密切了社、组的关系，使合作社成为团结互助组和个体农民的核心。社组联合开荒，联合使用新农具，联合养鱼等，这就从经济关系上把全体农民结合了起来。
    通过生产规划，把国家的五年建设计划具体地布置到村，使农业生产的发展和国家工业建设进一步联系起来了。克服了一部分社的盲目发展倾向。
    区村干部的事业心和工作主动性提高了。他们普遍反映：“工作有奔头，干的高兴。”万隆村支部书记老婆埋怨他过春节也不休息，他说：“生产规划是大事，过春节是小事！”吴家村支部书记说：
  “这回到时该怎干自己就知道了；以前是区里布置点干点，推一下动一下。”
    生产规划充实了备耕生产内容，有力的推动了备耕生产。有的说：“今年备耕真有搞头。”有的说：“真得紧点干哪！”拣粪、刨粪、送粪，串换籽种都积极行动起来了。
