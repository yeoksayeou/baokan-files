    Resolute Fighting Spirit
    Tang Di
    Revolutionary disabled soldier Jin Minglie was originally an ordinary farmer from Jilin Province in Northeast China. During the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, he bravely and voluntarily joined the Chinese People's Volunteers. He was seriously wounded in combat and lost his eyesight. However, as a Communist Party member, he did not lose his strong revolutionary fighting will because of his disability. After returning to his hometown, with the help of the Party, he joined the local agricultural production cooperative and actively engaged in agricultural production. We can imagine the great difficulties this blind man encountered when he tilled the fields with a hoe and planted crops step by step. However, Jin Minglie relied on the tenacious fighting willpower of a Communist Party member to overcome all difficulties, learned farming techniques, and became a skilled agricultural laborer.
    Jin Minglie is a revolutionary disabled soldier who gloriously shed blood on the front lines of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. He could have relied on the state's preferential treatment to maintain his livelihood without having to engage in heavy physical labor. However, Jin Minglie felt that since he had not completely lost his ability to work and could still do something for the Party and the people, he must contribute his share of ability and was unwilling to sit back and enjoy the fruits of others' labor. Jin Minglie's noble behavior is the most valuable quality of a Communist Party member.
    Jin Minglie's tireless and tenacious spirit of learning is also worthy of everyone's emulation. In the years after Jin Minglie was injured and disabled, he never interrupted his studies because of the great physical and mental pain; instead, he studied even harder, drawing spiritual strength from his studies to overcome his pain. He studied the Party's policies and guidelines, and current affairs. He cared about all the new things around him. Although learning was much more difficult for him than for ordinary comrades, he was not discouraged and sought all opportunities for assistance, humbly asking everyone for advice. Because of his persistent study, his vision broadened and his spiritual life became richer.
    In the growth of Jin Minglie's heroic deeds, we see how the Party cares for this loyal son. When he was unfortunately injured and disabled, the Party organization in the hospital gave him strong support; when he returned to the countryside, the local Party branch gave him various encouragements and assistance, helping him with his studies and his life. What is particularly moving is that his wife, Comrade Tong Zhenshu, a Communist Party member, cherished and cared for him with sincere affection, and helped him with production and study. This new family relationship, this new relationship between people, could only emerge under the guidance of the Party. A person like Jin Minglie, who has lost his eyesight, can only become a tenacious fighter in a big family like the Communist Party.
    Jin Minglie's exemplary deeds are not only worthy of emulation by revolutionary disabled soldiers; they are also a model for Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres to learn from. On the road of life and struggle, difficulties always coexist with victories. Learning from Jin Minglie's fighting spirit will enable us to overcome difficulties with confidence and achieve greater victories!

    顽强的战斗精神
    唐棣
    革命残废军人金明烈原来是东北吉林省的一个普通农民，在抗美援朝斗争的时候，他英勇地自动参加了中国人民志愿军，在作战中负了重伤，双目失明。但是他是一个共产党员，没有因为成了残废而丧失了坚强的革命的战斗意志。他回到家乡后，在党的帮助下，参加了当地的农业生产合作社，积极从事农业生产。我们可以想像，当这个双目失明的人，在田野里一锄一锹地耕作着；一步步地摸着向前栽种庄稼的时候，他会碰到多么大的困难，然而金明烈依靠一个共产党员的顽强斗争毅力，克服了一切困难，学会了耕作技术，使自己成了一个熟练的农业劳动者。
    金明烈是在抗美援朝战线上光荣地流过血的革命残废军人，本来他可以靠国家对他的优待照顾来维持生活，而不再需要从事繁重的体力劳动。但是，金明烈觉得自己既然还没有完全丧失劳动的能力，还能为党和人民作一点工作，他就一定要把自己的一份能力贡献出来，而不愿坐享其成。金明烈这种高尚的行为，正是共产党员最可贵的品德。
    金明烈不倦地顽强学习的精神也是值得大家学习的。在金明烈负伤残废以后的几年里，他没有因为身体和精神上的巨大痛苦而间断过学习；反而更加努力学习，从学习中汲取战胜痛苦的精神力量。他学习党的政策方针，学习时事政治，他关心周围一切新的事物。虽然，学习对于他要比一般的同志困难得多，但是他毫不气馁，争取一切的机会求得援助，虚心向一切人请教。由于他坚持不懈地学习，就使他的眼光扩大了，精神生活充实了。
    在金明烈的英雄行为的成长中，我们看到党是怎样地关怀这个忠实儿子的。当他不幸负伤残废的时候，医院中的党组织给了他有力的支持；当他回到农村以后，当地的党的支部便给他各种鼓励和帮助，帮助他学习、帮助他生活。特别使人感动的是他的妻子、共产党员童贞淑同志，以真挚的感情爱护他、体贴他，帮助他进行生产和学习。这种新的家庭关系、这种新的人与人之间的关系，只有在党的教导下才可能出现。像金明烈这样失去双目的人，也只有在共产党这样的大家庭里才能成为一个顽强战斗的人。
    金明烈的模范事迹，不仅值得革命残废军人学习；同时也是共产党员、革命干部学习的榜样。在生活斗争的道路上，困难总是随同着胜利同时存在的，学习了金明烈般的战斗精神，就能使我们满怀信心地去战胜困难，获得更大的胜利！
