    (I) Resolutely Oppose the American Conspiracy to Abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea
    On March 3, the U.S. government, in a memorandum to Sweden and Switzerland, expressed its intention to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, disregarding the provisions of the Armistice Agreement.
    On March 5, according to a broadcast by Australian radio, U.S. government officials publicly clamored, stating that the U.S. would increase its military strength in Korea, regardless of the restrictions of the Armistice Agreement.
    The close connection between these two events is obvious. It is precisely because the United States is eager to increase its military strength in Korea on a large scale, regardless of the Korean Armistice Agreement, that it has to openly bring out the destructive means it has always tried to conceal, and resolutely announce its advocacy of destroying the relevant clauses of the Armistice Agreement, abolishing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, so that its plan to massively increase its military strength in South Korea will not be hindered. This is a new development in the consistent obstruction and sabotage activities of the American aggressive bloc, aimed at undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement, escalating tensions in the Far East, in order to prepare for a new war.
    In order to cover up its new destructive activities, the U.S. government, in its memorandum to Sweden and Switzerland, even attempted to shift the responsibility for obstructing and undermining the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to the Korean-Chinese side by using its usual means of fabricating rumors and slanders. This is completely futile.
    Since the Korean Armistice in July 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, established in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, has played a positive role in supervising the implementation of the armistice. The Korean-Chinese side has consistently provided full cooperation and support to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, because on the one hand, this is an obligation stipulated in the Armistice Agreement, and on the other hand, the work of this organization has a definite contribution to peace in Korea.
    But conversely, since the armistice, the U.S. side has continuously violated the Armistice Agreement, importing a large amount of reinforcement war materials and arming the Syngman Rhee clique. Such violations of the Armistice Agreement by the U.S. side have been exposed by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; the existence of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has of course increased the difficulty for the U.S. side to continue such violations of the Armistice Agreement. It is precisely this situation that illustrates the necessity for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to continue to exist, and it is precisely this situation that explains why the U.S. side has consistently deliberately obstructed the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and actively plotted to abolish it.
    Since its establishment, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has been constantly obstructed and sabotaged by the U.S. side. The Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at various ports in South Korea have long been unable to obtain timely reports from the U.S. side on the import of war materials, and have been repeatedly prohibited by the U.S. side from boarding ships for inspection, prohibited from opening boxes for inspection, prohibited from entering ports for inspection, and even Neutral Nations personnel have been beaten, insulted and kidnapped by the U.S. side, attacked with guns and bombs by thugs organized by local authorities instigated by the U.S. side, and openly intimidated by local military and police authorities to use violence to expel them and persecute them. At the same time, since February 1954, the U.S. side has begun to openly threaten the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, stating that it will not allow it to continue to work.
    The facts clearly show that it is the U.S. side that has consistently obstructed the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, making it difficult for it to fulfill its responsibilities under the Armistice Agreement, and it is the U.S. side that has consistently used despicable means to attempt to undermine and abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The British authorities, who claim to be easing tensions, not only do not stop these destructive actions of the United States, but also strongly support them. A British Foreign Office spokesman openly stated that Britain agrees to disband the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This proves that the British authorities are accomplices in the American plot to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    The Korean Armistice Agreement must not be undermined, nor can it be arbitrarily modified. The Government of the People's Republic of China, with the consent of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, has solemnly expressed its opposition to ending the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This solemn position of the Chinese and Korean governments has won the firm support of all people who are concerned about peace in the Far East, because this is necessary for stabilizing the Korean armistice.
    It must be pointed out that since the Geneva Conference, the international situation has achieved a certain degree of relaxation, and the American aggressive bloc has tried every possible means to undermine this relaxation, which is beneficial to the peace and welfare of the people of the world. On the one hand, it pieced together the Southeast Asia Treaty and held the Bangkok Conference, plotting to further undermine the Indochina armistice, and on the other hand, it openly and blatantly wanted to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that supervises the Korean armistice, and stated that it would increase its military strength in Korea regardless of the restrictions of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The people of the world who love peace must be highly vigilant and resolutely stop the American aggressive bloc's blatant attempt to undermine the Korean armistice, create overall tension, and prepare for a new war.

### （一）坚决反对美国阴谋取消朝鲜中立国监察委员会

    （一）坚决反对美国阴谋取消朝鲜中立国监察委员会
    三月三日，美国政府在致瑞典和瑞士的备忘录里，表示美国政府不顾停战协定的规定，要取消朝鲜中立国监察委员会。
    三月五日，据澳洲电台广播，美国政府官员又公开叫嚣，表示美国将不顾停战协定的限制而增加它在朝鲜的军事力量。
    这两件事情的密切联系是显而易见的。正是由于美国急于要不顾朝鲜停战协定，大量增加它在朝鲜的军事力量，因此，它就不得不公开拿出它一向企图隐瞒的破坏手段，断然宣布它主张破坏停战协定的有关条款，取消中立国监察委员会，使它在南朝鲜大批增加军力的计划不致受到阻碍。这是美国侵略集团一贯的阻挠和破坏活动的新发展，目的是破坏朝鲜停战协定，加剧远东紧张局势，以便于准备新的战争。
    为了掩盖它的新的破坏活动，美国政府在其致瑞典和瑞士的备忘录里，竟企图以它惯用的造谣诬蔑手段，将阻挠和破坏中立国监察委员会的责任推在朝中方面。这完全是徒劳。
    一九五三年七月朝鲜停战以来，根据停战协定而成立的中立国监察委员会，在监督停战的实施中起着积极的作用。朝中方面一贯对中立国监察委员会给予充分的合作和支持，因为一方面这是停战协定所规定的义务，另一方面这个机构的工作对朝鲜的和平是有肯定的贡献的。
    但相反地，停战以来，美方却不断违反停战协定，大量运进增援性的作战物资，武装李承晚集团。美方这类违反停战协定的事实，曾经中立国监察委员会予以揭露；中立国监察委员会的存在当然增加了美方继续这类违反停战协定的行为的困难。正是这种情况说明了中立国监察委员会继续存在的必要，也正是这种情况说明了为什么美方一贯蓄意阻挠中立国监察委员会的工作并积极地图谋取消它。
    中立国监察委员会自成立以来就不断遭到美方的阻挠和破坏。驻在南朝鲜各口岸的中立国视察小组长期不能从美方及时地获得运进作战物资的报告，并且迭次被美方禁止上船视察，禁止开箱视察，禁止进入港口视察，甚至中立国人员遭到美方的殴打、侮辱和绑架，被美方指使地方当局组织的暴徒开枪袭击、投掷炸弹，遭到当地军警当局的公开恫吓要用暴力驱逐他们、迫害他们。同时，自一九五四年二月起，美方即开始公开威胁中立国监察委员会，表示要不让它继续工作下去。
    事实清清楚楚地说明了，是美方在一贯阻挠中立国监察委员会，使它在履行其依据停战协定所承担的责任时遭到困难，是美方在一贯用尽卑劣手段企图破坏和取消中立国监察委员会。对于美国的这些破坏行动，口口声声自称要缓和紧张局势的英国当局不但丝毫不加制止，而且极力支持。英国外交部发言人竟公然表示英国同意解散朝鲜中立国监察委员会。这证明英国当局是美国策划破坏朝鲜停战协定的同谋者。
    朝鲜停战协定不容许破坏，也不容许随意修改。中华人民共和国政府在征得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的同意后，已经严正地表示反对结束中立国监察委员会的活动。中朝政府的这一严正的立场获得所有关心远东和平的人士的坚决的支持，因为这对于稳定朝鲜停战是必要的。
    必须指出，自从日内瓦会议以后，国际局势取得一定的缓和，美国侵略集团就千方百计地要破坏这种有利于世界人民的和平和福利的缓和局面。它一面拼凑了东南亚条约、举行曼谷会议，阴谋进一步破坏印度支那停战，一面则公开露骨地要取消监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会，并且表示要不顾朝鲜停战协定的限制，而增加它在朝鲜的军事力量。对于美国侵略集团这种明目张胆企图破坏朝鲜停战、制造全面紧张局势、准备新的战争的阴谋活动，全世界爱好和平的人民必须提高警惕，并坚决予以制止。
