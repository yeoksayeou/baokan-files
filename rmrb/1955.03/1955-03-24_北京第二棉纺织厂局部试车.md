    Partial Trial Run of Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory

    By March 10th, the newly built state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory had installed over 80% of its total equipment. Most workshops began machine inspection and trial runs on March 17th.

    The scale of this factory is about twice that of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. All textile machinery and equipment are manufactured by textile machinery factories in Shanghai, Shenyang, Qingdao, Zhengzhou and other places. Among them, some machines, such as cotton openers, single-process three-passage roving frames, and grooved drum winding machines, are designed and manufactured by concentrating on the advanced technologies of many countries. This machinery and equipment is the most advanced in China's current textile industry, and has many advantages, such as high efficiency and the ability to save a large amount of labor and raw materials; at the same time, they all have perfect safety equipment.

    北京第二棉纺织厂局部试车
    新建国营北京第二棉纺织厂到三月十日，已经安装好的机器占设备总量的百分之八十以上，多数工段从三月十七日开始进行机器检修试车工作。
    这个厂的规模比北京国营第一棉纺织厂大一倍左右，全部纺织机器设备都是由上海、沈阳、青岛、郑州等地纺织机器制造厂制造的。其中有些机器如清花机、单程三道粗纱机、槽筒式筒子机等，是集中许多国家先进技术而设计制造出来的。这些机器设备在我国目前纺织业中是最先进的，具有许多的优点，如效率高，能够节省大量的人工和原料；同时都有着完善的安全设备。（张毅）
