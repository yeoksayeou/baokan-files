Northern provinces in our country, which have colder climates, are seeing their broad masses of farmers are working hard to prepare for spring plowing.
    In many parts of Hebei Province, manure is being delivered to the fields. Farmers in the Tianjin and Baoding areas, which suffered from floods last year, are seizing the time while the ice is melting to rush-plant spring wheat and other early-maturing crops. The province plans to plant more than 4 million mu of peanuts this year, of which 700,000 mu will be treated with peanut rhizobium inoculant. Inoculant sufficient for treating 100,000 mu of peanuts has been produced and is being shipped to Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Cangxian and other areas with earlier planting schedules.
    In Shanxi Province, many agricultural production cooperatives formulated their spring sowing plans for this year last winter based on the needs of the state. Twenty-four agricultural production cooperatives in Wanrong County responded to the call to expand cotton fields, increasing the area planted to cotton by 15 percent compared to last year. Currently, manure is being delivered to the fields, with more than half of the accumulated fertilizer already delivered in Jincheng, Yangcheng and other places. In terms of seeds, in addition to the 4.8 million jin of cotton seeds reserved by the state, the exchange of seeds among the masses has been launched. Linfen, Hongzhao, Wanrong and other counties have resolved more than 700,000 jin of seeds through mass exchange.
    Shaanxi Province plans to expand cotton fields by more than 400,000 mu this year, with total cotton production increasing by nearly 10 percent compared to last year. In order to complete this plan, farmers in cotton-producing areas are adopting methods such as reducing the planting area of melons and sweet potatoes, and intercropping cotton in barley, rapeseed, and highland barley fields to expand cotton fields, without affecting the production of grain and oil crops. Tongguan, Hancheng, Chengcheng and other places are now delivering base fertilizer to cotton fields.
    The masses in various parts of Gansu have accumulated a large amount of manure and are now transporting it to the fields. In some areas of Lingtai and Jingchuan, the masses are transporting manure early in the morning and late at night when the ground is frozen because the melting snow during the day makes it difficult to transport. More than 800 agricultural production cooperatives in the Yinchuan area have completed the delivery of all their manure. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Qinghai Province have made preparations for spring plowing, and planting can begin in early March in the warmer areas along the Yellow River.
    Agricultural production cooperatives in Rehe and Liaoning provinces are also working hard to deliver manure to the fields, and some cooperatives have begun to select seeds and repair farm tools. The area fertilized this year in various parts of Heilongjiang Province has increased compared to the past. According to statistics from 44 counties including Shuangcheng and Nenjiang, the fertilized area will be nearly 200 qing. Various places are now carrying out the delivery of manure and seed selection.

    北方各省农民积极准备春耕
    【本报讯】　我国气候较冷的北方各省，广大农民正在紧张地进行春耕生产的准备工作。
    河北省很多地方都把粪肥送到地里。去年遭受水灾的天津、保定等专区农民，正抓紧化冰时间抢种春小麦等早熟作物。全省今年计划种植花生四百多万亩，其中有七十万亩将使用花生根瘤菌拌种剂拌种。已制出可供种十万亩花生用的拌种剂，正运往邯郸、邢台、石家庄、沧县等点种较早的地区。
    山西省许多农业生产合作社早在去年冬季就根据国家需要制订了今年春耕播种计划。万荣县二十四个农业生产合作社响应扩大棉田的号召，植棉面积比去年扩大了百分之十五。目前各地正往地里送粪肥，晋城、阳城等地已送出所积肥料的半数以上。在种籽方面，除国家储备棉籽四百八十万斤外，并展开了群众之间的种籽调剂，临汾、洪赵、万荣等县通过群众互换，已解决种籽七十多万斤。
    陕西省今年计划扩大棉田四十多万亩，棉花总产量要比去年增加近百分之十。产棉区农民为了完成这一计划，正在不影响粮食油料生产的前提下，采用缩小瓜类、薯类的种植面积，和在大麦、油菜、青稞等地里套种棉花等办法扩大棉田。现在潼关、韩城、澄城等地已向棉田送底肥。
    甘肃各地群众已积了大批粪肥，现正往地里运送。灵台、泾川部分地区群众，因白天化雪，运送粪肥困难，都趁早晚地冻时运送。银川专区八百多个农业生产合作社的粪肥已全部运送完毕。青海省各族农民已作了春耕准备，黄河两岸比较温暖的地区三月初便可开始播种。
    热河和辽宁两省的农业生产合作社也都在紧张地把粪肥送到地里，部分社已开始选种和修理农具。黑龙江省各地今年施肥面积比过去有所增加，据双城、嫩江等四十四个县的统计，施肥面积将近二百垧。现在各地正在进行送粪肥和选种。
