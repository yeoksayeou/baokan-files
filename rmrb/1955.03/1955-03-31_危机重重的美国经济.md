The American Economy Plagued by Crisis

Luther Says the U.S. Economy Shows Dangerous Signs of a Great Depression

Luther, president of the United Automobile Workers of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, said at the United Automobile Workers convention on the 27th that the U.S. economy is currently showing dangerous signs of another Great Depression.

He said that just like in the years before the 1929 depression, between 1953 and 1954, production, employment, wages, and agricultural income all declined. However, profits increased by nearly 25 percent.

Luther said that in the early years of the 1920s, the economic depression occurred at a time when the income of those who had almost nothing decreased, while the income of those with vast estates increased. This situation is happening again now.

Luther acknowledged that the impoverishment of the working people is the cause of the economic crisis. He said that the reason the United States is in trouble is due to the increasing and serious imbalance between productivity and the weak purchasing power of millions of families.

Stock Market Volatile and Has Plummeted Three Times This Year

The U.S. stock market has been in an extremely volatile state this year, with stock prices plummeting three times.

The most recent decline, which began on March 4th, continued until it stopped on the 15th. United Press International believes this was "the biggest stock decline since the end of 1929." This decline resulted in a total loss of $10 billion in stock prices. Prior to this, in early January and mid-January, the New York stock market had already experienced two price plunges.

This serious instability in the stock market, especially the recent major decline, has caused alarm and unease throughout the American business community. The Senate Banking and Currency Committee said: "A considerable portion of economists admits that the current situation has significant similarities to the situation in 1928-29." Several American newspapers believe that the successive stock market crashes show a lack of confidence among stockholders in the future of the overall economy.

Many Merchant Ships Cease Sailing, Thousands of Sailors Lose Jobs

The New York "Economic Review" reported that the U.S. shipping industry continues to be sluggish, with many merchant ships ceasing to sail and sailors losing their jobs.

In 1954 alone, a strong 8 percent of U.S. merchant ships, or 113 vessels, ceased sailing, resulting in an 11 percent decrease in sailor employment, or 7,550 people. According to reports published by many maritime unions, almost half of the sailors in these unions are currently unemployed.

The "Economic Review" said that many merchant ships have been sold to other countries, and more than 2,000 ships built by the government are docked because there is no freight to transport.

Middle-Aged Men and Women Find It Increasingly Difficult to Find Work

An article published in "U.S. News & World Report" wrote: "It is becoming increasingly difficult for men over 45 and women over 35 to find work in the United States."

The article said that members of Congress and the Department of Labor often receive many letters from such people. A 45-year-old chemist with a college education and a degree wrote: "I have many years of experience working in various industrial sectors. But others tell me that due to my age, I cannot get a job."

A 47-year-old (who has a wife of the same age) wrote: "We have been unable to find work since August 1954. When they know our age, they tell us that there is nothing for us to do. They are looking for younger people."

    危机重重的美国经济
    路德说美国经济有大萧条的危险迹象
    美国产业工会联合会主席路德二十七日在联合汽车工人工会大会上说，美国经济目前呈现着发生又一次大萧条的危险迹象。
    他说，正像一九二九年萧条前那些年头一样，在一九五三年到一九五四年内，产量、就业人数、工资和农业收入全都下降了。可是利润却增加了将近百分之二十五。
    路德说，在二十年代最初几年里，经济萧条是在这样一个时候发生的：几乎一无所有的人收入减少了，而家产累累的人收入却增加了。现在这样的情形又发生了。
    路德承认劳动人民的贫困化是经济危机的原因。他说，美国之所以陷入困难，是因为生产力同千百万家庭薄弱的购买力两者之间日益加重的严重的不平衡所致。
    股票市场动荡不定今年来已暴跌三次
    美国股票市场今年来一直处于极度动荡不定的状态，股票价格曾经三次暴跌。
    最近的一次下跌，从三月四日开始一直延续到十五日才停止。合众社认为这是“一九二九年年底以来的最大一次股票下跌”。这次下跌使股票价格的亏损总额达一百亿美元。在这以前，在一月初和一月中旬，纽约股票市场已发生两次价格暴跌。
    股票市场这种严重的不稳状态，特别是最近这次大跌，使得整个美国经济界感到惊惶不安。参议院银行与通货委员会说：“相当大的一部分经济学家承认目前的情况和一九二八——二九年的情况有着重大的相同之处。”若干美国报纸认为，股票市场接二连三的暴跌，显示了股票持有人对整个经济前途缺乏信心。
    许多商船停止驶行成千海员失掉职业
    纽约的“经济评论”报道，美国航运业继续不景气，许多商船停驶，海员失业。
    在一九五四年一年内，美国商船有百分之八强，即一百十三艘停止行驶，因此海员的就业人数减少了百分之十一，即七千五百五十人。据许多海员工会发表的报告说，在这些工会中，目前几乎有一半的海员失业。
    “经济评论”说，有许多商船被卖给别的国家了，政府修建的两千多艘船只都因为没有货运而停放在船坞里。
    中年男女想找到工作已经越来越困难
    “美国新闻与世界报道”刊载的一篇文章写道：“上了四十五岁的男子和三十五岁的妇女在美国想找到工作是越来越困难了。”
    文章说，国会议员和劳工部经常收到这样的人的许多来信。一个受过大学教育并且获得了学位的四十五岁的化学家写的信说：“我有在各种工业部门中工作的多年经验。但是别人对我说，由于年龄关系，我不能获得工作。”
    一个四十七岁的人（他有一个妻子和他同年）写道：“我们从一九五四年八月起就找不到工作。当他们知道我们的年龄的时候，他们就对我们说，没有什么事情给我们做了。他们要找更年青的人。”
