Editor's note: Reader Xu Junwang's suggestion was forwarded to the Aquatic Products Management Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture for study. They believe this opinion is very good, worthy of attention, and should be used to improve work. They have forwarded this suggestion to the Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau and the Aquatic Products Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture for study. They also plan to promote the "crushed salt fish curing method" of Tianjin Aquatic Products Company to correct the waste of salt.

    Should Improve Fish Processing
    To the Editor:
    The aquatic product companies in Qingdao, Yantai, Shidao and other places under the Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau have serious waste in the use of salt for processing aquatic fish. In Yantai and other places, small yellow croaker and mackerel are abundant in spring. When they carry out salt-drying processing, according to the old rules, they often add salt to 40% (40 catties of salt per 100 catties of fish). As a result, the salted fish becomes bitter and is not popular when transported and sold to various places. According to the results of experiments at Yantai Aquatic Products School, it is sufficient to add salt to 28% for fish. Compared with fresh fish, the protein in salted fish with 28% salt content does not change much, and it can maintain the amino acids in the fish body, preventing them from decomposing into free ammonia (causing odor). However, when we put this opinion forward to the local aquatic product enterprises, it was opposed. They believe that adding 40% salt is a "legal number" and cannot be changed. They are also accustomed to using large-grain fish salt to cure salted fish. The large-grain salt dissolves slowly, and there is still undissolved residual salt after the fish is cured. According to our school's analysis, the sodium chloride in the residual salt still contains an average of more than 70%. Although the solubility and penetration are smaller than that of the original salt, it can still be used if mixed with the original salt. However, they discard these residual salts instead of using them. The amount of residual salt wasted each year reaches more than 200,000 catties.
    In terms of mackerel processing, the urgent problem to be solved is the "oil burn" issue. Mackerel contains more unsaturated fatty acids, which easily react with oxygen in the air, causing "oil burn," resulting in a rancid odor, which greatly reduces the quality and nutritional value of the fish. If this problem is not solved, the processed mackerel cannot survive the summer, let alone be exposed to the sun. In April 1954, the processing group of the Aquatic Products Experimental Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture came to Yantai to study this problem. Preliminary experimental results showed that wrapping the processed mackerel with soybean flour and rice bran (containing vitamin C, an antioxidant) can isolate the fish body from the air and prevent oxidation; or after taking the cured fish out of the pool, drying it into dried slices, and sprinkling an appropriate amount of natural seasoning spices (such as cloves, ginger, etc.) to inhibit enzyme activity. Both methods can delay the degree of "oil burn." Unfortunately, these suggestions were not supported by the local aquatic product department and could not be further studied and resolved. The local aquatic product department believes that as long as they catch more fish and complete the production task, that is enough. This kind of thinking should be corrected. I hope you can reflect these situations to the higher leadership departments for research.

### 应该改进鱼类加工

    编者按：读者徐均望的建议经我们转请农业部水产管理总局研究，他们认为这个意见很好，值得引起注意并据以改进工作。他们已把这个建议转请山东省水产局、农业部水产实验所研究。他们并准备推广天津水产公司的“碎盐腌鱼法”，以纠正浪费乏盐现象。
    应该改进鱼类加工编辑同志：
    山东省水产局所属青岛、烟台、石岛等地的水产公司，对于水产鱼类的加工用盐方法，存在着严重的浪费现象。烟台等地春季盛产小黄鱼和鲐鱼。他们在进行盐干加工时，凭着旧规矩，往往加盐到百分之四十（一百斤鱼四十斤盐）。结果使咸鱼发苦，运销各地，不受欢迎。据烟台水产学校实验的结果，鱼类加盐到百分之二十八已经足够了。加盐百分之二十八的咸鱼的蛋白质和鲜鱼的蛋白质比较，变化不多，又能保持鱼体中的氨基酸，使之不分解为游离氨（发臭）。但是我们把这个意见向当地水产企业部门提出后，遭到反对。他们认为加盐百分之四十是“法定数”，不能改变。他们还习惯用大粒鱼盐腌咸鱼。大粒盐溶解得慢，鱼腌好后还有未溶解的乏盐。根据我校的分析，乏盐的氯化钠平均还含有百分之七十以上，虽然溶解度和渗透力比原盐小些，如果和原盐混合起来还能使用。但是，对于这些乏盐，他们是弃而不用的。每年被浪费的乏盐达二十多万斤。
    在鲐鱼加工方面，迫切需要解决的是“油烧”问题。鲐鱼体中的不饱和脂肪酸较多，容易和空气中的氧发生作用，引起“油烧”，发生酸败气味，使鱼的质量和营养价值大为降低。这个问题不解决，加工后的鲐鱼不能过暑，更不能晒太阳。一九五四年四月间，农业部水产实验所加工组来烟台研究这问题，初步试验结果，将加工后的鲐鱼用大豆粉、大米糠（含维生素丙、为抗氧化剂）裹起来，使鱼体同空气隔绝，防止氧化；或者是把腌好的鱼从池中捞出，晒成干片后，撒以适量的天然调味香料（如丁香、生姜等），以抑制酵素的活动。这两种方法都可以延缓“油烧”的程度。可惜这些建议因为没有得到当地水产部门的支持，未能作进一步的研究和解决。当地水产部门认为只要捞鱼多，完成生产任务就可以。这种思想是应该纠正的。希望你们能把这些情况，反映给上级领导部门研究。
