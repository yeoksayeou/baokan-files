    New Method for Saving Gasoline
    A truck equipped with an "anti-knock fuel saver" was driven on Pudong Avenue in Shanghai. The truck, carrying three and a half tons of cargo, traveled 125 kilometers and used 30.4 liters of gasoline, saving 14 percent more gasoline than the same truck without the "anti-knock fuel saver."
    This was a recent test conducted by the Shanghai Wholesale Station of the state-owned China Petroleum Company on the use of the "anti-knock fuel saver." The "anti-knock fuel saver" is installed below the carburetor of the car, using an anti-knock agent made of equal parts alcohol and water to save gasoline. The truck drivers who participated in the test believe that the "anti-knock fuel saver" also has the effects of preventing engine knocking, increasing engine horsepower, and reducing the temperature of the water tank.
    The "anti-knock fuel saver" was manufactured by Qian Runlian, a technician at the Shanghai Public Transportation Company, based on Soviet experience. Repeated tests have shown that gasoline savings are above 10 percent. The relevant departments in Shanghai are now studying the promotion and use of the device, and the first batch of "anti-knock fuel savers" will soon be formally produced. (Xinhua News Agency)

    节约汽油的新方法
    一辆装有“抗爆节油器”的运货汽车在上海市浦东大道上行驶。汽车载着三吨半的货物，走了一百二十五公里，用去汽油三十点四公升，比同一汽车在没有装“抗爆节油器”时节省汽油百分之十四。
    这是国营中国石油公司上海批发站最近所作的利用“抗爆节油器”的一次试验。“抗爆节油器”装在汽车化油器的下面，用酒精和水各半掺成的抗爆剂节约汽油。参加试验的汽车司机认为：“抗爆节油器”还有防止引擎突爆敲缸，增强引擎马力和减低水箱温度等功效。
    “抗爆节油器”是上海市公共交通公司技术人员钱润廉根据苏联经验制造的，多次试验的结果，节约汽油都在百分之十以上。现在上海市有关部门正在研究推广使用，第一批“抗爆节油器”就要正式生产。　（新华社）
