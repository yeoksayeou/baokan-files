    Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 8th: TASS reported that "Stone Weekly" published an article entitled "Dangerous War Crisis." When discussing the Bangkok Conference, the article wrote that Dulles at this conference "attempted to realize the idea of linking the Manila Treaty with our own mutual security treaties concluded with Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Japan. …Therefore, Dulles began to act in accordance with what Nolan demanded, that is, he attempted to force the British to support Chiang Kai-shek. Dulles may have achieved victory."
    The weekly also pointed out that the recently published report by London regarding the so-called "atrocities" suffered by British prisoners of war in Korea is considered by the United States as a sign that the British have begun to surrender and are "creating public opinion" to unconditionally support the U.S. policy aimed at opposing the People's Republic of China.

    美国“斯通周刊”透露
    英国在追随美国反对我国
    【新华社九日讯】塔斯社纽约八日讯：“斯通周刊”刊载了一篇题为“面临危险的战争危机”的文章。文章在谈到曼谷会议时写道，杜勒斯在这次会议上“企图实现这样一种主张：把马尼拉条约和我们自己同蒋介石、李承晚以及日本缔结的共同安全条约联结起来。……因此，杜勒斯就开始按照诺兰所要求的作法办事，这就是说，他企图迫使英国人支持蒋介石。杜勒斯可能已经取得胜利。”
    这家周刊还指出，伦敦最近所发表的所谓英国战俘在朝鲜遭到“暴行”的报告被美国认为是标志着英国人已经开始投降，并且在“制造舆论”以便无条件支持美国的目的在于反对中华人民共和国的政策。
