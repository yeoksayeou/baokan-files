Panchen Erdeni's Speech

Dear Premier Zhou, Comrades:

Since we arrived in the capital, Beijing, it has been more than half a year. During this period, we participated in the First Session of the First National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We also participated in the National Day celebrations for the fifth anniversary of the founding of New China and had the excellent opportunity to visit Beijing and other places. Thanks to the kind concern of the great Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, as well as the enthusiastic help of all comrades, we received meticulous care during our participation in the meetings and our study tours. Today, we are honored to have such a grand banquet held to bid us farewell. Now, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Premier Zhou and all comrades.

As we are about to leave our beautiful capital, Beijing, our hearts are filled with reluctance. Frankly speaking, no matter how much longer we stayed in Beijing, it would not satisfy our wishes. However, in order to better repay Chairman Mao and everyone for their care and attention, we need to return earlier to do more work. At this moment of farewell, we earnestly hope and request that you all continue to give us more guidance and assistance in our future work, study, and all other aspects, so that even though we are thousands of miles apart, it will be as if we are still in Beijing.

After we return this time, we must resolutely abide by the kind instructions of Chairman Mao and all the leaders, further consolidate the unity within Tibet and the unity between the Han and Tibetan brotherly ethnic groups, and advance in the direction indicated by the Constitution, thoroughly implement the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, actively do a good job in the preparatory work for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet and consolidate the southwest national defense.

Now, let us raise our glasses to the prosperity and strength of our great motherland, to the great unity of all ethnic groups in our great motherland! To the boundless longevity of our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live our great and correct Chinese Communist Party!

Finally, to the good health and successful work of our dear Premier Zhou and everyone!

    班禅额尔德尼的讲话亲爱的周总理，各位同志们：
    我们这次到首都北京以来，到现在已经半年多了。在这个期间，我们参加了第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，和中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会会议，同时还参加了新中国建国五周年国庆观礼，并获得了很好的机会到首都北京及各地参观，由于伟大的中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的亲切关怀，以及各位同志们的热情帮助，使我们在参加会议和进行参观学习期间，都得到了无微不至的照顾，今天又蒙举行这样隆重的宴会，来欢送我们。现在，我谨在此向周总理，各位同志们，致以衷心的感谢。
    我们即将离开我国美丽的首都北京的时候，我们的心情是依依不舍的。老实说，我们在北京再住更多的时间，也不能满足我们的心愿。但是为了更好地报答毛主席和各位对我们的关怀和照顾，需要早些回去，做更多的工作。在这个临别的时候，我们迫切地希望和要求各位对我们今后的工作、学习等各方面，经常给以更多的指示和帮助，那么虽然相距万里，也如同在北京一样。
    我们这次回去后，要坚决遵守毛主席和各位首长的亲切指示，更进一步巩固西藏内部和汉藏兄弟民族的团结，并遵循着宪法所指示的方向前进，彻底执行关于和平解放西藏的协议，积极做好西藏自治区筹备委员会工作，为建设繁荣幸福的新西藏、巩固西南国防而奋斗。
    现在让我们为我们伟大祖国的繁荣富强、为我们伟大祖国各族人民的大团结而干杯！为我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆而干杯！为我们伟大的正确的中国共产党万岁而干杯！
    最后，为亲爱的周总理和各位身体健康、工作胜利而干杯！
