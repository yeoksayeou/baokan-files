Xinhua News Agency, March 18th: According to a report by Agence France-Presse, French Premier Edgar Faure stated at a press conference held in Paris on the 16th that he would study the possibility of France manufacturing hydrogen bombs. He said that he would soon deal with the issue of manufacturing hydrogen bombs in cooperation with the relevant ministers.

According to Reuters, Faure's statement was welcomed by "Western diplomats" in London. However, a commentary in the London "Daily Telegraph" on the 17th pointed out that it is "very doubtful" how much benefit this decision by France would actually bring to the "cause" of the Western "allies." The "Daily Telegraph" said: "Producing nuclear weapons on an effective scale would be a serious burden on the French economy, which has not yet recovered from the Indochina War."

    法国总理富尔表示
    法国将研究制造氢弹的可能性
    【新华社十八日讯】据法新社报道，法国总理富尔十六日在巴黎举行的记者招待会上表示，他将研究法国制造氢弹的可能性。他说，他不久就会在有关的部长的合作下来处理制造氢弹的问题。
    据路透社报道，富尔的声明受到伦敦的“西方外交人士”的欢迎。但是伦敦“每日电讯报”十七日的评论指出，法国这一决定到底对西方“盟国”的“事业”有多少好处“很可怀疑”。“每日电讯报”说：“要在有效规模上生产核子武器，对于还没有从印度支那战争中恢复过来的法国经济将会是一个严重的负担”。
