The China Blind Welfare Association will publish 20 percent more Braille books in 1955 than in 1954. Textbooks for advanced and primary elementary Chinese, history, geography, nature, and arithmetic textbooks for primary elementary schools will be published successively. In addition, it is planned to publish some political theory and literary books. The "Blind Monthly" will continue to be published. Two issues have already been published this year, carrying documents such as "Premier Zhou's Statement on the US-Chiang Mutual Defense Treaty," "The Fifth Anniversary of the Great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance," and "Atomic Energy Serving the Peaceful Happiness of Mankind." The Braille characters in the books published by the China Blind Welfare Association were created by Huang Nai (a blind person), Director of the Blind and Deaf Education Department of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. The reform of Braille and the publication of Braille books and periodicals have greatly encouraged blind people across the country. They have written letters to the China Blind Welfare Association, thanking the People's Government and Chairman Mao for their concern. Students from the Shenyang School for the Blind wrote: In the past, we spent most of our study time copying Braille books. It took us four or five years to complete the courses that ordinary elementary schools completed in three years. Now we have beautiful Braille textbooks and no longer have to spend time copying books. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    中国盲人福利会出版盲文书刊
    中国盲人福利会一九五五年计划出版的盲文书籍字数比一九五四年增加百分之二十。将陆续出版的有高级和初级小学语文、历史、地理、自然等课本和初级小学的算术课本。另外还计划出版一些政治理论和文艺书籍。“盲人月刊”仍继续出版，今年已出两期，刊载了“周总理关于美蒋共同防御条约的声明”、“伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约五周年”、“原子能服务于人类和平幸福的道路”等文件。中国盲人福利会出版书籍上的盲字，是由中华人民共和国教育部盲哑教育处处长黄乃（盲人）创造的。盲文的改革和盲文书刊的出版给全国盲人以极大的鼓舞，他们纷纷写信给中国盲人福利会，感谢人民政府和毛主席对他们的关怀。沈阳盲童学校的学生们来信说：过去我们大部分学习时间是用来抄盲书，普通小学三年学完的功课我们要四、五年才行。现在我们有精美的盲字课本，不必再花时间去抄书了。　（据新华社讯）
