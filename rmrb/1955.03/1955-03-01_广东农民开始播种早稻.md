Guangdong farmers, except in the Yuebei area, have successively started the early rice sowing work in various places. In Hainan Island and Xuwen County on the Leizhou Peninsula, where the season is earlier, rice transplanting has already begun. In order to increase the production of miscellaneous grains, farmers in various places are actively intercropping millet, corn, beans, and other early-maturing spring crops in sugarcane fields and peanut fields. In the Yuexi area alone, more than 400,000 mu of early-maturing crops have already been sown. This year, due to the great development of the cooperative movement, farmers in various places, driven by agricultural production cooperatives, are vigorously carrying out agricultural technical reforms. For example, the selection of seeds using yellow mud water or salt water has been widely adopted by farmers. Many areas have also held training classes for cultivating strong seedlings, imparting the experience of improved seedling fields and sparse sowing. In Guanshan Township, Chaoyang County, due to the promotion of sparse sowing methods, 30 to 50 jin of seeds are saved per mu of seedling field, which has solved the seed shortage problem for some farmers. In recent months, rainfall has been scarce in various places, and drought conditions have emerged. In order to ensure timely sowing of early rice and rush-planting of early-maturing crops, various places are launching a struggle against drought and for drought prevention. At the same time, in order to prevent attacks of spring cold, farmers in various places have made early preparations for protecting seedlings from the cold.

    广东农民开始播种早稻
    广东省除粤北区外，其他各地农民已陆续开始早稻播种工作，季节较早的海南岛和雷州半岛上的徐闻等县已开始插秧。各地农民为了增加杂粮生产，纷纷在蔗地、花生地上间种粟子、玉米、豆类等春季早熟作物，单粤西区目前已下种早熟作物即达四十万亩以上。今年由于合作运动的大发展，各地农民在农业生产合作社的带动下都大力进行农业技术改革。如黄坭水或盐水选种已为广大农民普遍采用。许多地区还举行了培育壮秧的训练班，传授合式秧田和疏播的经验。潮阳县关埠乡由于推广了疏播的办法，每亩秧田节约种籽三十斤到五十斤，解决了部分农民缺种困难。数月来各地雨量稀少，已呈现旱象，为了保证早稻及时播种和抢种早熟作物，各地正展开抗旱防旱斗争。同时为预防春寒袭击，各地农民已提早准备保苗防寒。
