    Tianjin literary circles recently held two symposiums to criticize Hu Shih's bourgeois idealist reactionary thought in literature and linguistics. More than 80 people participated in the symposiums, including professors and lecturers from the Chinese language departments of Nankai University, Tianjin Normal College, and Hebei Normal College, as well as some Chinese language teachers from middle schools and literary and art workers.
    Through the analysis of Hu Shih's poisonous works such as "History of Vernacular Literature," "Reading Chu Ci," and "Textual Research on Water Margin," the symposium revealed the reactionary essence of Hu Shih's thought, pointing out his shameless distortion and slander of classical literature. At the symposium, many people also exposed and criticized Hu Shih's reactionary views such as language is created by individuals and the development of language is unknowable. (Xinhua News Agency)

    天津文学界批判胡适反动思想
    天津市文学界最近举行了两次座谈会，批判胡适的资产阶级唯心论在文学和语言学方面的反动思想。参加座谈的有南开大学、天津师范学院、河北师范学院中国语文系的教授、讲师，各中学的部分语文教师和文艺工作者等八十多人。
    座谈会通过对胡适的“白话文学史”、“读楚辞”、“水浒传考证”等充满毒素的著作的分析，揭发了胡适思想的反动实质，指出他对古典文学的无耻歪曲和诬蔑。座谈会上，许多人还揭发并批判了胡适所说语言是个人创造的和语言的发展是不可知的等反动观点。　（新华社）
