How Rich Peasant Element Shu Minghuan Usurped the Township Government of Taoyuan Township
    Hu Jia

    In the spring of 1954, Taoyuan Township, Zongpu District, Huaining County, Anhui Province, held grassroots elections. However, the result of the election in this township was not to purify the organization of the grassroots government and elect people who were loved by the masses and connected with them, but to allow rich peasant element Shu Minghuan and others to further control the township government, turning Taoyuan Township into a dark corner. The state's policies and decrees could not be smoothly implemented there, landlords and rich peasants counterattacked and settled scores, and the people lived a life of suffering. This anti-people incident was finally exposed in the winter of 1954, and rich peasant element Shu Minghuan was arrested and brought to justice. The main reason this incident occurred was that some leading cadres in Zongpu District had serious bourgeois ideas of seeking enjoyment and being corrupt and degenerate, and were being wooed and utilized by rich peasant elements.

    After the end of the land reform movement, some cadres in Taoyuan Township developed complacency and relaxation, and relaxed the necessary vigilance against counter-revolutionaries and hostile class elements. Rich peasant element Shu Minghuan took the opportunity to infiltrate the village government, serving successively as administrative group leader, village head, and financial and grain officer of the township government, and also burrowed into the organization of the Youth League. Some important positions in the township government and mass organizations were also seized by politically impure elements. Su Fanghou, who had been a hooligan, thief, and liaison officer for the Japanese New Asia Team, became the township security committee member; Pan Xujin, who had been a bandit, puppet police officer, and feudal head, became the civil affairs committee member; Chen Shanbao, a counter-revolutionary who had escaped the net, became the mediation committee member; and Huang Zijin, the chairman of the peasant association, was also a bad element who had infiltrated the Party and had also participated in hooligan organizations before liberation. These people and Jiang Shi'an, the secretary of the township branch of the Youth League, were all drawn over by Shu Minghuan and became his good friends.

    Taoyuan Township was the seat of the Zongpu District government, and after the land reform, it was also the key township of the district committee. Zhang Yangyuan, the deputy secretary of the District Youth League Committee, was sent by the district to take charge of the work there, and Chen Tingli, the secretary of the district committee, and other district cadres also often went to this township to arrange and inspect the work. In principle, these district cadres should have discovered in time the impure organization of the township government of Taoyuan Township right under their noses and eliminated the rich peasant elements and counter-revolutionaries. But the fact was not like this. Chen Tingli and Zhang Yangyuan and others not only did not discover these problems, but were instead hit by Shu Minghuan's sugar-coated bullets. Shu Minghuan catered to these district cadres' preferences; for those who were greedy for food and drink, he bought wine and meat; for those who liked to take petty advantages, he sent pens and diaries; and for those who did not have wives, he introduced them to lovers. In the past two years, almost no district cadre who had worked in this township had not been wooed and invited to eat by Shu Minghuan. Zhang Yangyuan, the deputy secretary of the District Youth League Committee, often ate and drank at Shu's home; Chen Tingli, the secretary of the district committee, not only ate and drank every time he went, but even took his wife, friends, and friends' wives to Shu's home to eat and drink lavishly. Therefore, Shu Minghuan gave these district cadres a very good impression, and they all thought that Shu Minghuan was "active in his work" and a "good cadre." Zhang Yangyuan allowed him to fully represent everything important in the key township, and Chen Tingli even wanted to introduce him to the Party.

    Since these main responsible cadres of the district trusted Shu Minghuan so much, they all intentionally wanted to put him on the stage when Taoyuan Township conducted grassroots general elections in February 1954. Shu Minghuan also believed that the time for him to usurp the township government had arrived, so he actively campaigned. As soon as the general election work began, Shu Minghuan held a grand banquet in the name of inviting people to a spring wine party, and Chen Tingli, Zhang Yangyuan, and others were naturally guests. Then, a township election committee was established, with Zhang Yangyuan as the chairman, and Shu Minghuan's gang of close friends became members, so the township election committee actually became a legitimate tool for Shu Minghuan to usurp power. Shu Minghuan used all kinds of despicable methods to make his gang all become representatives of the township people's congress. And with the approval of Chen Tingli, the secretary of the district committee, Shu Minghuan was determined as a candidate for township head. Before the official election of the township head, Shu Minghuan's lackeys were all busy campaigning for Shu Minghuan's votes everywhere, and deliberately released air saying: "The district has long decided that Shu Minghuan will be the township head!" "Shu Minghuan is designated by the county party committee." Zhang Yangyuan and others also gave active support.

    Shu Minghuan's wine and meat enchantment could bewilder degenerated elements like Zhang Yangyuan, but it could not cover the eyes of the broad masses of the people. When the list of candidates for township head was announced, it immediately aroused great dissatisfaction among the voters, and the voters in several constituencies even jointly wrote a complaint to the district. Zhang Yangyuan dared to intercept the voters' complaint on the way, disregarding the law, and handed it over to Shu Minghuan's confidant Su Fanghou. With the strong support of people like Zhang Yangyuan, Shu Minghuan finally was "elected" as township head, and Su Fanghou and others also became members of the township people's committee and other administrative responsible cadres.

    The first thing Shu Minghuan did after taking office as township head was to attack and retaliate against the activists who had complained about him in the general election, especially to attack the former township head Xie Dacai first. Xie Dacai was elected as the second deputy township head in the general election, but for more than two months after the general election, Shu Minghuan had not notified him to attend the township people's committee meeting, nor did he allow him to participate in the work. One night in April last year, Shu Minghuan and Jiang Shi'an even falsely claimed that there were special agents and went to Xie Dacai's and League member Ma Zongren's homes in the middle of the night to interrogate and threaten them. In order to attack the Youth League members who had accused him, Shu Minghuan asked Zhang Yangyuan to hold several League branch meetings to investigate the people who had accused him. Xie Faming, a member of the League branch committee, was punished by having his work revoked, League member Ma Zongren was almost expelled from the League, League member Pan Chuanjin's propaganda officer position was revoked, and all League members who had participated in the complaint were forced to make self-criticisms. Xie Yixiang, a member of the district working group and a cadre of the district women's federation, who was in the township at that time, was also given the serious crimes of "harboring relatives," "engaging in sectarianism," and "sabotaging the general election" because she opposed Shu Minghuan's election as township head. Chen Tingli ordered her to make a written self-criticism. The arrogance of this group of rich peasants and hooligans was extremely rampant. Su Fanghou, Jiang Shi'an, and Shu Minghuan even called themselves the "Three Mounts Tai" in the township, acting tyrannically and doing whatever they wanted. If someone violated them even slightly, they would either beat or scold them, or even illegally bind and detain them, and arbitrarily impose punishments on the masses. In less than a year, no less than thirty or forty peasants in the township had been hung up and beaten by them. Shu Minghuan had hung up and beaten four people in the Taoyuan constituency, some of whom were beaten until they vomited blood, and some still have scars on their wrists.

    Of course, Shu Minghuan and others were extremely hostile to the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In 1954, general townships in Anqing Prefecture had begun to run cooperatives; however, Taoyuan Township, which was the key township of the Zongpu District Committee, did not have an agricultural production cooperative. Some of the existing mutual aid teams were led by Shu Minghuan and others onto the road of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture, and some had even developed to engage in speculative commerce. The credit cooperative in this township, under the manipulation of rich peasant element Shu Minghuan (Shu was the director of the credit cooperative), had also deteriorated, becoming his private treasury and a powerful tool for wooing cadres and oppressing poor peasants. It was easy and convenient for those who were with Shu Minghuan to get loans, and the amount was also large. On the contrary, it was very difficult for poor peasants to get loans. For example, the poor peasant Pan Xuqing's mother died on the second day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year. After saying many good words, he borrowed 200,000 yuan from the credit cooperative. Only seven days after the funeral, Shu Minghuan went to urge him to repay the loan, forcing Pan Xuqing to sell his only half-grown pig. Shu Minghuan himself was not subject to any restrictions. On three occasions, he embezzled 300,000 yuan from the credit cooperative without anyone's approval.

    The grain unified purchase and sale work in Taoyuan Township was also messed up by rich peasant element Shu Minghuan. When he began to unified purchase grain the year before last, he was in charge of the Nanshan, Taiyuan, and Yan's three constituencies. The evaluation team wanted to promote the policy of "sell more if you have a surplus, sell less if you have less, and don't sell if you don't have a surplus," but he didn't let them promote it. He repeatedly said at mass meetings: "We must sweep the bottom of the warehouse to sell grain, and we must sell tomorrow's ration today." When calculating the surplus grain account of the middle peasant Pan Xiaozhou's family, he even converted Pan's firewood into surplus grain. He forced many households to sell their rice seeds, and some farmers wanted to commit suicide as a result. Later, difficult households who lacked grain to eat asked him to write a certificate to buy rice, but he refused to write it. Some farmers had to pick up yam heads that others had dug up to cook with green vegetables. The masses all reflected: "Township Head Shu has great power, and we buy rice and oil in his hands. If he wants you to starve for a few days, you have to starve for a few days!" In short, after this group of rich peasants and hooligans seized the township government, Taoyuan Township had become a dark corner. The lives and democratic rights of the peasants, especially the poor peasants, had lost their protection. Everyone had no mood to produce well, and all kinds of work could not be carried out. The landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements took the opportunity to become active and settled scores with the peasants.

    However, no matter how insidious and vicious Shu Minghuan and his gang were, their criminal acts were finally exposed. After the masses of Taoyuan Township reported to the prefectural working group in October last year, the Anqing Branch of the Anhui Provincial People's Procuratorate arrested Shu Minghuan and Chen Shanbao in accordance with the law after a joint investigation by the relevant authorities; at the same time, the relevant authorities dealt with several other politically impure elements who had infiltrated the township government and removed them from the township people's government. The superior party committee decided to expel Huang Zijin from the party, and the superior league committee also revoked Jiang Shi'an's position as secretary of the township league branch. Zhang Yangyuan, the completely degenerated deputy secretary of the district league committee, was transferred to the county for other handling. The youth league members Xie Faming and Ma Zongren and Xie Yixiang, who had been attacked for upholding the truth, were praised in addition to restoring their original positions and reputations. This dark corner has once again been illuminated by the bright sunshine.

    富农分子舒明焕为什么能篡夺了桃园乡的乡政权
    胡笳
    一九五四年春天，安徽省怀宁县总铺区桃园乡进行了基层选举。但是这个乡选举的结果，不是纯洁了基层政权的组织，把为群众所爱戴的联系群众的人选出来，而是让富农分子舒明焕等人进一步掌握了乡政权，把桃园乡变成了一个黑暗角落。国家的政策法令在那里不能顺利推行，地主富农反攻倒算，人民群众过着痛苦的生活。这个反人民的事件终于在一九五四年冬天被揭发出来了，富农分子舒明焕被逮捕法办。这一事件之所以发生，主要是由于总铺区的一些领导干部存在着严重的资产阶级的贪图享受、腐化堕落的思想，为富农分子拉拢和利用。
    在土地改革运动结束以后，由于桃园乡的部分干部滋长了和平麻痹思想，放松了对于反革命分子和敌对阶级分子应有的警惕，富农分子舒明焕便乘机混进了乡村政权，历任行政组长、村长和乡政府的财粮员等职务，并且钻进了青年团的组织。乡政府和群众团体的一些重要职位，也被政治上的不纯分子所窃据。当过流氓、小偷和日寇新亚队联络员的苏芳候当了乡治安委员，当过土匪、伪警察和封建把头的潘绪金当了民政委员，漏网的反革命分子陈善保当了调解委员，农会主席黄自金也是混进党内的坏分子，解放前也参加过流氓组织。这些人和青年团乡支部书记蒋时安等都被舒明焕拉了过去，成了他的好朋友。
    桃园乡是总铺区区政府的所在地，土地改革以后又是区委的重点乡，区里派了团区委副书记张养源在那里掌握工作，区委书记陈廷礼和其他区干部也常到这个乡布置检查工作。按理说，这些区干部应该及时发现就在他们眼皮下面的桃园乡乡政权组织不纯的情况，把富农分子和反革命分子清除出去。但是事实不是这样的。陈廷礼和张养源等人不仅没有发现这些问题，反而被舒明焕的糖衣炮弹打中了。舒明焕投这些区干部的所好，对贪图吃喝的，他就打酒买肉；对好占小便宜的，他就送钢笔、日记本；对没有老婆的，他就介绍爱人。两年来，凡是到这个乡工作过的区干部，几乎没有一个人不被舒明焕拉拢请吃过。团区委副书记张养源就经常在舒家吃喝；区委书记陈廷礼不仅是每去必吃喝，甚至还把他的老婆、朋友和朋友的老婆都带到舒家大吃大喝。因此，舒明焕给这些区干部的印象都很好，都认为舒明焕“工作积极”，是个“好干部”。张养源让他全权代理重点乡的一切大事，陈廷礼还要介绍他入党。
    这些区的主要负责干部既然是这样信任舒明焕，在一九五四年二月桃园乡进行基层普选的时候，他们都有意要把他捧上台；而舒明焕也认为他篡夺乡政权的时机已到，就积极活动。当普选工作刚一开始，舒明焕就借请春酒为名，大排宴席，陈廷礼、张养源等人自然都是座中客。接着成立乡选举委员会，张养源当了主席，舒明焕的一伙知心朋友便都成为委员，乡选举委员会实际上变成了舒明焕篡夺政权的合法工具。舒明焕用种种卑鄙方法使自己的一伙人都当上了乡人民代表大会代表。并且经过区委书记陈廷礼批准，舒明焕被确定为乡长候选人。在正式选举乡长之前，舒明焕手下的喽罗们便都忙碌起来，到处为舒明焕活动选票，并且故意放出空气说：“区里早就决定舒明焕当乡长啦！”“舒明焕是县委指定的。”张养源等也予以积极的支持。
    舒明焕的酒肉迷魂阵，能够迷惑张养源这样的蜕化变质分子，却遮盖不了广大人民的眼睛。当乡长候选人名单一公布，立即引起了选民们的极大不满，几个选区的选民还联名写了状子到区里去控告。而张养源竟敢目无法纪地在半路上劫下了选民们的状纸，并且把它交给舒明焕的亲信苏芳候。在张养源这种人的极力支持之下，舒明焕终于当“选”了乡长，苏芳候等人也都当了乡人民委员会委员和其他的行政负责干部。
    舒明焕就任乡长以后的第一件事，就是打击和报复在普选中告过他状子的积极分子，特别是首先打击前任乡长谢达才。谢达才在普选中当选为第二副乡长，但普选后有两个多月，舒明焕没有通知过他参加乡人民委员会会议，也不让他参加工作。去年四月的一个夜晚，舒明焕和蒋时安更伪称有特务，半夜到谢达才和团员马宗仁家去查问和威胁。舒明焕为了打击控告过他的青年团员，就要张养源连开数次团支部会，追查控告他的人。团支部委员谢发明受到了撤销工作的处分，团员马宗仁差点被开除团籍，团员潘传进的宣传员职务被撤销了，所有参加过告状的团员都被逼做了检讨。当时在这个乡的区工作组组员、区妇联会干事谢异香，由于反对舒明焕当乡长，也被加上了“包庇本家”、“闹宗派”、“破坏普选”的重大罪名，由陈廷礼责令她作了书面检讨。这一伙富农、流氓分子的气焰嚣张已极，苏芳候、蒋时安、舒明焕甚至自称是乡里的“三泰山”，横行霸道，为所欲为。有人稍一触犯了他们，不是打就是骂，甚至非法加以捆绑和扣押，随便对群众施用刑罚。不到一年，全乡被他们吊打过的农民不下三、四十人，舒明焕在桃园选区就吊打过四个人，有的被打得吐血，有的至今手腕上还有伤痕。
    对于互助合作运动，舒明焕等人当然是极端仇视的。一九五四年安庆专区的一般乡都已开始办社；但是作为总铺区区委重点乡的桃园乡却没有一个农业生产合作社。已有的一些互助组，有的还被舒明焕等人引上了轻农业、重副业的道路，有的已经发展到做投机商业。这个乡的信用合作社，在富农分子舒明焕的操纵下（舒是信用社理事主任）也变了质，成了他私人的小金库和拉拢干部压迫贫苦农民的有力工具。凡是和舒明焕一伙的人贷款方便，数字也大。相反地，贫苦农民要想贷款，就很困难。例如贫农潘绪青在去年夏历七月初二死了妈妈，说了好多好话，才从信用社借了二十万元。刚办完丧事七天，舒明焕就去催还贷款，逼得潘绪青把仅有的一口半大的猪也卖了。舒明焕自己却不受任何限制，有三次他就没有经任何人批准，在信用社挪用了三十万元。
    桃园乡的粮食统购统销工作也被富农分子舒明焕搞得一蹋糊涂。前年开始统购粮食时，他掌握南山、太原、颜家三个选区，评议小组要宣传“多余多卖，少余少卖，不余不卖”的政策，他不叫宣传，自己在群众会上反复讲：“要扫仓底子卖粮，明天口粮今天也要卖。”在算中农潘孝周家的余粮账时，他甚至把潘家的柴草也折算成了余粮。他逼着好多户把稻种也卖掉了，有的农民因此要自杀。以后缺粮吃的困难户请他写证明去买米，他不写。有的农民只好拣别人挖断的山芋头子煮青菜吃。群众都反映说：“舒乡长权大势大，我们买米买油都在他手里，他要你饿几天你就要饿几天！”总之，在这一伙富农、流氓分子窃取了乡政权以后，桃园乡已经变成了一个黑暗角落。农民、特别是贫苦农民的生活和民主权利都失掉了保障，大家都没有心绪好好生产，各种工作都搞不起来。而地主、富农和坏分子则乘机活动起来，向农民进行倒算。
    但是，不管舒明焕这伙人是多么的阴险毒辣，他们的罪恶行为终于被揭发出来了。去年十月，桃园乡的群众向专区工作组告发以后，经过有关机关联合调查，安徽省人民检察署安庆分署已依法将舒明焕和陈善保逮捕；同时有关机关对其他几个混入乡政权的政治不纯分子分别作了处理，把他们清除出了乡人民政府。上级党委决定把黄自金清洗出党，上级团委也撤销了蒋时安的乡团支部书记职务，完全蜕化变质的团区委副书记张养源调县另作处理。区委书记陈廷礼受到了撤销工作的处分。因坚持真理而受到打击的青年团员谢发明、马宗仁和谢异香等，除恢复他们的原任职务和名誉外，并受到了表扬。这一黑暗角落又重新照遍了明朗的阳光。
