    The CPC Zhenhai County Committee strengthened its leadership over rural branch work. The Party's grassroots organizations in the county have greatly developed. According to statistics from the fourth quarter of 1954, the number of party members increased nearly sevenfold compared to the spring of 1953, and more than 94 percent of the townships have established branches. Through the study of the Party's general line during the transition period and the practical experience of the agricultural cooperation movement, the political awareness and leadership level of party members in these branches have greatly improved, and they have become an important reliance for the county committee to lead rural work.

    Before 1953, the Zhenhai County Committee's view of relying on the Party's grassroots organizations to lead rural work was unclear. At that time, among the county's eighty townships, there were only five branches, and the Party's grassroots organizations were very weak. The county committee had been using the method of dispatching work teams to carry out work. This led them to have the illusion that "work can be done well even without a party branch," and regarded the branch as "dispensable." Under the control of this idea, the county committee not only neglected party building work, but also abandoned leadership over the original five branches, leaving them in a state of uncontrolled drift for a long time. For example, Qiu Xiaomao of the Pengshi branch once went to the county committee's organization minister to complain, saying: "In the past, you often came to our village, but now no one comes, you have forgotten us." At this time, the county committee still did not recognize its mistakes, and did not conduct a self-examination from the perspective of the county committee's leadership. Instead, it was full of complaints and blamed others. Comrade Liu Lujun, the secretary of the county committee, once said: "Relying on new party members, there are too few new party members; relying on old party members, the old party members are not playing a role." The meaning of this sentence is: we must continue to rely on the work team to carry out the work.

    In the spring of 1953, the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee convened the Sixth Provincial Organizational Work Conference. At this conference, the Zhenhai County Committee's idea of neglecting branch work was criticized. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the Ningbo Prefectural Committee warned them: "It was wrong not to build the party in the past, and it will be a greater mistake not to build the party in the future." The Zhenhai County Committee convened a meeting based on the instructions of the superior party committee. At first, the county committee's thinking was still unclear, and there was a mood of complaint, saying: "The higher-level authorities did not arrange for party building in the past, how could we build the party?" Later, after a more calm analysis of the situation of the Party's grassroots organizations in the county, they clearly saw the serious consequences caused by abandoning leadership over branch work. The meeting also examined the work of the county committee's organization department and found that the management of party members was very chaotic. The organization department could not say exactly how many party members there were in the county, so the loss of party members' organizational relationships continued to occur. There was such a thing: a probationary party member returned to Zhenhai from Shanghai. After handing over his organizational relationship introduction letter to the organization department of the Zhenhai County Committee, he waited at home for more than half a year, and no one paid attention to it. Later, the probationary party member went to the organization department of the county committee to inquire, and the organization department did not even know that there was such a party member. The above situations were presented at the meeting, which aroused everyone's attention. The idea of neglecting branch work in the past began to change. Therefore, a party building plan was formulated, organizers were identified, and county-wide organizational work conferences and county-wide district and township party member cadre meetings were convened to mobilize and deploy party building work.

    Afterward, the Zhenhai County Committee's leadership ideology and leadership style have changed. However, this change was not a completely conscious change. Later, some problems were exposed at a party group meeting in the county committee office. For example, Wang Yuqiao, the county committee's mutual aid and cooperation minister, said: "Building the party and leading the branch is their (referring to the organization department) business, and engaging in mutual aid and cooperation is Old Wang's business." Shen Xiangquan, the county committee's propaganda minister, also said: "Our propaganda department cadres have all been pulled to develop party members." Some people expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that Liu Lujun, the secretary of the county committee, constantly supported the organization minister's views on strengthening party building, saying: "The organization minister's words are effective, and there are also big and small committee members."

    No matter what, the party building work in Zhenhai County has finally started. From the summer of 1953 to the spring of 1954, the number of new party members increased rapidly, and the Party's grassroots organizations gradually established. During this period, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee and the Ningbo Prefectural Committee repeatedly instructed the Zhenhai County Committee: it must give full play to the role of the Party's grassroots organizations and rely on the Party's grassroots organizations to carry out work. However, many county and district cadres in Zhenhai County, including the county's leading cadres, still lacked experience in carrying out work through the Party's grassroots organizations. Therefore, during this period, the work of the branches was relatively chaotic. First of all, some cadres simply understood relying on the branch as relying on "party members taking the lead." These cadres often went to the countryside with their own pre-prepared plans, and convened branch meetings as soon as they entered the village, calling on party members to take the lead in completing tasks, without educating party members. Using without educating seriously affected the work enthusiasm of party members. The Beifeng Township Branch of Guoju District reflected that "leading is no longer effective," and produced negative and tired emotions. At that time, such a situation was not an isolated case. At the same time, the chaos in branch work was also reflected in the fact that some cadres understood carrying out work through the branch as "all work through the branch." As a result, regardless of major or minor matters, even the daily affairs of the township government were moved to the branch meeting for discussion and approval. This resulted in too much content in the branch meeting and too frequent meetings, replacing administrative meetings. For example, the Xiaogang Township Branch of Changshan District held eight branch meetings in two months, but no township administrative meeting was held.

    During this period, on the other hand, the leadership ideology of the Zhenhai County Committee also underwent new changes, and the leadership of branch work gradually changed from not completely conscious to completely conscious action. This was mainly because they personally saw the great role played by the branches in actual work. For example, during the grain unified purchase and sale work in the winter of 1953, Qin Fenglou, the then organization minister of the county committee, and several cadres went to Changshan Township. In Changshan Township, they relied on the branch to rank the production and living conditions of the people in the township. After detailed calculations and comparisons, they figured out the grain situation in the township in less than three days. This was of great help to the county committee in formulating the grain unified purchase and sale work plan. There are many such examples. This made the county committee clearly see that where there is a party branch, there is a guarantee of work. Therefore, when summarizing the unified purchase and sale work, Li Ming, the deputy secretary of the county committee, said with emotion: "Without these eighty branches in the county, it would be difficult to complete the grain unified purchase task this time." The most prominent change among the leading cadres of the county committee was Wang Yuqiao, the minister of mutual aid and cooperation. Wang Yuqiao personally saw that the Fuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hantang Township did not advance along the socialist road because there were few party members in the cooperative and lacked strong leadership. In the process of rectifying this agricultural cooperative, Wang Yuqiao more clearly realized the importance of party leadership. He said: "The socialist transformation of agriculture cannot succeed without the leadership of the party." Since then, he has been very concerned about branch work. He also checked the branch work while going to the countryside to inspect the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    After the Zhenhai County Committee truly realized the importance of branch work, it put party building on the agenda of the party committee. It often combined the central task to study and deploy branch work in a unified manner, and strengthened specific leadership over branch work. By the winter of 1954, the face of the Party's grassroots organizations in the county had undergone significant changes. The main manifestations were that the leadership level of the branches had improved and they had actively played an organizational role. The number of branches with independent working ability and able to form a leadership core increased from 15% to 30%, and the number of branches with relatively weak leadership ability, low prestige among the masses, and only a few party members playing a role decreased from 20% to 10%. The continuous improvement of the branch leadership level guaranteed the continuous development of the socialist transformation movement of agriculture. In 1954, the sixty-four agricultural production cooperatives that were piloted in the county were basically successful.

    The Zhenhai County Committee also mastered the following links in strengthening branch leadership:

    1. Continuously improve the district committee's understanding of branch work and improve the district committee's leadership methods. The rural branches in Zhenhai County were mostly newly established within a year or so, and their level was relatively low, and they needed to work under the specific help and guidance of the district committee. However, the district committee, like the county committee in the past, had many confused understandings in party building. To this end, the county committee successively convened district committee secretary meetings and organizational work cadre meetings to systematically educate on strengthening branch building. It criticized the district committee's erroneous ideas and styles of not cultivating the independent working ability of the branch and not relying on the branch to carry out work. At the same time, it also commended cadres who attached importance to branch work. In addition, in actual work, the county committee helped the district committee to specifically arrange the steps and methods of relying on the branch to carry out work, and timely summarized the leadership role of the branch, and used such examples to continue to educate the district committee. At present, the district committees can generally rely on the branch to carry out work, convene joint meetings of branch secretaries twice a month on average, and the style of cadres taking over has been initially corrected. Party member cadres from county-level organs who go to the countryside can report the branch work to the organization department of the county committee after returning to the county.

    2. Focus on the central work, cultivate branch leadership backbone, and improve the branch's leadership core. The county committee realized that the key to whether the branch can play the role of a fighting fortress lies in the strength of the leadership backbone. To this end, the county committee often carefully selected and cultivated branch secretaries and branch committee members, and paid attention to developing new party members among township cadres. In the 1953 general election, the county committee intentionally selected 41 outstanding rural party members as the leadership backbone of the branches, of which 13 have served as branch secretaries and 4 have served as branch committee members. At present, party members in township cadres account for more than 44% of all township cadres. The following methods were mainly adopted to cultivate the leadership ability of the branch leadership backbone: First, in combination with the central work, regularly convene joint meetings of branch secretaries to improve them from the deployment, research, and inspection and summary work; second, county and district cadres go to the countryside to specifically help the branch study the work, explain the policies and methods to the branch, and establish the branch's leadership prestige among the masses; third, the county and district committees timely summarize and exchange the work experience of advanced branches in various movements; fourth, regularly conduct short-term training.

    3. Strengthen the ideological education work of the branch and continuously improve the socialist awareness of party members. The county committee planned to transfer party members to training classes to educate them on the basic knowledge of the party and the direction of rural development; in combination with the central work, held party member cadre meetings at the county, district, or township level to educate them on the party's rural policies; selected good and bad typical examples based on the main ideological tendencies existing in the party at various times, organized study and discussion, and conducted criticism; the branch gradually established a regular education system, such as the party class system. Through this series of education, the socialist awareness of party members has been universally improved, and more than 94% of party members have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, of which 45 have served as directors of agricultural production cooperatives, thereby providing a reliable guarantee for the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    4. Strengthen the work at the base point, timely summarize and promote the experience of the base point, in order to guide and drive the work of general branches.

    中共镇海县委怎样加强了对农村支部工作的领导
    商恺
    中共浙江省镇海县委员会加强了对农村支部工作的领导。全县党的基层组织有很大发展。据一九五四年第四季度的统计，党员数量比一九五三年春季增加了将近七倍，百分之九十四以上的乡都建立了支部。这些支部里的党员经过对党在过渡时期总路线的学习，以及农业合作化运动的实际锻炼，政治觉悟和领导水平大有提高，已成了县委领导农村工作的重要依靠。
    在一九五三年以前，镇海县委对依靠党的基层组织领导农村工作的观点是不明确的。当时，全县八十个乡中，只有五个支部，党的基层组织非常薄弱。县委一直是采用派遣工作队的方法去进行工作。这就使他们产生了一种错觉，以为“没有党支部一样可以搞好工作”，把支部看成“可有可无”的东西。县委在这种思想的支配下，不仅忽视了建党工作，就是对原有的五个支部也放弃了领导。使它们长期处于无人管理的自流状态中。例如芃市支部的邱小毛，曾经找到县委组织部长去诉苦，他说：“过去，你们常来我们村里，现在谁也不来，把我们忘了。”这时候，县委仍然没有认识到自己的错误，没有从县委领导上去进行检查，反而满腹牢骚，埋怨别人，县委书记刘鲁军同志就曾说过：
  “依靠新党员，新党员太少；依靠老党员，老党员不起作用。”这句话的含意就是：只有继续依靠工作队去进行工作。
    一九五三年的春天，中共浙江省委召开了第六次全省组织工作会议。在这次会议上，镇海县委忽视支部工作的思想受到了批判。浙江省委和宁波地委警告他们说：“过去没有建党是错误，今后再不建党，就要犯更大的错误。”镇海县委根据上级党委的指示召开了会议。起初，县委的思想还搞不通，存在着埋怨情绪，说：“过去上级不布置建党，我们怎么建党呢？”后来，比较冷静地分析了全县党的基层组织情况，才比较清楚地看到了由于放弃对支部工作的领导所造成的严重恶果。会议又检查了县委组织部的工作，发现党员管理工作非常混乱，全县到底有多少党员，组织部就说不清楚，因而丢失党员组织关系的事情不断发生。曾有这样一件事情：有一个候补党员，由上海回到了镇海，当他把组织关系介绍信交到镇海县委组织部以后，在家等了半年多，也无人过问。后来，这个候补党员到县委组织部去查询，组织部还不知有这么一个党员。在会议上摆出了以上这些情况，引起了大家的重视。过去忽视支部工作的思想开始有了转变。于是拟定了建党计划，确定了组织员，先后召开了全县组织工作会议和全县区乡党员干部大会，进行动员，布置建党工作。
    以后，镇海县委的领导思想和领导作风是有了转变。但是这种转变，还不是完全自觉的转变。后来在县委机关的一次党的小组会议上，便暴露了这样的一些问题。比如县委互助合作部长王玉桥说：“建党、领导支部是他们（指组织部）的事，搞互助合作是我老王的事。”县委宣传部长沈相权也说：“我们宣传部的干部，都被拉去发展党员去了。”县委书记刘鲁军不断地支持组织部长关于加强党的建设的意见，也有人表示不满，说：“组织部长说话吃的开，委员也分大小。”
    不管如何，镇海县的建党工作总算展开了。从一九五三年夏季到一九五四年春季，新党员的数目增加很快，党的基层组织已逐步建立起来。在这一段时期，浙江省委及宁波地委又曾一再指示镇海县委：必须充分发挥党的基层组织作用，依靠党的基层组织去进行工作。但是镇海县的许多县区干部，包括县的领导干部在内，还缺乏通过党的基层组织进行工作的经验。因此，在这一段时期中，支部的工作情况是比较混乱的。首先表现在有些干部把依靠支部简单地理解为依靠“党员带头”，这些干部常常是带着自己早已作好了的计划下乡，进村就召开支部大会，号召党员带头完成任务，不对党员进行教育。光使用不教育，严重地影响了党员的工作积极性。郭巨区北峰乡支部就反映说：“带头带不动了”，产生了消极疲塌情绪。在当时，这样的情况，并不是个别的。同时支部工作的混乱还表现在：有些干部把通过支部进行工作，理解为“一切工作通过支部”，于是不分大事小事，甚至把乡政府的日常事务，也都搬到支部会上去讨论，去通过。这样，就使支部会的内容过多，开会的次数也过繁，代替了行政会议。例如，长山区小岗乡支部，两个月开了八次支部会，乡的行政会议却没开一次。
    在这一段时期中，另一方面，镇海县委的领导思想也发生了新的变化，对支部工作的领导，由过去不完全自觉逐渐转变成了完全自觉的行动。这主要是因为他们在实际工作中，亲自看到了支部所显示的巨大作用。例如，在一九五三年冬季的粮食统购统销工作中，当时的县委组织部长秦凤楼和几个干部到了长山乡。他们在长山乡依靠支部，对全乡群众的生产和生活情况进行了排队，经过详细的计算和比较，没过三天，就摸清了全乡的粮食情况。这对县委制订粮食统购统销工作的计划，有很大帮助。这样的例子还有很多。这就使县委清楚地看到：那里有党的支部，那里的工作就有了保证。所以在总结统购统销工作时，县委副书记李明感动地说：“要没有全县这八十个支部，这次的粮食统购任务是很难完成的。”县委领导干部中，转变最突出的是互助合作部长王玉桥。王玉桥曾亲眼看到，韩塘乡复兴农业生产合作社，由于社里的党员少，缺乏坚强的领导，就没有沿着社会主义的道路前进。王玉桥在对这个农业社的整顿过程中，更清楚地认识到了党的领导的重要性。他说：“农业的社会主义改造，离开党的领导，就不可能成功。”从此以后，他对支部工作非常关心。下乡检查互助合作运动，也同时检查支部工作。
    镇海县委在真正认识到了支部工作的重要性以后，就把党的建设列入了党委的议事日程。经常结合中心任务，统一研究和布置支部工作，加强了对支部工作的具体领导。到一九五四年冬季，全县党的基层组织的面貌，有了显著的转变。主要表现在支部的领导水平提高了，积极发挥了组织作用，其中有独立工作能力、能形成领导核心的支部，由从前的百分之十五增加到了百分之三十，领导能力比较弱的、在群众中的威信不高的、只有少数党员起作用的支部，由过去的百分之二十，降到了百分之十。支部领导水平的不断提高，保证了农业的社会主义改造运动的不断发展。一九五四年，全县试办的六十四个农业生产合作社，基本上获得了成功。
    镇海县委在加强支部领导方面，还掌握了以下几个环节：
    一、不断地提高区委对支部工作的认识，改进区委的领导方法。镇海县的农村支部，大都是在一年多的时间内新建立的，水平比较低，需要在区委的具体帮助和指导下进行工作。但是，区委也和县委过去的情况一样，在党的建设上存在着许多糊涂认识。为此，县委先后召开了区委书记会议和组织工作干部会议，系统地进行了关于加强支部建设的教育。批判了区委不培养支部独立工作能力、不依靠支部进行工作的错误思想和作风。同时也表扬了重视支部工作的干部。此外，县委在实际工作中，帮助区委具体安排依靠支部进行工作的步骤和方法，及时总结支部的领导作用，并用这样的实例继续向区委进行教育。目前，各区委一般都能作到依靠支部去进行工作，平均每月能召开两次支部书记联席会议，干部的包办代替作风已得到初步纠正。县级机关下乡的党员干部，回县后都能向县委组织部汇报支部工作情况。
    二、围绕中心工作，培养支部领导骨干，健全支部的领导核心。县委认识到，支部能否发挥战斗堡垒作用，关键在于领导骨干的强弱。为此，县委经常地认真地挑选和培养支部书记和支部委员，并注意在乡干部中发展新党员。在一九五三年普选工作中，县委有意地选拔了四十一名优秀的农村党员作为支部的领导骨干，其中有十三名已担任了支部书记，四名担任了支部委员。目前乡干部中的党员已占到全体乡干部的百分之四十四以上。培养支部领导骨干的领导能力，主要采取了以下几种方法：第一，结合中心工作，定期召开支部书记联席会议，从布置、研究和检查总结工作中提高他们；第二，县区干部下乡具体帮助支部研究工作，向支部交代政策，交代办法，树立支部在群众中的领导威信；第三，县区委在各项运动中，及时总结交流先进支部的工作经验；第四，定期集中，进行短期训练。
    三、加强支部的思想教育工作，不断地提高党员的社会主义觉悟。县委有计划地调党员到训练班进行党的基本知识和农村发展方向的教育；结合中心工作，以县或以区以乡为单位，召开党员干部会议，进行党在农村的方针政策教育；根据各个时期党内存在的主要思想倾向，选择出好坏典型，组织学习讨论，进行批判；支部逐步建立经常的教育制度，如党课制等。通过这一系列的教育，党员的社会主义觉悟获得了普遍的提高，百分之九十四以上的党员都参加了互助合作组织，其中有四十五名当了农业生产合作社的主任，从而使农业的社会主义改造事业获得了可靠的保证。
    四、加强基点工作，及时总结推广基点经验，以指导和带动一般支部的工作。
