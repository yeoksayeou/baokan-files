Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 2nd: TASS Moscow, March 1st: I. Zekhonia authored an article in "Pravda" commenting on the reasons for the serious setback suffered by the Liberal Party in the Japanese Diet's House of Representatives election.

The article said: The Liberal Party and the Liberal Party government led by Yoshida became notorious during their time in power for being faithful executors of all political and military measures implemented by the United States in Japan. It was the Liberal Party government that tied Japan's hands with a series of intricate treaties and agreements concluded with the United States.

The same is true in the economic sphere, especially in foreign trade, where the Liberal Party government's policies have caused tragic consequences for the broad masses of the Japanese people. While subjecting the country to American "aid" agreements, the Liberal Party government also put Japan's economy on the track of American military orders – thus seriously harming Japan's national interests.

Japan is facing an unavoidable crisis. Because Japan has not established normal commercial relations with the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and other countries in the socialist camp, Japan has lost reliable markets for its products and sources of raw materials.

The Japanese people judge the Liberal Party not by their words, but by their actions.

The article added that the Democratic Party could not fail to take this situation into account. Its leader, Hatoyama, first announced his intention to adjust relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China at the party's inaugural congress last November, promising to develop cultural relations with them, especially commercial relations. This statement was the basic platform of the Democratic Party's campaign program. Some specific measures taken by the Hatoyama government to establish contact in order to arrange negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union further strengthened the Democratic Party's influence on voters.

When discussing the situation of other parties, the article said that the election results showed that the left-wing parties gained more seats, especially the left-wing socialists. The article pointed out that the left-wing and right-wing socialists won new seats in the Diet with the assistance of the Japanese Communist Party, which withdrew its candidates in some constituencies during the election in order to ensure united action against the conservative forces.

The article concluded by summarizing the election results, saying: It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the majority of the Japanese people voted in favor of adjusting relations with their neighbors – the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China – in favor of expanding economic and cultural ties with them, and in favor of Japan's peaceful development.

Time will prove how the Democratic Party, which now has a majority in the Diet, will fulfill its promises made during the election: to normalize relations with Japan's neighbors, which the majority of the Japanese people insist on very firmly.

### “真理报”载文评论日本众议院选举的结果  指出日本大多数人民赞成日本同中苏恢复正常关系

    “真理报”载文评论日本众议院选举的结果
    指出日本大多数人民赞成日本同中苏恢复正常关系
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：伊·泽霍尼亚在“真理报”上著文评论在日本国会众议院选举中自由党遭到严重挫败的原因。
    文章说：由吉田领导的自由党和自由党政府，在他们当政时期以充当美国在日本实施的一切政治和军事措施的忠实执行人而臭名远扬。用和美国缔结的一系列的错综复杂的条约和协定来束缚日本的手脚的就是自由党政府。
    在经济方面，特别是对外贸易方面，也是这样，自由党政府的政策已使日本广大人民遭受到悲惨的后果。自由党政府在使这个国家受到美“援”协定束缚的同时，还把日本的经济纳入美国军事订货的轨道——这样就严重危害了日本民族利益。
    日本面临着不可避免的危机。由于日本同中华人民共和国、苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家没有建立正常商业关系，日本就丧失了它的产品的可靠市场和原料来源。
    日本人民判断自由党，不是根据他们的言论，而是根据他们的行动来判断的。
    文章又说，民主党不能不考虑到这种情况。它的领袖鸠山，在去年十一月这个党成立大会上第一次宣布他打算调整同苏联以及中华人民共和国的关系时，曾保证发展同它们的文化关系，特别是商业关系。这个声明是民主党竞选纲领的基本政纲。鸠山政府用来建立联系以便安排日本同苏联之间的谈判的一些具体措施，进一步加强了民主党对选民的影响。
    文章谈到其他党派的情况时说，选举结果表明左派多得了一些席位，特别是左派社会党人。文章指出，左派和右派社会党人赢得新的国会席位是得到了日本共产党的协助的，日本共产党在选举中为了保证以一致的行动来对付保守力量曾将它在一些选区的候选人撤回。
    文章最后综述选举的结果时说：可以毫不用担心会言过其实地说，大多数的日本人民投票赞成调整和他们邻国——苏联和中华人民共和国——的关系，赞成扩大和它们的经济和文化的联系，赞成日本的和平发展。
    时间将证明现在在国会中拥有多数的民主党将如何来履行它在选举时提出的诺言：使和日本邻国的关系正常化，而这是日本大多数人民非常坚决地坚持的。
