    Afforestation Movement Unfolds in Southern Jiangxi

    The Ganzhou Administrative Region of Jiangxi Province, a well-known timber-producing area, has launched a large-scale spring afforestation movement. Currently, the 18 counties in the region have afforested more than 334,000 mu, reaching more than 70 percent of the original plan. The ten counties including Dayu, Xingguo, Dingnan, and Shangyou, which have completed their original planting plans, have shifted to nurturing and protecting seedlings. In order to further protect the trees from damage, the Ganzhou Administrative Office recently dispatched forestry work inspection teams to various places to assist in the work. (Jiang Yi)

    江西南部地区展开造林运动
    有名的木材产地江西省赣南行政区展开了大规模的春季造林运动。目前全区十八个县已造林三十三万四千多亩，达原定计划的百分之七十多。目前已完成原订种植计划的大庾、兴国、定南、上犹等十个县已转入抚育和保护幼苗的工作。为进一步保护林木不受损失，赣南行署于最近又派出了林业工作检查组到各地帮助工作。             （姜　毅）
