Newspaper Review

	Supporting the Struggle Against Extravagance and Waste

	Recently, the "New Hunan Daily" has been continuously criticizing the ideological style of some leading cadres in factories and mines who emphasize ostentation while neglecting the lives and safety of workers in production. On February 26th, the "New Hunan Daily" reprinted a letter from a worker in the "Electric Motor Worker" newspaper of the Xiangtan Electric Motor Factory. The letter criticized the Xiangtan Electric Motor Factory for spending more than 20 million old currency to build a sprinkler pond in a green area that was not urgently needed, but failed to provide workers with urgently needed living equipment that would not cost much, such as stools in the cafeteria, reading rooms in the library, and electric lights in the toilets. The reprinted article "Let the Head of the General Affairs Section Give a Public ‘Explanation’" criticized the General Affairs Section head of this factory for disregarding workers' criticisms. In the editor's note, the "New Hunan Daily" pointed out the mistake of the Xiangtan Electric Motor Factory in emphasizing ostentation while neglecting the daily lives of workers, and demanded that the factory's Party committee supervise the relevant departments within the factory to earnestly improve their work and support the criticisms made by the "Electric Motor Worker" newspaper.
	This criticism in the newspaper aroused a response from readers. For example, nine employees of the Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory wrote a letter to the "New Hunan Daily" after seeing the newspaper's support for the criticism made by the "Electric Motor Worker" newspaper. In addition to expressing their support for the newspaper's criticism, the letter also revealed that the Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory spent a lot of money to build large ponds and walls, etc., but did not repair the dilapidated and crumbling factory buildings that threatened the safety of workers, did not open skylights in workshops with heavy smoke and prone to accidents, and did not solve the problem of missing protective covers on the transmission parts of machines.
	The Party and the government have long pointed out that in order to accumulate funds for socialist industrialization, the people of the whole country, especially the cadres of state organs and enterprises, need to be diligent, thrifty, and practice strict economy. However, some enterprise cadres, under the pretext of seeking benefits for the working masses, are busy building projects that are not urgently needed; on the other hand, they do not pay attention to solving problems that must be solved in the lives of the working masses and can be solved. Therefore, the criticisms of the "New Hunan Daily" and the "Electric Motor Worker" newspaper have universal educational significance.

    支持反铺张浪费的斗争
    新湖南报近来对一些厂矿企业领导干部讲究排场，而不关心工人生活疾苦和生产安全的思想作风，进行了连续的批评。二月二十六日的新湖南报，转载了湘潭电机厂“电机工人”报上的一封工人来信。信中批评了湘潭电机厂用二千多万元旧币修建了当前并不急需的绿化区的喷水池，但是却不置办工人生活上迫切需要而又花钱不多的生活用具，如食堂的凳子，图书馆的阅览室和厕所中的电灯。同时转载的“让总务科长公开‘解释’吧”一文，批评了这个工厂的总务科长漠视工人批评的态度。新湖南报在编者按语中，指出了湘潭电机厂这种讲究排场而不关心工人日常生活的错误，要求工厂党委会监督厂内有关部门切实改进工作，对“电机工人”报的批评给予了支持。
    报纸上的这个批评，引起了读者的反响。例如衡阳矿山机械厂的九个职工看到新湖南报对
  “电机工人”报批评的支持之后，就给新湖南报写来了信。信中除表示拥护报纸的批评外，又揭露了衡阳矿山机械厂花大量的钱修建大水池、围墙等等，却不修理破旧欲倒的、威胁着工人安全的车间厂房，不给烟雾多、容易发生事故的车间开设天窗，不解决机器传动部分缺少防护罩的问题。
    党和政府早已指出，为了给社会主义工业化建设积累资金，就需要全国人民特别是国家机关、企业的干部，勤俭朴素，厉行节约。但是有些企业干部，却借口为工人群众谋福利，忙于兴建当前并不急需的建设；另一方面，对于工人群众生活中必须解决而又能够解决的问题，又不注意解决。因此，新湖南报以及“电机工人”报的这种批评，是有着普遍教育意义的。
