    Collaborative Relationships in the Basic Construction System of the Ministry of Fuel Industry Urgently Need Improvement
    Sun Rong

    Currently, in the basic construction work of the fuel industry system, the relationship between Party A (the construction unit) and Party B (the construction contractor) is abnormal in many respects, and in some cases, quite tense, causing many unnecessary losses to the basic construction work. The reasons for the abnormal relationship between Party A and Party B, in addition to the objective difficulties caused by insufficient experience in planning work, unrealistic and frequently changing plans, geological and design work lagging behind and failing to provide the necessary information in a timely manner, and imperfect systems, are mainly due to the lack of an overall perspective on both sides, with varying degrees of departmentalism. This manifests in the compilation of quotas or budgets, where Party B often overestimates labor and materials in order to earn more money, mistakenly treating the relationship between Party A and Party B in state-owned enterprises as that of capitalist business owners and contractors. In one power transmission line project contracted by the Power Transmission and Transformation Company, the labor alone was overestimated by 25,000 workdays. When the East China Power Construction Bureau contracted a boiler installation project at Nanjing Institute of Technology, it initially proposed 3,000 workdays, which was changed three times, eventually settling at 1,100 workdays; while the actual labor used was only 1,000 workdays. For a project contracted by the Lanzhou team of the Northwest Thermal Power Company of the Northwest Power Administration, the budget was 1.1 billion yuan (old currency), while the actual expenditure was 560 million yuan, with approximately 300 million yuan being excessive profits. When Party A requested Party B to return the excessive profits, Party B firmly refused, and the Bank of Communications determined the excess profit to be 330 million yuan. The profit of the Xining Power Plant project contracted by the Seventh Engineering Company even reached over 50% of the workload. Party A personnel also often fail to proceed from reality and deliberately lower the budget, thus causing disputes. Last year, when the Datong Mining Bureau compiled the budget for a project, it simultaneously adopted five types of quotas, using whichever was the "most advanced," resulting in a budget that was difficult for Party B to accept; later, the budget compiled by Party B was also deemed unreasonable by Party A, thus preventing the signing of a contract.

    In terms of quality inspection and acceptance of projects, instead of actively cooperating to do the work well under the premise of ensuring project quality, the two sides often argue their own points of view. In particular, Party B often believes that it has experience and is unwilling to be supervised by Party A, unwilling to humbly consider and accept Party A's opinions, believing that Party A "pretends to understand" and "only knows how to nitpick." Many power transmission project personnel believe that since large-scale projects like the 506 have been completed, other projects are not worth mentioning. Cement workers are not used when pouring concrete, and some even fail to construct according to the construction drawings, causing quality accidents. At the construction site of the Baotou Power Plant, Party B personnel stood aside and ridiculed Party A personnel when they inspected the center line stakes of the chimney foundation.

    In terms of daily work, there is mutual buck-passing, lack of communication, and lack of cooperation. For the ventilation shaft project of the Kailuan Coal Mine and the erection of power lines for the substation, both parties should have contacted the Power Bureau and the district government beforehand, but neither Party A nor Party B took care of it, resulting in the inability to start construction when the time came. In the Zaozhuang Power Plant project, Party A and Party B were only a wall apart, but they did not consult with each other when problems arose, resorting to official correspondence at every turn. Before the start of the project, Party B never went to the construction site to clean up the site and prepare materials and equipment.

    The contracting method in state-owned enterprise basic construction is advanced and is a socialist basic construction management system. The relationship between Party A and Party B that it embodies is a relationship of division of labor, responsibility, and cooperation. Their common task (and only task) is to jointly strive to complete the state's basic construction plan on schedule or ahead of schedule, in accordance with the requirements of the national plan and the Party and state's basic construction policy of "good, fast, economical, and safe," by adopting different working methods. Their starting point is the overall interests of the Party and the state, their working method is to strengthen coordination and cooperation with each other, and the basis for their work activities is the various management systems stipulated by the state. Therefore, the primary task in improving the relationship between Party A and Party B is to strengthen the overall thinking of both parties, overcome departmentalism, and strengthen coordination and cooperation. Criticism and self-criticism should be carried out for incorrect thoughts and behaviors. Secondly, planning work should be actively improved and strengthened, placing the plan on a reliable foundation; geological and design work should be strengthened, striving to provide the various materials needed for construction as soon as possible; various systems should be gradually established and improved, and various quotas should be formulated and revised to make them feasible, so as to serve as the basis for compiling design budgets and construction budgets, thereby signing construction contracts as soon as possible. It is undeniable that, due to our lack of experience and low technical level, there are currently many objective difficulties in basic construction work. These require both Party A and Party B to strive to create conditions subjectively to overcome difficulties and gradually seek solutions. Only in this way can we achieve the improvement of the relationship between Party A and Party B, reduce and overcome the difficulties caused objectively, and jointly do a good job in basic construction.

    燃料工业部基本建设系统的协作关系急需改善
    孙容
    目前燃料工业系统基本建设工作中，甲（建设单位）、乙（施工单位）方关系在许多方面表现得不正常，而且有的十分紧张，给基本建设工作造成许多不应有的损失。产生甲、乙方关系不正常的原因，除了因计划工作经验不足，计划制订得不切合实际、变动多，地质、设计工作赶不上，不能及时提出所需要的资料，以及各项制度不健全，给双方在工作上造成若干客观困难外，主要是甲、乙双方缺乏整体观念，存在着程度不同的本位主义思想，遇事不协商，彼此之间不团结。这种思想表现在编制定额或预算时，乙方往往为了多赚钱就多估工料，错误地把国营企业的甲、乙方关系当作资本主义的企业主和包商的关系。电业送变电公司承包的一项送电线工程，仅仅人工一项就多估了二万五千工。华东电业修建局在承包南京工学院一个锅炉安装工程时，最初提出三千工，经三次变更，最后确定为一千一百工；而实际只用一千工。西北电业管理局西北火电公司兰州队承包的一项工程，预算为十一亿元（旧币，下同），实际用五亿六千万元，其中属于暴利的约三亿元。甲方要乙方退还暴利部分，乙方坚决不退，结果交通银行确定三亿三千万元为超额利润。第七工程公司承包的西宁电厂工程利润竟达工作量的百分之五十以上。甲方人员也往往不从实际出发，故意压低预算，因而引起纠纷。去年大同矿务局在编制一个工程的预算时，同时采用五种定额，哪一种“最先进”就采用哪一种，结果预算编出后，使乙方难于接受；后来乙方编制的预算，甲方也认为不合理，因而合同签订不了。
    表现在工程质量检查和工程验收上，则不是在保证工程质量的前提下双方积极合作把工作作好，而常常是各执一词，特别是乙方往往认为自己有经验，不愿受甲方监督，不虚心考虑和接受甲方意见，认为甲方是“不懂装懂”、“只会挑毛病”。不少送变电工程人员认为像五○六那样的大工程都做过了，别的工程算不了啥。在浇灌混凝土时不用水泥工，有的甚至不按施工图施工，造成质量事故。在包头电厂工地上，甲方人员检查烟囱基础中心线标桩时，乙方人员站在一旁讥笑。
    表现在日常工作上则互相推诿，彼此不联系、不协作。开滦煤矿的风井工程和变电站的电线架设，双方事先原应跟电业局及区政府联系，但甲、乙双方都不管，结果到开工时开不了工。在枣庄电厂工程中，甲、乙双方仅一墙之隔，而遇事互不商量，动辄以公文来往。在工程开工前乙方一直未到工地清理现场和准备材料、设备。
    国营企业基本建设的包工方式是先进的，是社会主义基本建设管理制度，其所体现的甲、乙方的关系是一种分工负责、分工合作的关系。它们共同的任务（也是唯一的任务），是在国家计划的要求下，按照党和国家基本建设“好、快、省、安全”的方针，采取不同的工作方法，共同努力按期或提前完成国家的基本建设计划。他们一切的出发点是党和国家的整体利益，工作的方法是彼此之间加强配合和协作，而工作活动的依据则是国家规定的各项管理制度，因此改善甲、乙方之间的关系首要的是加强甲、乙双方的整体思想，克服本位主义思想，加强配合协作。对于不正确的思想和行为，则应开展批评和自我批评。其次应积极改善和加强计划工作，将计划放在可靠的基础上；加强地质和设计工作，争取及早提出建设所需要的各种资料；逐步建立和健全各项制度，制订和修改各项定额，使之切实可行，以作为编制设计预算和施工预算的依据，从而尽速签订包工合同。不可否认：由于我们的经验不足，以及技术水平低，当前基本建设工作中存在着不少的客观困难。这些都需要甲、乙双方从主观上努力创造条件克服困难，逐步求得解决。只有如此才能求得甲、乙方关系的改善，减少和克服客观上所造成的困难，共同搞好基本建设工作。
