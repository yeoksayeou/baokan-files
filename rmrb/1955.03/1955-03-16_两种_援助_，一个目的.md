    Two Kinds of "Aid," One Purpose
    Li Gao
    The United States has recently been vigorously promoting its increased "aid" to Asian countries, supposedly to help them achieve "stability" and "development."
    However, on March 11, U.S. Deputy Undersecretary of State Murphy added an impolite footnote to this "aid." He said that the basis for the U.S. considering "aid" is "the deep conviction that the people of Asian countries can only realize their economic aspirations as members of the free world." Isn't this too obvious? U.S. "aid" is to force the people of Asian countries to become members of the "free world" under U.S. jurisdiction.
    This is one type of U.S. "aid."
    Meanwhile, in the trials of some rebels in Indonesian courts, people have also seen another type of "aid" being conducted by the United States in Asia.
    A former soldier of the Netherlands East Indies Army, Manoch, who participated in the rebellion, testified in court that he had used aircraft from the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia and the U.S. New Jersey-New York Mobil Oil Company to "aid" the rebels by air-dropping weapons and food. Another defendant, the so-called "Prime Minister of the South Moluccas Republic," Weirlissar, confessed in court on March 3 that they had connections with the United States. He said that they had planned to "lease" the Indonesian seaport of Makassar to the United States, receiving a rent of 13 million guilders per year to "solve" the "financial problems" of the rebel forces.
    It seems that the so-called "aid" from the United States, whether publicly promoted or secretly carried out, has the same purpose: to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries and undermine their independence and autonomy.

    两种“援助”，一个目的
    李高
    美国最近又在大肆宣传它将增加对亚洲国家的“援助”，据说是为了帮助它们获得“稳定”和“发展”。
    可是，三月十一日美国副国务卿墨菲却给这种“援助”下了一个不客气的注脚。他说美国考虑
  “援助”的基础“是深信亚洲各国人民只有作为自由世界的成员才能实现他们的经济方面的愿望”。这不是太明显了吗？美国的“援助”就是要迫使亚洲各国人民做美国所管辖的“自由世界的成员”。
    这是美国的一种“援助”。
    同时，在印度尼西亚法庭对一些叛乱分子的审讯中，人们还看到美国在亚洲进行着的另外一种
  “援助”。
    曾经参与叛乱活动的前荷兰东印度陆军士兵曼罗赫在法庭上作证说，他曾使用驻印度尼西亚美国大使馆的飞机和美国新泽西—纽约美孚油公司的飞机，去“援助”叛乱分子，给他们空投武器和粮食。另一被告，所谓“南摩鹿加共和国总理”韦里萨尔三月三日又在法庭上供认他们和美国有联系。他说，他们曾计划把印度尼西亚的海港望加锡“租借”给美国，每年取得租金一千三百万盾，来“解决”叛乱部队的“财政问题”。
    看来美国的所谓“援助”，无论是公开宣扬的或是秘密进行的，都有着一样的目的：干涉亚洲国家内政，破坏他们的独立自主。
