Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: TASS, New York, March 18th: As the date for the Asian-African Conference draws nearer, American newspapers are increasingly revealing the anxiety of the American ruling circles. They fear that the Asian-African Conference may help expose the imperialist conspiracies carried out by the United States against the people of these countries.

In this regard, an article published by Grant, the Washington correspondent of the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch," in that newspaper is noteworthy. He wrote that "the United States hopes that the Asian-African Conference will not be held at all." But since the United States cannot prevent the conference from being held, it wants some of its "friends" in the Near East and Southeast Asia to guide the progress of the conference in a way that suits the United States.

However, Grant admits that due to the overall position of the United States in Asia, the situation of the American "friends" attending the conference will be very difficult.

Grant recalled Dulles' advocacy of a policy of force at the recent Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting in Bangkok. He regretted that Asian and African countries "have a strong tendency to minimize the role of force." He said that "the American posture of force" will very likely be interpreted as an American "posture of domination over Asia."

    害怕侵略阴谋被揭露
    美国打算从内部破坏亚非会议
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：由于召开亚非会议的日期越来越近，美国报纸的报道越来越多地透露了美国统治集团的不安情绪。他们担心亚非会议可能有助于揭露美国对这些国家的人民所进行的帝国主义阴谋。
    关于这一点，“圣路易邮报”驻华盛顿记者格兰特在这家报纸上发表的一篇文章是值得注意的。他写道，“美国希望根本就不召开亚非会议”。但是既然美国不能够阻止这个会议的召开，它就要它的近东和东南亚的某些“朋友”把会议的进展导向适合美国的途径。
    但是格兰特承认，由于美国在亚洲的总的地位，出席会议的美国的“朋友”的处境将是很困难的。
    格兰特追述杜勒斯在最近在曼谷召开的东南亚条约组织会议上主张武力政策。他遗憾地说，但是，亚洲和非洲国家却“有尽量缩小武力的作用的强烈倾向”。他说，“美国的武力姿态”将被解释成为美国“统治亚洲的姿态”，这是非常可能的。
