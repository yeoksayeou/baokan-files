    The dredging project on the Right River, the main waterway of the Guangxi Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has been basically completed recently. For more than four months, thousands of workers and technicians, with the assistance of dredgers, have dredged ninety shoals, dangers, and reefs of various sizes.

    In the past, the Right River was not navigable for ships during the dry season from December to April of the following year. After the completion of this dredging project, ships can navigate the more than 300-kilometer route from Nanning to Baise all year round. At the same time, the ship's load capacity and turnover rate can also be improved, which facilitates the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

    Recently, the Nanning Branch of the Pearl River Shipping Administration has also set up various luminous navigation aids along the Right River, preparing to implement day and night navigation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    右江疏浚工程基本完工
    广西省桂西僮族自治区主要航道——右江的疏浚工程已在最近基本完工。四个多月以来，成千的工人和技术人员，在挖泥船的协助下，共疏浚了大小滩险、礁石九十处。
    过去右江在每年十二月到次年四月枯水时期，轮船不能通航；这次疏浚工程完工后，南宁到百色的三百多公里航线，一年四季轮船都可以通航了，同时船舶载重量和周转率也可以提高，便利了城乡物资交流。
    最近，珠江航运管理局南宁分局并在右江沿线设立夜间发光的各种助航标志，准备实行日夜通航。　（新华社）
