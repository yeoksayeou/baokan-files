Refuting Sophistry to Cover Up American War Conspiracies
Hu Jin

The American aggressive bloc suffered a miserable defeat in its war policy in Asia at the Geneva Conference. Therefore, immediately after the Geneva Conference, it convened the Manila Conference to organize the sabotage of the Geneva Accords, and hurriedly convened the Bangkok Conference before the Asian-African Conference to equip the Southeast Asia Treaty with "teeth." Its purpose is clearly to intensify tensions in Asia, divide Asia, maintain and expand its colonial rule in Asia, and drive its so-called allies to help it wage war. Its spearhead is mainly directed at the People's Republic of China. At the same time, it also seeks to intimidate the people of Asian countries and Asian independent and autonomous countries with so-called "strength," attempting to force them to abandon peaceful cooperation, submit to the US war policy and colonial rule, and serve the US's aggressive demands.

If the dangerous steps taken at the Bangkok Conference and the US aggressive bloc's exposed conspiracy plans to harm peace are not stopped, they will pose a more serious threat to the peace and security of the region and Asia.

In order to whitewash its image and cover up its actual intentions, the US aggressive bloc and its followers deliberately used some words of peace in the Bangkok Conference communiqué, claiming that their military arrangements were "defensive," pretending to champion "non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries," and even shamelessly saying that they wanted to realize the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. It can truly be called "doing all the bad things and saying all the good things." However, this clumsy trick of the American aggressors can never deceive the eyes and ears of the people of Asia and the world.

The Bangkok Conference communiqué stipulates that this military group will establish "military advisors" and "staff planners" to plan "military cooperation," attempting to form a "mobile strike force" commanded by American generals. It is not worth refuting the claim that these military measures of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc are "defensive."

China and important Asian countries are working hard to seek peaceful coexistence and international cooperation. Apart from the Western colonial countries headed by the United States sending their troops to Asia, tens of thousands of kilometers away from their borders, to carry out various aggressive and threatening activities, no Asian country has carried out any aggression against the United States, Britain, or France. Therefore, the US-British bloc's unwarranted establishment of military groups and mobile troops in Asia, and its intention to "use Asians to fight Asians," is of course aimed at strengthening aggression, not so-called defense.

In fact, Dulles also openly admitted at the Bangkok Conference that "the United States regards the situations in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Korea as part of a whole situation," attempting to continue to expand its aggressive activities and encirclement of China from these three fronts. He also boasted that the United States already has a million troops backed by atomic weapons in the Far East, tens of thousands of kilometers away from the United States, "bearing its military obligations in the Far East," vainly attempting to use this to intimidate the Chinese people and the Asian people. To say that these activities are not aggression but defense, only Hitler and Tojo can agree, and no one with conscience can admit it.

The Bangkok Conference confirmed the US's further conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Accords. The communiqué reiterated the Southeast Asia Treaty's violation of the Geneva Accords by forcibly including Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam into the "protected" area. This shows that the United States wants to further interfere in the situation in Indochina and undermine the peace in Indochina.

It is clear that the United States is using the Bangkok Conference to coerce its allies to sabotage the Geneva Accords, but some people say that the Southeast Asia Treaty "strengthens the Geneva Accords." Everyone knows that the Geneva Accords created a collective guarantee for peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, while the Southeast Asia Treaty undermined this collective guarantee and formed a hostile military alliance. The Geneva Accords stipulate that reinforcing military materials and military personnel shall not be transported into Indochina. However, in order to achieve the goal of undermining peace in Indochina, the United States openly trains and expands Bao Dai's army in South Vietnam, increases military aid, and assists in the construction of military ports in Cambodia, planning to train and equip the Laotian and Cambodian armies. These, of course, violate the above-mentioned provisions of the Geneva Accords, allowing a large influx of reinforcing military materials and military personnel into Indochina. The United States also subsidized and dispatched armed bandits to carry out riots in Sam Neua of the Lao People's Liberation Army, attempting to occupy Sam Neua and Phong Saly. During the Bangkok Conference, the United States even clamored for "joint action" against Indochina. All of these are serious violations of the Geneva Accords. To say that these actions are "strengthening the Geneva Accords" is a serious distortion and insult to the Geneva Accords. Those who make this statement are not only completely departing from the spirit of the Geneva Accords, but are also intentionally justifying the US's aggressive behavior.

In order to facilitate their sabotage of the Geneva Accords, the United States and its followers also falsely accused the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Lao People's Liberation Army of violating the ceasefire agreement. However, the US's slander will not achieve its purpose. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as the Khmer resistance forces and the Lao People's Liberation Army, have faithfully fulfilled the ceasefire agreement and have been recognized by the International Supervisory and Control Commission.

The American aggressive bloc has also launched propaganda slandering China, insisting that China's Dai Autonomous Region is the center of so-called free Thailand, thereby fabricating the so-called tension on the Thai border out of thin air, so that it can drag Cambodia and other three countries into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. Everyone knows that China's ethnic minority autonomous regions are systems that are universally practiced in our country. In addition to the Dai Autonomous Region, there are many ethnic minority autonomous regions, including the Mongolian, Korean, and Uzbek autonomous regions. These are all facts that have long been announced. The US's attempt to fabricate slander against China's Dai Autonomous Region to undermine the Geneva Accords can only arouse greater anger from the Chinese people and Asian people of justice.

The Asian people do not believe in so-called "aggression" and "threat" from China. On the contrary, they clearly see that the United States is using the trick of "preventing subversive activities" to strengthen interference in the internal affairs of various countries. As the Indian "Free Press" pointed out, the Southeast Asia Treaty is "a challenge to the independence and self-esteem of the Asian people." However, the Bangkok Conference communiqué still emphasized that their "one of the primary tasks" is to "strengthen cooperative measures in anti-subversion and infiltration activities," "exchange information," dispatch special agents, and carry out subversive and destructive activities.

The facts of the United States engaging in espionage and sabotage activities in Asian countries have long been endless. The United States' attempt to overthrow the current government of Indonesia by buying and instigating traitors, and even organizing armed rebellions, is well known. All these facts show that any country that implements an independent and peaceful policy is intolerable to the United States.

The Bangkok Conference even passed a resolution specifically on the Asian-African Conference, exerting pressure on the Asian-African Conference and making preparations for sabotage in advance. This resolution openly attempts to impose the "tasks" and "principles" touted by the Southeast Asia Treaty, which have nothing in common with the purposes of the Asian-African Conference, on the Asian-African Conference, and requires that the results of the Asian-African Conference "will further guarantee" the goals of this colonial country's military group. Does this not prove that the Southeast Asia Treaty is hostile to peace, hostile to friendly cooperation in Asia?

The Southeast Asia aggressive bloc has extremely obvious goals of undermining peace and preparing for war. However, the defenders of the Bangkok Conference have tried their best to say that the Southeast Asia aggressive organization does not threaten anyone and is not directed at anyone. This is obviously nonsense. The communiqué of the conference unambiguously pointed out that the hostile target of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc is "international communism." In Asia, this clearly refers to the People's Republic of China. In this way, this military group of colonial countries is attempting to turn Asia back into a source of war, maintain and strengthen the colonialist system, and enslave the people of this region. It seriously threatens the independence, sovereignty, peace, and security of the Asian people. The Asian people have already seen this very clearly. The "Rangoon Daily" pointed out in criticizing the Bangkok Conference: It is "laughable" that the Southeast Asia Treaty countries "want to discuss the 'security' issues of Southeast Asia in the name of 'Southeast Asian countries'. In fact, the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty is only a tool for the United States to invade Asia, and the so-called 'security' in the Southeast Asia region is the United States creating wars in Southeast Asia in order to seize profits. Therefore, all countries that have not participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty must rise up to oppose the United States' conspiracy to create wars in this region and alienate the feelings of Southeast Asian countries, especially the conspiracy to drag these countries into a war of aggression against new China." This reflects the just public opinion of Southeast Asian countries. Such public opinion proves that any defense and disguise by the United States and its followers is a waste of effort.

It must be pointed out that when the American aggressive bloc is arrogantly pursuing its war policy, if Britain adopts a more sensible and clearer policy, the United States would not dare to act so recklessly. The success of the Geneva Accords is an example. At that time, the British authorities gained the support of the British people and the praise of the people of the world because it could contribute to peace. Conversely, when the British authorities try their best to follow the United States and help the United States create tension, they will inevitably encounter various due opposition at home and abroad, making their situation extremely difficult. After the Geneva Conference, the British authorities, regardless of the wishes of the British people, circumvented and closely followed every aggressive step of the United States. It violated the will of the British people and followed the United States in holding the Manila Conference and the Bangkok Conference, organizing aggressive military groups, condoning the United States' sabotage of the Geneva Accords, creating absurd bases for the United States, and supporting the United States' occupation of Taiwan. The British authorities may think that relying on the United States can maintain its colonial rule. But in fact, the British authorities can neither prevent American imperialism from increasingly intensifying the division of the so-called British Commonwealth, replacing Britain's colonial position in Asia and the Middle East, nor is it possible to establish genuine peaceful cooperation with the Asian people by following the United States in creating tension in Asia. If some people in the British authorities insist on being obsessed with the old dreams of the nineteenth century, thinking that relying on the so-called hard-line policy can intimidate the Chinese people and the Asian people, if they think that what the United States' "strength policy" cannot do, Britain can do, then the Chinese people and the vast majority of the Asian people, who have forever broken away from the nineteenth century, will definitely have the power to make them sober up.

The Bangkok Conference attempts to overthrow the results of the Geneva Conference, which are warmly welcomed by millions of people. The American aggressive bloc and its followers want to replace the international consultation and peaceful cooperation that have already begun since the Geneva Conference with the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, with war and colonialism. This is an open confrontation with the Asian people and the peace-loving people of the world, and a clear challenge to the people's desire for peace. The people will never fail to be vigilant here. The Chinese people will certainly fight to the end together with the Asian people and all peace-loving people to smash the war conspiracy of the American aggressive bloc.

    驳斥掩饰美国战争阴谋的诡辩
    胡今
    美国侵略集团在亚洲的战争政策，在日内瓦会议上遭到了悲惨的失败。因此，它紧跟着日内瓦会议之后就召开马尼拉会议来组织破坏日内瓦协议，紧赶在亚非会议之前召开曼谷会议来给东南亚条约装上“牙齿”。它的目的显然是要加剧亚洲紧张局势，分裂亚洲、保持和扩大它在亚洲的殖民统治，驱使它的所谓盟国帮它进行战争。它的矛头主要是针对着中华人民共和国。同时，它也是要以所谓“实力”来吓倒亚洲各国人民和亚洲独立自主的国家，企图迫使他们放弃和平合作，向美国的战争政策和殖民统治屈服，为美国的侵略要求服务。
    曼谷会议所采取的危险步骤，美国侵略集团暴露出来的危害和平的阴谋计划，如果不加制止，将使这一地区和亚洲的和平和安全，遭到更严重的威胁。
    为了粉饰自己的面目，掩盖自己的实际意图，美国侵略集团和它的追随者故意在曼谷会议公报中用了一些和平字眼，宣称他们的军事安排是“防御性的”，假意标榜“不干涉其他国家内政”，甚至无耻地说他们要实现联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。真是堪称“坏事做尽，好话说完”。但是，美国侵略者的这种拙劣的手法，是绝不能掩盖亚洲和全世界人民的耳目的。
    曼谷会议公报规定，这个军事集团将设立“军事顾问”和“参谋策划人员”，来策划“军事合作”，企图组成美国将军所指挥的“机动的攻击力量”。说东南亚侵略集团的这些军事措施是“防御性”的话，是不值一驳的。
    中国同亚洲重要国家正在努力谋求和平共处，国际合作。除了以美国为首的西方殖民国家把它们的军队派到离它们的国境几万公里以外的亚洲来作各种侵略威胁活动以外，亚洲国家没有对美国、英国或法国进行什么侵略。因此，美英集团无端在亚洲搞军事集团，搞机动部队，并要“用亚洲人打亚洲人”，其目的当然是为了加强侵略，而不是为了所谓防御。
    事实上，杜勒斯也公开在曼谷会议上已经不打自招地承认：“美国把东南亚、台湾和朝鲜的形势看作是一个整个形势的一部分”，企图继续从这三条战线上，来扩大对中国的侵略活动和包围圈。他并且夸耀美国已有以原子武器为后盾的百万部队，在远离美国一万公里的远东地区，“负担起它在远东的军事义务”，妄图借此来威吓中国人民和亚洲人民。说这些活动不是侵略而是防御，那只有希特勒和东条能够同意，任何有良知的人都是不能承认的。
    曼谷会议确证了美国进一步破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋。公报就重申了东南亚条约违反日内瓦协议硬把老挝、柬埔寨和南越划入“保护”区域的规定。这就是表明美国要进一步干涉印度支那局势，破坏印度支那的和平。
    明明美国在利用曼谷会议来胁迫它的盟国一起破坏日内瓦协议，但有人竟说东南亚条约“加强了日内瓦的协议”。谁都知道，日内瓦协议造成了对印度支那和东南亚的和平的集体保证，而东南亚条约破坏了这种集体保证，形成了一个敌对的军事同盟。日内瓦协议规定不得将增援性的军火和军事人员运入印度支那，可是，美国为了达到破坏印度支那和平的目的，却公开在南越训练和扩大保大的军队，增加军事援助，并在柬埔寨协助建筑军港，策划训练和装备老挝和柬埔寨军队。这些当然就要违反日内瓦协议的上述规定，使增援性的军火和军事人员大量输入印度支那。美国还资助和派遣武装匪徒到寮国战斗部队的桑怒去进行暴乱，企图占领桑怒和丰沙里。在曼谷会议期间，美国更大肆叫嚣对印度支那采取“联合行动”。所有这些都是严重违反日内瓦协议的。如果说这些行动是“加强日内瓦协议”，那就是对日内瓦协议的严重曲解和污辱。提出这种说法的人们不仅是完全背离了日内瓦协议的精神，而且是有意为美国的侵略行为作辩解。
    为了便于他们破坏日内瓦协议，美国和它的追随者还诬赖越南民主共和国和寮国战斗部队违反停战协定。但是，美国的诬赖是达不到目的的。越南民主共和国以及高棉抗战部队和寮国战斗部队都忠实地履行停战协定，并得到国际监督和监察委员会的公认。
    美国侵略集团又发动诬蔑中国的宣传，硬说中国的傣族自治区是所谓自由泰国的中心，借此来无中生有地制造所谓泰国边境的紧张局势，以便它把柬埔寨等三国拉入东南亚侵略集团。谁都知道，中国的少数民族自治区是在我国普遍通行的制度。除了傣族自治区以外，还有许多少数民族自治区，其中包括蒙古族、朝鲜族和乌兹别克族等自治区。这些都是早经公布的事实。美国要制造对我国傣族自治区的诬蔑来破坏日内瓦协议，只能激起中国人民和亚洲公正人士更大的愤怒。
    亚洲人民都不相信有所谓来自中国的“侵略”和“威胁”，相反地，他们却清清楚楚地看到，美国打着“防止颠覆活动”的花招，来加强干涉各国的内政。正如印度“自由新闻”报所指出的，东南亚条约就是“对亚洲人民的独立和自尊的一种挑战”。但曼谷会议公报依然强调他们的“首要任务之一”是“加强在反颠覆和渗透活动方面的合作办法”，“交换情报”，派遣特务，进行颠覆和破坏活动。
    美国在亚洲各国从事间谍破坏活动的事实，早已层出不穷。美国通过收买和唆使卖国分子，甚至组织武装叛乱，企图推翻印度尼西亚现政府，就是大家知道的。这一切事实，都是说明，任何执行独立自主和和平政策的国家，都是美国所不能容许的。
    曼谷会议还居然特别就亚非会议通过了一个决议，对亚非会议施行压力，预作破坏准备。这个决议，公开企图把东南亚条约所标榜的同亚非会议的目的毫无共通之点的“任务”和“原则”，强加在亚非会议的身上，并要亚非会议的结果“将进一步地保证”这个殖民国家军事集团的目标。这不是证明东南亚条约敌视和平，敌视亚洲的友好合作，又是什么呢？
    东南亚侵略集团抱着极其明显的破坏和平、准备战争的目的。但是，曼谷会议的辩护者却极力说什么东南亚侵略组织不威胁任何人，不针对任何人。这显然是胡说。会议的公报就毫不含糊地指明东南亚侵略集团的敌对目标是“国际共产主义”。在亚洲这显然就指的是中华人民共和国。这样，这个殖民国家的军事集团就是在企图把亚洲重新变为战争策源地，维护和加强殖民主义制度，奴役这一地区的人民。它严重地威胁着亚洲人民的独立、主权、和平和安全。亚洲人民对这一点已经看得很清楚。“仰光日报”在抨击曼谷会议时指出：东南亚条约国家“要以‘东南亚国家’名义讨论东南亚的‘安全’问题，真令人发笑。实际上，所谓东南亚防务条约只是美国侵略亚洲的工具，所谓东南亚地区的‘安全’就是美国为了攫取利润在东南亚制造战争。因此，一切未参加东南亚条约的国家，必须大家起来反对美国在这个地区制造战争和离间东南亚国家的感情，特别是想把这些国家拖入侵略新中国的战争的阴谋。”这反映了东南亚各国公正的舆论。这样的舆论证明，美国及其追随者的任何辩护和伪装，都是枉费心机的。
    必须指出，在美国侵略集团狂妄推行战争政策的时候，如果英国采取比较明智、比较清醒的政策，美国就不敢那么轻易胡来。日内瓦协议的成功就是一个例子。那时候，英国当局就得到英国人民的支持，得到世界人民的赞扬，因为它对和平能够作出贡献。相反，在英国当局极力跟随美国，帮助美国制造紧张的时候，它就必然在国内国外受到各种应有的反对而使自己的处境异常困难。日内瓦会议以后，英国当局不顾英国人民的愿望，转弯抹角紧紧跟随美国的每一个侵略步骤。它违反英国人民的意志跟着美国搞马尼拉会议、搞曼谷会议，组织侵略性的军事集团，纵容美国破坏日内瓦协议，替美国制造荒唐根据，支持美国侵占台湾。英国当局或者以为依靠美国可以保持它的殖民统治。但是事实上，英国当局既不能阻止美帝国主义越来越加紧地分化所谓大英联邦，取代英国在亚洲和中东的殖民地位，更不可能用跟随美国在亚洲制造紧张的办法来同亚洲人民建立真正的和平合作。如果英国当局中有人硬要迷恋十九世纪的旧梦，以为依靠所谓强硬政策能够吓倒中国人民和亚洲人民，如果它以为美国的“实力政策”办不到的事情英国能够办到，那么，已经永远摆脱了十九世纪的中国人民和亚洲绝大多数人民就一定有力量要他们清醒一些。
    曼谷会议企图推翻千千万万人民所热烈欢迎的日内瓦会议的成果。美国侵略集团和它的追随者想用东南亚侵略集团，用战争和殖民主义来代替自日内瓦会议以来就已经开始了的国际协商，和平合作。这是同亚洲人民和世界爱好和平人民公然的对抗，是对人民和平愿望的明显挑战。人民在这里决不会不提高警惕。中国人民必将同亚洲人民和一切爱好和平人民一道，为粉碎美国侵略集团的战争阴谋而斗争到底。
