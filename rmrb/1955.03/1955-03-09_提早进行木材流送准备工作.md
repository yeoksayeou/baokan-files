    Prepare for Timber Rafting Early
    The Forest Industry Bureaus of Shihuanzhen and Wudaoku in Heilongjiang Province have begun preparations for timber rafting and river transportation. The rafting units of the Shihuanzhen Forest Industry Bureau have already constructed water gates, gabions, tripods, and other projects for rafting work. During the construction process, workers put forward many rationalization proposals, which not only ensured the quality of the projects but also saved manpower and materials. The newly built water gates have many improvements in safety equipment. The machinery and equipment of the river transport yards are also being actively overhauled and installed. The flatcar lines connecting to the river transport yards have been repaired. The timber rafting and river transportation preparations of the Wudaoku Forest Industry Bureau are more than twenty days earlier than in 1954, and various water transport preparations have now begun.

    提早进行木材流送准备工作
    黑龙江省世环镇、五道库等森林工业局开始进行木材流送和出河准备工作。世环镇森林工业局各流送单位目前已为流送工作修筑了水闸、石笼子、三角架等工程。这些工程在修筑过程中，工人们提出了很多合理化建议，不但保证了工程质量，而且节省了人力和材料。新修的水闸在安全设备上有了许多改进。出河场的机械设备也正在积极检修和安装。和出河场相连接的平车线路已整修完毕。五道库森林工业局的木材流送和出河准备工作较一九五四年提早了二十多天，现已着手进行各项水运准备工作。
