Recently, at the request of the Vietnam People's Army, the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission in Vietnam dispatched a mobile inspection team to South Vietnam and the Haiphong area to investigate illegal acts of forced relocation of residents. However, during the investigation of the so-called "refugee camps" in Hu Nai, Du Mo and other places in South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem elements, with the connivance of the French Federation forces, sent special agents and gangsters to create a series of disturbances, using violence and insults to obstruct the investigation work of the International Commission's mobile inspection team. The delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army has lodged a strong protest to the French side.

The Ngo Dinh Diem elements' actions to obstruct the International Commission from carrying out its mission were obviously instigated by the United States, and are in line with the shenanigans it has been up to in South Korea.

Since the ceasefire in Indochina, the United States has begun to implement the abduction of North Vietnamese residents. According to the US plan, when withdrawing from areas such as Pizhou, Fayen, and Hanoi, the French Federation forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem group forcibly forced tens of thousands of residents to leave their homes and abducted them to South Vietnam. Recently, with the approach of the date stipulated in the Geneva Agreement for the French army to withdraw from Haiphong, they have been frantically abducting local residents in the Haiphong area, in addition to obstructing the handover and plundering public property.

In order to plan the abduction of North Vietnamese residents, the United States established a special organization in Saigon, allocated 40 million US dollars in "special budget" funds, sent a large number of ships and aircraft to directly participate in the abduction work, and also sent a group of agents in religious garb to areas in North Vietnam with a large number of Catholics to cooperate with the French army and the Ngo Dinh Diem group to deceive, intimidate, and sow discord among the residents. US President's special envoy to South Vietnam, Collins, personally went to Haiphong to "inspect" the abduction of residents. On March 8, US Secretary of State Dulles publicly said in a speech that they would abduct another 400,000 people from North Vietnam "before the withdrawal work is completed."

Under the instigation of the United States, French High Commissioner for Indochina and Commander-in-Chief of the French Federation Forces, Ely, and Commander of the French Federation Forces in the Haiphong area, Cogne, successively issued orders forcing residents to "withdraw," threatening them that if they did not "withdraw" by the deadline, the French military authorities would not be responsible for their safety, and the orders even stipulated that residents could be gathered and evacuated without prior notice. According to this order, US agents, French troops, and Ngo Dinh Diem elements constantly used armed massacres, large-scale roundups, and setting fire to residents' houses to forcibly abduct large numbers of North Vietnamese residents.

This brutal action of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem group in collaboration with the French side to abduct North Vietnamese residents is a direct violation of the Geneva Agreement. Item 8 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference stipulates: "The clauses in the ceasefire agreement concerning the guarantee of the maintenance of life and property must be strictly implemented, in particular, it must be ensured that everyone in Vietnam can freely choose the area where he wants to live." US Secretary of State Dulles knows this very well. It is for this reason that he has tried his best to spread a shameless argument, saying that the North Vietnamese residents abducted by the United States using violence are "coming to the South to seek freedom," and that the US abduction activities are "benevolent" and "fraternal actions." But Dulles has not been able to explain why, since those people wanted to go themselves, why force them? The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which faithfully implements the Geneva Agreement, has provided all convenient conditions for those who want to go to South Vietnam. Just recently, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also sent away a group of people who wanted to go to the South. This is proven by facts. As for what kind of "fraternal friendship" Dulles is talking about, the more than 3,000 letters written to the International Commission by local Catholics in the Fayen area are a powerful explanation. These letters accuse the Ngo Dinh Diem group of using beatings, violence, intimidation, and deception in that area to abduct a large number of Catholics to South Vietnam. Even the Saigon correspondent of the British "Times" reported last September that the residents who were abducted to South Vietnam told him personally: "We didn't plan to go, but the authorities told us to go." Recently, when the International Commission's mobile inspection team was investigating the forced relocation incident in Chaiyi, Haiphong, the county "police chief" of the Ngo Dinh Diem group admitted that terrorist incidents had occurred, and admitted that he was dressed in plain clothes and mixed in with the crowd to direct special agents to suppress the masses who resisted forced evacuation. These facts all prove that the right to free residence of the Vietnamese people guaranteed by the Geneva Agreement has been severely violated.

Even the American news agency cannot conceal the sinful acts of the United States. People might as well take a look at what Dulles calls "brotherly friendship" from the report of Associated Press reporter Clements. Clements said that when North Vietnamese residents who were forcibly abducted to South Vietnam "poured out of American naval ships and transport planes, they formed a tragic scene"; they "lived in tents during the peak of the rainy season," and many others were "scattered in the cold highland villages near Dalat," or were driven to "swampy areas west of Saigon." Of course, these are just a few of the situations that have been revealed through layers of inspection. Recently, Catholic priests Chen Guangyan, Liang Wenji, who returned to North Vietnam, and Wu Shishan, a resident who escaped, angrily accused: The Ngo Dinh Diem group established more than 80 concentration camps in Saigon, Dike An, and other places to imprison abducted residents, and even imprisoned many people in the deep forests dozens of miles away where no one lived. They groaned on the line of hunger and death, and in some places there was not even water. A large number of young people were captured by the Ngo Dinh Diem group into barracks or sold to rubber plantations as slave laborers, and many young women were sold to brothels. The concentration camps were full of patients, and cars loaded with corpses drove out every day. This is the "freedom" that the "fraternal actions" of the American imperialists have brought them!

The abducted residents have relentlessly resisted the brutal crimes of the United States. They opposed forced relocation to South Vietnam, and after being abducted to South Vietnam, they resolutely demanded to return to North Vietnam. News released by American news agencies also admitted that riots had occurred among North Vietnamese residents who had been abducted to Saigon. They rushed out of the "refugee camps" and held demonstrations, "shouting that they demanded to be sent back to the North." The Ngo Dinh Diem group even used force to carry out bloody suppression against them, causing a tragic bloodshed. Recently, despite the fact that the Ngo Dinh Diem group has stepped up its control and suppression, more than 3,000 people have risked everything and broke through many obstacles to escape back to North Vietnam in the past 20 days since the end of February.

The US aggression group's planning to abduct North Vietnamese residents is not only a violation of the Geneva Agreement on guaranteeing the right of free residence of the Vietnamese people, but also part of its conspiracy to undermine the democratic elections in Vietnam stipulated by the Geneva Agreement, so as to maintain and restore colonial rule in Vietnam. In this regard, a message from Saigon on the 18th from the United Press is worth pondering. The message said: "South Vietnam has a population of about 10 million, and North Vietnam has a population of 12 million. Therefore, the Communists have an advantage from the beginning in the election struggle... But the fact that more than 800,000 refugees have fled south of the 17th parallel in the past six months is very helpful in making up for this difference." And now Dulles has stated that the United States intends to abduct another 400,000 people to South Vietnam before the French side completely withdraws from North Vietnam. In this way, in Washington's view, once the obstruction fails and elections have to be held in accordance with the Geneva Agreement, the North Vietnamese residents forcibly abducted by the United States for the Ngo Dinh Diem group can be manipulated in the hands of Ngo Dinh Diem's police rule, thereby creating a so-called election "advantage."

There is no action more shameless than this. But such a shameless and sinful action cannot realize the sinister intentions of the United States. The crime of the US aggressive group's plot to abduct North Vietnamese residents, like its crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war in Korea and instigating the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek group to abduct residents in Dachen and Nanjishan Islands, exposes its ugly face of trampling on international agreements and ravaging humanitarian principles. All upright people in the world condemn the United States for undermining the Geneva Agreement and ravaging human rights, and support the protest lodged by the representative of the headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army to the French side. They demand that the Geneva Agreement be observed, the continued forced abduction of residents be stopped immediately, and that the residents abducted to South Vietnam be responsible for being sent back to North Vietnam.

    美国怎样指使劫运北越居民
    李高
      最近，越南国际监督和监察委员会应越南人民军的要求，派出机动视察小组，到南越和海防地区调查强迫迁移居民的非法行为。但在调查南越的湖耐、笃谟等处的所谓“难民营”时，吴庭艳分子在法兰西联邦部队的纵容下，派出特务、歹徒制造了
  一系列的骚乱事件，用暴力威胁和侮辱手段，阻挠国际委员会机动视察小组的调查工作。越南人民军总司令部代表团已向法方提出强硬抗议。
    吴庭艳分子这种阻挠国际委员会执行任务的行动显然是受到美国指使的，它和美国在南朝鲜干的勾当一脉相承。
    自印度支那实现停战后，美国即开始实行劫运北越居民。法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳集团根据美国的计划，在撤退斐朱、发艳、河内等地区时，用武力强迫数以万计的居民离乡背井，把他们劫夺到南越去。最近，随着日内瓦协议规定的法军撤出海防日期的临近，它们在海防地区，除了阻挠移交工作，劫运公共财产以外，也疯狂地劫运当地居民。
    美国为了策划强劫北越居民的活动，在西贡设立了专门组织，拨出了四千万美元的“特别预算”款项，并派出了大批舰只、飞机，直接参与劫运工作，还派出了一批披着宗教外衣的特务到北越的一些天主教徒较多地区，协同法国军队和吴庭艳集团对居民进行欺骗恐吓和挑拨离间。美国总统派驻南越特使柯林斯，曾亲到海防“视察”劫运居民的活动。三月八日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在演说中公然说，要“在撤退工作完成以前”，再从北越劫走四十万人。
    在美国指使之下，法国驻印度支那高级专员兼法兰西联邦部队总司令埃利和海防地区法兰西联邦部队司令戈涅先后公开发出强迫居民“撤退”的命令，威胁他们说，若不按期限“撤退”，法国军事当局对他们的安全不负任何责任，命令甚至规定可以不经事先通知即把居民集合起来撤走。根据这种命令，美国特务、法国军队和吴庭艳分子不断使用武装屠杀、大规模兜捕和放火焚毁居民房屋等手段，来强迫把大批北越居民劫走。
    美国和吴庭艳集团在法方协同下进行的这种残暴地劫运北越居民的行动，是直接违反日内瓦协议的。日内瓦会议最后宣言第八项规定：“停止敌对行动协定中关于保证维护生命财产的各项条款，必须最严格地予以执行，特别是必须使在越南的每一个人都能自由地选择他所愿意居住的地区。”这一点，是美国国务卿杜勒斯知道得很清楚的。正是因为这样，因此他竭力散布一种恬不知耻的论调，把美国指使用暴力劫走的北越居民说成是“到南方来找寻自由的”，而美国的劫运活动，是“仁慈”的“兄弟之谊的行动”。但是杜勒斯没有能够说明，既然是那些人自己要去，为什么要强劫？忠实执行日内瓦协定的越南民主共和国为要求到南越去的人提供了一切便利的条件。就在最近，越南民主共和国还送走了一批愿到南方去的人民。这是有事实为证的。至于杜勒斯所说的“兄弟之谊的行动”是怎样的一种“兄弟之谊”，那么，在发艳地区有三千多封当地天主教徒写给国际委员会的信就是有力的说明。这些信控诉了吴庭艳集团在那个地区使用打杀、暴力恫吓和欺骗手段来大规模劫运教民到南越去的罪行。甚至英国“泰晤士报”驻西贡记者在去年九月曾报道说，被劫到南越的居民亲口告诉他说：“我们并不打算走，但是当局叫我们走。”最近国际委员会机动视察小组在海防地区的柴仪进行调查强迫迁移的事件时，吴庭艳集团的县“警察局长”承认曾发生恐怖事件，并承认他身穿便服混在群众中指挥特务镇压反抗强迫撤退的群众。这些事实，都证明了日内瓦协议所保障的越南人民的自由居住权利，已遭到极严重的侵犯。
      连美国通讯社也掩饰不了美国的罪恶行为。人们不妨从美联社记者克莱门兹的报道中，看一看杜勒斯所说的“兄弟之谊”是什么。克莱门兹说，被强劫到南越的北越居民“从美国的海军船只和运输飞机上涌出来的时候，他们形成了一幅悲惨的景象”；他们“在雨季达到高峰的期间却住帐篷里”，还有许多人“分散在大叻附近的寒冷的高原乡村中”，或是被赶到了“西贡以西的沼泽地带”。当然，这些不过是通过重重检查透露出来的一点点状况。最近回到北越的天主教神甫陈光严、梁文纪和逃回来的居民武氏山等，愤怒地控诉说：吴庭艳集团在西贡、堤岸等处建立了八十多个集中营囚禁被劫居民，还把许多人禁锢到周围数十里无人烟的森林深处。他们呻吟在饥饿、死亡线上，有的地方甚至连水都没有。大批青年被吴庭艳集团抓进兵营或卖进橡胶园做奴工，许多青年妇女被卖进妓院。集中营到处是病人，每天都有满载死尸的车子驶出。这就是美帝国主义者的“兄弟之谊的行动”带给他们的
  “自由”！
    被劫居民对美国的这种残暴罪行进行了不息的反抗。他们反对强迫迁移到南越去，被劫到南越后他们坚决要求返回北越。美国通讯社发的消息中也承认，被劫到西贡的北越居民曾发生暴动，他们冲出“难民营”举行游行示威，“大喊他们要求送回北部”。吴庭艳集团竟使用武力，对他们实行血腥的镇压，造成了流血惨剧。最近，尽管吴庭艳集团加紧了控制和镇压，但是，从二月底以来的二十多天中，就有三千多人不顾一切危险，突破重重障碍，逃回了北越。
      美国侵略集团策划强劫北越居民，不仅是破坏日内瓦协议关于保障越南人民自由居住权利的规定，而且是它破坏日内瓦协议规定的越南民主选举，以便在越南保持和恢复殖民地统治的阴谋的一部分。关于这一点，合众社十八日发自西贡的一条消息是值得玩味的。这条消息中说：“南越约有一千万人口，北越有一千二百万人口，因此共产党在选举斗争中一开头就是拥有优势的……但是八十多万难民在过去六个月期间逃到十七度线以南一事对于弥补这个差额是很有帮助的。”而现在杜勒斯表示，美国打算在法方完全撤出北越以前再劫运四十万人到南越去。这样，在华盛顿看来，一旦阻挠失败而不得不按照日内瓦协议举行选举时，美国替吴庭艳集团用暴力强劫的北越居民就可以操在吴庭艳的警察统治的手中、从而使他们造成所谓选举“优势”了。
    再没有比这更厚颜无耻的行动了。但是这样无耻的罪恶行动是不可能实现美国的罪恶企图的。美国侵略集团策划劫运北越居民的罪行，像它在朝鲜强迫扣留战俘，在大陈、南麂山列岛指使蒋介石卖国集团劫走居民的罪行一样，暴露了它践踏国际协议和蹂躏人道原则的丑恶面目。全世界一切正直的人都谴责美国破坏日内瓦协议和蹂躏人权的罪行，支持越南人民军总部代表向法方提出的抗议。他们要求遵守日内瓦协议，立即停止继续强迫劫运居民的活动，并把被劫到南越的居民负责送回北越。
