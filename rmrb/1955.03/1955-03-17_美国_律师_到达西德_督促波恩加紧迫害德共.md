Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 12th: According to a report by the German News Agency: The West German Federal Constitutional Court continued its illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party on the 10th. The next "trial" is scheduled for the 16th.

    German Communist Party representatives Fischer and Redwin spoke in court successively. Fischer elaborated the party's attitude towards parliamentary politics in bourgeois democratic countries, and Redwin stated the party's trade union policy. They refuted the government's slander that the German Communist Party was in principle opposed to the parliament and used trade unions to achieve its political goals.

    On the 10th, German Radio revealed new facts about the behind-the-scenes instigators of the "trial" of the German Communist Party. The radio station said: American lawyers arrived in Karlsruhe on March 6th. It is said that they will study the entire course of the "trial" and will pay special attention to the exchange of opinions and experience. The radio station continued: Senior officials of the Bonn Ministry of Justice believe that the American government feels that the "trial" of the German Communist Party is proceeding "too slowly" and they sent these "experts" to speed up the matter.

    美国“律师”到达西德
    督促波恩加紧迫害德共
    【新华社柏林十二日电】据德意志通讯社报道：西德联邦宪法法院十日继续对德国共产党进行非法“审讯”。下次“审讯”定在十六日举行。
    德国共产党代表费希和莱德温相继在法庭上发言。费希阐述了党对资产阶级民主国家中的议会政治的态度，莱德温申述了党的工会政策，他们驳斥了政府方面关于德国共产党在原则上反对议会和利用工会来达到它政治目的的诬蔑。
    德意志广播电台在十日用新的事实暴露了“审讯”德国共产党的幕后主使人。这家电台说：美国的律师已经在三月六日到达加尔斯卢合。据说，他们要研究整个“审讯”的进程，并且将特别注意交流意见和经验。这家电台接着说：波恩司法部的高级官员认为，美国政府人士觉得对德国共产党的
  “审讯”进行得“太慢”了，他们派这些“专家”来是为要加速这件事的进行。
