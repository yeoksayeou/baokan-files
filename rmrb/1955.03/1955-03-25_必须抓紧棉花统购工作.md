We Must Grasp Cotton Unified Purchase Work Tightly
	Guo Xianrui

The national cotton unified purchase task has not yet been completed. The supply and marketing cooperatives in several major cotton-producing areas have performed poorly in completing their cotton unified purchase tasks. By the end of February, Hebei Province had only completed 69.5 percent of its annual task, Shandong Province 76.6 percent, Jiangsu Province 71.6 percent, and Henan Province 66.3 percent. Because the task completion in major cotton-producing areas is not good enough, the overall national unified purchase plan has only been completed by 75.3 percent. This issue deserves our attention.

There are many reasons why the cotton unified purchase task has not been completed. The most important reason is that some supply and marketing cooperative cadres have relaxed their cotton unified purchase work. They blindly believe: "The cotton harvesting season has passed, and cotton farmers have no cotton in their hands." They prematurely closed cotton collection points, excessively reduced cotton collection personnel, stopped mobile purchasing, and planned to hastily withdraw. For example, nearly half of the cadres in the Taikang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province who were responsible for purchasing cotton have been transferred to other jobs; the Eleventh District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Luoyang County originally had 21 people purchasing cotton, but now only eight remain. Similar phenomena have occurred in other regions.

Is it true that cotton farmers have no cotton in their hands? According to investigations in several major cotton-producing areas, cotton farmers still have a considerable amount of cotton in their hands, with most of it being held by middle peasants. According to reports from various counties in the Nantong Special District of Jiangsu Province in mid-February, cotton farmers' cotton reserves still accounted for 33.6 percent of the total output. According to investigations in Lingbao, Anyang, Shanxian, and Luoyang counties in Henan Province, cotton farmers' cotton reserves accounted for more than 25 percent of the output. Generally, cotton farmers also retain a large amount of cotton for padding, which they cannot actually use up and can sell some of it.

This situation shows that there are conditions for striving to complete the purchase task and purchasing as much cotton as possible. The cotton in the hands of cotton farmers will be sold sooner or later. If we do not seize the opportunity to purchase now and allow cotton farmers to store large quantities of cotton; when cotton farmers sell in the future, if the supply and marketing cooperatives' purchasing work cannot keep up and cannot meet the cotton farmers' demands, it will cause dissatisfaction among cotton farmers, and some cotton farmers may sell on the free market or trade on the black market, undermining the state's policy of unified cotton purchase.

Cotton is the main raw material of the textile industry. Whether the cotton unified purchase task can be completed will directly affect the normal progress of textile industry production and the continued improvement of people's lives. Therefore, completing this year's cotton unified purchase task will have great significance for national construction. All major cotton-producing areas should organize a certain amount of manpower to assist grassroots units, and while doing a good job in spring plowing and production, mobilize cotton farmers to actively sell all the cotton they can sell to the state, and strive to complete the state's cotton unified purchase task.

    必须抓紧棉花统购工作
    郭献瑞
    全国棉花统购任务，现在还未完成。几个主要产棉地区的供销合作社，棉花统购任务完成得很不好。到二月底，河北省仅完成全年任务的百分之六十九点五，山东省完成百分之七十六点六，江苏省完成百分之七十一点六，河南省完成百分之六十六点三。由于主要产棉区完成任务的情况不够好，因此，全国总的统购计划只完成百分之七十五点三。这一问题值得引起我们注意。
    棉花统购任务没有完成的原因很多。最主要的是有些供销合作社的干部放松了棉花统购工作。他们盲目地认为：“目前收棉季节已过，棉农手里没有存棉了。”他们过早地撤销收棉点，过分减少收棉人员，停止流动收购，打算草率收兵。如河南省太康县供销合作社收购棉花的干部，将近一半以上已被调去担任其他工作；洛阳县十一区供销合作社原有二十一名收购棉花的人员，目前只剩了八人。其他地区也发生了这样现象。
    是不是棉农手里真的没有棉花呢？根据几个主要产棉区的调查，棉农手里的存棉还很不少，大部分存棉是在中农手里。据江苏省南通专区各县在二月中旬报告：棉农存棉还占总产量的百分之三十三点六。据河南省灵宝、安阳、陕县、洛阳四县的调查，棉农手里的存棉占产量百分之二十五以上。一般棉农留用的絮棉数量也很多，实际用不完，也可以卖些出来。
    这种情况说明，争取完成收购任务，尽量多收购些棉花是有条件的。棉农手里的棉花迟早都要出卖。如果现在不抓紧收购，任凭棉农存放大量棉花；等到棉农将来出售时，供销合作社收购工作跟不上，不能满足棉农的要求，就会引起棉农不满，某些棉农还可能到自由市场出售或在黑市成交，破坏国家统购棉花的政策。
    棉花是纺织工业的主要原料。棉花统购任务能否完成，会直接影响纺织工业生产的正常进行和人民生活的继续改善。因此完成今年棉花统购的任务，对于国家建设将有极大的意义。各主要产棉地区应该组织一定力量，协助基层单位，在做好春耕生产工作的同时，发动棉农把所有能出售的棉花踊跃卖给国家，争取完成国家统购棉花的任务。
