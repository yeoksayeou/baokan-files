    “Rushing into Work in a Swarm” Won’t Work
    Zhong Xia
    The intense spring plowing season has begun. Many newly established agricultural production cooperatives have smoothly entered production; however, many new cooperatives have experienced varying degrees of chaos at the beginning of production.
    The management of the Shuanggang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhao'an County, Fujian Province, is very chaotic. Members do not know which land belongs to the cooperative and which does not, so they plant beans on other people's land and send manure to other people's fields. In Nanjing County, about half of the newly established cooperatives have chaotic labor organization, with no plan for work. Members are anxious and dissatisfied, and some say that the cooperative is "rushing into work in a swarm and randomly assigning tasks." A survey of more than 36,000 newly established cooperatives in Hebei Province showed that as of the beginning of this month, about half had not yet started production or had chaotic production management. Some cooperatives have no one in charge, so members send manure to their own land or find work themselves. Some people say this is "individual farming within the cooperative."
    The above phenomena are only one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, the spring plowing preparations of many cooperatives are not as good as in previous years, nor are they as good as those of farmers outside the cooperatives, and they urgently need to catch up. For example, the Shangweidian Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing has an average of only 150 jin of fertilizer per mu, half as much as farmers outside the cooperative. The Xinzhuang Cooperative needs more than 5,000 carts of fertilizer, but currently has only more than 2,000 carts. In many places, the establishment of cooperatives in winter was not combined with production, which delayed much production work. After the cooperatives were established, they did not quickly go into production, which further delayed the production that should have been grasped tightly. This situation must be changed quickly, otherwise it will be difficult to guarantee the increase in production of the cooperatives; and whether the cooperatives can increase production is the key to determining whether the cooperatives can be consolidated.
    Of course, newly established cooperatives are beginning to implement collective management, leaders have no experience, and members are not used to it, so temporary chaos is difficult to completely avoid. However, the season does not allow this phenomenon to continue. Many members say: "We'll see after the autumn harvest!" That is to say, if production increases after the autumn harvest, the cooperative will be easily consolidated; otherwise, it will not be easily consolidated.
    The demands reflected by the members are the main issues that we should pay attention to. We must quickly solve this problem, correct the chaotic phenomena, and carry out spring plowing production.

    “干活一窝蜂”是不成的
    仲夏
    紧张的春耕季节开始了。许多新建立的农业生产合作社已经顺利地投入生产；有不少新社在开始生产时却出现了程度不等的混乱现象。
    福建省诏安县双港农业生产合作社的经营管理很混乱，社员不知道哪块地是合作社的，哪块地不是合作社的，以致把豆子种到别人的地里，把粪也送到别人的地里了。南靖县约有半数新建立的合作社劳动组织混乱，干活没有计划，社员焦急不满，有人说合作社是“干活一窝蜂，派工乱点兵”。河北省调查了三万六千多个新建立的合作社的情况，到本月初，尚未进行生产和生产管理混乱的约占半数以上。有些合作社因无人负责，社员就往自己的地里送粪，或者自己找活干，有人说这是“合作社里的单干户”。
    以上这些现象，还只是问题的一方面。另一方面，有不少合作社的春耕准备工作都不如往年，也不如社外的农民，急需赶上。如北京郊区上苇店合作社平均每亩只有一百五十斤肥料，比社外农民少一半。辛庄合作社需肥料五千多车，现在只有两千多车。许多地方在冬季建立合作社的过程中，没有结合生产，以致许多生产工作都耽误了。合作社建立以后，又未迅速投入生产，使本来应该抓紧的生产又拖了下来。这种情况必须赶快设法加以改变，否则合作社的增产就很难保证；而合作社能否增产，却是决定合作社能否巩固的关键。
    当然，新建立的合作社开始实行集体经营，领导没经验，社员不习惯，暂时的混乱现象是很难完全避免的。但是，季节已不容许这种现象再继续下去。不少社员说：“干一年，秋后看！”这就是说，秋后如果增产了，合作社就容易巩固；否则，就不容易巩固。
    社员集中反映的要求，也就是我们应该注意的主要问题。必须迅速解决这个问题，纠正混乱现象，进行春耕生产。
