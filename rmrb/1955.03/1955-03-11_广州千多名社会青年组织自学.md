More than a thousand social youths in Guangzhou have joined self-study groups, and they have organized nearly sixty social youth self-study groups. The Guangzhou Municipal Democratic Youth Federation and the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, among other relevant organizations, are helping them with their self-study through various methods. The Guangzhou Municipal Cultural and Educational Committee and other organizations have also specially organized a "Self-Study Guidance Working Group" and launched "Youth Self-Study Tutoring Broadcast Lectures." Not long ago, five districts in the city held "Lectures on Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry" for junior high school graduates who did not continue their education. Recently, they are also preparing to hold lectures on collectivism and communist morality education for social youths.

After receiving education, many social youths have actively assisted street offices in doing propaganda work and supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs. Many young people also voluntarily organize books in youth cultural palaces and cultural centers, teach the masses to sing, and more.

    广州千多名社会青年组织自学
    广州市已有一千多名社会青年参加自学小组学习，他们已组织了近六十个社会青年自学小组。广州市民主青年联合会和青年团广州市委员会等有关单位，通过各种方法帮助他们进行自学。广州市文化教育委员会等单位还特地组织了“自学指导工作组”，举办了“青年自学辅导广播讲座”。不久以前，全市有五个区为没有升学的初中毕业生举办了
  “数学、物理、化学讲座”。最近，还准备举办向社会青年进行集体主义和共产主义道德教育的讲座。
    许多社会青年受到教育后，主动地协助街道办事处做宣传工作和拥军优属工作；还有不少青年义务为青年文化宫和文化馆整理图书、教群众唱歌等。
