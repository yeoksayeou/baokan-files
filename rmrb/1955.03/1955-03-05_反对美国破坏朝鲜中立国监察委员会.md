    Oppose the United States' Sabotage of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea
    Du Bo
    The representatives of the United States and its sixteen satellite nations in the Korean War held a meeting in Washington on February 24th. According to a United Press report, the meeting discussed steps to "reduce or end" the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, which is responsible for ceasefire supervision. The day before the meeting, State Department spokesman Sudanm released information stating that the countries involved in the Korean War were preparing to unilaterally end the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. At that time, news revealed that in order to eliminate the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the destructive steps the United States intended to take were threefold: First, the Swiss and Swedish members would come forward and negotiate with the Polish and Czechoslovakian members to reduce or curtail the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; second, the US invasion army command in Korea would unilaterally declare the mission of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission over and disband it; third, the Swiss and Swedish members would leave Korea, and then the South Korean Syngman Rhee government would illegally drive the Polish and Czechoslovakian members out of South Korea. A week later, on March 3rd, the United States officially issued a memorandum announcing its "agreement" with the views of Switzerland and Sweden that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be disbanded. It is quite clear that the United States is further sabotaging the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in an attempt to jeopardize peace in Korea.
    The "reason" used by the United States to support its conspiracy is that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is unable to fulfill its responsibilities due to what it calls "Communist obstruction activities." At the same time, the State Department has created new rumors of "Communist violations of the armistice agreement." However, it is nothing new for the US to clamor about "Communist violations of the armistice agreement" whenever its acts or conspiracies to undermine the armistice agreement are exposed. Throughout the entire Korean armistice period, the Korean and Chinese sides have always strictly abided by and effectively implemented the armistice agreement. The rotation and replacement work on the Korean and Chinese sides have been carried out under the full supervision of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, fully complying with the provisions of the agreement. This has been affirmed by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In its earlier comments on the rotation and replacement on the Korean and Chinese sides, it stated: The rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition reported by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams and the Korean and Chinese sides did not exceed the limits stipulated in the armistice agreement. The figures reported by the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams and the Korean and Chinese sides were completely identical. The mobile inspection teams dispatched by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have conducted and are still conducting on-the-spot investigations in many places in northern Korea. They have always received assistance and facilitation from the liaison officers of the Korean and Chinese sides and the Korean local authorities during their work. This fact cannot be denied. The United States' claim that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has been "obstructed" by the Korean and Chinese sides is a complete distortion of the facts and has no factual basis.
    The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has indeed encountered constant obstruction in carrying out its task of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement in Korea. But this does not come from the Korean and Chinese sides, but from the US side. Throughout the entire Korean armistice period, the US side has consistently violated the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, illegally transporting many reinforcement military supplies into South Korea and expanding Syngman Rhee's army. The Polish and Czechoslovakian members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, in accordance with the armistice agreement, justly carried out supervision and repeatedly pointed out the US side's violations of the armistice agreement. This is entirely in line with the interests of maintaining peace. However, for this reason, they have become a thorn in the side of the US side. The US side obviously believes that the supervision work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea is an obstacle to its activities in violation of the armistice agreement.
    Neutral Nations Inspection Teams have often been unreasonably obstructed and prevented by the US side from performing their duties at various ports in South Korea. The US side has even openly kidnapped, beaten, insulted, and intimidated the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission Inspection Teams. Until now, responsible personnel of the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique have frequently clamored to expel the Polish and Czechoslovakian personnel in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In January of this year, the US side falsely claimed to stop using certain ports in South Korea for rotation and replacement, openly restricting the scope of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams' duties.
    The United States' eagerness to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is inseparable from its preparations for resuming war in South Korea. An Associated Press reporter reported on February 24th that the United States wants to "replace the old American aircraft in the hands of the United Nations forces or Korea with newer aircraft and ship new weapons to strengthen the strength of the Korean army." US Secretary of State Dulles also said at the Bangkok meeting of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc that the United States is providing South Korea with extensive military assistance. The facts are more obvious, the United States wants to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, is to intend to abandon the Korean Armistice Agreement, let go of expanding and strengthening the US's aggressive military strength in Korea, and intensify the tense situation.
    This conspiracy activity of the United States in Korea is part of its overall plan to undermine peace in the Far East and prepare for a new war. Dulles explained this at the Bangkok meeting of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. According to revealed information, Dulles boasted at a closed-door meeting on February 23 about "the US's offensive power in the Pacific" and stated that the United States regards the situations in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Korea as "part of a whole situation," which are "three fronts" for aggression against China. According to US news agencies, once the United States launches a war of aggression against China in Asia, it will not only require the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries to take "joint action," but also "threaten to release Chiang Kai-shek from Taiwan and Syngman Rhee from Korea."
    The United States and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique signed a treaty, attempting to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other coastal islands; and stationed a large number of naval and air forces in the Taiwan Strait, openly carrying out war provocations against our country, creating an extremely tense situation there. The Bangkok meeting held by the United States and its followers, one of its main purposes is to plan to sabotage the Geneva Conference agreement on restoring peace in Indochina, and turn Indochina into a US aggressive military base. Now, the United States unilaterally announced that it would end the Neutral Nations Commission that monitors the Korean Armistice, in order to step up preparations for resuming the war of aggression in South Korea. This is the step taken by the US aggressive bloc from these "three fronts" to intensify the tense situation in the entire Asia and Pacific region and prepare for a new war.
    For twenty months, the Korean armistice has been maintained thanks to the vigilance of the Korean and Chinese people and peace-loving people of all countries against the US side's deliberate sabotage of the Korean armistice. Throughout the entire armistice period, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has shouldered the important task of supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement. In performing the tasks entrusted to it by both sides of the armistice, the Neutral Nations Commission has often been subjected to all kinds of obstruction by the US side, but it has still done a lot of work, which has played a role in the implementation of the armistice agreement and the maintenance of the Korean armistice. Today, as the US side is increasingly stepping up its attempts to undermine the armistice agreement, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has increased its responsibilities. The establishment of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is an integral part of the Korean Armistice Agreement. It is the result of the agreement between the two sides of the Korean armistice and cannot be unilaterally ended or abolished by any one side. The actions of the US aggressive clique, disregarding its international agreement obligations and actively attempting to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, are completely illegal. All people who wish for the stability of the Korean armistice and the maintenance of peace should rise up to stop the US aggressors' conspiracy to endanger peace in Korea.

    反对美国破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会
    杜波
    美国和它在侵略朝鲜战争中的十六个仆从国家的代表，二月二十四日在华盛顿开了一个会议，据合众社报道，会议讨论了“缩小或结束”在朝鲜执行停战监察任务的中立国监察委员会的工作的步骤。在开会的前一天，美国国务院发言人苏丹姆就放出空气说，侵朝国家准备要片面结束中立国监察委员会。当时就有消息透露，为了取消中立国监察委员会，美国打算采取的破坏步骤有三个：一、由瑞士委员和瑞典委员出头，同波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员交涉缩小或减缩中立国委员会；二、由在朝鲜的美国侵略军司令部片面宣布中立国委员会任务终了，并且解散；三、使瑞士委员和瑞典委员离开朝鲜，然后由南朝鲜李承晚政府把波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员非法赶出南朝鲜。一个星期之后，三月三日，美国正式发表备忘录，宣布“同意”瑞士和瑞典的意见，应该解散中立国监察委员会。十分明显，美国正在进一步破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会企图危害朝鲜和平。
    美国用来支持它的这一阴谋策动的“理由”是中立国监察委员会因什么“共方阻挠活动”而不可能履行其责任。同时，国务院又造出了“共产党破坏停战协定”的新的谣言。但是，每当美方破坏停战协议的行为或阴谋被揭露时，它总是吵嚷“共产党破坏停战协定”，这已经不是新鲜的事情了。在整个朝鲜停战期间，朝中方面一向严格遵守和切实执行停战协定，朝中方面的轮换和替换工作，都是在中立国监察委员会的充分监察之下进行，完全符合于协定条款的规定。这一点是中立国监察委员会都肯定了的。它在早些时候发表的关于朝中方面轮换和替换的评论中曾说：各中立国视察小组和朝中方面所报告的军事人员的轮换和武器、弹药的替换没有超出停战协定所规定的限额。各中立国视察小组和朝中方面所报告的数字完全相同。中立国监察委员会所派遣的机动视察小组在朝鲜北部许多地方进行过并且还在进行着实地调查，他们在进行工作时，总是得到朝中方面联络军官和朝鲜地方当局的协助和便利，这个事实也是抹煞不了的。美国说中立国监察委员会受到朝中方面的“阻挠”，完全是颠倒黑白，没有任何事实根据。
    中立国监察委员会在朝鲜执行监察停战协定的实施的任务中，的确是不断地遇到阻挠的。但这不是来自朝中方面，而是来自美方。在整个朝鲜停战期间，美方一直违反朝鲜停战协定的规定，把许多增援性的军事物资非法运入南朝鲜，扩大李承晚的军队。中立国监察委员会的波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员根据停战协定，公正地进行监察，屡次指出美方这种破坏停战协定的行为，这完全是符合于维护和平的利益的。但是，因此，他们就成了美方的眼中钉。美方显然认为中立国监察委员会在南朝鲜的监察工作，是对它的违反停战协定的活动的一重障碍。
    中立国视察小组在南朝鲜各口岸执行职务时，经常受到美方的无理阻挠和制止，美方甚至公然劫持、殴打、侮辱和恫吓中立国监察委员会视察小组的人员。直到现在，南朝鲜李承晚集团负责人员还经常叫嚷要驱逐中立国监察委员会中的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克人员。今年一月，美方诡称停止使用南朝鲜的某些口岸进行轮换和替换，公然限制中立国视察小组执行职务的范围。
    美国急于取消中立国监察委员会，是和它在南朝鲜进行恢复战争的准备分不开的。美联社记者二月二十四日报道说，美国要“把联合国军或朝鲜手中的陈旧的美国飞机换成较为新式的飞机，并运去新式武器以加强韩国军队的力量”。美国国务卿杜勒斯在东南亚侵略集团曼谷会议上也曾说，美国正给与南朝鲜广泛的军事援助。事实再明显没有了，美国要破坏中立国监察委员会，就是要打算抛开朝鲜停战协定，放手扩大和加强美国在朝鲜的侵略军事力量，加剧紧张局势。
    美国在朝鲜的这一阴谋活动，是它破坏远东和平、准备新战争的总计划的一部分。关于这一点，杜勒斯在东南亚侵略集团曼谷会议上已经作了说明。据透露出来的消息说，杜勒斯在二月二十三日秘密会议上曾经吹嘘“美国在太平洋上的攻击力量”，并表示，美国把东南亚、台湾和朝鲜的形势看作是“一个整个形势的一部分”，是对中国进行侵略的“三条战线”。按照美国通讯社的说法，美国一旦在亚洲发动对中国的侵略战争，它不仅要东南亚条约组织国家采取“联合行动”，并且还要“从台湾放出蒋介石和从朝鲜放出李承晚相威胁”。
    美国和台湾蒋介石卖国集团签订条约，企图长期霸占我国领土台湾、澎湖列岛和沿海其他岛屿；并在台湾海峡驻屯大量海空军，向我国公开进行战争挑衅，造成了那里极端紧张的局势。美国和它的追随者举行的曼谷会议，其主要目的之一就是策划破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，把印度支那变成美国的侵略军事基地。现在，美国又片面宣布要结束监察朝鲜停战的中立国委员会，以便在南朝鲜加紧恢复侵略战争的准备。这就是美国侵略集团从这“三条战线”来加剧整个亚洲和太平洋地区紧张形势、准备新战争的步骤。
    二十个月来，由于朝、中人民和各国爱好和平人民对美方蓄谋破坏朝鲜停战的行为始终保持警觉，朝鲜的停战是维持下来了。在整个停战时期里，中立国监察委员会担当了监察停战协定的实施的重大任务。中立国委员会在执行停战双方所赋予它的任务中，虽然经常受到美方的百般阻挠，但是仍然做了不少的工作，这对于停战协定的实施和朝鲜停战的维持是有作用的。在今天美方日益加紧企图破坏停战协定的情况下，中立国监察委员会更增加了它的责任。中立国监察委员会的设置，是朝鲜停战协定不可分割的一部分，它是朝鲜停战缔约双方协议的结果，是不能由任何一方片面加以结束或废止的。美国侵略集团不顾它所负的国际协议的义务，积极图谋取消中立国监察委员会的行为，是完全非法的。一切愿望朝鲜停战稳定、维护和平的人民，都应该起来制止美国侵略者这种危害朝鲜和平的阴谋。
