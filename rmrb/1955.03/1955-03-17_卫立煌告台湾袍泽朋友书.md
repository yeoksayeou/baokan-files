A Letter to My Comrades and Friends in Taiwan

Comrades and Friends in Taiwan:

	In the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the motherland has made rapid progress in all aspects, unprecedented in history. Externally, the country's prestige in the international arena has been increasing day by day. Internally, it has enabled all ethnic groups to live in harmony and formed an unprecedented great unity. Even Tibet, which had been separated for decades, has now returned to the motherland. The motherland's economic construction has been advancing rapidly, achieving development from scratch and from small to large, such as the large-scale development and construction of heavy industries like steel, iron, coal, and oil, the harnessing of the Huai River, the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, and the construction of water conservancy projects in various places, the construction of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the expansion of the Baoji-Chengdu and Longhai Railways, the surveying and construction of the Baotou-Lanzhou and Chengdu-Kunming Railways, the completion of the Sino-Mongolian border railway, and the self-manufacture of airplanes, locomotives, ships, and so on. Especially in terms of personnel, regardless of the past, all those who have contributed to the country can be rewarded and supported equally (such as Cheng Songyun, Weng Wenhao, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Chen Mingren, Zheng Dongguo, etc.). This is in stark contrast to the Chiang Kai-shek era, when diplomacy was subservient to others and shamelessly flattering; in politics, the country was treated as a family, and dissidents were excluded; in the economic field, the country's economic lifeline was placed in the hands of the four major families; and in terms of personnel, the virtuous were envied and the capable were suppressed, and only relatives were used. The distinction between right and wrong, good and evil, is clear. All these ironclad facts, whether loved or hated, cannot be denied.

	Now Chiang Kai-shek does not hesitate to sell out the country and the nation, colluding with American forces, vainly attempting to counterattack the mainland. You all have been on the front lines in military and political affairs, so your knowledge is naturally profound. Just imagine, with his former strength of four million soldiers in the army, navy, and air force, and billions of dollars in military and economic aid from the United States, he still could not escape defeat and collapse. Now, with his hundreds of thousands of old, weak, and disabled soldiers, attempting to counterattack is nothing but a pipe dream, a ghost in broad daylight.

	Taiwan is Chinese territory, as documented in historical and diplomatic records. No one can distort the facts and deny it. The United States' attempt to forcibly occupy Taiwan by force is nothing more than its imperialist ambition for aggression. No matter how it reverses right and wrong and confuses the public, it cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world. Taiwan is to China as Hawaii is to the United States. If the fleet of another country were to霸占 the territorial waters of Hawaii, how would the American people feel? Moreover, liberating Taiwan is to punish Chiang Kai-shek, the sinner of China, which is purely an internal affair and is sympathized with by those who uphold justice in the world. Now Chiang Kai-shek has signed the US-Chiang Mutual Defense Treaty, attempting to use external forces to resist stubbornly. This is truly selling out sovereignty and letting wolves into the house. This kind of behavior is not only spurned by 600 million compatriots, but also hated by those with a conscience and a love for the country! You have all seen the fact that the motherland's strong military force forced the United States to cease fire during the Korean War. Taiwan will eventually be liberated, no matter which aspect you look at it from, it is an inevitable truth, a foregone conclusion.

	My friends, my comrades: I will now cite two personal experiences to make you even more aware of how despicable Chiang Kai-shek is. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was responsible for the First War Zone, fought bravely on the north bank of the Yellow River, and resisted the enemy for five years. Because I advocated that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should jointly resist the enemy, I advocated fair handling of all tasks and supplies undertaken by the Eighth Route Army (the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army). This aroused Chiang Kai-shek's suspicion, who thought I was favoring the Eighth Route Army and undermining his conspiracy to "pacify the country before resisting foreign aggression." He transferred me away from the First War Zone and secretly monitored me. The Battle of Northeast China was entirely planned and directed by Chiang Kai-shek himself in Shenyang. Although the generals unanimously expressed their opinions that it was not feasible, Chiang insisted on his own way, resulting in the annihilation of the entire army. Afterwards, due to accusations from the Legislative Yuan and the people, Chiang shirked responsibility to his subordinates, falsely accusing me of dereliction of duty, and sent military police special agents to monitor me at my private residence in Nanjing. Zhang Zhen, the commander of the military police, told me: Before seeing Chiang, it is best not to meet other guests. Later, Mr. Wu Liqing asked Chiang about this matter, and Chiang disclaimed knowledge of it. Mr. Wu then asked Zhang Zhen why the president did not know that military police were sent to Marshal Wei's home and not allowed to see guests. Zhang Zhen was horrified and did not know how to answer. The above two incidents are just the bigger ones among my personal experiences. I worked with Chiang Kai-shek for more than 30 years, and he was willing to do such insane, perverse, faithless, and treacherous things to harm his subordinates. Are you not wary yet!

	Since I joined the army in the Xinhai Revolution, I have been determined to devote myself to the revolution, hoping to help reform the corrupt old society and build a modern country. However, Chiang Kai-shek seized the leadership position, was blinded by greed, betrayed the revolution, and only sought to consolidate his personal power by all means, regardless of the national economy and the people's livelihood. As a result, decades of time were wasted, and I was unable to fulfill my wishes. I was both resentful and ashamed. Since I lived in Hong Kong for five years, I have been reading various books and newspapers behind closed doors, observing reality from an objective standpoint, and seeking revolutionary truth. Recalling Chiang Kai-shek's actions over the past few decades, compared with the achievements of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the past five years, I am even more clear about right and wrong, merits and demerits, and where to go. Therefore, I feel that these decades of mistakenly following Chiang Kai-shek, who harmed the country and the people, is really a disservice to the country and the people. Now the motherland is carrying out the liberation of Taiwan, giving us all an opportunity to be loyal to the revolution and do our best for the people, in order to atone for our past sins. Thinking of the comrades and friends in Taiwan who have shared hardships for decades under Chiang Kai-shek's clutches, I cannot bear to sit idly by and watch you sink and be destroyed with Chiang. Therefore, I sincerely and frankly inform you, hoping that you will wake up as soon as possible and do your best to help liberate Taiwan in tangible and intangible ways. Then, on the day of Taiwan's liberation, the motherland and the people will not fail you. These are my heartfelt words, I hope you will understand! The responsibility is arduous, please take care!

    卫立煌告台湾袍泽朋友书台湾袍泽们、朋友们：
    祖国近五年来，在共产党和毛主席领导下，凡百设施，突飞猛进，为有史以来所未有。对外在国际上国家声望日高，对内使各民族融洽共处，形成空前未有之大团结，以西藏数十年之离异，现又重回祖国。祖国经济建设一日千里，达到由无而有，自少而多，如钢、铁、煤、油等重工业之大量开发与建设，治淮、荆江分洪以及各地水利之兴修，康藏、青藏两公路及成渝铁路之筑成，宝成、陇海铁路之增筑，包兰、成昆铁路之测建，中蒙国境铁道之完成，以及自造飞机、火车头、轮船等等。尤其在人事方面，不论过去如何，凡对国家有所贡献者，均能奖励扶植，一视同仁（如程颂云、翁文灏、张治中、傅作义、陈明仁、郑洞国等等）。以视蒋介石时期，在外交上俯仰随人，厚颜谄媚；在政治上视国为家，排除异己；经济方面则将国家经济命脉置于四大家族之手；人事上嫉贤忌能，非亲莫用。真乃泾渭分明，善恶立判。凡此铁的事实，无论为爱为憎，都是不能加以否认的。
    现在蒋介石不惜出卖国家及民族，勾引美国力量，妄想反攻大陆。各位均在军政方面曾身当其冲的，所知当然深切。试想以他当年具有海、陆、空军四百万之声势与美国数十亿之军经援助，尚且逃不了溃败垮台，目前以他几十万老弱残兵，而图反攻，岂不是痴人说梦，白昼见鬼吗？
    台湾是中国领土，乃是历史上和外交上文献所具载，任何人不能歪曲事实，加以否认。美国欲以武力强据台湾，乃其别具帝国主义者侵略野心，无论他如何颠倒是非，混淆视听，也不能掩盖天下人的耳目。台湾之于中国，正如夏威夷之于美国，如有其他国家舰队霸占夏威夷领海，他们美国人民又将作何感想？何况解放台湾，是讨伐中国的罪人蒋介石，纯是内政问题，是世界上主持正义者所同情的。今蒋介石乃与美国订立美蒋防御公约，图借外力负隅拒抗，真是出卖主权，引狼入室，这种行为不但为六亿同胞所唾弃，更为具有天良，心存爱国者所切齿！各位已看到了韩战时祖国坚强军力迫使美国停战之事实，台湾最后必定解放，无论按那一方面说，都是必然之理，既成之势。
    各位朋友，各位袍泽：我现举两项个人亲身经历之事，使各位更知蒋介石如何卑劣。抗战时期，我负第一战区责任，在黄河北岸，背水奋战，拒敌五年。因为我主张国共共同抗敌，故凡八路军（解放军前身）担任之任务和补给，都主张公平办理。乃竟招蒋疑忌，认为我偏袒八路军，破坏他攘外必先安内之阴谋，将我调离第一战区，并暗行监视。东北之战，完全由蒋三到沈阳亲自主持策定，虽经各将领一致陈述意见，认为不可，但蒋一意孤行，终至全军覆殁。事后因受立法院及国人指责，乃竟向部下诿卸责任，诬为系我失职，派宪兵特务将我监视于南京私邸，并由宪兵司令张镇告我：未见蒋以前，最好不要接见其他客人。后经吴礼卿先生向蒋提问此事，蒋竟诿称不知。吴先生事后又问张镇何以总统并不知道卫长官家中会派有宪兵，不许见客。张镇闻言，惶恐不知所答。以上二事，不过就我亲身经历中较大者而言。我同蒋介石共事三十余年，他都肯作出这种丧心病狂，倒行逆施，背信弃义、陷害部属的事来，诸位还不及早警惕吗！
    我自辛亥年投笔从戎以来，即决心献身革命，希望有所助益于改革腐旧社会，建设现代国家。只因蒋介石窃据领导地位，利欲迷人，背叛革命，只图千方百计巩固私人权势，置国计民生于不顾。以致几十年光阴虚耗，未能如愿以偿，既恨且愧。自从我在香港住了五年以来，闭门阅读各种书报杂志，站在客观的立场观察实际，寻求革命真理。回想过去蒋介石几十年来的所作所为，比起共产党和毛主席领导下五年来的建树，使我更为明白是非功罪，何去何从。所以我觉得这几十年误随了祸国殃民的蒋介石，实在愧对国家愧对国人。现在祖国正在进行解放台湾，予我们大家一个效忠革命，为人民尽力的机会，以赎前愆。遥念在台数十年共患难的袍泽们、朋友们还在蒋介石魔掌之下，不忍坐视诸位随蒋沉沦毁灭。故特掬诚坦告，深望诸位及早醒悟，对于有助于解放台湾者，在有形无形中，各自乘机量力而为，则台湾解放之日，祖国及国人必不有负于诸位。肺腑之言，敬希谅察！责任艰巨，诸维珍重！
