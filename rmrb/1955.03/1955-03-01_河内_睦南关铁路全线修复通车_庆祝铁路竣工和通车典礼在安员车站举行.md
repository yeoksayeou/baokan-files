Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 28th: A ceremony celebrating the completion and opening of the Hanoi-Friendship Pass Railway was held at Anyuan Station, 11 kilometers northeast of Hanoi, on the morning of February 28th. The station was freshly decorated for the occasion, and the national flags of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China, as well as portraits of President Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Mao Zedong, were hung at the venue.

    范文同, Vice Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Tôn Đức Thắng, Acting Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of Vietnam, Thi Sơn, President of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, ministers and vice-ministers of various government departments, leaders of various democratic parties and mass organizations in Vietnam, representatives from various inter-zones and provinces, and model workers who participated in the construction of the railway attended the ceremony.

    Luo Guibo, Ambassador of China to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, also attended the ceremony. Representatives of Chinese experts, technicians, and workers who participated in the railway restoration project also attended the ceremony from the Chinese side.

    After the band played the national anthems of Vietnam and China, Tran Dang Khoa, Minister of Transport and Public Works of the Vietnamese government, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Today, we are joyously celebrating the completion of the Hanoi-Friendship Pass and Pingxiang-Friendship Pass Railways together with our great friendly neighbor, China. Our capital, Hanoi, has been connected to China by a solid railway, and through China, it is connected to the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries. This is a very significant victory, and it has great significance and role."

    Tran Dang Khoa said, "From the start of construction on October 26, 1954, to the present, we have completed a huge task, which is a remarkable achievement to be recorded in the history of Vietnamese railways." He then pointed out that the glorious achievements were due to the enthusiastic work of compatriots from all over the country, the generous assistance of friendly China, and the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the Vietnamese government.

    Tran Dang Khoa said that this railway has brought confidence to people of all strata, enabling them to engage in greater undertakings in peaceful construction. It clearly demonstrates the strength of unity among all the people in the country, and the strength of unity between the people of Vietnam and the people of China, as well as peace-loving people all over the world. This force will shatter all the vicious conspiracies of the American imperialists, the French colonialists who are undermining the Geneva Accords, and their running dogs.

    Next, Chinese Ambassador Luo Guibo delivered a speech. He extended warm congratulations to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China. Luo Guibo said that the rapid restoration and early opening of the Hanoi-Friendship Pass Railway marks a great victory for the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in their efforts to restore and develop peaceful economic construction. This great victory fully proves that under the wise leadership of Vietnam Workers' Party, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and President Ho Chi minh, the Vietnamese people are not only able to achieve victory in the War of Resistance, but also to achieve great victories in the cause of restoring and developing the national economy in a peaceful environment.

    Luo Guibo said that the people of China and Vietnam have a traditional friendship. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, this friendship has embarked on a new stage of development. The Chinese people have always shown deep sympathy and concern for the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence and freedom. The Chinese people have especially shown deep concern and support for the efforts made by the Vietnamese people to restore and develop peaceful economic construction. The completion and opening of the Hanoi-Friendship Pass Railway will enable further development of economic cooperation and cultural exchange between China and Vietnam.

    After the speeches, Vice Premier Pham Van Dong cut the ribbon. At 7:35, amidst cheers from the crowd, the first train on the Hanoi-Friendship Pass Railway slowly departed from Anyuan Station. This train included hard-seat cars and soft-seat cars, sleeping cars and dining cars. A portrait of President Ho Chi Minh and Chairman Mao Zedong was erected high in front of the locomotive. Representatives from various departments of the Vietnamese government, various regions, and South Vietnam, as well as model workers, were on board the train, and they were warmly welcomed by the masses at each station along the way.

    庆祝铁路竣工和通车典礼在安员车站举行
    【新华社河内二十八日电】二月二十八日早晨，在河内东北十一公里的安员车站举行了庆祝河内—睦南关铁路竣工和通车的典礼。这个车站今天被布置得焕然一新，会场上挂着越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国的国旗、胡志明主席和毛泽东主席的画像。
    越南民主共和国副总理范文同、越南国民大会常务委员会代理主席孙德胜、越中友好协会会长诗山和政府各部部长、副部长，越南各民主党派、各群众团体的负责人，各联区、各省的代表和修筑铁路的劳动模范等参加了典礼。
    中国驻越南民主共和国大使罗贵波也参加了典礼。中国方面参加典礼的还有参加铁路修复工程的中国专家、技术人员和工人的代表。
    乐队奏越、中两国国歌后，越南政府交通公政部部长陈登科在会上讲话。他说，今天我们和伟大的友邦中国一道欢欣鼓舞地庆祝河内—睦南关和凭祥—睦南关铁路的竣工。我们的首都河内已经由一条巩固的铁路和中国连接起来，并且通过中国同苏联和各人民民主国家连接上了。这是一个很重大的胜利，它具有重大的意义和作用。
    陈登科说，从一九五四年十月二十六日施工到目前为止，我们已经完成了一项巨大的工作，这是值得在越南铁路史上记载的成绩。他接着指出，所以取得这些光荣的成绩，是由于各地同胞热情的工作，由于友邦中国慷慨的援助，由于胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南政府的英明领导。
    陈登科说，这条铁路为各阶层人民带来了信心，使他们从事和平建设中的更大事业。它明显地表示着国内全体人民团结的力量，越南人民和中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民之间团结的力量。这支力量将粉碎美帝国主义者、破坏日内瓦协定的法国殖民分子和其走狗的一切恶毒阴谋。
    接着，中国大使罗贵波致词。他代表中华人民共和国政府向越南民主共和国政府表示热烈的祝贺。罗贵波说，河内—睦南关铁路的迅速修复和提前通车，标志着越南人民和越南民主共和国政府在为恢复和发展和平经济建设事业中取得一次伟大的胜利。这一伟大的胜利充分证明了越南人民在越南劳动党、越南民主共和国政府和胡志明主席的英明领导下，不仅在抗战的时期中能够取得抗战的胜利，而且能够在和平环境中，在恢复和发展国民经济的事业中取得伟大的胜利。
    罗贵波说，中越两国人民具有传统的友谊。自从中华人民共和国成立之后，这种友谊就踏上了新的发展阶段。中国人民对于越南人民争取民族独立和自由的斗争，一向是寄以深切的同情和关怀的。中国人民对于越南人民为恢复和发展和平经济建设事业所作的努力，尤其寄以深切的关怀和支持。河内—睦南关铁路的竣工和通车，将使中越两国经济合作和文化交流获得进一步的发展。
    讲话后，由范文同副总理剪彩。七时三十五分，在人群的欢呼声中，河内—睦南关铁路上的第一次列车徐徐开出了安员车站。这节列车包括硬席车和软席车、卧车和餐车。机车前面高竖着胡志明主席和毛泽东主席的画像。乘坐在列车上的有越南政府各部门、各地区和南越的代表、以及模范工人等，他们在沿途各站受到群众极热烈的欢迎。
