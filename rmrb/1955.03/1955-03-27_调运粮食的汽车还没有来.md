To the Editor:

In November of last year, the Grain Bureau of the Dangyang County People's Government, Hubei Province, made a decision based on instructions from higher authorities: to transport five million jin of rice from Banyue District of Dangyang County to Jiangkou Town in Zhijiang County. After this massive grain transport plan was decided, the county Grain Bureau notified the grain stores and warehouses in Banyue District to immediately prepare the grain and await transport.

Banyue District is a rice-producing area, but because it is a mountainous region, transportation is very inconvenient. In previous years, the grain harvested here was transported out by manpower and animal power, which took a lot of time and affected farmers' production. To solve this problem, the county Transportation Section decided to build a section of highway from Banyue Town to Jiangkou Town to assist in this grain transport work. With the highway problem solved, the county Grain Bureau formulated a very detailed plan: first, build a shed next to the highway in Banyue District that could hold three million jin of grain, and then mobilize the masses to concentrate the grain scattered in various townships here in preparation for outward transportation. They planned to have fifteen trucks arrive every day, with each truck making three round trips a day. In this way, the task of transporting five million jin of grain could be completed in December 1954, at the latest by January of this year.

The farmers of Banyue District were very excited to hear the news of grain being transported by trucks. They were afraid of not being able to supply enough for the trucks to transport, and they worked day and night to send the grain to the new warehouse. Soon, the new warehouse was piled high with rice.

In this mountainous area, using trucks to transport grain was still a novelty. The county Grain Bureau also felt that this was a major event, so they decided to hold a grand opening ceremony on December 5th. Nearby farmers came to attend the meeting. The district's theater troupe also came to perform to add to the excitement. But, alas, the trucks did not come that day. One day, two days... a week passed, and the trucks still did not come. A month passed, and the trucks still did not come. On December 29th, there was a heavy snowfall, and it only cleared up on January 8th. After that, it was the Spring Festival, and still no sign of the trucks.

Now, the grain in the Banyue District granary has become moldy, and there have been several theft incidents. It is impossible to calculate how much grain has been lost for the time being. However, the waste of manpower and resources caused by this grain transport work is already considerable. In order to salvage this batch of grain, the Dangyang County People's Government Grain Bureau should quickly take urgent measures and not sit idly by and watch the grain continue to spoil.

### 调运粮食的汽车还没有来

    调运粮食的汽车还没有来编辑同志：
    去年十一月里，湖北省当阳县人民政府粮食局根据上级的指示作出了一项决定：从当阳县半月区调运五百万斤稻谷到枝江县的江口镇。这个庞大的运粮计划决定以后，县粮食局就通知半月区的粮店和仓库立刻把粮食准备好，等待调运。
    半月区是个盛产稻米的地方，因为是山区，交通很不方便。往年，这里收获的粮食都是用人力和畜力向外运，费的时间很多，影响农民的生产。为了解决这个问题，县交通科决定从半月镇到江口镇修筑一段公路，协助这次的运粮工作。公路的问题解决了，县粮食局又订了一套十分精细的计划：首先在半月区的公路旁边修筑了一栋可容三百万斤粮食的货棚，然后发动群众把分散在各乡的粮食集中到这里，准备外运。他们计划每天来用十五辆汽车，每辆汽车一天来回运三次。这样，在一九五四年十二月份，最迟到今年一月份就可以完成五百万斤粮食的调运任务。
    半月区的农民群众听到用汽车运粮的消息，都十分兴奋。他们唯恐供不上汽车的运输量，日夜不停地把粮食送到新的仓库里来。不久，这个新仓库便堆满了稻谷。
    在这个山区，用汽车来运粮食还是件新鲜事，县粮食局也感到这是一件大事，就决定十二月五日召开一个隆重的通车典礼大会。附近的农民都赶来参加这个会。区里的剧团也来演剧助兴。但是，真遗憾，这一天汽车并没有来。一天，两天……一个星期过去了，汽车还没有来。一个月过去了，汽车还是没有来。到十二月二十九日，下了一场大雪，直到一月八日才晴，以后接着就是过春节，到现在仍然不见汽车的影子。
    现在，半月区粮仓的粮食已经发霉了，并且发生了多次盗窃事故。究竟损失了多少粮食，一时还无法计算。但是在这次粮食调运工作中造成的人力物力的浪费，已经是十分可观了。为了挽救这批粮食，当阳县人民政府粮食局应该赶快采取紧急措施，不要再坐视粮食继续霉坏下去。
