Xinhua News Agency, London, March 4th: According to TASS, a rally of 2,000 people was held in London on the 2nd under the slogan "Negotiate with the Soviet Union Now".

The rally was organized by the "Tribune" weekly newspaper. Michael Foot, a Labour MP who chaired the meeting, stressed that the main issues to be discussed at this meeting were the urgent need to discuss the German question with Soviet leaders before ratifying the Paris Agreements, and to reach an agreement on banning hydrogen and atomic weapons.

The main speakers at the meeting were Labour MP Bevan and Methodist leader Dr. Donald Soper. Both of them called for peaceful solutions to international problems. Their words were met with enthusiastic applause from the large audience.

Bevan said, "The only way now is peaceful negotiation. There is no other way."

Bevan said that attempting to impose rearmament on the German people against their will was "criminal stupidity."

Bevan accused both the Conservative and Labour leaders of trying to force German rearmament. He said that there could be no peace in Europe while Germany remained divided. If you want peace in Europe, you must give Germany a chance for peaceful reunification. We want immediate action. The Conservatives and Labour are both opposed to negotiating with the Soviet Union at this time, and I believe that they represent only a very small minority opinion in the House of Commons.

Bevan said, "In the Far East, the United States is also trying to restore a corrupt regime in China, just as it is trying to restore a militarist regime in Germany. This is not a policy of peace, but a policy of war. Now is the time for the British people to stop this attitude towards the development of the situation."

Bevan went on to say that Britain's threat to use the hydrogen bomb against others is tantamount to suicide. The time has come for the British people to tell the government that they want a more moderate and wiser attitude in international affairs. "I hope this rally will tell Churchill that the time has come to act or step down."

Soper told the crowd that what he saw and heard during his visit to the Soviet Union convinced him that the Soviet people wanted peace. He said that he was disturbed by the assumption running through the March 1st debate in the House of Commons that the enemy was Russia. He said, "This is wicked nonsense. It is untrue, and never has been true."

Soper said that all Christians should demand immediate talks with the Soviet Union on the German question, and should support the demand for the abolition of hydrogen and atomic weapons.

    伦敦两千人集会要英政府立即同苏联谈判
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：在“现在就同苏联谈判”的口号下，伦敦在二日举行了一个两千人的集会。
    集会是“论坛”周报组织的。主持集会的工党议员迈克尔·福特强调说：这次集会要讨论的主要问题是：在批准巴黎协定之前同苏联领袖讨论德国问题以及就禁止氢武器和原子武器达成协议的迫切必要性。
    会上的主要演讲人是工党议员比万和卫理公会领袖唐纳德·索佩尔博士。他们两人都要求用和平方法解决国际问题。他们的话赢得了广大听众热烈的掌声。
    比万说：“现在只能和平谈判。没有别的办法。”
    比万说：企图违反德国人民的意志，把重新武装强加在他们身上，是“愚蠢到了犯罪的地步”。
    比万指责保守党和工党领袖都设法强使德国重新武装。他说：当德国处于分裂状态的时候，欧洲绝不可能有和平。你如果希望欧洲实现和平，就必须给德国一个和平统一的机会。我们希望立即采取行动。保守党和工党都反对在目前同苏联谈判，我认为，它们在下院都不过只代表极少数人的意见。
    比万说：“美国在远东也正在设法使一个腐朽的政权在中国复辟，就像它企图在德国恢复军国主义的政权一样。这不是和平政策，而是战争政策。现在是英国人民制止这种对待事态发展的态度的时候了。”
    比万接着说：英国用氢弹来威胁别人实际上就等于自杀。时候已经到来：英国人民应该告诉政府，他们希望在国际事务中采取柔和一点、明智一点的态度。“我希望这次集会会告诉邱吉尔：现在已经到了不下台就得采取行动的时候了。”
    索佩尔向到会的群众说，他在访问苏联期间的所见所闻使他深信苏联人民是希望和平的。他说，使他感到忧虑的是贯穿下院三月一日的辩论的这样一种假设：敌人是俄国。他说：“这是一种邪恶的废话。它是不真实的，而且从来不曾真实过。”
    索佩尔说，所有基督徒都应当要求现在就德国问题同苏联会谈，都应当支持取消氢武器和原子武器的要求。
