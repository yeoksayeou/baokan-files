    The Pattern of the US Conspiracy to Sabotage the Armistice
    Cui Qi
    Currently, the United States is plotting to tear up the armistice agreement in Korea while stepping up its efforts to undermine the Geneva Accords in Indochina. To achieve this goal of sabotaging the armistice, its approach in both places has a clear commonality: attacking the neutral international bodies that oversee the armistice.
    In Korea, the United States has openly stated that it wants to abandon the basic terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement and abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC). Encouraged by the United States, Byun Young-tae, the "Foreign Minister" of the Syngman Rhee group, brazenly shouted on March 19 that he was prepared to use force to compel the Polish and Czechoslovak members of the NNSC to leave South Korea. He also advocated declaring the armistice agreement "invalid."
    In South Vietnam, the United States has instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem elements to rudely obstruct the activities of the International Supervisory and Control Commission, even attacking and insulting the staff of the international inspection teams. The Ngo Dinh Diem group has also launched a so-called "signature campaign," clamoring for the "automatic dissolution" of the International Supervisory and Control Commission. Its press office openly stated that "the Geneva Accords are of no value to Ngo Dinh Diem of Vietnam."
    Similarly, the United States has constantly promoted the idea that the Royal Government of Cambodia is demanding that the International Supervisory and Control Commission cease its activities and withdraw from Cambodia.
    For more than a year, people have long seen through the pattern of the US conspiracy to sabotage the armistice in Korea and Indochina. First, it creates a series of incidents that violate the armistice agreement, obstructing and undermining the activities of the international supervisory commissions; then, it falsely accuses the other side of "sabotaging" the armistice agreement and creates public opinion that the international supervisory commissions are "useless"; subsequently, it openly states that it wants to "abolish" the international supervisory commissions and uses the Syngman Rhee and Ngo Dinh Diem groups to threaten with force, attempting to achieve its goals.
    However, Britain, which follows the US aggressive policy, also comes out to act according to the US pattern. Just as the United States is about to sabotage the Korean NNSC, the British Foreign Office, on March 22, repeated the hackneyed arguments of the United States, falsely accusing the Korean-Chinese side of violating the armistice agreement and also stating that the NNSC is useless and wanting to abolish it. The British Foreign Office wants to prove that the US pattern is the British pattern, which is certainly not glorious for itself and does not help the United States much.
    Not to mention that Britain cannot cover up the crimes of the United States, even the United States cannot cover up itself. Upright people have seen who is destroying international agreements. In Korea, the United States violates the armistice agreement, constantly illegally transporting large quantities of reinforcements, weapons, and military supplies into South Korea to strengthen its military power in South Korea. In Indochina, the United States has violated the Geneva Accords and carried out various activities in an attempt to undermine the general elections in South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and expand the US aggressive forces. The United States is also trying to formally drag them into the Southeast Asia military bloc and turn them into US military bases. The armed offensive against the Laotian combat forces planned by the United States is a serious violation of international agreements.
    The fact is that precisely because the international armistice supervision work plays a significant role in ensuring the implementation of the armistice agreements in Korea and Indochina, the United States shows extreme hostility to this kind of international supervision. The various slanders of the United States against international supervisory bodies nakedly demonstrate this hostile attitude.
    Originally, whether in Korea or in Indochina, the United States did not accept the armistice willingly, but was forced to do so by powerful and effective peaceful forces. But the United States does not regard the armistice in these two places as the realization of peace, but attempts to make a comeback, regarding the armistice as the beginning of another war preparation. According to an Associated Press report on March 20, the US State Department believes that the reason it is demanding the abolition of the basic terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the "abolition" of the NNSC is to "legally clear the way so that the United States—the United Nations Korea Command—can take any measures that may be found appropriate (!) to strengthen the position and... military strength of its forces." It can be seen from this that if the international armistice supervision work is abolished, it will only facilitate the United States to do whatever it wants in Korea and Indochina, turn these two places into US war origins, and allow the United States to find excuses to provoke war at any time.
    Peace-loving people must not allow this conspiracy of the United States to succeed. Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the Indian Parliament on March 21 that the Indian government does not agree to abolish the NNSC. He said:
  “If this neutral body is dissolved, it will not help the current situation in Korea.” The governments of Czechoslovakia and Poland have also successively replied to the governments of Sweden and Switzerland, believing that the existence of the NNSC is an important factor in maintaining peace in Korea and world peace. All those who are truly concerned about peace in Asia will rise up to safeguard the international supervision work in Korea and Indochina, and stop the United States from sabotaging the armistice agreement in order to guarantee peace in Asia.

    美国破坏停战的阴谋的规律
    崔奇
    目前，美国一边在朝鲜策划撕毁停战协定，一边在印度支那加紧破坏日内瓦协议。为了达到这种破坏停战的目的，它在这两个地方的做法有一个明显的共同点，这就是：向监督停战的中立国国际机构实行进攻。
    在朝鲜，美国公开表示它要废弃朝鲜停战协定的基本条款，取消中立国监察委员会。由于美国的鼓励，李承晚集团“外务部长官”卞荣泰于三月十九日放肆地叫喊，准备用武力强迫中立国监察委员会的波兰委员和捷克斯洛伐克委员离开南朝鲜。他并主张宣布停战协定“无效”。
    在南越，美国指使吴庭艳分子蛮横地阻挠国际监督和监察委员会的活动，甚至攻击和侮辱国际视察小组的工作人员。吴庭艳集团并展开什么“签名运动”，叫嚷国际监督和监察委员会“自动解散”。它的新闻处公然表示，“日内瓦协定对越南吴庭艳是没有价值的”。
    同样的，美国也不断宣传说柬埔寨王国政府要求国际监督和监察委员会停止活动，并撤出柬埔寨。
    一年多以来，人们早已看清楚了美国在朝鲜和印度支那破坏停战的阴谋计划的规律。首先，它制造一系列违反停战协议的事件，阻挠和破坏国际监察委员会的活动；跟着，它诬蔑对方“破坏”停战协议，并制造舆论说，国际监察委员会“没有用处”；随后它就公开表示要“取消”国际监察委员会，并利用李承晚和吴庭艳集团出来以武力相威胁，企图达到它的目的。
    但是，尾随着美国的侵略政策的英国却还要出来按照美国的规律办事。正当美国要破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会的时候，英国外交部却在二十二日重复美国的滥调，诬指朝中方面违反停战协定，并也表示中立国监察委员会没有用处，想把它取消。英国外交部想证明美国的规律就是英国的规律，这对它自己当然不是什么光彩的事，就是对美国也帮不了什么忙。
    不要说英国掩饰不了美国的罪恶行为，就是美国也无法掩饰它自己。正直的人们都看到了破坏国际协议的究竟是谁。在朝鲜，美国破坏停战协定，不断地非法运进南朝鲜大批增援性武器和军用物资，来加强它在南朝鲜的军事力量。在印度支那，美国违反日内瓦协议，进行了种种活动，企图破坏南越、柬埔寨、老挝的普选，扩大美国的侵略势力。美国并企图把它们正式拖入东南亚军事集团，把它们变为美国军事基地。美国策划的对寮国战斗部队的武装进攻，更是严重违反了国际协议。
    事实是，正因为国际监察停战工作对于保障朝鲜和印度支那的停战协议的实施，起着重大的作用，美国才对这种国际监督表示极端仇视。美国对国际监察机构的种种诽谤，就露骨地表现了它的这种仇视心理。
    本来，不论是在朝鲜或是在印度支那，美国接受停战都不是心甘情愿的，是强大的有效的和平力量迫使它不得不如此。但是美国并不把这两个地方的停战看作是和平的实现，而是企图卷土重来，把停战看作是另一次战争准备的开始。据美联社三月二十日报道，美国国务院认为，它所以要求废除朝鲜停战协定的基本条款，“取消”中立国监察委员会，是为了“在法律上扫清道路，使美国——联合国朝鲜司令部能够采取可能发现是适宜的任何（！）措施来加强其部队的地位和……军事实力”。由此可见，如果取消国际监察停战工作，只会便于美国在朝鲜和印度支那为所欲为，把这两个地方变为美国的战争策源地，使美国随时可以寻找借口来挑起战争。
    爱好和平的人民决不能容许美国的这种阴谋得逞。印度总理尼赫鲁三月二十一日在印度国会表示了印度政府不赞成取消中立国监察委员会。他说：
  “要是解散这个中立机构的话，那将不会有助于目前朝鲜的局势”。捷克斯洛伐克和波兰两国政府也已经先后答复瑞典、瑞士政府，认为中立国监察委员会的存在是维护朝鲜和平和世界和平的重要因素。一切真正关心亚洲和平的人都将起来维护朝鲜和印度支那的国际监察工作，制止美国破坏停战协议的行为，以保障亚洲的和平。
