    Qinghai Province Vigorously Supports Resource Exploration Work in the Qaidam Basin

    All departments and organizations in Qinghai Province have been mobilized to vigorously support resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin.

    The Qaidam Basin, located in the northwestern part of Qinghai Province, is a rich basin covering an area of approximately 220,000 square kilometers. Preliminary exploration has revealed that it has excellent oil-bearing structures and other valuable mineral deposits, as well as vast arable land and grazing grasslands. This year, the Qaidam Basin is one of the key areas for national oil exploration work.

    In February of this year, the enlarged meeting of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to make supporting the Qaidam resource exploration work one of the province's main tasks. In early March, the Qinghai Provincial People's Committee held a meeting and approved the establishment of the Qaidam Affairs Office, deciding to dispatch a work team to be responsible for support work. In order to increase the production of grain, oil crops, and vegetables to support the exploration work, the water conservancy survey and design team and wasteland survey team dispatched by the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Water Conservancy Bureau, all entered the Qaidam construction site in mid-March. In order to ensure convenient transportation, the Provincial Department of Transportation specially dispatched transportation engineering personnel in January to conduct preliminary surveys of the routes to Qaidam, and recently established a highway repair team. The Provincial Department of Commerce decided to expand the existing trade organizations in Qaidam and will send more than 40 people to strengthen leadership work. The Provincial Grain Bureau has designated special personnel to be responsible for the transfer of grain and will set up a grain supply station in Golmud. The Provincial Department of Industry also dispatched a coal exploration team in mid-February and is actively carrying out all preparations for opening a coal mine in Qaidam to ensure fuel supply. The Provincial Department of Health is also planning to add medical personnel and increase medical equipment in Qaidam. The Provincial Posts and Telecommunications Bureau plans to add a post office in Qaidam and will organize several mobile service teams to deliver newspapers and periodicals to the construction site in a timely manner. In addition, the Provincial Bureau of Foreign Trade is rushing to produce various leather clothing, leather hats, and other items for the employees who are about to enter Qaidam. The Provincial Public Security Department will also dispatch security personnel to ensure the smooth progress of exploration work.

    青海省大力支援柴达木盆地资源勘察工作
    青海省各机关已动员起来，大力支援柴达木盆地资源勘察工作。
    柴达木盆地在青海省西北部，是一个约有二十二万平方公里的富饶盆地。据初步勘探，发现它有很好的石油储油构造和其他宝贵矿藏，而且还有极其广阔的农业可耕土地和放牧的草原。今年，柴达木盆地是全国石油勘察工作的重点之一。
    今年二月间，中共青海省委扩大会议作出决定，将支援柴达木资源勘察工作作为全省主要任务之一。三月初，青海省人民委员会开会通过成立柴达木事务办公室，决定派遣工作团负责进行支援工作。为了增产粮食、油料和蔬菜来支援勘察工作，青海省农林厅水利局派出的水利勘测设计队和荒地踏勘队，已在三月中旬全部进入柴达木工地。为了保证交通运输上的方便，省交通处在一月间专门派出交通工程人员，对通往柴达木的线路作了初步踏勘工作，并在最近成立了抢修公路队。省商业厅决定扩大柴达木原有的贸易机构，并将派出四十多人加强领导工作。省粮食局已指派专人负责调运粮食的工作，并将在噶尔穆设立粮食供应站。省工业厅也在二月中旬派出了煤炭勘察队，并且积极进行在柴达木开办煤矿的一切准备工作，以保证燃料的供应。省卫生厅也正计划在柴达木增添医务人员，增加医疗设备。省邮电局计划在柴达木增设邮局一处，并将组织若干流动服务小组，以便将报纸、书刊及时送到工地。此外，省对外贸易局正为即将进入柴达木的职工赶制各种皮衣、皮帽等。省公安厅也将派出保卫人员，以保证勘察工作顺利进行。
