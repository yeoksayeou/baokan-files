    My Experiences in Scientific Research
    Hua Luogeng
    Before writing this article, many thoughts came to my mind. First, I know that I am still a novice in scientific research, with few achievements and a lack of experience. Second, even if I have some experience, it is extremely one-sided; because I am only familiar with a small part of science—a tiny part of mathematics. Whether this experience can be applied to other parts is highly doubtful. And third, I am still a young scientific worker. Although I have done some work, it is only the beginning in terms of my entire life. New experiences are constantly being discovered, and old methods are constantly being revised and negated. Therefore, what I say today is likely to be very superficial or even wrong in the future, not to mention its completeness. But I finally wrote this article, mainly because I feel that even some small experiences may be useful for younger scientific workers than me.

    Scientific Research Requires a Solid Foundation

    What is a solid foundation? Does being able to recite and repeat perfectly and being thoroughly familiar with something count as having a solid foundation? I don't think so. Moreover, I don't think this is the best way to build a solid foundation. Because someone who truly understands the achievements of predecessors or the knowledge in books doesn't necessarily have to recite them word for word. On the contrary, someone who can recite word for word is not necessarily someone who truly understands.

    "True understanding" of course includes understanding the logical reasoning in books, but more importantly, it also includes the following: You must put yourself in the position of thinking, before this law (or theorem) was discovered, whether it would be possible for me to discover it. If possible, what kind of practical and thought process would it take to obtain it? Needless to say, when studying the proof, it is even more important to understand the central link. Because understanding the central link can sometimes make the proof or theorem appear intuitive and simple. At the same time, truly understanding the central link of a book or a chapter often plays a decisive role in understanding the entire content. Not only that, it can also help with memory, because something that is remembered through understanding is more profound and less likely to be forgotten than word-for-word memory. If you forget a word or a sentence when using word-for-word memorization, there is a great possibility that the whole thing will be wrong.

    After finishing a book (or an article), you must also do some analytical work. For particularly important conclusions, you must analyze which knowledge in the book it relies on. It is very likely that a law is written on page 250, but in reality, only 20 or 30 pages scattered in various places before it are needed. The more thoroughly this analytical work is done, the more convenient it will be to use when doing research. In research, you may encounter problems similar to page 250. If someone who has not done analytical work tries to solve such a problem, they will involve considering 250 pages. However, someone who has done analytical work only needs to consider 20 or 30 pages.

    Analysis is important, but don't forget the synthesis after analysis. In other words, the relationship between the central links must be paid attention to, even if you can recognize that there is no connection between them. Because such a conclusion can help us make a preliminary conclusion. If we find that they are related at a higher stage, it can help us realize that our understanding has improved a step further. This is much better than swallowing it whole from beginning to end. After reading a book, it is also necessary to connect the content of the book with what you have read in the past. For example, when learning quadratic forms in algebra in the mathematics department of a university, you must connect it with the conic sections of geometry learned in middle school. When learning symmetric kernels of integral equations, you must connect it with quadratic forms of algebra.

    Perhaps some people say that many of the above points are what university teachers should pay attention to when teaching. Yes. University teachers should raise the pointing out and explanation of the central links above the word-for-word explanation. They should explain the content comprehensively and clearly, and not circle around on the trivial matters. They should explain the key points of this discipline and other adjacent disciplines clearly. But the most important thing is to rely on yourself, because what teachers can point out is always very limited, while what we can understand ourselves, and what we need to understand ourselves, is endless.

    Speaking of foundations, anyone who has done scientific research work or is about to engage in scientific research work will always ask: How big should the foundation be? If we answer in general terms that the bigger the foundation, the better, it will not solve the problem. Because it is very likely that you will be building the foundation for your whole life, and the foundation has not yet been laid. Therefore, we must have a specific standard, and we must give it full possibilities for development. Regarding the specific standard of the foundation, I think it is relatively easy to answer satisfactorily today: that is, to require ourselves with the professional knowledge of Soviet university graduates (I am not saying to require ourselves with the professional knowledge of our university graduates, because our standards have not been fully fixed). But don't limit yourself, you should gradually broaden your horizons and gradually expand your foundation during professional research, so as to build higher pagodas on a larger foundation. The method of limiting oneself is sometimes unconscious. For example, some college students see the problems in the "Mathematics Bulletin" question and answer column and think that they are of middle school level, so they ignore them. Before liberation, some students who studied geometry paid no attention to algebra at all, not to mention students who studied mathematics paying attention to mechanics. This way of thinking will lead people into a dead end without realizing it. Of course, the key point is indispensable, and the major must be fixed (at least for a considerable period of time, do not arbitrarily transfer); but do not give up any opportunity to broaden your horizons and expand your research field.

    Independent Thinking Ability and Mentors

    After being liberated from formalistic understanding, independent thinking ability becomes the central link in doing good research. Independent thinking ability is an indispensable talent for scientific research and invention. In history, any relatively important scientific creation and invention is inseparable from the creator's independent and in-depth way of looking at problems. Because only in this way can we transcend conventions, not be limited by the conclusions of our predecessors, delve into the essence of things, and create new conclusions in a unique way. Since everything is constantly developing, the achievements we have obtained yesterday, on the one hand, have become our intellectual wealth, but on the other hand, they have also brought some biased views with them. If we use the past methods unchanged to study today's things, we may not be able to solve the problems and obtain results. When we find that some problems cannot be solved by past methods, we must create new methods. Therefore, we must rely on the independent thinking ability to break through the conventions of our predecessors.

    Due to the nature of science and its historical development process, we can realize that science is gradually deepening, even infinitely deepening. Because science is ever-changing, we often discover some truths every time we remove an obstacle. When breaking through these layers of obstacles, we often need to use new and original methods that are completely different from the past to succeed; therefore, the continuous progress of science must rely on originality. Perhaps it is not an exaggeration to say that independent thinking is a necessary method for obtaining correct understanding, and it is also the only way to overcome difficulties in science. Many examples can illustrate that some college students do well in school and are excellent students under the guidance of teachers, but once they leave the teacher to participate in work, they stagnate and are helpless when encountering difficulties. This phenomenon is because they have only learned some knowledge from the teacher, but have not acquired the ability to think independently.

    Independent thinking has nothing in common with not accepting the achievements of predecessors. If someone thinks that research work is original, as long as they think independently and deeply, they don't need to read a lot of books, accept the experience of their predecessors, or rely on the masses, this view is also wrong. Such a view will lead people into the failed path that their predecessors have taken, and thus waste their energy. Take the "trisection of an angle" in mathematics as an example. Due to ignorance, some people still stubbornly want to use a compass and ruler to trisect an arbitrary angle, which is a waste of energy. Because the trisection of an arbitrary angle is a famous problem in the Middle Ages, but it has been completely solved today (that is, it has been proved that it is impossible to trisect an arbitrary angle with a compass and ruler). If we refuse to accept the achievements of our predecessors and still stagnate our knowledge at the level of the Middle Ages, blindly carrying out this useless research, it is of course no wonder that we will waste our energy like the "angle trisectors" of the Middle Ages!

    Independent thinking is not incompatible with not needing a mentor. Excellent mentors have countless successful and failed experiences, especially the latter, which are often not easy to find in books—because books only record successful creations, and rarely record the countless failures and the arduous thinking process of countless gradual advancements before the invention. And excellent mentors are like navigators on a voyage. They can tell you where there are reefs and where the channel is. But one point must be pointed out: it is also unacceptable to not think independently and rely on the mentor blindly. Because mentors also have subjective or unconsidered points. On the other hand, don't be discouraged if you don't have a mentor. According to my personal experience, due to self-study, I have studied the knowledge of middle school and university levels. Of course, it took a lot of time and energy, but I don't regret it, because today, in my research work, I can freely use any part of elementary mathematics, which cannot but be attributed to my early research efforts in elementary mathematics. At the same time, every comrade who has just embarked on the road of research must also see that due to the immaturity of our country's scientific work, there are not many competent mentors. Therefore, we must firmly establish that if we have an excellent mentor, we will follow him to climb over a big mountain faster, and then move forward independently; if we don't have one, we should be prepared to bravely advance and cut through thorns at any time!

    Ideological Preparation Before Conducting Research

    The first point that should be raised is: do not underestimate easily solved problems and ignore small things. Science has today not because of a very small number of geniuses who created it in a single leap, but because of accumulation, long-term, bit-by-bit accumulation; therefore, even if it is bit-by-bit, it should not be ignored. Because the formation of rivers is due to the gathering of small things. And any successful scientific work, if analyzed, is composed of many steps. It is easy and intuitive to look from the first step to the second step; it is the same to look from the previous step to the next step. However, connecting several steps in a row becomes a difficult and in-depth work. Therefore, if anyone underestimates the small things in scientific practice, they will certainly not have major creations and inventions.

    The phenomenon of underestimating small things is quite common. I myself have had such painful lessons. When understanding departments that are easy to understand, if you are careless, you will not be able to use them easily when applying them. Of course, I am not encouraging people to stagnate in the stage of solving easily solved problems. My focus is on starting from the easy, and mainly deepening step by step, entering the core of science step by step without being sloppy.

    Only by not underestimating small things can we not be afraid of difficulties. And only by not being afraid of difficulties can we start research work. Underestimating difficulties and fearing difficulties are twins, often appearing in the same person. I have seen many young people who are ambitious but unskilled, dabble and stop, and have achieved nothing in ten years. This is due to this shortcoming. We must know that only scientists who are not afraid of difficulties and work hard can climb the peaks that others have not climbed, and only then can they obtain commendable achievements. The so-called genius is not reliable, we must realize that hard work is the only powerful guarantee for the success of scientific research. The glorious title of genius will never belong to lazy people!

    When just entering the scientific field, we must also be ideologically prepared to suffer possible setbacks and failures. After suffering setbacks and failures, don't be pessimistic and disappointed, but should make persistent efforts and move forward bravely. Which scientist has not experienced the pain of failure? Even, if summarized, every scientist cannot but have such a feeling: the failed roads he has walked are no less than the successful roads he has walked. However, scientific literature only publishes successful records, so it does not show the situation of scientists "success or failure is a common occurrence for soldiers." But we must pay attention to one point, which is to learn from failures. If we attack a difficult problem and fail, then we must figure out what exactly caused us to fail.

    You must have ambition, but more importantly, you must have a feasible plan. Don't have the idea of "making a splash" from the beginning. We must realize that outstanding work in science is important, but a large number of ordinary work is also an important part of promoting scientific progress.

    In order not to lengthen the article, I will not mention the two important links of learning from the Soviet Union and learning philosophy here. But let me briefly mention that Chairman Mao's "On Practice" is the most useful article for scientific research work. Anyone who has just engaged in scientific research work must read this article carefully, which will be beneficial not only now, but also in the future, throughout the life of scientific research.

### 我从事科学研究工作的体会

    我从事科学研究工作的体会
    华罗庚
    在写这篇文章之前，我想到很多。第一，我知道我对科学研究还是一个小学生，既少成绩，也还缺乏经验。第二，即使有一些经验，也是极片面的；因为我所熟悉的仅仅是科学中的一部分——数学中的极小部分，其中的经验对于其它部分能否应用，是大可怀疑的。且第三，我仍是一个年青的科学工作者，工作虽有一些，但就整个的一生来说，还仅仅是开始，新经验还不断地在被发现，旧办法也不断地在修正和否定；所以，很可能我今天所说的，在将来看来是极肤浅甚至于是错误的，当然更不要谈到它的完整性了。但我终于写了这篇文章，最主要的是由于我觉得：那管就是些点滴的体会，对那些比我更年青的科学工作者来说，也许还有些参考作用。
    科学研究要有坚实的基础
    什么叫做坚实的基础？会背会默，滚透烂熟，是否就算已获得坚实的基础了呢？我认为不算的，并且，我认为这不是建立坚实基础的一种最好的途径。因为真正懂得前人的成果或书本上的知识的人，不一定要会逐字逐句的背诵；甚至完全相反，会逐字逐句背诵的人不一定就是真懂的人。
    所谓“真懂”，其中当然包括搞懂书本上的逻辑推理，但更重要的还要包括以下一些内容：必须设身处地地想，在没有这定律（或定理）之前，如果我要发现这一条定律（或定理）是否可能。如果可能，那是经过怎样的实践和思维过程获得它的。不消说，在研究证明的时候，更重要的是了解其中的中心环节。因为对中心环节的了解，有时可以把这证明或这定理显示得又直觉又简单。同时，真正了解一本书或一章书的中心环节，对了解全部内容也往往是带有决定性的作用的。不但如此，它还可以帮助记忆，因为由理解而被记忆的东西比逐字逐句的记忆更深刻，更不易忘掉；而逐字逐句的记忆法，如果忘掉一字一句就有极大的可能使全局皆非。
    学完一本书（或一篇文章）之后，还必须做些解剖工作。对其中特别重要的结论，必须分析它所依赖的是本书上的那些知识。很可能一条定律是写在第二百五十页上的，但实际上所需要的仅仅是其前的散见各处的二三十页。这种分析工作做得愈透彻，在做研究工作时就运用得愈方便。在研究中可能遇到同第二百五十页相仿佛的问题，如果没有做过解剖工作的人在解决这样的问题时，就会牵涉到二百五十页的考虑，而做过解剖工作的人，他只须考虑二三十页就可以了。
    解剖固然重要，但不要忘掉解剖后的综合。换言之，中心环节之间的关系不可不注意，就是能认识到它们之间毫无关联也好。因为这样的结论可以帮助我们作一个初步结论。如果在较高阶段又发现了他们之间是有关联的，那可以帮助我们体会到我们的认识又提高了一步。这比囫囵吞其始，囫囵吞其终的好得多。读完了一本书，还有必要把这本书的内容和已往所读的联系起来，例如：在大学数学系学代数中的二次型的时候，就必须和中学里所学的几何的圆锥曲线联系起来看。在学习积分方程对称核的时候，又必须和代数的二次型联系起来看。
    也许有人说，以上所说的很多是大学教师授课时所应当注意之点。是的。大学教师应当把中心环节的指点说明提高到逐字逐句讲解之上，要把内容全面讲解清楚，而不要在枝节上兜圈子。应当把本门学科和其他相邻学科的关键讲解清楚。但最主要的还是要依靠自己，因为教师能指点的总是十分有限的，而我们可以自己了解的，及需要我们自己去了解的却是无穷无尽的。
    讲到基础，凡是作过科学研究工作或即将从事科学研究工作的人总会发问的：要多么大的基础？如果我们笼统地回答说，基础愈大愈好，是不解决问题的。因为很有可能搞了一生的基础，而基础还未打好。所以我们必须有一个具体标准，而又必须给它以充分发展的可能性。关于基础的具体标准，我认为在今天比较容易圆满答复：就是以苏联大学毕业生对他自己的专业知识要求自己（我目前不说以我国的大学毕业生的专业知识要求自己的原因，是我们的标准还没有十分固定下来）。但是切不要局限住自己，应当在专业研究的时候逐步扩大眼界，逐步扩大基础，以备在更大的基础上建立起更高的宝塔。局限自己的方法有时是不自觉的。例如：有些大学生看到了“数学通报”的问题解答栏中的问题，就认为这是中学水准的问题，因而不加顾盼。解放前有些学习几何的同学对代数就丝毫不留意，更不必说学数学的对力学不留意了。这种思想方法是会引导人进入牛角尖而不自觉的。当然重点是必不可少的，专业是不可不固定的（至少在某一阶段相当长的一个时期内不要任意转移）；但是也不要放弃任何可以扩大眼界、扩大研究领域的机会。
      独立思考能力和导师
    在从形式主义的了解中解放出来之后，独立思考能力就成为搞好研究工作的中心环节。独立思考能力是科学研究和创造发明的一项必备才能。在历史上任何一个较重要的科学上的创造和发明，都是和创造发明者的独立地深入地看问题的方法分不开的。因为唯有如此，才能超越成规，不为前人的结论所局囿，深入事物本质，独辟蹊径，作出新的结论。由于一切事物都在不断地发展着，昨天已经获得的成果，固然一方面变成了我们知识上的财富，但另一方面，也随之而俱来地带来了一些偏僻之见。如果把已往的方法一成不变地用来研究今天的事物，便并不一定能够解决问题，获得成果。在发现某些问题不能用已往的方法来解决的时候，我们就必须创造新方法，如此，便必须依赖于突破前人成规的独立思考能力。
    由于科学的本质和它在历史上发展的过程，我们可以体会到科学乃是逐步深入、乃至无限深入的。由于科学是千变万化的，因之往往每去掉一层障碍就发现一些真理。在突破这层层障碍的时候，往往要用和已往迥然不同的新的独创的方法，才能获得成功；所以科学上的不断进展，是必须依靠独创精神的。也许如此说并不是过分的：独立思考是取得正确认识的必要方法，也是科学中克服困难的不二法门。很多例子可以说明：有些大学生在学校中功课学得很好，在教师指导下也是优等学生，但一旦离开教师参加工作，就停滞不前，遇到困难便束手无策。这种现象就是由于只跟教师学得了若干知识，而并没有获得独立思考的本领之故。
    独立思考和不接受前人的成就是毫无共同之点的。如果有人认为研究工作是独创性的，只要独立深思，不需要多读书，多接受前人的经验，也不需要依靠群众，这看法也是错误的。这样的看法会把人引入前人已走过的失败的道路，因而白费精力。以数学上的“三分角”为例吧。由于无知，有些人还硬想用圆规和直尺来三分任意角，这便是精力浪费。因为三分任意角是中世纪的著名难题，但今天已经完全解决了（即已证明用圆规直尺三分任意角是不可能的）。如果我们不肯接受前人成果，仍把自己的知识停滞在中世纪的水准上，盲目地来进行这种无益的研究，当然就无怪乎要和中世纪的“三分角家”一样地浪费精力了！
    独立思考和不需要导师也是并不相容的。优良的导师有无数成功的和失败的经验，特别是后者，往往是在书本上不易找到的——因为书本上仅仅记录了成功的创作，而很少记录下在发明之前无数次失败和无数次逐步推进的艰苦思索过程。而优良的导师正如航行的领航者一样，他可以告诉你哪儿有礁石，哪儿是航道。但是有一点必须指出，不独立思考，一味依赖导师也是要不得的。因为导师也有主观或思索不到之处。另一方面，没有导师也不必自馁。照我个人的经验，由于自修的关系，我对中学、大学程度的知识都进行了研究，当然花费了不少的时间和精力，但我并不后悔，因为在今天，在我的研究工作中所以能够自如地运用任何初等数学部分，都不能不归功于我早年的关于初等数学的研究功夫。同时，每一个初走上研究道路的同志还必须看到，由于我国科学工作的幼稚，能胜任的导师是不很多的。所以，我们必须坚强地树立起：有优良导师我们跟着他较快地爬过一段大山，再独立前进；如果没有，我们便应当随时随刻地准备着披荆斩棘地奋勇前进！
    进行研究工作前的思想准备
    最先应当提出的一点：就是不要轻视容易解决的问题和忽视点滴工作。科学之所以得有今日，并不是由于极少数的天才，一步登天般地创造出来的，而是由于积累，长期的、一点一滴地积累而得来的；所以，尽管是一点一滴，也不应该忽视。因为江河之形成正是由于点滴的聚汇。且任何一个成功的科学工作，如果分析一下，都是由于不少步骤所组成的。由第一步看第二步，是容易的，较直觉的；由前一步看后一步，也莫不如此。但是，一连若干步贯穿起来，这便成为一件烦难而深入的工作了。所以如果任何人轻视在科学实践中的点滴工作，也便一定不会有较大的创造发明。
    轻视点滴工作的现象是相当普遍的，我自己也有过这样的痛苦教训。在了解容易了解的部门时，如果漫不经心，在应用时就不能得心应手。当然，我并不是鼓励人们停滞在搞容易解决的问题的阶段上。我的着眼点是从容易入手，而主要是逐步深入，一步不苟地进入科学的内核之中。
    不轻视点滴工作，才能不畏惧困难。而不畏惧困难，才能开始研究工作。轻视困难和畏惧困难是孪生兄弟，往往出现在同一个人的身上。我看见过不少青年，眼高手低，浅尝即止，忽忽十年，一无成就，这便是由于这一缺点。必须知道，只有不畏困难，辛勤劳动的科学家，才有可能攀登上旁人没有登上过的峰顶，才有可能获得值得称道的成果。所谓天才是不足恃的，必须认识，辛勤劳动才是科学研究成功的唯一的有力保证。天才的光荣称号是决不会属于懒汉的！
    在刚进入科学领域的时候，还必须在思想上准备遭受可能的挫折和失败。受了挫折和失败之后，不要悲观失望，而应当再接再厉，勇敢前进。那一个科学家没有经历过失败的苦痛呢？甚至，如果总结起来，每一个科学家都不能不有这样的感觉：他所走过的失败的道路比他所走过的成功的道路并不少些。但科学文献仅刊载了成功的记录，因而显不出科学家的“胜败乃兵家之常”的情况。但我们必须注意一点，就是从失败中取得经验教训。如果我们向一个困难问题进攻，而遭到失败，那我们必须弄清楚究竟是什么东西使我们招致失败的。
    雄心是要有的，但更重要的是步步可行的计划，不要一开始就抱着“一鸣惊人”的思想。必须认识，在科学中出类拔萃的工作固然重要，但大量的平凡的工作也是推进科学进展的重要部分。
    为了不使篇幅加长，我这儿不再涉及学习苏联及学习哲学两个重要环节了。但是我简单地提一句：毛主席的“实践论”是对科学研究工作最有用的文章。任何刚从事科学研究工作的人都必须精读此文，这不但目前，并且将来，在科学研究的一生中都会得益非浅的。
