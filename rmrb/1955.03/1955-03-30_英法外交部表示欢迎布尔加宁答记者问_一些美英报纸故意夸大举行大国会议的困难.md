    Xinhua News Agency, March 29th dispatch: TASS London, March 28th dispatch: London Radio broadcast that a British Foreign Office spokesman said on March 28th that Britain "hopes to hold great power talks, and therefore naturally welcomes Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's answers to reporters, because Bulganin expressed support for U.S. President Eisenhower's opinion: that holding four-power talks in the near future is appropriate."
    According to Xinhua News Agency: The focus of attention in the Paris morning papers on the 28th was Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's answers to questions from a TASS reporter regarding the Great Power Conference issue. All newspapers agree that this conversation has significant international importance.
    The newspapers published a statement issued by the French Foreign Ministry regarding Bulganin's answers to the TASS reporter. The statement said that whether it is Eisenhower's press conference, Bulganin's answers to the TASS reporter, or the comments of the British Foreign Office spokesman, all make it foreseeable that East-West negotiations will resume.
    According to a West German "Die Welt" correspondent in Paris, French Foreign Minister Pinay, in a conversation with this reporter, said that it is possible to convene a Great Power Conference in June of this year. Pinay, referring to Bulganin's talk, said that Western countries will immediately engage in contact to discuss this talk.
    Xinhua News Agency, March 29th dispatch: TASS New York, March 28th dispatch: Some American newspapers emphasize that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's answers to the TASS reporter have significant international importance. United Press called this reply "a declaration of major significance, demonstrating the flexibility of current Soviet policy." United Press said, "It is believed that this measure by the Soviet Union is a strong demonstration of Moscow's desire to ease international tensions."
    However, some American politicians and commentators are attempting to diminish the significance of Bulganin's talk. For example, Bridges, chairman of the U.S. Republican Party Policy Committee, on the one hand, said that "all paths to peace should be explored," but at the same time, groundlessly described Bulganin's answers to the reporter as "dishonest probing tactics."
    Xinhua News Agency, March 29th dispatch: TASS London, March 29th dispatch: British newspapers are widely discussing the possibility of convening a Great Power Conference in response to Bulganin's answers to the TASS reporter.
    It is noteworthy that individual British newspapers are strangely attempting to exaggerate the difficulties of convening a Great Power Conference and emphasizing that it is "impossible" to hold a meeting in the near future. For example, while the "Yorkshire Post" said that the Soviet attitude aroused "a glimmer of hope," it also asserted that "there will be a long period of tedious preparation and meticulous haggling in the future."
    An editorial in the American "New York Times," received in London, attempts to justify this "long period." The editorial said: "Before the East-West conference is held, in addition to Washington, Paris, and London discussing the issues of the future conference, the seven members of the Western European Union should also hold consultations. Probably, the first step is for Pinay and Adenauer to hold talks to discuss the implementation of the Saar agreement, which has been included in the Paris Accords." The "New York Times" pointed out: "In Washington, opinions are very divided on what specific issues the (East-West) conference should study and what the prospects of the conference are."

    英法外交部表示欢迎布尔加宁答记者问
    一些美英报纸故意夸大举行大国会议的困难
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十八日讯：伦敦电台广播，英国外交部发言人三月二十八日说，英国“希望举行大国会谈，因此当然也欢迎苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的答记者问，因为布尔加宁表示支持美国总统艾森豪威尔的意见：在最近举行四国会谈是适宜的”。
    据新华社讯：二十八日巴黎各晨报注意的中心是苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁就大国会议问题答塔斯社记者问。各报一致认为这次谈话具有重大的国际意义。
    各报刊载了法国外交部就布尔加宁答塔斯社记者问所发表的声明。声明说，无论就艾森豪威尔的记者招待会、布尔加宁答塔斯社记者问来说，或者是就英国外交部发言人的评论来说，都使人可以预见到东西方谈判将要恢复。
    据西德“世界报”驻巴黎记者报道，法国外交部长比内在向这个记者发表谈话时说，在今年六月召开一次大国会议是可能的。比内谈到布尔加宁谈话时说，西方国家之间将马上进行接触，来讨论这一谈话。
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：美国一些报刊着重指出，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁答塔斯社记者问具有重大的国际意义。合众社把这一答复称为“具有重大意义的宣言，它表现了目前苏联政策的灵活性”。合众社说，“人们认为，苏联的这一措施是莫斯科想要缓和国际局势的有力证明”。
    但是，有一些美国政治家和评论员却企图缩小布尔加宁谈话的意义。例如，美国共和党政策委员会主席布里奇斯一方面说“应当研究通往和平的一切道路”，但同时又毫无根据地把布尔加宁答记者问说成是“不诚实的试探手段”。
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十九日讯：英国报纸就布尔加宁答塔斯社记者问，广泛地讨论召开大国会议的可能性。
    值得注意的是，个别的英国报纸奇怪地企图夸大召开大国会议的困难，并且强调在最近的时期内
  “不可能”举行会议。例如，“约克郡邮报”一方面说苏联的态度引起了“一线希望”，但同时又断言“今后将有一个长时期的令人厌烦的筹备和斤斤计较的讨价还价”。
    伦敦收到的美国“纽约时报”的社论企图为这种“长时期”辩护。社论说：“在东西方会议举行之前，除了华盛顿、巴黎和伦敦就未来的会议的问题进行商谈以外，西欧联盟七个成员国之间也应当举行商谈。大概，第一个步骤是比内和阿登纳举行会谈，商讨已列入巴黎协定的萨尔协定的实施的问题。”“纽约时报”指出：“在华盛顿，对于（东西方）会议应该研究那些具体问题以及会议的前途如何，各方面的意见很不一致。”
