Hunan Plans to Plant Six Million Mu of Double-Season Rice

Hunan Province plans to plant over 6.1 million mu of double-season rice this year. Large quantities of rice seeds and pesticides are being transported to areas expanding double-season rice cultivation. Many places have held short-term technical training classes and organized technical seminars to provide technical guidance for planting double-season rice.

The broad masses of peasants have a very high level of enthusiasm for planting double-season rice. When formulating production plans, agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in Daotian Township, Fourth District of Pingjiang County, believed that planting double-season rice was the main way to increase production and decided to expand the planting of double-season rice by 800 mu in the entire township. According to local water sources, sunlight, soil quality, and fertilizer conditions, the Zhu Lake Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jubao Township, Changde County, decided to plant 270 mu of double-season rice, a tenfold increase compared to last year. In the hilly area of Lianyuan County, more than 260 mu of double-season rice were experimentally planted last year, with an average yield of over 700 jin of rice per mu, changing the peasants' view that double-season rice could not be planted in mountainous areas. The county plans to expand the planting of double-season rice by 5,000 mu this year.

Peasants in various places are now stepping up preparations for planting double-season rice. The Baifutang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the First District of Wangcheng County has accumulated a large amount of fertilizer and repaired a large pond that had not been repaired for decades. This pond can irrigate more than 240 mu of land and can be used for drought resistance for twenty days. Lianyuan County has sent people to Xiangtan, Hengnan, Liling and other places to purchase more than 50,000 jin of rice seeds.

    湖南计划种六百万亩双季稻
    湖南省计划在今年种植双季稻六百一十多万亩。大批稻种和杀虫药械正源源运往扩种双季稻地区。许多地方举办了短期技术训练班，组织了技术座谈会，进行种植双季稻的技术指导工作。
    广大农民种植双季稻的积极性很高。平江县第四区稻田乡的农业生产合作社和互助组在制定生产计划时，认为种双季稻是增产的主要办法，决定在全乡扩种双季稻八百亩。常德县聚宝乡朱湖农业生产合作社根据当地的水路、阳光、土质、肥料等情况，决定种双季稻二百七十亩，比去年扩大十倍。丘陵地区的涟源县，去年试种双季稻二百六十多亩，一般每亩收稻谷七百多斤，改变了农民们认为山地不能种植双季稻的看法，全县今年计划扩种双季稻五千亩。
    各地农民现在正加紧进行种植双季稻的准备工作。望城县第一区白芙塘农业生产合作社已经增积了大批肥料，并修好了一口几十年没有修过的大塘。这口塘能灌溉二百四十多亩田，可供在二十天时间内抗旱使用。涟源县已经派人到湘潭、衡南、醴陵等地采办了五万多斤稻种。
