	The Prosperous Season of Niu Shan Fishing Ground
	Rong Tianyao
	Looking east across the sea from Pingtan Island in Fujian Province, you can see a small mountain called Niu Shan, which fishermen also call "Treasure Mountain." The ocean surrounding the mountain for over a hundred li is a good fishing ground rich in fish products all year round. This is the famous "Niu Shan Fishing Ground" in Fujian Province. Tens of thousands of fishermen from Pingtan Island, Lianjiang, and Changle catch fish in this fishing ground.
	During February and March, large schools of ribbonfish migrate from north to south to the Niu Shan Fishing Ground, and tens of thousands of fishermen begin fishing intensely. Before dawn, while the sky is still filled with twinkling stars, the beach becomes a hub of activity. Fishermen carry fishing nets and gear, raise anchors, and prepare sails. Countless boats shoot out of the harbor like arrows.
	As the sun rises, countless fishing boats return to the ocean in search of fish schools. When a boat discovers a school of fish, the crew immediately shouts out, and many fishing boats quickly surround it, casting their nets continuously. Soon, silver-white ribbonfish fill basket after basket.
	In the evening, fishing boats laden with fish return to the port one after another. At this time, the beach becomes lively again. Women, children, the elderly, and procurement staff from aquatic product companies and cooperatives cheer and welcome the fishermen returning from a successful harvest.
	This year, fishermen on Pingtan Island have enjoyed a harvest unprecedented in decades. In the half-month from February 23rd to March 8th, they caught a total of more than 110,000 dan of ribbonfish. Aquatic product companies and cooperatives have tried various methods to increase the capacity of existing processing equipment. The state-owned aquatic product company, which originally could only accommodate 11,000 dan of processing equipment, can now cure more than 18,000 dan of ribbonfish. Under the leadership of the state-owned aquatic product company and cooperatives, fish prices have remained stable during this season of unprecedented fish harvests, and the days when fishermen feared "disaster from abundance" are gone forever.

    牛山渔场的繁荣季节
    容天耀
    在福建省平潭岛东面隔海相望，可以看到一座小山，这座山叫牛山，渔民又称呼它做“宝山”。山的四周方圆百多里的海洋是一年四季鱼产丰富的好渔场，这就是福建省著名的“牛山渔场”。平潭岛和连江、长乐一带成千上万的渔民就在这个渔场上捕鱼。
    二、三月间，大群大群的带鱼由北而南地洄游到牛山渔场，上万个渔民就紧张地开始捕鱼了。天还未亮，满天的星星还在海空闪烁，海滩上便沸腾起来了。渔民抬来渔网渔具，拉起了船锚，整理好船帆，无数条船箭一样地驶出了港口。
    朝阳升起来了，数不尽的渔船回驶在海洋上追寻鱼群，当一条船发现了鱼群，船上立即发出一片招呼声，霎时许多渔船都围过来了，对对渔船接连不断地撒下渔网。一会，银白色带鱼便倒满一筐又一筐。
    傍晚，满载着鱼儿的渔船陆续回港，这时海滩上又热闹起来了，妇女、孩子、老人、水产公司和合作社的收购工作人员，熙熙攘攘的人群欢呼着迎接丰收归来的渔民。
    今年，平潭岛渔民获得了数十年来未有过的丰收，从二月二十三日到三月八日的半个月中，共捕获带鱼十一万多担。水产公司和合作社想各种办法增加了原有加工设备的容纳量，国营水产公司原来只能容纳一万一千担的加工设备，现在已经能腌制一万八千多担带鱼。在国营水产公司和合作社领导下，在鱼产空前丰收的季节中，鱼价仍旧保持平稳，渔民担心的“丰收成灾”的日子已经一去不复返了。
