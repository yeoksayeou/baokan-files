    Do a Good Job in Technical Instruction and Repair Preparation for New Farm Tools
    You Qun
    In the 1955 spring plowing, many areas will use new animal-powered farm tools. Double-wheel double-share plows and double-wheel single-share plows are to be promoted to more than 900 counties; many of these places will be using them for the first time this year. New animal-powered farm tools have many parts and a more complex structure than old farm tools, requiring certain skills to master. Therefore, the quality of technical instruction and repair work plays a decisive role in the promotion of new animal-powered farm tools. If new animal-powered farm tools are used well, agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams will be able to increase production and lay a good foundation for more extensive promotion in the future; if they are not used well, it will have a very bad impact. This is because old-fashioned small farm tools only affect individual farmers, while new farm tools affect entire cooperatives or mutual aid teams.
    The spring plowing season is fast approaching. Some provinces have trained very few farmers in the use of farm tools, with an average of less than one farm tool operator per double-wheel double-share plow and double-wheel single-share plow. Many places did not conduct field tests when training farm tool operators; and many of them are young people who have no experience in farming. These areas should continue to do a good job in training farm tool operators, and conduct technical inspections and make-up lessons for farm tool operators who were trained in the winter of 1954. Heilongjiang Province plans to have cadres from the technical extension stations in the districts go to various places to inspect and help farm tool operators, and requires district cadres and village chiefs, Party and Communist Youth League branch secretaries to also learn the usage techniques and provide guidance and assistance to farm tool operators at any time, so that the technology takes root among the masses. Shanxi Province plans to train a farm tool technician for every twenty double-wheel double-share plows promoted, relying on an agricultural cooperative to help farmers and farm tool operators technically. These practices are all good. All localities should, based on their specific circumstances, conduct practical organizational work for technical guidance to continuously improve the skills of farm tool operators and ensure the quality of cultivation.
    Making good preparations for repairing new animal-powered farm tools is also very important. Liaoning Province plans to establish six machinery factories in six larger cities to be responsible for repairing parts; counties will set up repair factories; districts will organize small furnaces through handicraft production cooperatives to be responsible for minor repairs. Henan Province has adopted the following methods: before plowing, the agricultural departments and supply and marketing cooperatives organize roving inspection teams to conduct general surveys in concentrated areas, teaching usage techniques on the one hand, and carrying out repairs on the other. In addition, fixed repair stations are established, with blacksmith shops, bicycle shops, and ironware production cooperatives as the base, and the supply and marketing cooperatives supply parts to repair new farm tools for the nearby masses. These methods can be used as a reference for all localities. In order to make good repair preparations, the supply and marketing departments should supply parts in a timely manner to avoid difficulties in repair work and affect the progress of spring plowing.
    Some local leading organs and cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the significant role of promoting new animal-powered farm tools in promoting mutual assistance and cooperation, improving cultivation techniques, and increasing agricultural production. Although the planned promotion quantity in these areas is not small, they have few or no cadres specifically in charge of farm tools, have not carried out publicity and education for farmers well, and the training work for farmer farm tool operators is also very poor. Some local leading organs and cadres, although aware of the significance of promoting new animal-powered farm tools and demanding a large promotion quantity, underestimate this work too easily and therefore have not seriously done a good job in technical instruction and repair preparation. These areas should strengthen their leadership over this work, widely teach the techniques of using new animal-powered farm tools, do a good job in typical demonstrations, train farmer farm tool operators and prepare for repairs, prevent the reoccurrence of laissez-faire and coercive command, so that new animal-powered farm tools can truly be welcomed by the masses and achieve the goal of promoting mutual assistance and cooperation and increasing production.

    作好新式农具技术传授和修配准备工作
    友群
    一九五五年春耕中，许多地区都要使用新式畜力农具。双轮双铧犁和双轮一铧犁要推广到九百多个县；其中有许多地方，今年还是第一次试用。新式畜力农具部件多，构造比旧农具复杂，需要有一定的技术才能掌握。因此，技术传授和修配工作的好坏，对于新式畜力农具的推广就有决定性的作用。新式畜力农具使用得好，农业生产合作社或互助组就能够增加生产，并给今后更大量的推广打好基础；如果使用得不好，就要发生很坏的影响。因为旧式的小农具只能影响一人一户的个体农民，而新式农具却要影响整个合作社或互助组。
    春耕季节很快就要到来了，有些省的农民农具手训练得很少，每部双轮双铧犁和双轮一铧犁平均不到一个农具手。许多地方训练农具手时没有经过实地试验；而且其中有许多是过去没有耕地经验的青年。这些地区要继续作好农具手的训练工作，并对一九五四年冬季已经训练过的农具手进行技术检查和补课工作。黑龙江省准备由区的技术推广站的干部到各地巡回检查和帮助农具手，并要求区干部和各村村长，党、团支部书记也学会使用技术，对农具手随时指导帮助，使技术在群众中扎根。山西省计划每推广二十部双轮双铧犁，就训练一个农具技术员，依托一个农业合作社，在技术上帮助农民农具手。这些作法都是好的。各地应该根据具体情况，进行切实的技术指导的组织工作，使农具手的技术不断提高，保证耕作的质量。
    作好修配新式畜力农具的准备工作也是十分重要的。辽宁省计划在六个较大城市设立六个机械厂，负责修配部件；县设修配厂；区由手工业生产合作社组织小烘炉，负责小的修配。河南省采取了以下的办法：在犁地前，农业部门和供销合作社组织巡回检查小组，分区集中进行普查，一面传授使用技术，一面进行修配。另外还建立固定的修配站，以铁木匠铺、自行车铺、铁业生产合作社为基点，由供销社供应零件，给附近群众修配新式农具。这些办法都可供各地参考。为了作好修配准备工作，供销部门应该及时供应零件，以免修配工作发生困难，影响春耕的进行。
    有些地方的领导机关和干部，对推广新式畜力农具能够促进互助合作，改进耕作技术，增加农业生产的重大作用认识不足。这些地区计划推广的数量虽然不小，却没有或很少配备专管农具的干部，对农民的宣传教育没有很好地进行，对农民农具手的训练工作作得也很差。有些地方的领导机关和干部，虽然认识到推广新式畜力农具的意义，要求推广的数量也很大，但却把这项工作估计得太容易了，因此，也没有认真作好技术传授和修配准备工作。这些地区都应加强对这一工作的领导，广泛传授使用新式畜力农具的技术，作好典型示范、培养农民农具手和修配准备工作，防止放任自流和强迫命令的现象再度发生，使新式畜力农具真正能为群众所欢迎，达到促进互助合作、增加生产的目的。
