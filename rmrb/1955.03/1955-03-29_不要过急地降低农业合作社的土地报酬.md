Under the conditions of greatly increased production in agricultural production cooperatives, the continuous improvement of members' awareness, and the general increase in income, it is correct and necessary to appropriately increase labor remuneration and reduce land remuneration. However, under normal circumstances, once the ratio of labor to land distribution in the cooperative has been reasonably determined, it should not be changed arbitrarily within a certain period. Disregarding specific conditions and prematurely and hastily reducing land remuneration will hinder the healthy development of the agricultural collectivization movement.

According to a report from the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province: The Nonglinmu (Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry) Production Cooperative in Xigou Township, Pingshun County, achieved a bumper harvest in 1954, with an average grain yield of 346 jin per mu of autumn fields, an increase of 54 jin per mu compared to 1953. This cooperative expanded to 203 households in the spring of 1954. During the year-end distribution, some cooperative cadres were eager to transition to advanced agricultural production cooperatives with a completely socialist nature, and prematurely lowered land remuneration, causing the land dividend ratio to drop sharply. As a result, the income of 57 households was lower than in 1953 (some of these households also experienced income reductions due to other reasons). The distribution ratio was as follows: after deducting various investments, labor dividends accounted for 65 percent, an increase of 8 percent compared to 1953; land dividends accounted for 27 percent, a decrease of 13 percent compared to 1953; and public accumulation fund and public welfare fund accounted for 8 percent, an increase of 5 percent compared to 1953. This distribution ratio meant that land dividends were reduced too drastically for old members; for members who joined in the spring of 1954, land dividends were too low. As a result of this distribution, the income of 132 households exceeded that of 1953, accounting for 65 percent of the total number of cooperative members; the income of 14 households was equal to that of 1953, accounting for 6.8 percent; and the income of 57 households was lower than that of 1953, accounting for 28 percent. The cooperative's production increased, but the income of dozens of households decreased. As a result, some members expressed dissatisfaction, and the goodwill of the masses outside the cooperative was also diluted.

The Pingshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this problem and conducted education on the distribution policy through the branch, criticizing the impetuous mood of certain cooperative cadres who disregarded the increase or decrease in the income of each member household and blindly and hastily reduced land remuneration, as well as the erroneous thinking of fearing trouble and being unwilling to correct mistakes. This enabled everyone to correctly understand the distribution principle of striving to ensure increased income for every household and the necessary conditions for transitioning to a completely socialist system. After discussion by the members, a new distribution ratio was formulated. The newly determined distribution ratio was: labor dividends accounted for 60 percent; land dividends accounted for 32 percent; and public accumulation fund and public welfare fund remained at 8 percent. After this correction, the distribution settlement was carried out, and the income of 146 households exceeded that of 1953, an increase of 14 households compared to before the correction; the income of 25 households was equal to that of 1953, an increase of 11 households compared to before the correction; and the income of 32 households was lower than that of 1953, and the difference between the actual income of these households and the past was also smaller. These 32 households whose income was lower than that of 1953 generally had special reasons. Some had daughters getting married and spent time on family affairs, resulting in fewer workdays; some had reduced or lost labor power; some had replaced livestock with smaller or fewer animals, or had less investment than in the past; some were cadres and spent fewer workdays; and some had other income outside the cooperative. These households understood the distribution policy and the specific reasons for their lower share and had no objections. After the redistribution, both new and old members were satisfied.

The problems that occurred in the distribution of Xigou Township Cooperative and the process of correction are a very beneficial education for those comrades who are very enthusiastic and subjectively demand to accelerate the transition to advanced cooperatives. Even an old cooperative like Xigou Township, which is relatively good and has a larger increase in production, cannot reduce the proportion of land dividends too quickly, and ordinary cooperatives should be even more cautious.

    不要过急地降低农业合作社的土地报酬
    仲夏
    在农业生产合作社里的生产大大增长、社员觉悟不断提高和收入普遍增加的条件下，适当提高劳动报酬和降低土地报酬，是正确的，必要的。但是，在一般的情况下，社里的劳力、土地分配比率既经合理规定，在一定时期以内就不要随便变动；如果不顾具体条件，过早过急地降低土地报酬，就会妨碍农业合作化运动的健康发展。
    据中共山西省长治地委通报：平顺县西沟乡农林牧生产合作社，一九五四年得到了丰收，每亩秋田平均产粮三百四十六斤，比一九五三年每亩增产五十四斤。这个社在一九五四年春扩大到了二百零三户。在年终分配时，一部分社干部急于向完全社会主义性质的高级的农业生产合作社过渡，过早地压低土地报酬，使土地分益比例突然降低。结果，有五十七户社员收入低于一九五三年（其中有些户的收入降低还有其他原因）。分配的比例是这样的：除去各项投资以外，劳动分益是百分之六十五，较一九五三年提高百分之八；土地分益是百分之二十七，较一九五三年降低百分之十三；公积金公益金为百分之八，较一九五三年提高百分之五。这个分配比例，对于老社员来说，是土地分益降低得太猛；对于一九五四年春季入社的社员说，是土地分益太少。这样分的结果，社员收入超过一九五三年的有一百三十二户，占社员总户数的百分之六十五，收入和一九五三年相等的有十四户，占百分之六点八；收入低于一九五三年的有五十七户，占百分之二十八。合作社增产了，几十户社员却减收了。因此，部分社员表示不满；社外群众对合作社的好感也被冲淡了。
    中共平顺县委发现了这个问题，就通过支部进行了分配政策的教育，批判了某些社干部不顾各户社员收入增减情况、盲目地过急地降低土地报酬的急躁情绪和怕麻烦不愿纠正的错误思想，使大家正确认识了争取保证户户增加收入的分配原则和转变为完全社会主义制度所必备的条件。经过社员讨论，重新拟定了分配比例。重新确定的分配比例是：劳动分益占百分之六十；土地分益占百分之三十二；公积金公益金仍为百分之八。经过这样纠正，进行了分配决算，收入超过一九五三年的有一百四十六户，比未纠正前增加了十四户；和一九五三年相等的二十五户，比纠正前增加了十一户；低于一九五三年的三十二户，这些户实收入比过去低的差额也小了些。这三十二户收入不及一九五三年的，大都有特殊原因。有的是嫁女儿、办家务事少做了劳动日的；有的是减少或失去劳动力的；有的是牲口换小了、少了，或者投资比过去少了的；有的是当干部少做了劳动日的；有的是在社外另有其他收入的。这些户了解了分配政策和他们自己少分的具体原因，也没什么意见。重新分配以后，新老社员都满意了。
    西沟乡社分配中发生的问题和纠正的经过，对于那些热情很高主观要求加速过渡到高级社的同志，是一种很有益的教育。西沟乡社这样比较好的、增产较多的老社还不能把土地分益比例降低得太快，一般的合作社就更要慎重了。
