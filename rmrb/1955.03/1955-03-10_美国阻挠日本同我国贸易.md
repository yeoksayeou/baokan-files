Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 9th: U.S. Embassy Economic Counselor Frank Waring openly threatened Japan on the 7th, saying that Japan's plan to expand trade with China might affect Japan's exports to the United States. He said: "The United States has certain laws and regulations regarding 'trade with China.' These laws affect imports and exports." According to International News Service, the laws Waring referred to are the U.S. Foreign Debt Control Regulations. This regulation prohibits the export to the United States of any goods made with raw materials produced in China. Therefore, Japanese products made with Chinese raw materials will not be allowed to be exported to the United States.

While openly preventing Japan from trading with China in this way, Waring also attempted to deny that the United States had tried to prevent Japan from trading with China. However, Kyodo News reported on the 7th that Japanese government authorities stated on the 6th that "at a gathering more than a month ago, a responsible official from the U.S. Embassy in Japan informally expressed the opinion that if Japanese trading companies traded too much with Communist China and North Korea, they should be aware that the United States also has the Foreign Debt Control Regulations and the McCarran Act." Kyodo News also said: "This kind of situation has occurred several times in the past." International News Service also said on the 7th that officials from the U.S. Embassy had "advised" Japanese businessmen to abide by U.S. laws regarding trade with China.

    美国阻挠日本同我国贸易
   【新华社九日讯】东京消息：美国驻日本大使馆经济参赞弗兰克·华林在七日公开向日本威胁说，日本扩大对中国的贸易计划，可能影响日本对美国的输出。他说：美国有某些关于同中国“进行贸易的法律和条例。这些法律影响入口和出口。”据国际新闻社说，华林所指的法律是美国的外债管制条例。这个条例禁止把用中国出产的原料所制成的任何物品输往美国。因此，用中国原料制成的日本产品将不准输往美国。
    华林在这样公开阻止日本同中国贸易的同时，却还企图否认美国曾设法阻止日本同中国进行贸易。但是，共同社七日报道，日本政府当局在六日表明，“在一个多月以前的某次集会上，美国驻日大使馆的一位负责官员曾经非正式地表示过这样的意见：日本的贸易公司对共产党中国和北朝鲜进行贸易如太过火，希望留神美国还有外债管制条例和麦卡伦法。”共同社还说：“这类情况在过去曾经有过好几次。”国际新闻社在七日也说：美国驻日大使馆的官员们曾“劝告”日本商人遵照美国关于同中国进行贸易的法律。
