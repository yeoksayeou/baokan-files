Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 14th – The World Peace Council Standing Committee meeting concluded on the 13th, and a press conference was held on the 14th, according to TASS.

At the press conference, Mrs. Isabelle Blume, Secretary of the World Peace Council, stated that the World Peace Council Standing Committee discussed the issue of launching a worldwide movement against the preparation for atomic war and the issue of holding a World Peace Congress in Helsinki.

Mr. Artur Lundkvist, Vice-President of the World Peace Council, emphasized in his speech that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council's resolution on the use of atomic weapons, the plan for the remilitarization of West Germany, Britain's manufacture of atomic weapons, and the United States' aggressive actions in the Far East, all greatly increased the danger of atomic war. Therefore, the task of the World Peace Council is to mobilize the people of all countries to struggle against the increasing threat of atomic war.

Subsequently, two resolutions passed at the Standing Committee meeting were read out:

In Support of Convening a World Peace Congress

The overt threat of atomic war now looms over every nation, every family, and every man, woman, and child. Instead of using atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, terrible weapons are being stockpiled; instead of reducing armaments, new military blocs are being pieced together; instead of holding negotiations and reaching agreements, threats are being made and hateful propaganda is being carried out.

However, threats and force are the road to war, not the road to peace. The rearmament of West Germany, the situation in Taiwan, and interference in the independence of other nations are all exacerbating contradictions and unease. If humanity continues in this way, there will be no safety anywhere.

Humanity cannot allow the situation to develop like this. The conscience of mankind is disgusted at the thought of atomic carnage.

The people of all countries should use all the strength they must exert when their lives are in danger to demand the destruction of nuclear weapons, universal disarmament, security for everyone, and respect for the sovereignty and rights of every nation.

In this spirit, and for these purposes, the World Peace Council invites peace advocates from all countries to come to Helsinki on May 22, 1955, to participate in the World Congress and freely discuss urgent actions to safeguard peace.

Statement of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council

The World Peace Council, advocating the destruction of atomic weapons and the cessation of their manufacture, in its appeal to the people of the world, has awakened the conscience of all those in every country who abhor the prospect of a destructive war.

This appeal to the people of the world meets the hopes of those who believe that the people of all nations can prevent atomic slaughter.

We welcome the many organizations and prominent figures, and all people, who oppose the preparation for atomic war in various ways.

The danger of atomic war has become even more concrete. Some politicians are recklessly clamoring for the use of nuclear weapons. The governments of some countries that do not yet have such weapons have decided to manufacture them or are considering the issue of manufacturing them. Some people are attempting to justify the use of these terrible weapons, or are attempting to portray the existence of these weapons as a guarantee of peace; however, in reality, these weapons increase the danger of aggression and will only bring death and destruction to the people.

The signature collection campaign fully expresses the world's aversion to atomic weapons, in order to urge the governments of countries that possess these weapons to agree to destroy them under strict supervision. Such an agreement would be an important step towards universal disarmament.

The people of all countries are capable of making a loud call, so that no government dares to ignore their opposition.

### 世界和平理事会常委会会议通过决议  号召反对原子战争威胁

    世界和平理事会常委会会议通过决议
    号召反对原子战争威胁
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十四日讯：世界和平理事会常务委员会会议已在十三日结束，十四日举行了记者招待会。
    世界和平理事会书记伊莎贝丽·布伦姆夫人在记者招待会上说，世界和平理事会常务委员会讨论了展开反对准备原子战争的全世界运动问题和在赫尔辛基举行世界和平大会问题。
    世界和平理事会副主席阿图尔·伦德奎斯特在他的讲话中着重指出，北大西洋集团理事会关于使用原子武器的决议、西德重新军国主义化的计划、英国制造原子武器和美国在远东的侵略行动，这一切都大大地加剧了原子战争的危险性。因而，世界和平理事会的任务就是动员世界各国人民为反对日益加剧的原子战争威胁而斗争。
    随后宣读了在常务委员会会议上通过的两项决议：
    拥护召开世界和平大会
    原子战争的公开威胁现在笼罩在每一个国家、每一个家庭和每一个男人、女人、孩子的头上。不但没有使原子能为人类服务，反而储存可怕的武器；不但没有裁减军备，反而拼凑新的军事集团；不但没有举行谈判和达成协议，反而进行威胁和进行仇恨的宣传。
    但是，威胁和武力是导向战争的道路，而不是导向和平的道路。西德的重新武装，台湾的局势，对别国人民的独立的干涉，这一切都加甚了矛盾和不安。如果人类这样继续下去，哪里也都不会有安全。
    人类不能允许局势这样发展。人类的良心一想到原子大屠杀就感到憎恶。
    各国人民应该用他们在性命遭到危险时所必须发挥的一切力量来要求销毁核子武器、普遍裁减军备、使人人得到安全、尊重每个国家的主权和权利。
    世界和平理事会根据这种精神，为了这些目的，邀请各国拥护和平人士在一九五五年五月二十二日来赫尔辛基参加世界大会，自由地讨论维护和平的迫切行动问题。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会声明
    主张销毁原子武器和停止制造原子武器的世界和平理事会告全世界人民书，在世界上的每一个国家里都唤醒了一切憎恶毁灭性战争的前景的人们的良心。
    这一告全世界人民书符合那些相信各国人民能够防止原子大屠杀的人们的希望。
    我们欢迎许多组织和著名人士，欢迎所有的人们以各种方式反对准备原子战争。
    原子战争的危险已经更加具体了。有些政治家恣意扬言要使用核子武器。有些还没有这种武器的国家的政府已经决定要制造这种武器或者正在考虑制造这种武器的问题。有人企图为使用这种可怕的武器进行辩解，或者企图把这种武器的存在说成是和平的保证，然而事实上，这种武器增加了侵略的危险，并且只会给人们带来死亡和毁坏。
    征集签名的运动使全世界憎恶原子武器的情绪得到充分的表达，来促使拥有这种武器的各国政府同意在严格的监督下销毁这种武器。这种协议将是走向普遍裁减军备的一个重要步骤。
    各国人民是能够发出响亮的呼声，使得没有一个国家的政府敢于无视他们的反对的。
