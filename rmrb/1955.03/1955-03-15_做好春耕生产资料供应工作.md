Doing a Good Job in Supplying Spring Ploughing Production Materials

　　To adapt to the new needs of this year's agricultural production, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the country have already made the necessary preparations for the supply of agricultural production materials for the spring season. The total value of production materials that supply and marketing cooperatives plan to supply to farmers this year has increased by more than 33 percent compared to 1954. Among them, the supply of commercial fertilizers has increased by more than 2.4 million tons; various new and improved agricultural tools have increased by 1.8 times; draught animals have increased by 74 percent; improved seeds have more than doubled; and the supply of pesticides, agricultural machinery, timber, feed, and old agricultural tools has also increased. If these production materials can be supplied to farmers in a timely and reasonable manner, it will be very helpful to support spring ploughing production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

　　In order to do a good job in supplying agricultural production materials, leading cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must fully recognize the new situation and characteristics of rural areas this year. First, due to the implementation of unified purchase of grain, oil, and cotton, farmers have more currency in their hands than before, and their purchasing power has further increased. In the past, many farmers could only purchase production materials sporadically and in small quantities. Now, they can purchase them in large quantities and more centrally during the spring ploughing season. Second, the number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased by about 500,000 this year. The requirements of agricultural production cooperatives for production materials are very different from those of individual farmers, both in terms of variety and quantity. Agricultural production cooperatives require soil improvement, the development of paddy fields, increased application of fertilizers, and the use of new agricultural tools. These are things that individual farmers dare not imagine and cannot do. According to a typical survey in Shandong Province, the number of waterwheels purchased by organized farmers accounted for 63 percent of the supply of supply and marketing cooperatives, and the purchase of large agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows accounted for more than 80 percent of the total supply. Supply and marketing cooperatives should try their best to meet the needs of farmers, especially the needs of agricultural production cooperatives. That is to say, under this new situation, supply and marketing cooperatives must be fully prepared, make early arrangements, and strive to supply production materials to farmers at the right time. For individual farmers, it is of course not good if the supply of production materials is delayed, which affects agricultural production. For agricultural production cooperatives, if the supply of production materials is delayed, it will not only affect agricultural production, but also affect the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should conduct a thorough inspection of the existing preparatory work, and transfer the existing commodities to rural grass-roots units in a timely manner, so as to prevent and overcome the phenomenon of stockpiling at the top and underselling at the bottom, and stockpiling here and underselling there.

　　This year, supply and marketing cooperatives should first do a good job in supplying fertilizers. As everyone knows, the supply of commercial fertilizers in our country will still fall short of demand for a considerable period of time. Therefore, we must adopt a focused and planned approach to supply fertilizers to economic crop areas such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco, as well as major wheat and rice producing areas, especially cotton producing areas, and give priority to agricultural production cooperatives in these areas. In order to realize this principle, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels must break through the thinking of cadres, criticize departmentalism and the phenomenon of equal distribution; promote the application of fertilizers in some areas where fertilizers must be supplied but farmers do not yet have the habit of applying them; and persuade farmers in areas where chemical fertilizers have been universally applied regardless of crop variety to use them on major crops.

　　An effective way to change the situation of fertilizer supply falling short of demand is to tap local potential and expand local fertilizer sources. There are many local fertilizer sources, whether in urban or rural areas, whether in the south or the north, everywhere. According to a survey by supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions of all cities with a population of over 50,000, about 13 million tons of human and animal manure can be produced annually; vigorously transporting these fertilizers to rural areas can solve a big problem. According to the experience of some areas, it is very necessary to establish some business organizations of the nature of warehouses to be responsible for contacting urban public health departments and cooperatives, and to be responsible for managing this work.

　　The supply and transfer of new agricultural tools and livestock should also be done well. Before promoting new agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-share plows, publicity work must be done well, and on-the-spot experiments should be carried out as much as possible to impart technology to farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives should also be responsible for supplying various parts for new agricultural tools and helping farmers solve the difficulties of repairing and fitting agricultural tools. According to surveys since last winter, the phenomenon of livestock reduction in some areas is very serious, which has caused many difficulties for spring ploughing production. At present, party committees and governments in various regions are actively carrying out livestock protection work. Supply and marketing cooperatives should cooperate with grain departments to actively organize the supply of feed, and according to the principle of "feed first, fertilizer second," quickly supply the oil cake that can be transferred to farmers. In terms of draught animal transfer, supply and marketing cooperatives can organize farmers to conduct exchanges locally, can organize livestock dealers to conduct necessary long-distance transportation, and can also plan to directly transport a portion of draught animals to make up for the lack of local exchanges. Supply and marketing cooperatives should participate in the leadership and management of livestock markets, control livestock prices, eliminate bad habits and malpractices in livestock transactions, and assist the government in prohibiting the indiscriminate slaughter of draught animals.

　　Under the current conditions, supply and marketing cooperatives must not ignore the supply of small agricultural tools. Small agricultural tools are, after all, still the most used agricultural tools by farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should pay attention to investigating and studying farmers' opinions on improving small agricultural tools, and according to the policy of "local materials, local processing, and local supply," adopt the method of processing orders from handicraftsmen, supplying them with the raw materials they need, purchasing their products, guiding them to improve product specifications, and improving product quality.

　　In order to assist farmers in doing a good job in spring ploughing production, supply and marketing cooperatives must also improve the supply of living materials; they must never neglect the management of living materials because they emphasize the management of production materials. Since the implementation of unified purchase and sales of grain, cotton cloth, and oil, some supply and marketing cooperatives have not worked hard to improve business management and rationally organize sales and supply in accordance with the new market situation. On the contrary, they have been conservative and reluctant to sell certain unified sales materials, so that what should have been supplied has not been supplied, or has not been supplied in appropriate quantities, causing dissatisfaction among farmers. This situation must be changed quickly, otherwise it will damage farmers' enthusiasm for production and have an adverse impact on this year's agricultural production, especially the increase in production of crops such as grain, cotton, and oil. Cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives must continue to overcome the idea of ​​being conservative and reluctant to sell, and try to meet the needs of farmers in terms of variety and quantity within the scope of the national plan.

　　Doing a good job in cotton pre-purchase work is of utmost importance for increasing cotton production. Cooperatives at all levels must find ways to replenish the supply of production materials and other materials needed for pre-purchase work.

　　Doing a good job in supplying rural production materials is by no means just the task of supply and marketing cooperatives, but the common task of state-owned commerce, local industry, and agricultural departments. However, supply and marketing cooperatives should bear the direct and main responsibility. Of course, relying solely on the strength of supply and marketing cooperatives cannot completely do these tasks well and fully meet these requirements of farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives should implement the policy of transforming rural private merchants, organizing and leading the entire market to serve spring ploughing production and the needs of farmers. The primary measure to achieve this goal is to immediately wholesale a certain amount of commodities to private merchants and peddlers to promote their business that is conducive to spring ploughing production and national needs.

　　In order to strengthen the supply of production materials, party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over supply and marketing cooperatives and urge supply and marketing cooperatives to play their due role. The supply and marketing cooperative system must earnestly strengthen political education, improve the thinking of cadres, improve business style, supply spring agricultural production materials to farmers in a timely manner, and make active efforts to vigorously support agricultural production.

### 做好春耕生产资料供应工作

    做好春耕生产资料供应工作
    适应今年农业生产的新的需要，全国各地的供销合作社对于春季农业生产资料的供应，早已作了必要的准备。供销合作社系统准备供应农民的生产资料的总值，今年比一九五四年增加了百分之三十三以上。其中商品肥料增加了二百四十多万吨；各种新式农具和改良农具增加了一点八倍；耕畜增加了百分之七十四；优良种籽增加了一倍多；农药、农械、木材、饲料、旧式农具的供应量也都增加了。这些生产资料如果能够及时地合理地供应到农民手中，对于支持春耕生产和互助合作运动是很有作用的。
    为了做好农业生产资料供应工作，各地供销合作社的领导干部必须充分认识今年农村新的情况和特点。第一、由于实行了粮食、油料、棉花的统购，农民手中的货币比以前增多了，购买力更加提高了。许多农民过去只能分散地零星地购买生产资料，现在能够比较集中地在春耕期间大批购置了。第二、今年农业生产合作社增加了约五十万个，农业生产合作社对生产资料的要求，无论在品种和数量方面，都和个体农民大不相同。农业生产合作社要求改良土壤，开发水田，增施肥料，使用新式农具，这是个体农民所不敢设想和不能办到的。根据山东省典型调查，组织起来的农民购买水车的数量占供销合作社供应数量的百分之六十三，购买的双轮双铧犁等大型农具占总供应数的百分之八十以上。供销合作社应该尽量满足农民的要求，特别要满足农业生产合作社的要求。这就是说，在这种新的情况之下，供销合作社必须充分准备，早作安排，争取适合时机地把生产资料供应到农民手中。对于个体农民来说，生产资料供应迟了，影响农业增产，当然是不好的。对于农业生产合作社来说，生产资料供应迟了，就不仅影响农业增产，而且影响农业生产合作社的发展和巩固。因此，各地供销合作社应该把已有的准备工作做一次深入的检查，及时地把已有的商品调拨到农村基层单位，防止和克服上面积压下面脱销、这里积压那里脱销的现象。
    今年供销合作社首先应该作好肥料供应工作。大家都知道，我国的商品肥料在一个相当长的时期还是会供不应求的。因此，必须采取有重点有计划的办法，把肥料供应给棉、麻、烟等经济作物区和小麦、稻谷的主要产区，特别是棉花产区，并尽先供应这些地区的农业生产合作社。为了实现这个原则，各级供销合作社必须打通干部思想，批判本位主义和平均分配的现象；在某些必须供应肥料而农民尚无施用习惯的地区，要加以推广；在以往不分作物品种普遍施用化学肥料的地区，要说服农民把它用到主要作物上。
    改变肥料供不应求现象的有效办法是发掘当地潜力，扩大地方肥源。地方肥源很多，无论城市农村，无论南方北方，到处都有。根据各地供销合作社对五万人口以上的所有城市的调查，每年约可出产人粪尿一千三百万吨；大力运送这些肥料到农村去，就能解决很大的问题。根据部分地区的经验，建立一些货栈性质的经营机构，负责跟城市公共卫生部门和合作社联系，负责管理这个工作，是很必要的。
    新式农具和牲畜的供应、调剂工作也要作好。在推广双轮双铧犁等新式农具以前，必须做好宣传工作，并尽可能进行实地试验，把技术传授给农民。供销合作社还要负责供应各种新式农具的零件，帮助农民解决修配农具的困难。据去年冬季以来的调查，某些地区牲畜减少的现象很严重，给春耕生产造成许多困难。目前，各地党和政府正在积极进行保畜工作。供销合作社要协同粮食部门，积极组织饲料的供应，按照“先饲料、后肥料”的原则，迅速把可以调出的油饼供应到农民手里。在耕畜调剂方面，供销合作社可以组织农民在当地进行交流，可以组织畜贩进行必要的较长距离的贩运，也可以有计划地直接贩运一部分耕畜，以补当地交流之不足。供销合作社应该参加牲畜市场的领导和管理，掌握牲畜价格，取缔牲畜交易中的陋规恶习，协助政府禁止滥宰耕畜。
    在当前条件下，供销合作社绝不能忽视小农具的供应工作。小农具毕竟还是农民使用最多的农具。各地供销合作社要注意调查研究农民关于改进小农具的意见，根据“就地取材，就地加工，就地供应”的方针，采取向手工业者加工订货的办法，供给他们所需要的原料，收购他们的产品，指导他们改进产品的规格，提高产品的质量。
    为了协助农民作好春耕生产，供销合作社还必须改善生活资料的供应工作；绝不能因为强调经营生产资料而忽视经营生活资料。自从实行粮食、棉布、油料统购统销以来，有些供销合作社没有根据市场新的情况，努力改进经营管理，合理组织销售供应，反而对某些统销物资保守惜售，使应该供应的没有得到供应，或没有得到适量的供应，引起农民的不满。这种情况必须迅速改变过来，否则就将损伤农民的生产积极性，对今年的农业增产，特别是粮食、棉花、油料等作物的增产，有不良的影响。供销合作社的干部必须继续克服保守惜售思想，尽量在国家计划范围内，从品种和数量上满足农民的要求。
    作好棉花预购工作，对棉花增产有极其重要的意义。各级合作社必须设法补足预购工作中所需要的生产资料和其他物资的供应。
    做好农村生产资料供应工作，绝不只是供销合作社的任务，而是国营商业、地方工业和农业部门的共同任务。但供销合作社应该担负直接的主要的责任。当然，仅靠供销合作社的力量，是不能完全作好这些工作，充分满足农民的这些要求的。供销合作社应该贯彻对农村私商的改造政策，组织和领导整个市场为春耕生产和农民需要服务。实现这一目的的首要措施是立即批发给私商小贩以一定的商品，推动他们进行有利于春耕生产和国家需要的经营。
    为了加强生产资料的供应，各级党委应加强对供销合作社的领导，督促供销合作社发挥应有的作用。供销合作社系统要切实加强政治教育工作，提高干部思想，改善经营作风，把春季农业生产资料及时供应到农民手中，为大力支持农业生产而作积极的努力。
