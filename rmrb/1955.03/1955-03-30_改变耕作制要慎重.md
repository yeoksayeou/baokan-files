    Changing farming systems has a very significant effect on increasing production. Anhui implemented "Three Changes," increasing grain production by billions of catties in one year. Double-cropping rice in Hunan yields about 200 catties more per mu than single-cropping rice. In 1954, some sandy fields in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong changed from intercropping to continuous cropping, generally increasing production by 70% to 100%.

    The leading organs of many regions have affirmed the significant role of changing farming systems and have emphasized this work in guiding this year's agricultural production. Provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, and Fujian have all formulated plans to change single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice, intercropping rice to continuous cropping rice, and indica rice to japonica rice this year. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in these provinces have also set out plans to change farming systems this year.

    We must cherish the enthusiasm and initiative of leading organs and the broad masses in various regions. However, it must be understood that changing these farming systems must be done with great caution. This change is a change to the traditional farming habits of the broad masses of peasants; resistance from conservative thinking is inevitable in the reform process, and absolute impatience is impermissible. In the actual work process, many practical problems will inevitably be encountered. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Fuyang County, Zhejiang, changed to planting double-cropping continuous rice, and found that the prepared fertilizer was far from enough. Many villages in Jiacun Township, Yin County, wanted to expand the planting area of double-cropping rice, but lacked sufficient seeds. After inspection, Longquan Township in the fifth district of Ningxiang, Hunan, found that the existing water conservancy conditions could not meet the needs of expanding double-cropping rice this year. These facts show that changing farming systems is by no means a simple matter.

    Liling, Hunan, has created the experience of promoting double-cropping rice: making full preparations, promoting it in a concentrated way, and advancing steadily. The so-called full preparation means preparing all necessary conditions before promoting double-cropping rice: good early rice and late rice seeds with appropriate growth periods, appropriate water conservancy conditions, and sufficient fertilizer. In addition, we must do a good job in preventing insect pests; in order to enable cadres and the masses to learn the techniques of planting double-cropping rice, typical demonstrations must be carried out. With these preparations, and by strengthening leadership and advancing steadily, success can be achieved.

    Yancheng County, Jiangsu, had such a lesson in promoting double-cropping rice in 1954: due to unsuitable local climatic conditions, the late rice grains in 5,000 mu of continuous rice were not harvested.

    The specific conditions of various regions implementing changes in farming systems are not entirely the same as those of Liling and Yancheng, but it is very necessary to learn from and remember their experiences and lessons. Treating their experiences and lessons as a "mirror" to reflect on the work in one's own region can reveal some problems and is of great benefit to the work of implementing changes in farming systems.

    改变耕作制要慎重
    赵起
    改变耕作制有极显著的增产效果。安徽实行“三改”，一年中增产成十亿斤的粮食。湖南种植双季稻，每亩比单季稻增产二百斤左右。广东珠江三角洲某些沙田在一九五四年由间作改为连作，一般都能增产百分之七十到一百。
    许多地区的领导机关肯定了改变耕作制的重大作用，在领导今年农业生产中，都重视了这一工作。浙江、广东、湖南、广西、福建等省都分别作出今年改单季稻为双季稻、改间作稻为连作稻和改籼稻为粳稻的计划。这些省的许多农业生产合作社、互助组也定出了今年改变耕作制的计划。
    必须珍视各地领导机关和广大群众这种热情和积极性。但是，要知道，进行这种耕作制度的改变，一定要十分慎重。这种改变是对广大农民传统的耕作习惯的改变；在改革过程中，必然遇到保守思想的抵抗，这是绝对急躁不得的。在实际工作过程中，还必然遇到许多实际问题。浙江富阳县有的农业生产合作社改种双季连作稻，发现原准备的肥料相差很多；鄞县甲村乡许多村庄想扩大双季稻种植面积，但缺乏足够的种籽。湖南宁乡五区龙泉乡经过检查，发现原有的水利条件不能满足今年扩种双季稻的需要。这些事实说明，改变耕作制绝不是很简单的事。
    湖南醴陵创造了推广双季稻的经验：充分准备，集中推广，稳步前进。所谓充分准备，就是在推广双季稻前，准备好各种必要的条件：优良的、生长期适当的早稻、晚稻种籽，适当的水利条件，足够的肥料；此外，还要做好预防虫害的工作；为了要使干部和群众学会种双季稻的技术，要经过典型示范等。有了这些准备，再加强领导，稳步前进，就能成功。
    江苏盐城县一九五四年推广双季稻有这样一个教训：由于当地气候条件不适当，五千亩连作稻中的晚稻颗粒未收。
    各个实行改变耕作制地区的具体情况同醴陵、盐城都不尽相同，但是学习和记取它们的经验教训是很必要的，把它们的经验教训当做“镜子”照一照自己地区的工作是可发现若干问题的，是对实行改变耕作制的工作大有好处的。
