Beijing and Tianjin Organize Condolence Groups
　　Deeply Visit Disaster-stricken Rural Areas in Hebei to Console Farmers

　　In early February, the people of Beijing and Tianjin organized condolence groups to visit the disaster-stricken areas in Hebei Province last year to console the affected farmers. The visits have now been completed, and the groups have returned to Beijing and Tianjin respectively.

　　The condolence group organized by Beijing Municipality went deep into the disaster-stricken areas of Gu'an, Daxing, and Ji counties. In addition to extending cordial condolences to thirty-four agricultural production cooperatives and three hundred and forty-three farmer households, they also focused on comforting model individuals in disaster resistance, rescue, and production. Furthermore, they held twenty-one condolence meetings, sixteen discussion meetings, and met with more than 58,000 disaster-stricken farmers.

　　The film projection team accompanying the condolence group screened films such as "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," "Dawn Collective Farm," and "A Proposal" for the disaster-stricken farmers. Farmers from villages far and near came to watch. The farmers said: "The people of the capital care about us so much, and the films they show are all about farmers organizing themselves." Wherever the condolence group went, they were warmly welcomed by the disaster victims. Upon the condolence group's return, the disaster-stricken farmers wrote 1,180 enthusiastic letters of gratitude in the name of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individuals, and entrusted them to the condolence group to be delivered to the people of Beijing. The people of the three counties also warmly saw off the condolence group, expressing their gratitude to the people of the capital.

　　The two sub-groups of the condolence delegation organized by the people of Tianjin Municipality visited the areas severely affected by floods last year in the Tianjin and Baoding regions from February 4th to 26th. They held more than 100 condolence meetings and discussion meetings, and conducted in-depth visits to farmer households. The two medical teams accompanying the condolence group provided free medical treatment to more than 1,300 farmers; the two theater troupes and two film projection teams performed and screened films more than 40 times each, and more than 260,000 farmers watched these programs. The condolence group was warmly welcomed by local farmers wherever they went.

　　The condolence group representatives also repeatedly discussed with the local farmers the close unity and mutual support between the city and the countryside, and between workers and farmers in the past. During the condolences in Jinghai County, they recalled that during the flood control period last year, Tianjin sent 100,000 migrant workers to protect the dozens of miles of dikes in Jinghai County, and supported them with 200,000 hemp bags, more than 100,000 large wooden stakes, and a large number of flood control materials. The people of Jinghai County fought continuously against the floods for two or three months on the 800-mile-long dikes of the Ziya River and the South Canal, protecting the safety of Tianjin and the Jinpu Railway.

　　Farmers from various places also sent local specialties such as water caltrop, gorgon fruit, peanuts, and cattail leaf fans as gifts to the representatives of the condolence group. They also asked the representatives to send letters to the working-class elder brothers in Tianjin, expressing their determination to work hard to increase production and overcome the disaster.

    北京天津分别组织慰问团
    深入河北受灾农村慰问农民
    北京、天津两市人民在二月初曾分别组织慰问团，到河北省去年遭受水灾地区慰问受灾农民，现已慰问完毕，分别返回北京和天津。
    北京市组织的慰问团曾深入固安、大兴、蓟县等三县受灾地区，除对三十四个农业生产合作社、三百四十三户农民进行亲切慰问外，并重点慰问了抗灾、抢险、生产的模范人物。此外，还举行了慰问大会二十一次，座谈会十六次，和受灾农民五万八千多人见了面。
    慰问团带领的电影放映队为受灾农民放映了“春风吹到诺敏河”“曙光集体农庄”“一件提案”等影片，远近各村农民都赶来观看。农民们说：首都人民太关心我们了，放的电影都是关于农民组织起来的事。慰问团不论走到哪个乡村，都受到灾民们热烈的欢迎。在慰问团归来时，受灾农民以农业生产合作社、互助组和个人名义写了一千一百八十封热情的感谢信，交慰问团带交北京人民。三县的人民，还热烈欢送慰问团，表示对首都人民的答谢。
    天津市人民组织的慰问代表团的两个分团从二月四日到二十六日曾分别在天津、保定两专区去年遭受大水的地区进行慰问，共开过一百多次慰问大会、座谈会，并深入农民家庭进行访问。随同慰问团前往的两个医疗队，曾为一千三百多个农民免费治病；两个剧团和两个电影队为农民演出和放映各达四十多次，有二十六万多农民观看了这些节目。慰问团每到一处都受到当地农民热烈的欢迎。
    慰问团代表和当地农民们还多次交谈城市和乡村、工人和农民在过去亲密团结互相支援的情形。在静海县慰问时，他们回忆起去年防汛期中，天津市曾出了十万民工来防护静海县几十里长的堤岸，支援了二十万条麻袋、十万多棵大木桩和大批防汛物料；静海县人民在子牙河、南运河等八百多里河堤上，连续与洪水战斗了两三个月，保护了天津市和津浦铁路的安全。
    各地农民还纷纷把当地特产的菱角、鸡头米、花生、蒲扇等作为礼物送给慰问团代表们。并请代表们给天津市工人老大哥捎信，表示一定要努力增产，战胜灾荒。
