(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th) According to TASS: N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke on the 18th at a conference of agricultural workers from the southeastern regions of the Soviet Union, held in Saratov.

	Khrushchev said that the resolution adopted by the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on increasing the production of grain and livestock products is the key to the country obtaining abundant agricultural products. However, no matter how good the resolution is, it will not give us anything by itself if the collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms are not led by people who are good at organizing the masses to complete these resolutions. Khrushchev pointed out that it is necessary to resolutely continue to strengthen collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms with experienced leading personnel.

	When talking about increasing grain production, Khrushchev spoke in detail about the issue of planting corn. He said that the main link in solving the task of drastically increasing grain production, especially increasing the production of feed grain needed for animal husbandry, is corn. Under the current circumstances where the proportion of sown area has already changed, to raise grain production to the required level, it is necessary to greatly increase the yield per unit area. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the production of fertilizer several times, which means making huge investments in the chemical industry. However, if we pay special attention to corn, then we can achieve the above goal in a relatively short period of time with relatively little capital. Under the same conditions, the yield of corn per unit area is always one or two times higher. Corn is a very valuable feed, and from the perspective of the amount of labor used per unit product, planting corn is the most labor-saving.

	Khrushchev then talked about the task of increasing millet production. He believes that we should widely adopt existing experiences of high yields and greatly increase the yield of millet this year.

	Khrushchev spoke in detail about the task of improving agricultural leadership. He said that leading cadres must be very knowledgeable about agriculture, must frequently meet with collective farmers, and learn from them. This science cannot be learned from books alone, it must be learned in constant practical work.

	Khrushchev emphasized the necessity of improving the work of agricultural scientific research institutions. He said that there are still unacceptable phenomena in our agricultural science, that is, some scientific workers do not bear any specific responsibility. The remuneration of scientific workers should be adopted in such a way that it can materially promote them to care about how to apply the results of scientific research to production. Khrushchev put forward a task to the scientists, suggesting that they study in depth the issue of improving the cultivation system in grassland and arid areas, so as to put forward scientifically based suggestions for the correct operation of agriculture to collective farms and state farms there.

	Khrushchev finally expressed his firm belief that the southeastern states of the Soviet Union will greatly increase the production of grain and livestock products this year.

    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫在会议上的讲话（摘要）
   【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫，十八日在萨拉托夫举行的苏联东南部各州农业工作者会议上讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联共产党中央委员会一月全体会议通过的关于增加谷物和畜牧业产品生产的决议，是全国获得丰裕的农产品的关键。但是，不管决议多么好，如果领导集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的不是一些善于组织群众来完成这些决议的人，那么，它本身是不会给我们任何东西的。赫鲁晓夫指出，必须坚决地继续以有经验的领导人员来加强集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场。
    在谈到增加谷物生产时，赫鲁晓夫详细地谈到了种植玉蜀黍的问题。他说，解决急剧增加谷物生产，特别是增加畜牧业所需的饲料谷物生产这个任务的主要环节是玉蜀黍。在目前播种面积比例已经改变的情况下，要把谷物生产提高到必需的水平，就要大大提高单位面积产量。因此，就要增加生产几倍的肥料，也就是要对化学工业进行巨额投资。但是，如果我们特别注意一下玉蜀黍的话，那么我们在比较短的时期内用比较少的资金也能够达到上面的目的。在条件相同的情况下，玉蜀黍的单位面积产量总是高一两倍。玉蜀黍是一种非常宝贵的饲料，从每个单位产品所用的劳动量来看，种植玉蜀黍最节省劳动。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了增加黍生产的任务。他认为，应当广泛采用已有的丰产经验，在今年大大提高黍的产量。
    赫鲁晓夫详细地谈到改进农业领导的任务。他说，领导工作者必须对农业非常内行，必须经常地同集体农民会面，向他们学习。这门科学不是光从书本上就可以学好的，必须要在经常的实践工作中才能学好。
    赫鲁晓夫着重指出了改进农业科学研究机关的工作的必要性。他说，我们的农业科学中还存在着不能允许的现象，那就是有些科学工作人员不负任何具体责任。对科学工作人员的报酬应当采取这样一些方式，就是：这种方式能够从物质上促使他们去关心如何把科学研究的结果运用到生产中去。赫鲁晓夫向科学家们提出一项任务，建议他们深入研究在草原地区和干旱地区改进耕作制度的问题，以便向那里的集体农庄和国营农场提出正确经营农业的有科学根据的建议。
    赫鲁晓夫最后表示深信，苏联东南部各州在今年将会大大增加谷物和畜产品的生产。
