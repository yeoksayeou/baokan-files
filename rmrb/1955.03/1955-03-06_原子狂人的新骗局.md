Title: The Atomic Madman's New Swindle

The atomic madman Dulles has never missed any opportunity to conduct atomic war-mongering and blackmail. According to Reuters, Dulles declared at the Bangkok conference that "the current U.S. military strategy in the Far East is firmly based on the concept of treating atomic bombs as conventional defensive weapons." In Rangoon, he publicly stated that he would use atomic bombs to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

However, this kind of rabid clamoring, in addition to once again exposing the warmongering face of the U.S. ruling clique, will not have any effect on the Chinese people. Now that the United States has lost its monopoly on atomic bombs, atomic bombs are not something sweet for navies and naval bases. The atomic madmen in the United States had better remember this.

Of course, Dulles's flaunting of U.S. atomic power is not only a vain attempt to intimidate the Chinese people but also to subdue other Asian countries and force them to comply with the U.S. aggressive plans in Southeast Asia. But the era in which Asian people can be intimidated by the weapons of imperialism has long passed. The opposition of the Japanese people, who have suffered greatly from U.S. atomic weapons, fully demonstrates the Asian people's hatred for the U.S. atomic madmen.

Precisely because of this, while Dulles was clamoring about America's atomic strength, he played some new tricks in an attempt to ease the people's opposition to atomic weapons. He deliberately emphasized that atomic bombs would only be used for so-called tactical purposes and not for strategic attacks. In Rangoon, he said: he "hoped that it would not be necessary to use it to bomb densely populated areas." But who can be fooled by this? U.S. President Eisenhower said at the beginning of this year that "there is no clear distinction" between tactical and strategic atomic weapons. U.S. military experts also believe that any use of atomic weapons will lead to unlimited atomic war. It can be seen that the so-called "tactical use of atomic weapons" is just a clumsy trick to induce people from all countries to agree to the U.S. use of atomic weapons. U.S. Air Force Reserve Colonel Leghorn recently wrote an article in "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which revealed the purpose of this deceptive propaganda. He said that if the United States declares that it will only use atomic weapons against military targets, "then the movement to eliminate atomic weapons will be greatly reduced..."

Dulles also set up another trap for the Asian people. While waving atomic bombs at the Asian people, he talked a lot about the United States' willingness to carry out international cooperation with Asian countries in the so-called "peaceful use of atomic energy." However, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson said that the relationship between the United States and other countries is like doing business. It is clear that Dulles's so-called "international cooperation" is to use the so-called "atomic aid program" to plunder atomic raw materials from Asian countries and make these countries' nuclear resources serve the U.S. atomic arms race.

Dulles thought that as long as he played some tricks, he could make the Asian people agree to the United States dropping atomic bombs in Asia and that he could make the Asian people dedicate their nuclear resources to the U.S. monopoly capital. But Dulles completely miscalculated. Whether it is an old conspiracy or a new trick, the Asian people will never agree to the use of atomic weapons. Former President of the United Nations General Assembly, Mrs. Pandit of India, said not long ago: "You Americans seem to think that you can intimidate other countries with your hydrogen bombs. But this is impossible. What you possess is a force of death. No matter how often you can kill the masses, the masses will continue to live and grow. This is a real force, this is the power of life." These words reflect that the Asian people are sober, and they will confidently use their own life force to stop the death force of the atomic madmen.

    原子狂人的新骗局
    谭文瑞
    杜勒斯这个原子狂人从来没有放过任何机会来进行原子战争的叫嚣和讹诈。据路透社报道，杜勒斯曾在曼谷会议上宣称，“目前美国在远东的军事战略是以把原子弹当作常规防御武器的观念作为牢固的基础的。”他在仰光并且公开说要用原子弹来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。
    但是，这种狂暴的叫嚣，除了再一次暴露美国统治集团的好战面目之外，对中国人民是不会有任何作用的。在美国已经丧失了原子弹的垄断权的今天，原子弹对于海军和海军基地并不是什么甜蜜的东西，美国的原子狂人们最好记住这一点。
    当然，杜勒斯炫耀美国的原子实力，不仅是妄想恐吓中国人民，而且企图慑服其他亚洲国家，迫使它们顺从美国在东南亚的侵略计划。但是亚洲人民可以被帝国主义的武器吓倒的时代早已过去了。一再受过美国原子武器的大害的日本人民对于原子武器的反对，充分表现了亚洲人民对于美国原子狂人的憎恨。
    正是因为这样，杜勒斯在叫嚣美国的原子实力的同时，玩弄了一些新骗术，企图缓和各国人民反对原子武器的情绪。他有意强调原子弹只用于所谓战术的目的而不用于战略攻击。他在仰光说：他“希望将不必用它来轰炸人口集中的地方”。但是这能骗倒什么人呢？美国总统艾森豪威尔今年年初就曾说过：战术原子武器和战略原子武器“并无截然的区别”。美国的军事专家也认为，原子武器的任何方式的使用都将要导致无限制的原子战争。由此可见，所谓“原子武器战术使用”，不过是企图诱使各国人民同意美国使用原子武器的一个拙劣诡计罢了。美国预备役空军上校列格霍恩最近在“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志上所写的一篇文章，就道破了这种欺骗宣传的目的。他说，美国如果声明将只对军事目标使用原子武器，“那么争取解除原子军备的运动将大大缩小。……”
    杜勒斯还对亚洲人民设下了一个另外的骗局。他一面向亚洲人民挥舞原子弹，一面却大谈美国愿同亚洲国家在所谓“和平使用原子能”上实行国际合作。但是，美国助理国务卿罗伯逊却表示美国和其他国家的关系就是做生意的那种关系。很清楚，杜勒斯的所谓的这种“国际合作”就是用所谓“原子援助计划”，来掠夺亚洲各国的原子原料，使这些国家的核子资源为美国的原子军备竞赛服务。
    杜勒斯以为只要他略施骗局，就可以使亚洲人民同意美国在亚洲丢原子弹，就可以使亚洲人民把他们的核子资源奉献给美国垄断资本。但是杜勒斯完全算计错了。无论是老阴谋，无论是新骗局，只要是使用原子武器，亚洲人民决不同意。前联合国大会主席、印度潘迪特夫人不久以前说过：“你们美国人似乎认为你们能够用你们的氢弹吓倒其他国家。但是这是办不到的。你们拥有的是一种死亡力量。不管你们能够怎样频繁地杀戮群众，群众还是将继续活着和成长。这是一种真正的力量，这是生活的力量。”这一番话反映了亚洲人民是清醒的，他们将满怀信心地用自己的生活的力量制止原子狂人的死亡的力量。
