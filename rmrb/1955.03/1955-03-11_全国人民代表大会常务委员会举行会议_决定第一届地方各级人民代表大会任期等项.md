Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its eighth meeting on March 10th.

The meeting, based on the opinions put forward by the State Council, first discussed the issue of the term of office for the first local people's congresses at all levels. Given that the first meetings of local people's congresses at all levels were convened at different times before the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, if a unified regulation is not made, the election time of some local people's congresses at the county level and above will be far apart from the grassroots people's congresses, and cannot be effectively connected. At the same time, it will result in local election work being carried out all year round. For this reason, the meeting decided that the term of office for the first local people's congresses at all levels will uniformly end when the first meeting of the second people's congress at the corresponding level is held. The election of representatives to the second local people's congresses at all levels will be handled in 1956 for municipalities directly under the central government, counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns, and in 1958 for provinces. The specific time will be stipulated by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The meeting then discussed the issue of the number of representatives to the current people's congresses after changes in the administrative structure of provinces, counties, and townships, based on the opinions put forward by the State Council. Due to the merger of several provinces and cities in 1954, the number of representatives to the people's congresses of the merged provinces generally exceeded the number stipulated in the Electoral Law by a large margin. Some county people's congresses also had the issue of the number of representatives due to changes in the administrative structure. In addition, due to the needs of industrial development or the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the zoning of suburban districts and rural townships is sometimes adjusted, which also raises the issue of the number of representatives. Based on the opinions put forward by the State Council, the meeting decided that when the number of representatives to the people's congresses of provinces, counties, and townships merged due to changes in the administrative structure exceeds the number stipulated in the Electoral Law, the current number of representatives will be maintained uniformly, and adjustments will be made when electing representatives to the next people's congresses of provinces, counties, and townships.

Both decisions of the meeting will be notified by the State Council to the relevant local people's committees for implementation.

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会举行会议
    决定第一届地方各级人民代表大会任期等项
   【新华社十日讯】全国人民代表大会常务委员会在三月十日举行第八次会议。
    会议根据国务院提出的意见，首先讨论了关于第一届地方各级人民代表大会任期问题。鉴于在中华人民共和国宪法公布以前，地方各级人民代表大会第一次会议都已先后召开，时间参差不齐，在这种情况下，如不作统一的规定，一部分县以上的地方各级人民代表大会同基层人民代表大会的选举时间就会相距较远，不能衔接；同时，就会形成常年都要进行地方选举工作。会议为此决定，第一届地方各级人民代表大会的任期，一律到第二届各该级人民代表大会举行第一次会议为止，第二届地方各级人民代表大会代表的选举，直辖市、县、市、市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇一律在一九五六年办理，省一律在一九五八年办理，其具体时间由全国人民代表大会常务委员会规定。
    会议接着根据国务院提出的意见，讨论了关于省县乡改变建制后本届人民代表大会代表名额问题。由于一九五四年合并了若干省、市建制，合并后的各省人民代表大会代表名额，一般均超过选举法规定的名额很多；有些县人民代表大会也因改变建制发生代表名额问题；此外，因工业发展或农业合作化运动发展的需要，市郊区和农村乡的区划时有调整，也发生代表名额问题。会议根据国务院提出的意见，决定因改变建制而合并的省、县、乡人民代表大会代表超过选举法规定名额时，一律保持现有名额，待选举省、县、乡下一届人民代表大会代表时再行调整。
    会议的这两项决定都将由国务院通知有关地方的人民委员会遵照执行。
