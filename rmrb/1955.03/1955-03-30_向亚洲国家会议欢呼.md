A Salute to the Asian Countries Conference

He Xiangning

The Asian Countries Conference is scheduled to open on April 6th in New Delhi, India. The convening of this conference is a symbol of the friendship and unity of the people of Asian countries, and it also reflects the determination of the people of Asian countries to oppose aggression and defend peace. It will definitely make a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world. This is to be expected.

Asia's population accounts for more than half of the world's total population. The vast majority of the people here have long suffered from the enslavement of colonialists and are in the miserable situation of being in colonies or semi-colonies. But recently, China's 600 million people have overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and stood up as masters of the country; India, Indonesia, Burma, and other places have also established independent countries; at the same time, the people in other places have also generally awakened and are urgently demanding independence, democracy, freedom, and peace. Despite this, European and American colonialists will not willingly withdraw their clutches that control Asia. The American aggressor group is even more aggressively implementing its policy of aggression and pursuing colonialism in Asia. They want to continue to occupy the territories of Asian countries and interfere in the internal affairs of various countries. Their occupation of our sacred territory of Taiwan and the use of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to conduct destructive and harassing wars against our country is a clear example. They are also doing their utmost to expand their arms and prepare for war, using the preparation for atomic war as a means of blackmail, and doing everything possible to create international tensions. At this time, the United Nations, which is responsible for maintaining world peace, has become a tool of the United States. Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations, ignoring the condemnation of world public opinion, still allows the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has been spurned by the Chinese people, to occupy a position in the United Nations; the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, which has a quarter of the world's population, in the United Nations are unreasonably usurped. Faced with this situation, the task of the Asian Countries Conference is obviously very important.

The people of Asian countries have always had a deep friendship. In particular, India and China have a 2,000-year-old friendly relationship. Last year, the joint statement of Premier Zhou Enlai of our country and Prime Minister Nehru of India emphasized the importance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; the joint statement of Premier Zhou and Prime Minister U Nu of Burma also agreed that these five principles should be the guiding principles for Sino-Burmese relations. Our country and countries such as India and Burma abide by these five principles—mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence—have already set an example of peaceful coexistence for countries with different social systems and political systems in Asia and the world. Through this Asian Countries Conference, these five principles will certainly receive more universal attention, thereby further promoting friendly relations between countries and the friendship of the people of various countries. This can also be affirmed.

Although Japanese militarists once invaded China and many other Asian countries, we must distinguish between Japanese aggressors and the Japanese people. The Japanese people are good friends of the Chinese people. In my youth, I studied in Japan and also went to Japan to escape Yuan Shikai's arrest. I lived in Japan for a total of fourteen years. Because I followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen to participate in the revolution, I met many Japanese people of insight. They once enthusiastically supported the Chinese revolution against the Manchu Qing Dynasty. For example, Yamata Yoshimasa sacrificed his life in the Huizhou Uprising in Guangdong before the 1911 Revolution. I admire the righteousness and chivalry of these Japanese friends very much and will never forget them. Today, forty or fifty years later, the Chinese people already have an independent and democratic new China, while Japan is now being enslaved by the United States and used by the United States as a military base for aggression against Asia. Its politics, economy, and diplomacy are directly or indirectly subject to American interference and control, and even foreign trade cannot be independent. We feel extremely unfair about the Japanese people's situation, because our country has also been oppressed. The intelligent, hardworking, and brave Japanese people will certainly not be willing to be in a state of oppression and humiliation. They will certainly join hands with the people of Asian and other countries in the world to jointly oppose aggression and cherish peace. The recent enthusiastic signing of petitions by the Japanese people against the use of atomic weapons is proof of this.

Asian countries have had extensive cultural exchanges in the past. For example, Japan still uses a large number of Chinese characters; the calligraphy and paintings of the Han and Tang dynasties have had a profound impact on the Japanese art world; ancient China's more advanced production tools and production technologies were also introduced to Southeast Asia and other places with the emigration of the Chinese people. For example, Chinese sericulture and silk weaving methods were introduced to Java very early. On the other hand, China also absorbed a large amount of foreign culture. After the forces of European and American colonialists invaded Asia and most parts of Asia became colonies or semi-colonies, cultural exchanges in various parts of Asia were greatly hindered. Now, cultural exchanges between Asian countries are not only necessary to restore and expand, but also possible to restore and expand. This is beneficial to the people of all countries. I believe that through this Asian Countries Conference, this goal will not be difficult to achieve.

When Asian countries were still colonies or semi-colonies, women in various places were subjected to heavy shackles and oppression, and their suffering was very deep. At the same time, the fate of children was also very tragic. The alarmingly high infant mortality rate in many places is a clear proof. This Asian Countries Conference will discuss not only political, cultural, and economic issues, but also issues concerning the status of women and the protection of children, which is also welcome. Asian women account for more than a quarter of the world's total population. All of us Asian women must unite closely and jointly oppose the use of atomic weapons, protect children's safety, and defend peace in Asia and the world.

The era when Asia was at the mercy of others is gone forever. The convening of the Asian Countries Conference is a sign of the development of this great significance. Let us cheer for this conference with its important mission!

    向亚洲国家会议欢呼
    何香凝
    亚洲国家会议定于四月六日在印度新德里开幕。这一次会议的召开，象征着亚洲各国人民的友谊和团结，同时反映了亚洲各国人民反对侵略和保卫和平的决心，对于亚洲以至世界的和平一定会有很大的贡献。这是可以预期的。
    亚洲的人口占世界总人口的一半以上。这里绝大部分的人民长期受了殖民主义者的奴役，处在殖民地或半殖民地的悲惨境地。但是到了最近，中国六亿人民已经推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，站了起来，作为国家的主人了；印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸等地，也已经建立了独立的国家；同时，其他各地人民，也已经普遍地觉醒起来，迫切地要求独立、民主、自由、和平。尽管如此，欧美殖民主义者是不会心甘意愿地缩回他们控制亚洲的魔手的。美国侵略集团更变本加厉地在亚洲实行侵略政策，推行殖民主义。他们要继续侵占亚洲各国的领土，干涉各国的内政。他们侵占我国神圣的领土台湾，利用蒋介石卖国集团对我国进行破坏性和骚扰性的战争，这就是一个明显的事例。他们又竭力扩军备战，用准备原子战争来作为讹诈的手段，千方百计地制造国际紧张局势。在这个时候，负有维持世界和平的责任的联合国反而变成了美国的工具。在美国的操纵之下，联合国竟不顾世界人民舆论的指责，还让那个遭受中国人民唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团窃据联合国中的位置；拥有世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利，竟被无理侵夺。面对着这种局势，亚洲国家会议的任务显然是很重大的。
    亚洲各国人民一向有着深厚的友谊。尤其是印度与中国有两千年的友好关系。去年我国周恩来总理和印度尼赫鲁总理的联合声明，强调了和平共处五项原则的重要意义；周总理和缅甸吴努总理的联合声明，也同意这五项原则作为指导中缅关系的原则。我国和印、缅等国的遵守这五项原则——互相尊重领土主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利，和平共处——已经为亚洲以至世界不同社会制度和政治制度的国家树立了和平共处的典范。通过这一次亚洲国家会议，这五项原则一定能够获得更普遍的重视，从而进一步促进各国的友好关系和各国人民的友谊，这也是可以断定的。
    日本的军国主义者虽然曾经侵略中国和亚洲其他许多国家，但是我们必须把日本侵略者和日本人民区别开来。日本人民是中国人民的好朋友。我在年青时代，曾经在日本求学，也曾经因为逃避袁世凯的缉捕而到日本去。我前后在日本一共住了十四年，因为追随孙中山先生参加革命，结识了不少日本的有识见人士。他们曾经热诚地赞助中国反满清帝制的革命，如山田良政就在辛亥革命前在广东惠州之役牺牲了生命。我对这些日本朋友的义风侠骨，非常钦佩，并且念念不忘。在四五十年后的今天，中国人民已经有了一个独立、民主的新中国，而日本现在却正在受着美国的奴役，被美国利用为侵略亚洲的军事基地，不论政治、经济、外交，都直接或间接地受着美国的干涉和支配，连对外贸易也不能自主。我们对于日本人民这样的遭遇极为不平，因为我国也曾经受过压迫。聪明智慧、勤劳勇敢的日本人民，一定不甘心于处在被压迫被侮辱的境地。他们一定会和亚洲以至世界各国人民一道，共同反对侵略，一样爱好和平。最近日本人民热烈地签名反对使用原子武器，这是一个证明。
    亚洲各国过去就有广泛的文化交流。例如日本到现在还应用大量的汉字；汉唐的字画，对于日本美术界也发生了深远的影响；古代中国比较进步的生产工具和生产技术，跟着中国人民的出国，也曾经传入东南亚等地，如中国养蚕和织绢的方法，很早就传到爪哇。另一方面，中国也大量吸收外来的文化。到了欧美殖民主义者的势力侵入亚洲，亚洲大部分地区沦为殖民地或半殖民地以后，亚洲各地的文化交流，就受到很大的阻碍。现在亚洲各国间的文化交流，不但有恢复和扩大的必要，也有恢复和扩大的可能了。这对于各国人民都有好处。相信通过这一次亚洲国家会议，这个目的是不难达到的。
    当亚洲各国还是殖民地或半殖民地的时候，各地妇女受着重重的束缚和压迫，苦难是非常深重的。同时儿童的命运也很悲惨。许多地方的婴儿死亡率高得惊人，就是一个明证。这一次亚洲国家会议除了要讨论政治、文化、经济等问题，也要讨论妇女地位和保护儿童问题，这也是值得欢迎的。亚洲妇女占世界人口总数四分之一以上。我们全体亚洲妇女要紧密团结，共同起来反对使用原子武器，保护儿童安全，保卫亚洲及世界和平。
    亚洲任人随意宰割践踏的时代永远过去了。亚洲国家会议的召开就是这一伟大意义的发展的一个标志。让我们向这个任务重大的会议欢呼吧！
