Hunan Province will transport a large quantity of draught cattle, farm tools, fertilizer, seeds, and other spring plowing production materials via waterways. Since February, the Hunan Provincial Department of Transportation's Inland Navigation Administration Bureau has dispatched a large number of ships and adjusted the freight rates for spring plowing production materials in order to rush the transport of goods accumulated in the Zi River, Yuan River, and other river basins. It stipulates that steamers will receive a 10% discount on the current freight rate, and civilian boats will be calculated at an 20% discount on the current freight rate to reduce the burden on farmers. Several steamers towing wooden sailboats loaded with production materials depart from the wharves of Changsha City every day, heading towards various places along the Xiang River. In more than ten days, Changsha Port has transported over 800 tons of chemical fertilizer, over 170 tons of grain seeds, over 670 tons of iron and steel for manufacturing farm tools, and dozens of double-blade plows to the lakeside and western Hunan areas. Currently, the shipping department of Hunan Province has transported over 66,000 tons of fertilizer, seeds, and farm tools to the rural areas.

    湖南利用航路调运肥料种籽
    湖南省将通过航路调运大批耕牛、农具、肥料、种籽等春耕生产资料。二月以来，湖南省交通厅内河航运管理局为了赶运资水、沅江等流域积压的物资，已派出大批船只，并调整了春耕生产资料的运价，规定轮船按现行运价九折优待，民船按现行运价八折计算，以减轻农民负担。长沙市各码头每天都有好几艘轮船拖带着装载生产资料的木帆船，沿着湘江开往各地。长沙港在十多天内已运出八百多吨化学肥料、一百七十余吨谷种、六百七十多吨制造农具的钢铁和几十部双铧犁到滨湖和湘西一带。现在湖南省航运部门运往农村的肥料、种籽和农具已达六万六千多吨。
