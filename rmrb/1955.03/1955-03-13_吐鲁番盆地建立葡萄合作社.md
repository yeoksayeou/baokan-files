    Grape Cooperatives Established in Turpan Basin

    The first grape production cooperative in Xinjiang Province has been established in the nationally renowned grape-producing area - the Turpan Basin.

    This grape production cooperative was established on the basis of the Sai'er perennial mutual aid team in Village One, Shahezi Township, District Three, Turpan County. Twenty-two farming households joined the cooperative. At the time of its establishment, a formal inaugural meeting was held, and it was named the "Liberation" Grape Production Cooperative. At the inaugural meeting, the cooperative members presented their carefully selected top-quality seedless white raisins to the beloved leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and wrote a letter to Chairman Mao guaranteeing: "We must strive to increase grape production and sell it to the state to support the country's industrial construction."

    To ensure the completion of the production increase task, all cooperative members have started from early February to apply soil and transport manure to the grape vines.

    吐鲁番盆地建立葡萄合作社
    新疆省第一个葡萄生产合作社已在全国驰名的葡萄产地——吐鲁番盆地——建立起来。
    这个葡萄生产合作社是以吐鲁番县三区沙河子乡一村赛尔常年互助组为基础建立起来的。入社农民有二十二户。在建社时，正式举行了成立大会，并定名为“解放”葡萄生产合作社。在成立大会上，社员们把自己精细挑选的上等无核白葡萄干献给各族人民敬爱的领袖毛主席，并写信向毛主席保证：“一定要努力增产葡萄，并把它卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。”
    为保证增产任务的完成，全社社员从二月上旬起，便开始给葡萄拉土、驮粪。
