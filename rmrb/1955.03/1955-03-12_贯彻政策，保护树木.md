Implement Policies, Protect Trees
    Lin Wei
    Recently, the phenomenon of tree felling has been occurring continuously in some villages in Leling County, Shandong Province. Even some productive trees have been felled. According to statistics from eighteen townships, more than 30,000 jujube trees, including the famous Leling jujube trees, have been felled.

    The main reason why farmers are felling trees is that cooperatives have not handled the valuation of trees as shares reasonably enough. Farmers with trees feel they are at too much of a disadvantage, so they cut down the trees. As for the existing trees, they are of course even less inclined to prune and cultivate them.

    The phenomenon like the one occurring in Leling is by no means isolated in the country. When some cooperatives in Huayin County, Shaanxi Province, handled the issue of trees as shares, they stipulated that small trees less than two spans thick would belong to the cooperative without compensation. As a result, many trees less than two spans thick were felled. The Xu Qiyuan Cooperative in Linshui County, Sichuan Province, stipulated that trees with a diameter of less than five inches would belong to the cooperative without compensation. The farmers were very dissatisfied and even felled cypress trees as thick as bowls.

    All artificially planted trees, especially fruit trees, take a lot of labor to cultivate successfully. The handling of such privately owned trees by farmers must be very cautious. Blindly mobilizing farmers to contribute trees as shares, or the erroneous practice of lowering tree compensation, has no benefit other than causing farmer dissatisfaction and damage to the timber.

    Agricultural producers' cooperatives should all seriously check whether similar problems have occurred. When dealing with this issue, the principle of farmers' voluntary participation and the principle of being beneficial to the cooperative's operation must be strictly observed. If farmers are unwilling to contribute timber as shares, they should absolutely not be forced to do so. When farmers contribute land to the cooperative, scattered trees growing on the land should not all be included as part of the land contribution; for timber that has already been contributed, good consultations should be held with the farmers, giving reasonable compensation, or the timber should remain the personal property of the farmers and its contribution postponed.

    "It takes ten years to grow a tree." Cultivating trees is not a short-term matter, nor is it an easy one. All measures of agricultural producers' cooperatives should be conducive to uniting production and should absolutely not harm production. Areas where tree felling has occurred should quickly conduct inspections and deal with the situation.

    贯彻政策，保护树木
    林卫
    山东省乐陵县有些乡村近来不断发生砍伐树木的现象。有些生产树都被砍伐了。据十八个乡统计，生产著名的乐陵枣的枣树，已被砍伐三万多棵。
    农民砍伐树木的主要原因，是合作社处理树木作价入社问题不够合理，有树的农户觉得太吃亏，就把树木砍掉了。至于对现有的树木，当然更无心去修剪培植了。
    像乐陵发生的这种现象，在全国绝不是个别的。陕西省华阴县有些合作社处理树木入社问题的时候，规定不够两把粗的小树无代价归社所有。这样一来，许多不足两把粗的树木都被砍掉了。四川省邻水县许期元合作社规定：直径五寸以下的树木一律无代价归社所有，农民很不满意，把碗口粗的柏树也砍了。
    所有人工种植的树木，特别是果树，要花费好多劳动才能培育成功。处理农民这种私有树木必须十分慎重。盲目发动农民把树木入社，或者压低树木报酬的错误作法，除了引起农民不满和对林木的破坏以外，没有任何好处。
    农业生产合作社都应该认真检查一下，是否发生了类似的问题。处理这个问题的时候，必须严格遵守农民自愿的原则和对合作社经营有利的原则。如果农民不愿意把林木入社，绝对不要勉强他们。农民把土地入社时，土地上长着的零散树木，不要一律随地入社；对已入社的林木，要很好地和农民协商，给予合理的报酬，或仍归农民个人所有，暂缓入社。
    “十年树木”。栽培树木不是短时期的事，也不是容易的事。农业生产合作社的一切措施，都应该有利于团结生产，绝不能损害生产。发生砍伐树木现象的地区，应该赶快进行检查处理。
