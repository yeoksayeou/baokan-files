Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 25th: The German News Agency reported on the 25th that the Government of the German Democratic Republic issued the following statement on strengthening security measures:

    When the Federal Parliament and the Federal Council approved the Paris Agreements, and Federal President Heuss signed and promulgated this war treaty that violates the will of the German people for unity and peace, the Adenauer government attempted to create the impression that the ratification of the Paris Agreements seemed to be conducive to the realization of German unity and that negotiations to resolve the German issue would be held in the shortest possible time. The Government of the German Democratic Republic cannot ignore this deceptive statement, which attempts to confuse the German people and obscure people's understanding of the tension of the situation. The German people must recognize that, due to the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the Western countries, the Adenauer Federal Parliament, and the Federal Council will make negotiations on the issue of German peaceful reunification impossible and deepen the division of Germany.

    Completely contrary to this: The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, with the declaration on ending the state of war with all of Germany, which was welcomed by the entire German people and all peace-loving people, and with the proposal to establish a European collective security, have opened a path towards a peaceful solution to the German issue and guaranteeing peace in Europe.

    The Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic have repeatedly declared their readiness to negotiate, but they have also pointed out that the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements will make negotiations on the restoration of German unity impossible. Therefore, the Paris Agreements must first be cancelled in order to open the path to a peaceful solution of the German issue and thus also to the peace and security of Europe.

    Therefore, the Government of the German Democratic Republic calls on the German people to make every effort to engage in the struggle against the implementation of the Paris Agreements, to remove militarist elements from the West German administrative and economic organs, to oppose the establishment of a West German mercenary army, and to oppose the burden of arms production—these struggles are for maintaining peace and are in line with the interests of restoring unity.

    In view of the new situation that has now arisen, the Government of the German Democratic Republic has begun to take measures to defend the German Democratic Republic in accordance with the Moscow Conference Declaration of December 2, 1954, and the resolution of the People's Chamber of December 8.

    The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the decision passed by the Federal Council is contrary to the national interests of the German people, and the Federal Parliament and the Federal Council will bear all the consequences of their decisions. Therefore, the Government of the German Democratic Republic expects the German people to continue the struggle against the Paris Agreements regardless of all difficulties, to voice their demands with a stronger mass movement, and to not stop until the issue of national survival is resolved democratically and peacefully.

    德意志民主共和国政府
    就加强保卫措施问题发表声明
    【新华社柏林二十六日电】德意志通讯社二十五日讯：德意志民主共和国政府就加强保卫措施问题发表声明如下：
    在联邦议院和联邦参议院批准了巴黎协定，联邦总统休斯签署与公布了这一违反德国人民要求统一和平的意志的战争条约的时候，阿登纳政府曾企图造成一种印象，即巴黎协定的批准似乎是有利于实现德国的统一，并将在最短时间内举行解决德国问题的谈判。德意志民主共和国政府对这种欺骗的说法不能置之不理，这种说法就是企图迷惑德国人民并蒙蔽人们去认识局势的紧张性。德国人民必须认清：由于巴黎协定的批准，西方国家、阿登纳联邦议院、联邦参议院将使德国和平统一问题的谈判成为不可能，并加深了德国的分裂。　　由于急急忙忙地强使巴黎协定批准，西方国家和阿登纳再一次证明，他们拒绝在民主与和平的基础上重新统一德国，而把西德拖进一个侵略性的公约集团里去。
    和这完全相反：苏联和人民民主国家以受到全德人民和一切爱好和平人民所欢迎的关于对全德结束战争状态的声明，以建立欧洲集体安全的建议，开辟了一条走向和平解决德国问题和保证欧洲和平的道路。
    苏联政府和德意志民主共和国政府曾一再宣布准备协商，但他们同时也指出：巴黎协定的批准和实行，将使恢复德国统一问题的协商成为不可能。因此必须先取消巴黎协定，才能打开和平解决德国问题从而也是欧洲的和平与安全的道路。
    因此，德意志民主共和国政府要求德国人民尽一切努力从事反对实现巴黎协定的斗争，从西德行政和经济机关中撤除军国主义分子，反对建立西德雇佣军，反对军火生产的负担——这些斗争是为了保持和平并且是符合恢复统一的利益的。
    鉴于现在所产生的新的情势，德意志民主共和国政府已开始按照一九五四年十二月二日莫斯科会议宣言和十二月八日人民议院的决议，着手采取保卫德意志民主共和国的措施。
    德意志民主共和国政府对于联邦参议院所通过的决定，认为这种对巴黎协定的表决是与德国人民的民族利益相违背的，联邦议院和联邦参议院对它们所作的决议将担负一切后果的责任。因此，德意志民主共和国政府期望德国人民不顾一切困难，继续反对巴黎协定的斗争，以更强大的群众运动发出他们的呼声，不到民族的生存问题达到民主与和平的解决，决不停止。
