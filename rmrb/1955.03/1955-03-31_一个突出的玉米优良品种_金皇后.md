    A Prominent Excellent Corn Variety - "Golden Queen"
  　Zhu Pirong
    "Golden Queen" corn is a prominent excellent variety widely welcomed by farmers. Its yield generally exceeds local varieties by fifty to over one hundred catties per mu. In Shandong Province, from 1948 to 1952, twenty-one farms conducted twenty-five trials, with an average yield increase of 44% compared to local varieties, and a maximum increase of 104%. Trials and production practices in various parts of Shanxi Province have proven that it yields an average of 22% more than White Horse Tooth corn and 39% more than ordinary corn. If "Golden Queen" corn is planted in all spring corn producing areas, the country can increase grain production by approximately 5 billion to 10 billion catties annually.
    "Golden Queen" is a dent corn variety. Its ears (commonly known as cobs) are thick and large, measuring seven to eight inches in length, with relatively thin cobs and plump kernels. Generally, "Golden Queen" planted in fertile to medium fertile land can yield four to five hundred catties of kernels per mu. If fertilizer application is increased and cultivation techniques are improved, the yield can be significantly increased. The Guo Yu'en Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, planted 46.8 mu of "Golden Queen" corn in 1952. Due to improved cultivation techniques, the average yield was 775 catties per mu, with 2.5 mu creating a high yield record of 1,518 catties per mu. Hybridizing "Golden Queen" with other corn varieties can also produce hybrid varieties with very significant hybrid vigor. The "Fangza No. 2" and "Laiza No. 7" hybrid varieties promoted in Shandong Province are created by hybridizing "Golden Queen" with local farmer varieties "Small Kernel Red" and "Large Kernel Red". Their yields are not only 30% to 50% higher than local farmer varieties, but their quality is also improved.
    "Golden Queen" has a wide range of adaptability. From Liaoning in the Northeast to Yunnan and Guizhou provinces in the Southwest, whether in mountainous or plain areas, corn producing areas with a frost-free period of more than 150 days can almost all be planted. As corn is a crop with a relatively high yield, its planting area has increased significantly in recent years; especially the planting area of "Golden Queen" corn has increased most rapidly. In the Xinxian Special Zone of Shanxi Province, the planting area of "Golden Queen" corn was only over 150 mu in 1950, but it expanded to 250,000 mu in 1954. Currently, the planting area of this corn in Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei and other provinces is already considerable, and the trial planting results in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Guizhou and other places are also very good. As long as various localities pay attention to advocating and further expanding the planting area of this corn, it is entirely possible.
      "Golden Queen" corn is a relatively late-maturing variety, requiring 120 to 140 days from sowing to maturity, so it is generally used for spring sowing. Its stalks are thick and strong, and its leaves are large, requiring more fertilizer and water. The seedlings should not be planted too densely.
    According to some people, the quality of "Golden Queen" corn is not as good as that of hard-kernel corn, but according to laboratory analysis, its nutritional value is not lower than that of general corn varieties; if this variety can be improved through hybridization methods, its quality can also be improved.

    一个突出的玉米优良品种——“金皇后”
  　朱丕荣
    “金皇后”玉米是农民普遍欢迎的一个突出的优良品种。它的产量一般每亩超过农家种五十到一百多斤。山东省自一九四八年到一九五二年，经过二十一个农场进行二十五次试验，平均产量比当地种增加百分之四十四，最高的增加百分之一百零四。山西省各地的试验研究和生产实践证明，它比白马牙玉米平均增产百分之二十二，比一般玉米增产百分之三十九。如果春玉米产区都能种植“金皇后”玉米，全国每年约可增产粮食五十亿到一百亿斤。
    “金皇后”是马齿型玉米。它的果穗（俗称棒子）粗大，长有七、八寸，穗轴较细，籽实肥满。一般肥沃中等土地种植的“金皇后”，每亩能收籽粒四、五百斤，如果增施肥料和提高栽培技术，产量还能显著增加。山西省平顺县郭玉恩农业生产合作社，一九五二年种植的四十六亩八分“金皇后”玉米，由于提高了栽培技术，每亩平均产七百七十五斤，其中有二亩半还创造了每亩一千五百十八斤的高额丰产纪录。用“金皇后”和别的玉米品种进行杂交，也可以获得杂交优势十分显著的杂交种。山东省推广的
  “坊杂二号”“莱杂七号”等杂交种，就是用“金皇后”和当地农家种“小粒红”“大粒红”杂交而成的。它们的产量不但比当地农家种增高百分之三十到五十以上，而且品质也有提高。
    “金皇后”的适应地区很广，从东北的辽宁到西南的云南、贵州各省，无论是山区或平原，无霜期在一百五十天以上的玉米产区，几乎都能种植。由于玉米是一种产量较高的作物，近年来种植面积增加很多；特别是“金皇后”玉米的种植面积增加最为迅速。山西省忻县专区，一九五○年“金皇后”玉米种植面积只有一百五十多亩，一九五四年已扩大到二十五万亩。目前山西、山东、河北等省这种玉米的种植面积已经不少，四川、湖北、江苏、贵州等地试种结果也很好。只要各地再注意加以提倡，进一步扩大这种玉米的播种面积是完全可能的。
      “金皇后”玉米是一个比较晚熟品种，从播种到成熟需要一百二十天到一百四十天，所以一般都用于春播。它的茎秆粗壮，叶子肥大，需要较多的肥料和水分，种植时留苗不宜太密。
    “金皇后”玉米的品质，据一些群众反映不及硬粒种玉米好，但是根据化验分析结果，它的营养价值并不比一般玉米品种低；如果能够采用杂交办法改良这个品种，它的品质还可以提高。
