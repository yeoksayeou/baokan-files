Produce More Milk to Meet the Needs of the City People

    The State-owned Shuangqiao Farm in Tongxian County, Hebei Province, is a diversified farm that combines agriculture and animal husbandry, focusing on dairy cattle breeding. The farm has relatively complete equipment, including feed processing machines and electric milking machines in terms of animal husbandry, as well as cold storage, medical rooms, and artificial insemination rooms. The farm's more than 200 dairy cows produce 4,159 pounds of milk daily, which is disinfected by the Beijing Milk Station and supplied to the people of the capital.
    Currently, alfalfa and oat grass and other feed crops have been planted on the farm's more than 4,000 mu of land. The farm workers are actively carrying out spring harrowing to preserve soil moisture in an effort to better raise dairy cows and further increase milk production. By Our Reporter Gao Liang.

    生产更多的牛奶，供应城市人民的需要
    在河北省通县境内的国营双桥农场是一个农、牧结合，以饲养奶牛为主的多种经营的农场。农场的设备比较完善，在畜牧方面有饲料加工机器和电气挤奶机等设备，此外，还有冷藏库、医疗室和人工授精室。农场饲养的二百余头奶牛，每天可出产四千一百五十九磅牛奶，这些牛奶经过北京牛奶站消毒后，供给首都广大人民的需要。
    现在，在农场的四千多亩土地上已经种植了苜蓿和燕麦草等饲料作物，农场工人正积极进行春耙保墒，为更好地饲养奶牛和进一步提高牛奶的产量而努力。　本报记者　高　粮摄
