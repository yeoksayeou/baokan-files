Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 27th: The Fourth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam concluded on the afternoon of the 26th after seven days of meetings.

    Ho Chi Minh, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, and others attended the closing ceremony.

    President Ho Chi Minh delivered a speech at the closing ceremony, saying that the National Assembly had approved the various policies that the government had already implemented and would implement, and had made necessary supplements to the policies. This shows that the National Assembly has complete confidence in the government.

    President Ho Chi Minh said: In the future, with the help of the National Assembly and the support of the entire people, the government is determined to overcome all difficulties in order to complete the sacred task entrusted to it by the National Assembly and the entire people, which is to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete national independence and democracy; and at the same time strive to contribute to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world.

    Ton Duc Thang delivered the closing speech, saying: On behalf of the Presidium, I am excited to announce that the Fourth Session has been successful.

    The National Assembly has unanimously adopted the general line and policies proposed by the government at the current stage for consolidating peace, achieving unification, and completing independence and democracy. This line is a symbol of the iron will of the entire people of Vietnam, regardless of North or South, to fight for the complete liberation of the nation.

    He pointed out: This session proves that the Vietnamese people, the National Assembly, and the government are completely united. The National Assembly of Vietnam is the people's congress, elected by universal suffrage in an environment where the French colonialists began to ignite the flames of aggression in South Vietnam, which shows the determination of the Vietnamese people to defend the achievements of the August Revolution and to defend national independence and freedom. This unity is the fundamental factor for the success of this session, which makes the people of the whole country more confident in the implementation of the resolutions passed by the National Assembly.
