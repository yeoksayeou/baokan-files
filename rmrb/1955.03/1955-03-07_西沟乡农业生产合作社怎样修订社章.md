How Xigou Township Agricultural Production Cooperative Revised Its Charter
Chen Jie, Kai Ji, Wen Chang, Shu Xing

In January 1954, the Xigou Township Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, expanded from 47 households to 203 households. At that time, the cooperative members were all worried: "With a large cooperative and many people, everyone will have their own opinions, going east and west. Without rules, it will be difficult!" Based on the members' opinions, the cooperative committee mobilized everyone to discuss democratically and formulate a cooperative charter. After a year of implementation, the members all believed that "acting in accordance with the charter" was a good way to unify the members' thinking and actions and ensure increased production. Cooperative member Zhang Chouhai said: In the spring of 1954, Li Qishuan and others applied fertilizer to their private plots instead of investing in the cooperative. According to the charter, members' fertilizer should be invested in the cooperative in proportion to their land contribution. Other members raised objections to them based on the charter, and the next day, more than 40 households invested more than 4,300 dan of fertilizer. Cooperative member Zhang Qifa said: "More than 30 people in our cooperative are engaged in sideline occupations outside the cooperative year-round, and some people have selfish ideas, not handing over the money they earn to the cooperative. If it weren't for the implementation of the charter, the cooperative would have lost more than 10 million yuan (old currency)!" Similar problems were resolved a total of more than 40 times within the year. Everyone believed that the charter played a great role.

In the winter of 1954, the cooperative expanded again to 263 households. At this time, some members felt that some parts of the charter were not comprehensive or specific enough and needed to be supplemented and revised. The majority of members also agreed with this view.

How can the cooperative charter be revised well? Cooperative Chairman Li Shunda believed:
“To formulate a good charter, we must first grasp the Party's policies.” The members agreed with his view. He successively organized branch committee members, cooperative affairs cadres, Party members, League members, and all cooperative members to study the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and the "Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives (Draft)" and other documents, so that everyone could further clarify the nature and development prospects of agricultural production cooperatives, and know what the cooperative should do and what it should not do. In this way, there was a basis for revising the charter.

When the revision of the charter began, cooperative member Zhang Zhishen raised a question. He said: "Some people still don't implement the original charter. It's useless to formulate it well if it's not implemented." Other members also advocated "settling old scores first, then talking about future matters." Therefore, the revision of the charter started with reviewing the implementation of the charter in the past and resolving outstanding issues.

The 1954 charter stipulated the implementation of "contracting work and output." Zhang Jiuze and other four production teams not only exceeded the planned output, but also saved labor. Wang Juze's team secretly revised the work recording ledger behind the deputy head's back, adding 10 to 15 workdays per person. The cooperative committee raised this issue for everyone to discuss and resolve. During the discussion, cooperative member Zhang Nvhai said: "Zhang Jiuze's team has been processing the land, accumulating more fertilizer, increasing production, and saving labor throughout the year. We should act in accordance with the charter and implement rewards. Everyone should also learn from them." Wu Tangze said: "Wang Juze's team did not work hard, failed to complete the plan, engaged in collective mischief, and damaged the interests of the entire cooperative. They even recorded attending temple fairs as work, which violates the charter. The extra workdays they added should be deducted, and they should also be punished." This issue was handled according to the opinions of the majority of members. In dealing with this issue, it was found that the charter stipulated that the compensation for reduced production was too high, so it was revised according to everyone's opinions.

In this way, while checking and revising, 16 problems were resolved and 16 articles in the charter were revised.

Qin Shuicheng, who first advocated revising the charter, proposed: "The original charter stipulates that 'the land contributed by members to the cooperative shall not be less than 80 percent of the total land.' This clause has problems. Zhang Xiaoke left more than one mu of land for himself, while the Wang Zhouze family of eight only left a little over one mu. Land should be left according to population." When discussing this issue, some people agreed to leave land according to population: one-third of a mu for a household of one, half a mu for a household of two, and two fen per person for a household of three or more, so that some more land could be absorbed into the cooperative. However, some people opposed this opinion. Later, Qin Shuicheng explained to those who wanted to keep more land: "It's not good for you to have too much private land. Working on private land doesn't earn you workdays. Working in the cooperative interferes with your private land. In the end, you can't catch up on either side. When you calculate the accounts, it's better to keep less private land and earn more workdays." Everyone's thinking was unified, and the charter was revised accordingly.

New cooperative members who joined at the end of 1954 raised a question: "Can the new cooperative members share the wheat from the beach land newly reclaimed by the old cooperative members?" This was a matter of concern to everyone. The old cooperative members reclaimed 70 mu of river beach land in 1954, which can produce as much grain as 200 mu of mountain land. They plan to reclaim more than 200 mu this year. Some new cooperative members joined precisely because they saw that the cooperative had reclaimed the river beach land. New cooperative member Zhang Huaichang said: "The beach land is the apple of our eye. If we hadn't seen the potential of this river beach, we wouldn't have joined this year! We'll withdraw if we're not allowed to share the wheat." However, some old cooperative members believed: "We reclaimed the land and we planted the wheat. No matter how much you value it, we can't share the wheat with you." The two sides argued fiercely. After research, the cooperative affairs committee believed that mutual aid teams had also participated in the reclamation of the beach land for the past year, although they didn't contribute as much labor as the cooperative. However, in order to strengthen the unity of old and new cooperative members and improve production, as long as the new cooperative members worked hard, they could share the wheat in the same way as the old cooperative members, according to the number of workdays each person did. After everyone agreed with this view, a clause was added to the charter: "The income from public land in the cooperative (collective reclamation, beach reclamation, etc.), after deducting public grain, production investment, and public accumulation funds, etc., shall all be attributed to labor income."

The new cooperative members happily said: "Now we can rest assured!" Then the old cooperative members proposed: "Since new cooperative members can enjoy the benefits of the beach land we reclaimed, the new cooperative members should also bring their public farm tools into the cooperative." Everyone agreed, and the following was stipulated in Article 27: "Livestock and farm tools left over from mutual aid teams before joining the cooperative shall be owned by the cooperative, but shall be regarded as the share fund of the team members." In this way, the relationship between old and new cooperative members became closer than before.

Some cooperative members said: "Good ideas are needed to run the cooperative well. Strengthening political study should be stipulated in the charter." After everyone's discussion, a "political work" item was added to the charter.

During the revision of the charter, 44 cooperative members who actively implemented the charter were also commended, and 15 cooperative members who did not act in accordance with the charter were criticized. Those who were criticized also made self-criticisms. After the charter was revised in this way, the cooperative members' collectivist thinking was improved, and their confidence in increasing production was also strengthened. Then, a plan to increase grain production this year was formulated, and everyone worked very hard. Qin Shuicheng said: "I did more than 170 workdays this year and sold 1,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Next year, I will strive to do more than 200 workdays and sell 1,500 jin of grain to the state!"

    西沟乡农业生产合作社怎样修订社章
    陈杰　开基  文昌　蜀兴
    一九五四年一月，山西省平顺县西沟乡农林牧生产合作社由四十七户扩大到二百零三户。当时，社员们都顾虑：“社大人多，七嘴八舌，你东我西，没有一个规矩，难办呀！”社委会根据社员的意见，发动大家民主讨论，制订了一个社章。执行了一年，社员们都认为“照章办事”是统一社员思想行动、保证增产的好办法。社员张丑孩说：一九五四年春天，李起栓等把肥料上在自留地里，不往社里投资。按社章规定，社员的肥料应该照入社土地的比例投入社内。别的社员根据社章向他们提了意见，第二天就有四十多户社员投资肥料四千三百多担。社员张起发说：“咱社常年在外搞副业的有三十多人，有些人有自私思想，挣了钱不交社；要不是执行社章规定，社里就要损失一千多万元（旧币）啦！”类似这样的问题，一年内总共解决了四十多件。大家都认为社章有很大作用。
    一九五四年冬天，社又扩大到了二百六十三户。这时，有些社员认为社章上有的地方还不全面、不具体，需要补充修改。大多数社员也同意这个意见。
    怎样才能把社章修订好呢？社长李顺达认为：
  “要订好社章首先要掌握党的政策。”社员们同意他的看法。他先后组织支部委员、社务干部、党团员和全体社员学习中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”和“农业生产合作社示范章程（草案）”等文件，使大家进一步明确地认识农业生产合作社的性质和发展前途，知道社里什么该干、什么不该干。这样，修订社章就有了依据。
    开始修订社章的时候，社员张芝申提出一个问题。他说：“原来的社章还有人不执行；订得再好，不执行也没用。”别的社员也主张“先结了前账，再说后事”。于是，修订社章就先从检查过去执行社章的情况、解决遗留问题着手。
      一九五四年的社章上规定实行“包工包产”。张九则等四个生产组，不仅产量超过计划，还节省了劳动力。王聚则组背着副社长，偷偷地修改记工账，每人加了十到十五个劳动日。社委会提出这个问题让大家讨论解决。讨论时，社员张女孩说：“张九则组
  一年来土地搞加工，积肥也多，增了产，省了工，应该照章办事，实行奖励。大家还要向他们学习。”吴堂则说：“王聚则小组不好好做活，完不成计划，集体捣鬼，破坏了全社利益；他们把赶会也记上了工，这是违背社章的；扣下他们多加的劳动日，还得给他们处罚才对。”这个问题按照多数社员的意见处理了。在处理这个问题时发现社章规定减产部分赔偿数目太大，就按大家的意见作了修改。
    就这样，一边检查，一边修订，解决了十六个问题，修订了社章中的十六条。
    首先主张修订社章的秦水成提出：“社章原来规定‘社员入社地不能低于全部土地的百分之八十’，这条就有毛病。张小科一人留了一亩多地，王周则家八口人才留亩把地，应该按人口留地才对。”讨论到这个问题时，有人同意按人口留：一户一口的留三分地，两口的留半亩，三口以上的，每人留二分，这样就可以再吸收一部分土地入社。但是，也有人反对这个意见。后来，秦水成对那些想多留地的人解释说：“自留地多了，对自己也不好。在自留地上干活，挣不上劳动日；到社里劳动，又误了自留地，结果是两头赶不上。算起账来还是少留一些自留地，多挣几个劳动日强。”大家思想统一了，就在社章上作了修改。
    社里一九五四年年底吸收的新社员提出了一个问题：“老社员新修的滩地，新社员能不能分麦子？”这是大家都关心的事。老社员一九五四年修了七十亩河滩地，可顶二百亩山地打粮食；今年还准备再修二百多亩。有些新社员就是看着社里修了河滩地才入社的。新社员张怀长说：“滩地是眼中珠，要不是看到这个河滩有前途呀，今年还不入社呢！不叫分麦子就退社。”可是有些老社员认为：“地是我们开的，麦子是我们种的；不管你们什么眼中珠，也不能分麦子给你们。”两下争吵得很厉害。社务委员会研究后，认为：一年来互助组也参加了修滩地，虽然出工不如社里多，但是为了加强新老社员的团结，搞好生产，新社员只要好好劳动，也可以和老社员一样按每人做的劳动日的多少分麦子。这个意见大家都同意后，就在社章上补充了一条：“社内公有土地（集体开荒、修滩等）收入，除去公粮、生产投资和公积金等开支外，全归劳动所得。”
    新社员们高兴地说：这下就放心啦！接着老社员又提出：“咱修的滩地，新社员能享受，新社员的公共农具也应该带进社来。”大家也同意，在第二十七条中就规定上：“互助组转社前置下的牲畜、农具应归社公有，但要作为组员的股份基金。”这样一来，新老社员的关系比以前更亲密了。
    有的社员说：“有好的思想才能办好社，应把加强政治学习订在社章里。”经过大家讨论，在社章中增加了一项“政治工作”。
    在修订社章当中，还表扬了积极执行社章的四十四个社员，批判了不照章办事的十五个社员；受到批评的人也都作了检讨。这样修订社章后，社员们的集体主义思想提高了，增产信心也加强了；接着订出今年增产粮食的计划，大家都干得很起劲。秦水成说：“我这一年做了一百七十多个劳动日，卖了一千斤余粮给国家；下一年要争取做二百多个劳动日，卖给国家一千五百斤粮食！”
