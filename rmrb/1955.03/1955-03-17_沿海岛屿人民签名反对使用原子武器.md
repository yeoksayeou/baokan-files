Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons in most towns on Hainan Island has basically ended, and the campaign is now spreading to rural areas and coastal fishing villages. As of the 13th, more than 110,000 people in Haikou City had signed the petition, accounting for more than 85 percent of the city's population.

The counties in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region have established signature campaign committees against the use of atomic weapons. On March 13th, Tongshi, where the People's Government of the Autonomous Region is located, held a signature rally against the use of atomic weapons. At the meeting, more than 1,600 government workers and people from all walks of life of the Li, Miao, Hui, and Han ethnic groups signed their names. Wang Guoxing, Chairman of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, said at the meeting: "We, the Li and Miao people of Hainan Island, have been freed from historical national oppression and are now masters of our own affairs, fully engaged in building a better new life. We resolutely oppose the atomic war policy of the American aggressors and fully support the Soviet Union's proposition to use atomic energy for peaceful construction."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Fishermen, salt workers, and residents on Nan'ao Island in Guangdong Province have been signing petitions against the use of atomic weapons.

On the 14th, all 87 township chiefs, heads of fishery, agricultural, and salt production cooperatives, and mutual aid team leaders who were attending meetings in the county signed the "Letter to the People of the World."

At the inaugural meeting of the Longxi Township Patriotic Fishery Production Cooperative on the 14th, more than 5,000 members and their families signed the petition. More than 500 representatives of fishermen, salt workers, and farmers from Longdong and Gongqian Townships who attended the inaugural meeting of the production cooperative also participated in the signing. Ke Ming, a fisherman who transported the People's Liberation Army across the sea to liberate Nanpeng Island in October 1952, said angrily: "We fishermen want peace and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the American imperialists to use atomic weapons."

Xinhua News Agency: The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons by the people of Fujian Province has penetrated into the coastal islands. In the three counties of Pingtan, Dongshan, and Fuqing, which are at the forefront of coastal defense, more than 70 percent of the people have signed their names. Fishermen on Dongshan Island held a signature rally, followed by a demonstration.
