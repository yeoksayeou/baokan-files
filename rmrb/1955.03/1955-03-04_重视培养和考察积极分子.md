    Attach Importance to Cultivating and Examining Activists
    The Communist Party branch of the Heilongjiang Province Clothing Factory conscientiously cultivates and examines non-Party activists. In addition to providing general education through Communist Youth League classes and inviting activists to participate in Party classes and Party meetings, the branch also calls on Party members to individually assist activists in their spare time. Party member Sun Yaozhong not only cares about the daily lives of activists but also prepares content before each conversation, purposefully enlightening the activists' class consciousness. The Clothing Factory branch promoted Sun Yaozhong's method of cultivating and examining activists to all Party members in the branch, calling on all Party members to conscientiously carry out the work of cultivating and examining activists.

    重视培养和考察积极分子
    黑龙江省被服厂共产党支部，认真培养和考察非党积极分子。支部除通过团课和吸收积极分子参加党课、党的会议进行一般的教育外，还号召党员利用业余时间个别帮助积极分子。党员孙耀忠平时不但能关心积极分子的日常生活，而且能在每次谈话之前都准备好内容，有目的地启发积极分子的阶级觉悟。被服厂支部向全支部党员推广了孙耀忠培养和考察积极分子的方法，号召全体党员认真做好培养和考察积极分子的工作。
