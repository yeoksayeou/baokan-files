Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th: According to TASS, the British House of Commons discussed Labour leader Attlee's proposal on the 14th. The proposal requests the British government to immediately suggest to the United States and Soviet governments to hold a three-nation summit conference "in order to ease world tension and to prepare for effective global disarmament through the United Nations." The proposal does not mention discussing the German question.

British democrats pointed out: This proposal is a trick of the Labour leadership aimed at alleviating the discontent of ordinary members and preventing internal party splits. Ordinary Labour members are dissatisfied with the leadership's support for the government's arms expansion policy, especially the production of hydrogen weapons.

In justifying his proposal, Attlee criticized Churchill's statement in the House of Commons on March 1, which stated that negotiations with the Soviet Union could not be carried out because the Soviet Union opposed the ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty, so the resolution passed by the parliament in April 1954 could not be implemented. Attlee said: "I don't think this is a valid reason."

Attlee condemned the government's refusal to hold great power negotiations before the ratification of the Paris Accords. He said that the government should "take every opportunity to seek personal contact."

In replying to Attlee, Churchill, apparently taking into account the sentiment of the broad public who were striving for a resolution of international differences through negotiations, therefore tried to make it seem as if he had always been in favor of negotiations with the Soviet Union, and that the delay in negotiations had nothing to do with him.

Churchill said that he had sent a "private telegram" to Molotov in early July last year, suggesting a "friendly talk without an agenda." On July 5, he received a "very earnest and hopeful reply" from Molotov. Churchill went on to say: But we have to wait until the end of the Geneva Conference. Later, we received a note from the Soviet Union suggesting a conference attended by European countries and the United States to discuss proposals for guaranteeing collective security in Europe. Molotov pointed out that he did not think that discussing the proposal to hold informal talks would preclude convening a conference on guaranteeing European security.

Without even considering how much logical basis his inference had, Churchill said: "The Queen's government had no other option but to postpone my proposal to Molotov."

Churchill finally reiterated that he did not agree to hold great power talks immediately. He said: "The most important thing in my mind is to enhance our friendship and understanding with our ally, the United States."

Labour MP Crossman, who spoke in the debate, expressed concern about the United States' attempt to drag Britain into military adventures in the Far East. He pointed out that the main cause of tension in the Far East was the United States.

Referring to the situation in West Germany, Crossman said: "The closer the final ratification of the Paris Accords gets, the more the Germans regard the Paris Accords as a prison in which the West has confined them and as a tool for turning their territory into a battlefield." Crossman also pointed out that the policy of "fostering the armed forces of the North Atlantic Alliance and equipping them with atomic weapons" was aimed at launching a war.

Labour MP Noel-Baker spoke about the danger of preparing for an atomic war. He told the government: Disarmament should be planned constantly, disarmament should be promoted, and negotiations on disarmament should be demanded. Efforts should be made to make this issue one of the most pressing issues in international affairs.

In replying to Labour MPs, Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned that "the British Labour government in the past increased armaments at a higher rate than ever before." Eden then repeated the trite phrases of American and British propaganda, saying that the West could only talk to the East from a position of strength after ratifying the Paris Accords.

In the vote, the House of Commons rejected the Labour proposal by 298 votes to 268.

    艾德礼向下院提出举行英美苏会议的提案
    英国民主人士指出：这是英工党右翼领导机构的诡计
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国议会下院在十四日讨论工党领袖艾德礼的提案。这个提案要求英国政府立即向美国政府和苏联政府建议举行三国首脑会议，“以便缓和世界紧张局势，并且通过联合国组织来准备有效的世界性裁军”。提案没有谈到要讨论德国问题。
    英国民主人士指出：这个提案是工党领导机构的诡计，其目的在于缓和普通党员的不满情绪和防止党内分裂。工党普通党员对领导机构支持政府的扩军政策，特别是生产氢武器的政策，感到不满。
    艾德礼在替自己的提案申述理由时批评了邱吉尔三月一日在下院所作的声明，这个声明说，由于苏联反对批准“欧洲防务集团”条约，所以没有能够执行议会在一九五四年四月通过的决议而同苏联谈判。艾德礼说：“我不认为这是一个能够成立的理由。”
    艾德礼谴责了政府拒绝在巴黎协定批准之前举行大国谈判。他说，政府应当“利用一切机会来设法进行个人接触”。
    邱吉尔在答复艾德礼的话时，显然考虑到广大社会人士竭力主张通过谈判解决国际分歧的心情，因此企图让人觉得：他一向就是主张同苏联谈判的人，而谈判之所以迟迟没有举行，好像和他没有关系。
    邱吉尔说，去年七月初他打了一封“私人电报”给莫洛托夫，建议举行一次“没有议程的友好的会谈”。七月五日，他接到了莫洛托夫“非常恳切的和令人寄予很大希望的回电”。邱吉尔接着说：但是，我们必须等到日内瓦会议结束。后来，我们收到了苏联的照会，建议召开一个由欧洲各国和美国参加的会议，讨论关于保障欧洲集体安全的建议。莫洛托夫指出，他认为讨论举行非正式会谈的建议并不妨碍召开保障欧洲安全的会议。
    邱吉尔也没有事先考虑一下他的推论到底有多少逻辑根据，就说：“女王政府只有把我向莫洛托夫提出的建议推迟下来，此外再也没有其他的办法了。”
    邱吉尔最后再度表示他不同意立即举行大国会谈。他说：“我心目中最重要的一件事就是：增进我们同我们的盟国美国的友谊和谅解。”
    在辩论中发言的工党议员克罗斯曼对美国企图把英国拖进在远东进行的军事冒险表示不安。他指出：造成远东紧张局势的主要是美国。
    克罗斯曼谈到西德的局势时说：“巴黎协定的最后批准愈是接近，德国人也就愈把巴黎协定当作西方囚禁他们的牢笼和使他们的领土变成战场的工具。”克罗斯曼还指出：“扶植北大西洋联盟的武装力量和以原子武器配备它们”的政策，其目的在于发动战争。
    工党议员诺埃尔—贝克在发言时谈到准备原子战争的危险。他向政府说：应该经常策划裁军，宣传裁军，并且要求就裁军问题举行谈判。应该设法把这个问题变成国际事务中一个最迫切的问题。
    外交大臣艾登在答复工党议员时提到“英国工党政府过去增加军备的速度比以前任何时候都要高”。接着艾登重复美英宣传的滥调，说西方只有凭借实力地位、在批准巴黎协定之后才能同东方会谈。
    投票结果，下院以二百九十八票对二百六十八票否决了工党的提案。
