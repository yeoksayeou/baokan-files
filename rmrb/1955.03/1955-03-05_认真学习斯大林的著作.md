    Study Stalin's Works Seriously
    Zhang Qirong
    The great successor to Lenin's cause, and the beloved friend and teacher of the Chinese people, Stalin, has passed away for two years. We deeply miss him.
    Stalin's works are immortal documents of Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have always drawn strength from Stalin's works in the past and present. To commemorate Stalin, we should follow Chairman Mao's instructions and study Stalin's works more carefully to build our country.
    According to the decision of the Party Central Committee, the Chinese version of the "Complete Works of Stalin" is being published successively in our country. This will greatly strengthen the ideological armament of our Party. Following the first, second, eighth, and ninth volumes of the "Complete Works of Stalin," the Chinese version of the tenth volume was also released to readers not long ago. Like all volumes of the "Complete Works of Stalin," the tenth volume is full of enormous theoretical wealth. The tenth volume includes Stalin's works from August to December 1927. This period was an important period of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. The works included in this volume, in response to the tasks of socialist construction facing the Soviet Communist Party at that time, further elaborated many important principles of Marxism-Leninism. These works are a scientific summary of the experience of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society. Therefore, these works are of great guiding significance for our country, which is in a period of transition.
    In this volume, Stalin demonstrated the policy of agricultural collectivization adopted by the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).
    After the 14th Congress, the Soviet Communist Party launched a struggle to realize the socialist industrialization of the country. By the end of 1927, industrialization had achieved significant success. Industry accounted for 42 percent of the entire national economy, and socialist industry accounted for 86 percent of the entire industry. In the industrial sector, the question of "who will win" had already been decided in favor of socialism. However, the situation in agriculture was different. At this time, although agriculture generally exceeded the pre-war level, the growth rate of agricultural products was very slow, and commodity grain only reached 37 percent of the pre-war level, and there was a continuing downward trend. If this situation in agriculture continued, it would create a very dangerous situation for the entire national economy. At that time, the question of "who will win" was already very sharp in agricultural production. That is to say, either capitalism would recover by relying on the vast individual economy, making the vast number of working peasants poor and bankrupt, breaking the worker-peasant alliance, and causing the entire socialist construction cause to fail; or the working class would lead the peasants to take the socialist road, carry out socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy, overcome the contradiction between workers and peasants, and thus completely defeat capitalism.
    In his report to the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin analyzed the reasons for the backwardness of agriculture. He pointed out that the fundamental reason was that the scattered agriculture did not have the various advantages of the state-owned large-scale industry. This small-peasant economy could not only not implement expanded reproduction like socialist large-scale industry, but even simple reproduction could not be realized regularly. At that time, it was necessary to find a way out of this situation, otherwise socialist construction could not move forward.
    Where is the way out? Right-leaning opportunists advocated slowing down the development speed of general industry, especially state-owned industry. Stalin severely criticized this fallacy, saying: "This must never be done! This is an extremely reactionary, anti-proletarian fantasy. State-owned industry should and must accelerate its development. This is our guarantee for moving towards socialism. This is the guarantee for ultimately industrializing agriculture itself."
    Based on the basic principles of Lenin's cooperative plan, Stalin put forward the historical task of realizing agricultural collectivization. He said: "The way out lies in gradually but resolutely uniting small and even the smallest peasant households into large farms based on public, mutual assistance, collective cultivation, using agricultural machinery and tractors, and adopting scientific methods of intensive cultivation, without using coercive means but using demonstration and persuasion. There is no other way out."
    Based on Stalin's report, the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed a resolution to do its best to develop agricultural collectivization. Since this congress, the Soviet Communist Party has led the entire people to implement a huge change after the October Revolution, guiding millions of individual peasants onto the socialist road, and on the basis of realizing overall collectivization, eliminating the last exploiting class in the country—the rich peasant class, and eradicating the pillar of capitalist restoration in the country.
    Stalin's report to the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is of particular importance to our country's implementation of the socialist transformation of agriculture. At present, in the rural areas of our country, the small-peasant economy still accounts for a large proportion. The scattered and backward small-peasant economy is incompatible with the development of socialist industrialization. In order to successfully complete the socialist industrialization of our country, it is necessary to gradually transform our country's agriculture from small-scale, backward individual agriculture to large-scale, advanced collective agriculture. Although due to different historical conditions, the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country is somewhat different from that in the Soviet Union in some methods, the basic principles pointed out by Stalin are completely applicable to us. Seriously studying Stalin's report will help to correctly implement the decisions of our Party Central Committee on mutual assistance and cooperation in agricultural production and on the development of agricultural production cooperatives, and to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country.
    Party unity is the life of the Party and the basic guarantee of revolutionary victory. In order to defend the unity of the Party, Stalin, in a series of reports and speeches included in this volume, emphasized the need to fight for the unity and iron discipline of the Party's ranks.
    With the progress of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union, the domestic class struggle became increasingly acute. In the summer of 1927, when the British Conservatives severed diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union, the agents of the hostile classes, the Trotsky-Zinoviev elements, also cooperated with the attacks of domestic and foreign enemies and intensified their sabotage within the Party.
    The differences of opinion between the opposition and the Party at that time had turned into programmatic differences. The opposition denied the possibility of building socialism in the Soviet Union, denied the existence of the proletarian dictatorship in the Soviet Union, denied the necessity of the alliance between the proletariat and the basic peasant masses, and denied the socialist nature of the revolution. Stalin pointed out that the Trotskyites were attempting to replace Leninism with Trotskyism, and that they had completely broken with Leninism and embarked on the road of surrendering to the domestic and international bourgeoisie. Stalin exposed the anti-Party and anti-Soviet traitorous nature of the Trotsky gang, pointed out the fact that they had degenerated into a Menshevik group, thoroughly shattered Trotskyism ideologically, and put forward to the Party the task of completely defeating and eliminating the Trotsky-Zinoviev anti-Party and anti-Soviet alliance organizationally. Based on Stalin's report, the Congress declared that participating in the Trotskyist opposition and propagating its views was fundamentally incompatible with Bolshevik Party membership. The Congress approved the resolution of the joint meeting of the Central Committee and the Central Supervisory Committee on expelling Trotsky and Zinoviev from the Party, and expelled the backbone elements of the Trotsky-Zinoviev alliance from the Party.
    At the same time, in order to enhance the unity of the Party, Stalin, in his report to the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), emphasized the importance of developing inner-Party democracy and carrying out revolutionary criticism and self-criticism. Stalin exposed the opposition's attempt to carry out splitting activities under the guise of "democracy" and clarified the essence of inner-Party democracy. He said that the democracy we need is by no means "the democracy of a tiny minority that undermines the will of the vast majority," but rather such democracy that the masses of Party members have the freedom to solve various problems in our construction; to enhance the enthusiasm of the masses of Party members and attract them to participate in the leadership of the Party; to give play to their sense of ownership in the Party.
    Stalin's writings on the struggle against the opposition, contained in this volume, played a huge role in the struggle to crush the imperialist dogs, the Trotsky-Zinoviev elements, and in mobilizing all forces to build the world's first socialist country. Stalin's writings are of great practical significance for us as well. Our country is in a period of transition, and this period of transition contains extremely complex and acute class struggles. Today, the imperialist encirclement still exists, and those classes that have been eliminated domestically will never be reconciled to their own demise, and those classes that will be eliminated will never be without resistance, and with the continuous victory of our cause and the continuous strengthening of our strength, class enemies will certainly adopt the method of "capturing fortresses from within" and undermining the unity and solidarity of the Party to attack the Party. Therefore, we must well understand Stalin's instructions on strengthening the unity and solidarity of the Party, enhance revolutionary vigilance in accordance with the spirit of the document of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, and strive to safeguard the unity of the Party and ensure the victory of socialist construction.
    The works included in this volume, such as "The International Character of the October Revolution," "Talks with Foreign Workers' Delegations," and "The International Situation and the Defense of the Soviet Union," expounded the world historical significance of the great October Socialist Revolution and pointed out the necessity of defending the base of the world revolutionary movement—the Soviet Union.
    Stalin refuted the fallacies of Trotsky and Zinoviev on the "national narrowness" of the Russian Revolution. In the classic essay "The International Character of the October Revolution," Stalin pointed out the great significance of the October Revolution to the world proletarian revolution. Stalin first pointed out that the reason why the October Revolution is an international and world revolution is that it is the fundamental transition in the history of all mankind from the old world of capitalism to the new world of socialism. The October Revolution is different from previous revolutions, its purpose is to eliminate the system of man exploiting man and overthrow all exploiting groups. The October Revolution opened up a new era of proletarian revolution in imperialist countries. It overthrew the imperialist bourgeoisie and established the proletarian dictatorship in one of the largest capitalist countries, thus setting an example of the liberation struggle for the proletariat all over the world. The October Revolution opened up a new era of revolution for the colonial people. The victory of the October Revolution pointed out the path of liberation to all oppressed nations in the world and had a major impact on the revolutionary movement of the colonial people. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is inseparable from the victory of the October Revolution. The great victory of the Chinese revolution gave the world capitalist system a new and extremely serious blow and pushed the colonial national liberation movement to a higher stage. The historical process since the October Revolution increasingly clearly confirms the truth pointed out by Stalin: "The era of safely exploiting and oppressing colonies and dependent countries has passed."
    Stalin pointed out that since the October Revolution spread the seeds of revolution to the center and rear of imperialism, weakened the rule of imperialism in the "mother country," and shook the rule of imperialism in the colonies, it also raised questions about the survival of the entire world capitalism itself. That is to say, the October Revolution gave world capitalism a fatal wound that can never be healed and caused a general crisis in the capitalist system. The Soviet Union, the first proletarian dictatorship state produced by the October Revolution, became a powerful public base and center for the revolutionary movement of the proletariat and oppressed nations of the world. Therefore, the attitude towards the socialist country, the Soviet Union, became the criterion for judging whether each person, each class, and each political party is progressive or reactionary. Stalin pointed out: "Whoever does not wholeheartedly and publicly support the world's first proletarian dictatorship... cannot claim to be a Marxist."
    In addition, the remaining articles in the tenth volume of the "Complete Works of Stalin" are all aimed at elaborating the important principles of Leninism in response to corresponding problems, which have great guiding significance for our current work. We must study hard.
    Stalin has always been the inspirer of the Chinese people's liberation cause. In the report "The International Situation and the Defense of the Soviet Union" included in this volume and in the report to the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin refuted the capitulationist and adventurous fallacies of Trotsky and Zinoviev on the Chinese revolution, analyzed the situation of the Chinese revolution at that time, and pointed out that a new upsurge and victory of the Chinese revolution would inevitably come. Stalin's analysis of the Chinese revolution encouraged the Chinese people's confidence in striving for revolutionary victory.

    认真学习斯大林的著作
    张启荣
    列宁事业的伟大继承者，中国人民敬爱的朋友和导师斯大林逝世二周年了。我们深切地怀念着他。
    斯大林的著作都是马克思列宁主义的不朽文献。中国共产党和中国人民过去和现在都是不断地从斯大林的著作中吸取力量。为着纪念斯大林，我们应当遵循毛主席的指示，更加认真地学习斯大林的著作，以建设我们的国家。
    根据党中央的决定，我国正陆续出版“斯大林全集”中文版。这将大大加强我们党的思想武装。“斯大林全集”继第一、二、八、九各卷之后，第十卷的中文版也在不久前同读者见面了。第十卷像“斯大林全集”所有各卷一样，充满着巨大的理论财富。第十卷包括斯大林从一九二七年八月到十二月这一期的著作。这段时期是苏联社会主义建设的重要时期。编入本卷的各篇著作针对苏联共产党当时所面临的社会主义建设任务，进一步阐述了马克思列宁主义的许多重要原理。这些著作是苏联建设社会主义社会的经验的科学概括。因此这些著作对于正处在过渡时期的我国具有伟大的指导意义。
    斯大林在本卷中论证了联共（布）第十五次代表大会所通过的农业集体化方针。
    苏联共产党在第十四次代表大会以后展开了实现国家社会主义工业化的斗争。到一九二七年末，工业化已经获得了重大成就。工业在整个国民经济中的比重已达到百分之四十二，社会主义工业在整个工业中的比重已达到百分之八十六。工业方面
  “谁战胜谁”的问题已预决要由社会主义获得胜利了。可是农业方面却是另外一种情形。这时农业一般说来虽已超过战前水平，但是农产品增长的速度非常缓慢，商品粮食只达到战前的百分之三十七，而且有继续下降的趋势。农业的这种状况如继续下去就会给整个国民经济造成一种十分危险的局势。当时“谁战胜谁”的问题在农业生产方面已表现得非常尖锐。这就是说，或者是资本主义凭借着广大的个体经济而恢复起来，使广大劳动农民贫困和破产，使工农联盟破裂，使整个社会主义建设事业归于失败；或者是工人阶级领导农民走社会主义的道路，对小农经济进行社会主义改造，克服工农之间的矛盾从而彻底战胜资本主义。
    斯大林在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上的报告中分析了农业落后的原因。他指出根本的原因是分散的农业没有国有化的大工业所具有的种种优越性。这种小农经济不但不能像社会主义大工业那样实行扩大再生产，甚至连简单的再生产也不能经常实现。当时必须找出摆脱这种境况的出路，否则社会主义建设便不能前进。
    出路何在呢？右倾机会主义者主张放慢一般工业特别是国有化工业的发展速度。斯大林痛斥了这种谬论，他说：“决不能这样做！这是一种极反动的、反无产阶级的空想。国有化工业应当而且一定要加速发展。这是我们走向社会主义的保证。这是最后使农业本身工业化的保证。”
    斯大林根据列宁合作社计划的基本原理，提出了实现农业集体化的历史任务。他说：“出路就在于逐步地然而一往直前地不用强迫手段而用示范和说服的方法把小的以至最小的农户联合为以公共的互助的集体的耕种制为基础、利用农业机器和拖拉机、采用集约耕作的科学方法的大农庄。别的出路是没有的。”
    联共（布）第十五次代表大会根据斯大林的报告通过了尽力开展农业集体化的决议。自这次代表大会以后，苏联共产党便领导全体人民实行了十月革命后一次巨大的变革，引导千百万个体农民走上社会主义的道路，并在实现全盘集体化的基础上消灭了国内最后一个剥削阶级——富农阶级，铲除了国内资本主义复辟的支柱。
    斯大林在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上的报告，对我国实行农业的社会主义改造有特别重要的意义。目前在我国农村中，小农经济还占很大的比重。分散落后的小农经济是和社会主义工业化的发展不相适应的。为了顺利完成我国的社会主义工业化，必须使我国农业由规模细小的落后的个体农业逐步转变为规模巨大的先进的集体农业。虽然由于历史条件不同，我国农业的社会主义改造在某些方法上和苏联有所不同，但是斯大林所指出的基本方针对我们是完全适用的。认真学习斯大林这个报告，有助于正确贯彻我们党中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议和关于发展农业生产合作社的决议，把我国农业的社会主义改造推向前进。
    党的团结是党的生命，是革命胜利的基本保证。为了保卫党的团结，斯大林在本卷所包括的一系列的报告和演说中都着重指出必须为党的队伍的统一和铁的纪律而斗争。
    随着苏联社会主义工业化的进展，国内的阶级斗争日益尖锐化。一九二七年夏，当英国保守党人同苏联断绝了外交和贸易关系的时候，敌对阶级的代理人托洛茨基、季诺维也夫分子也配合着国内外敌人的进攻，加紧在党内进行破坏。
    反对派和党之间的意见分歧当时已经转变成了纲领上的分歧。反对派否认在苏联有建成社会主义的可能性，否认苏联无产阶级专政的存在，否认无产阶级同基本农民群众联盟的必要，否认革命的社会主义性质。斯大林指出，托洛茨基分子是企图以托洛茨基主义代替列宁主义，他们已经完全同列宁主义决裂而走上向国内和国际资产阶级投降的道路。斯大林揭露了托洛茨基匪帮的反党反苏的叛逆本质，指出了他们已经蜕化为孟什维主义集团的事实，从思想上彻底粉碎了托洛茨基主义，并向党提出了从组织上完全击溃和消灭托洛茨基、季诺维也夫反党反苏维埃联盟的任务。代表大会根据斯大林的报告宣布，参加托洛茨基反对派和宣传其观点的行为，是和布尔什维克党党籍根本不相容的。代表大会批准了中央委员会和中央监察委员会联席会议关于开除托洛茨基和季诺维也夫党籍的决议，并把托洛茨基、季诺维也夫联盟中的骨干分子开除出党。
    同时，为了增强党的团结，斯大林在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上的报告中着重指出了发扬党内民主，开展革命的批评和自我批评的重要性。斯大林揭露了反对派在“民主”的幌子下进行分裂活动的企图，阐明了党内民主的实质。他说，我们所需要的民主，决不是“破坏绝大多数人的意志的区区少数人的民主”，而是这样的民主，即：党员群众有解决我们建设方面的各种问题的自由；提高党员群众的积极性并吸引他们来参加党的领导；发挥他们在党内的主人翁的感觉。
    本卷所载斯大林有关和反对派斗争的论著，在粉碎帝国主义走狗托洛茨基、季诺维也夫分子的斗争中，在动员一切力量建设世界上第一个社会主义国家的事业中，起了巨大的作用。斯大林的这些著作对于我们也是有极大的现实意义的。我国正处在过渡时期，在过渡时期中包含着极复杂极尖锐的阶级斗争。今天帝国主义包围仍然存在，而国内那些已被消灭的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级决不会没有反抗，而且随着我们事业的不断胜利和我们力量的不断增强，阶级敌人一定会更加采用“从内部攻取堡垒”、破坏党的统一和团结的办法来向党进攻。因此，我们必须很好地领会斯大林关于增强党的统一和团结的指示，根据中共七届四中全会文件的精神，提高革命警惕性，为维护党的团结，保证社会主义建设的胜利而奋斗。
    编入本卷的“十月革命的国际性质”、“和外国工人代表团的谈话”、“国际形势和保卫苏联”等著作，阐明了伟大十月社会主义革命的世界历史意义，指出了保卫世界革命运动基地——苏联的必要性。
    斯大林驳斥了托洛茨基、季诺维也夫关于俄国革命的“民族狭隘性”的谬论。斯大林在“十月革命的国际性质”这篇经典性的论文中，指明了十月革命对世界无产阶级革命的伟大意义。斯大林首先指明，十月革命所以是国际性的、世界性的革命，是因为它是全人类历史中从资本主义旧世界到社会主义新世界的根本转变。十月革命和过去历次革命不同，它的目的是要消灭人剥削人的制度，推翻所有一切剥削集团。十月革命开辟了帝国主义国家中无产阶级革命的新时代。它在一个最大的资本主义国家中推翻了帝国主义资产阶级，建立了无产阶级专政，这样就为全世界无产者树立了解放斗争的榜样。十月革命开辟了殖民地人民革命的新时代。十月革命的胜利向全世界一切被压迫民族指出了解放的道路，对殖民地人民的革命运动发生了重大的影响。中国人民革命的胜利就是和十月革命的胜利分不开的。中国革命的伟大胜利给了世界资本主义体系以新的极严重的打击，把殖民地民族解放运动推上更高的阶段。目前殖民地民族解放运动正在不断高涨。十月革命以来的历史进程日益明显地证实斯大林所指出的真理：“安然剥削和压迫殖民地和附属国的时代已经过去了。”
    斯大林指出，十月革命既然把革命种子散播到帝国主义的中心和后方，削弱了帝国主义在“宗主国”的统治，动摇了帝国主义在殖民地的统治，因而也就使整个世界资本主义本身的生存发生了问题。这就是说，十月革命使世界资本主义受了一个永远医治不好的致命伤，引起了资本主义体系的总危机。十月革命所产生的第一个无产阶级专政国家苏联，成了全世界无产阶级和被压迫国家人民群众革命运动的强大的公开的基地和中心。因此，对待社会主义国家苏联的态度，就成了判定每个人、每个阶级、每个政党是进步还是反动的标准。斯大林指出：“谁不全心全意地公开支持世界上第一个无产阶级专政……谁就不能自命为马克思主义者。”
    此外，“斯大林全集”第十卷中其余各篇，都是针对相应的问题发挥了列宁主义的重要原理，对我们目前的工作有其重大指导意义。我们必须好好学习。
    斯大林始终是中国人民解放事业的鼓舞者。在编入本卷的“国际形势和保卫苏联”的报告中和在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上的报告中，斯大林驳斥了托洛茨基、季诺维也夫在中国革命问题上的投降主义和冒险主义谬论，分析了当时中国革命的形势，指出了中国革命的新高潮和胜利必将到来。斯大林对中国革命的这种分析鼓舞了中国人民争取革命胜利的信心。
