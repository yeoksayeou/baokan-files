The Pingjiang County Committee Should Conduct a Serious Self-Criticism
To the Editor:

    The former Propaganda Minister (and County Committee Member) of the Pingjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province, Jia Buyun, has been transferred away from Hunan for two years now, but the residents of Changshou Town in Pingjiang—where the Third District Office is located—have not stopped cursing Jia Buyun. They angrily ask the question: Why is it that this rampant and lawless bully, after being constantly exposed and reported by the masses, has been able to escape the punishment of Party discipline and state law, and leave Pingjiang in great style with a body full of sins?

    Jia Buyun served as the Party Secretary of the Third District after arriving in Pingjiang in July 1949. After being transferred to the post of County Committee Propaganda Minister, he continued to be responsible for the work of the Third District. In the course of more than two years, he used his power as a leading Party cadre to commit a series of outrageous, shameless, and lawless acts, raping as many as nineteen women. When he was transferred away from Pingjiang County, he openly deceived a woman named Zhong and took her away with him.

    From some of the methods used by Jia Buyun with this woman who was taken away, we can see how serious his criminal activities had become. This woman was twenty years old and had already been engaged to a stonemason in the town. Jia Buyun used deceptive means to rape this woman. When the woman's mother expressed her dissatisfaction to the street cadres, he detained her and forced her to write a statement guaranteeing that she would "stop talking nonsense." Then, he falsely accused the woman's fiancé of being a secret agent, sent people to detain him, and personally interrogated him. When Jia Buyun was about to be transferred and leave Pingjiang, he deceived the organization by saying that the woman was the nanny of his child. In this way, he deceived and took away this young woman.

    Jia Buyun's crimes do not stop there. In order to have an affair with the wife of a puppet 保长 (village head during the Japanese occupation), he shielded this puppet 保长, who was hated by the local people. In order to have an illicit relationship with a married woman, he disregarded the opposition of district and township cadres and sent her to the non-Party activists training class he presided over in the county. And when he got tired of a woman he had been playing with and wanted to get rid of her, he put on a stern face and demanded repayment of living expenses, and forbade her from going back to work in Pingjiang County, attempting to conceal his crimes for a long time... The above facts fully prove that Jia Buyun has completely degenerated and fallen to the point of losing all human qualities.

    Jia Buyun retaliated against those who exposed his crimes by suppressing them and even plotting against them. For example, retired cadre Zhang Yulou had participated in the Second Revolutionary Civil War and retired home as a tailor after being wounded and disabled. Because he had reported Jia Buyun's illegal activities to the leading organs several times, Jia Buyun hated him to the core. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, he seized upon some minor faults of Zhang Yulou, and painstakingly fabricated several charges to have him sentenced to death. At that time, Hu Neng, a cadre of the County People's Court working in the Third District, disagreed. Jia Buyun then scolded Hu Neng for "harboring counter-revolutionaries" and forced him to stamp the material and report it to a higher level.

    What is even more intolerable is that the Pingjiang County Committee actually adopted an attitude of appeasement and accommodation towards such a degenerate and transformed element who violated Party discipline and state law. The local masses had long exposed Jia Buyun's crimes, but the County Committee had never investigated and dealt with them. Not long ago, the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, based on reports from the masses, joined with the County and District Party Committees to organize an investigation team to conduct an inspection in the area. It was proven that Jia Buyun's crimes were true. When the Hunan Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection decided to expel Jia Buyun from the Party and suggested that the judicial organs punish him according to law, the Pingjiang County Committee still showed a complete lack of principles in dealing with this scoundrel. Although the County Committee admitted that the investigation materials were basically true, it put forward the preliminary opinion that "if the person is determined to correct himself, he should be given a punishment of being placed on probation within the Party," as if such a criminal could still be allowed to continue to tarnish the glorious title of Communist Party member. Why is the Pingjiang County Committee so "benevolent and righteous" towards such a heinous criminal, while turning a blind eye to the damage done to the interests of the Party and the people? The Pingjiang County Committee has a responsibility to conduct a review of this issue.

### 平江县委应当进行严肃的检查

    平江县委应当进行严肃的检查编辑同志：
    原任中共湖南省平江县委宣传部长（县委委员）贾步云调离湖南已经有两年了，但是平江长寿镇——三区区公所所在地的居民们对贾步云的咒骂一直没有停止。他们愤慨地发出这样的疑问：为什么这个横行不法的恶霸，经过群众的不断揭发和检举，竟然能够不受党纪国法的制裁，带着一身罪恶大模大样地离开了平江。
    贾步云在一九四九年七月南下后就在平江三区当区委书记，调任县委宣传部长后仍然分工掌握三区的工作。在两年多中，他利用党的领导干部的职权，曾干下了一连串荒淫无耻、横行不法的勾当，先后被奸污的妇女竟达十九人；在调离平江县时，还公然骗走了一个姓钟的妇女。
    从贾步云对这个被带走的妇女所施的一些手段中，就可以看出他的犯罪勾当已经到了何等严重的地步。这个妇女二十岁，已经和镇上一个石匠订了婚。贾步云用欺骗手段奸污了这个妇女，女方的母亲向街道干部反映不满情绪，就被他扣押起来，逼她写下字据，保证“不再乱讲”。接着，他诬说女方的未婚夫有特务嫌疑，派人把他扣押起来，亲自审讯。在贾步云要调动工作离开平江时，欺骗组织说女方是他的孩子的褓姆。就这样把这个年轻的妇女骗走了。
    贾步云的罪恶行为还不止这一些：他为了搞一个伪保长的妻子，就包庇了这个为当地群众所痛恨的伪保长。他为了和一个有夫之妇搞不正当的关系，就不顾区、乡干部的反对把她送到县里他所主持的非党积极分子训练班受训，而当他在甩掉一个被他玩厌了的妇女时，就板起面孔向人家算回生活费用，并禁止她回到平江县城去做工，企图长期隐瞒他的罪行……。以上这些事实就充分证明贾步云已经完全蜕化变质，堕落到了没有人的气味了。
    贾步云对于揭发他罪行的人，采用打击压制甚至阴谋陷害的做法来报复。例如，退职干部张玉楼，曾经参加过第二次国内革命战争，负伤残废后退休回家当裁缝。因为他曾几次向领导机关检举贾步云的非法行为，贾步云就恨他入骨，在镇压反革命运动中抓住他的一些小毛病，又处心积虑地捏造了几条罪状，要把他判处死刑。当时县人民法院在三区工作的干部胡能不同意，贾步云就骂胡能“包庇反革命”，强令把材料盖章上报。
    令人更加不能容忍的是，平江县委居然对这样违反党纪国法的蜕化变质分子采取了姑息迁就的态度。当地群众对贾步云的罪行早有揭发，但是县委一直没有检查处理。不久以前，省委纪律检查委员会根据群众揭发，会同县、区党委组织调查组到当地进行检查，证明贾步云的罪行属实，湖南省委纪律检查委员会决定把贾步云开除出党，并建议司法机关依法惩处时，平江县委对于这恶棍的处理上仍然表现得毫无原则。县委虽然承认调查材料基本属实，却提出了“如果本人决心改正，给以留党察看处分”的初步意见，似乎这样的罪犯，还可以让他继续玷污共产党员的光荣称号。为什么平江县委对于这样恶劣的罪犯是那末“仁至义尽”，而对于党和人民的利益受到损害却熟视无睹呢？平江县委有责任对这个问题进行一次检查。  周钧
