Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 17th: According to TASS, the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic unanimously adopted the "Declaration of the Polish People's Republic on Foreign Policy" at its afternoon session on March 16th.

The declaration stated: The Parliament of the Polish People's Republic believes that the current international situation makes it necessary for the Polish people to make comprehensive efforts to continue to strengthen the power of the Polish People's Republic, to cooperate more actively with the countries of the socialist peace camp and with all peace-loving forces in the world, in order to ease international tensions, thereby strengthening peace and ensuring the progress of our peaceful construction and the security of our country.

The declaration stated that feelings of solidarity link the Polish people with the people of other countries who selflessly fought to help the Allied countries win victory over the militarist Hitler's "Third Reich." The Polish people harbor particularly deep fraternal feelings and gratitude towards the Soviet people, who made the greatest sacrifices and demonstrated the greatest heroism in this struggle for liberation, thanks to whom our people were liberated. The Polish people also cherish close friendship with the heroic Chinese people, whose contribution to the struggle for freedom of all peoples in the Second World War greatly helped to ensure the victory of the forces of peace, not only in Asia but also in Europe, over the forces of aggression. Common ideological ties link the Polish people with all the people's democracies in their common struggle for peace and progress.

Our feelings for the French people are also unwavering. The Polish people are closely following the struggle of French patriots against the revival of German militarism and for the crushing of the fateful Paris Agreements. The Polish people assure the French people of their active support for this struggle.

The declaration stated that Poland opposes the revival of aggressive German militarism in any form, and it fully supports the plan for the reunification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis and the conclusion of a just peace treaty with it.

However, if the Paris Agreements, which are directed against the peaceful stability of European relations, are ratified, then Poland, in accordance with its decision expressed at the Moscow Conference of eight European countries, must, together with these countries, take new and appropriate steps to further strengthen the strength and unity of the great peace camp, establish a unified command of our armed forces to protect the security of our peoples, deter aggressive forces, and strengthen the peace-loving forces of the world.

The declaration continued by saying that the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic declares that the parliaments of all countries, which make decisions concerning the fate of all peoples in seeking ways to reach agreements and harmony between countries, will play a very important role. The Parliament of the Polish People's Republic expresses its full support for the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9th of this year.

The declaration also stated that the participation of representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in the Sixth Session of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic at the invitation of the Polish Parliament proves the unshakable friendship between the Polish people and the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, and embodies the common struggle and efforts of the two peoples to defend the peaceful future of the world and to defend the peaceful construction of our two countries.

The Parliament of the Polish People's Republic expresses the will and wishes of the peace-loving Polish people, and relying on their unity and strength, will continue to struggle for the development of friendly relations between Poland and other countries and for the consolidation of the security of our country.

The Parliament of the Polish People's Republic calls on the people of France, Germany, and other European countries to redouble their efforts to fight for peace, against the revival of German militarism, and against the expansion of American imperialism. The Parliament of the Polish People's Republic is convinced that the forces of peace are stronger than the forces of aggression, and that the joint efforts of the people of all countries will realize the victory of the great ideal of peaceful coexistence among all countries in the world.
