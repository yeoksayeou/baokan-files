In order to further improve rural work, the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guizhou Provincial People's Committee have decided to mobilize and organize more than 10,000 cadres from agencies above the district level (including Party, government, mass organizations, economic, and technical units) to go deep into the countryside to help with work. Currently, 120 cadres have been selected from provincial-level agencies to form a work team to go to various places and delve into key areas to inspect and assist with spring plowing and production work. Before going to the countryside, these cadres listened to a mobilization report by Shen Yunpu, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and underwent two days of study, clearly understanding the purpose and requirements of this trip to the countryside. Therefore, they greatly enhanced their confidence and determination to complete the task.
