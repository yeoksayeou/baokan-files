    Yan Pengfei Exercises to Enlist in the Army
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yi Xintian
    Yan Pengfei, an eligible young man from Hongqiao Township, Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, diligently trained his body for more than three months to realize his wish to enlist in the army, and was finally honorably approved to join the army.
    Yan Pengfei is the village militia captain and the leader of the production mutual aid team. Since the news of the state recruiting and replenishing soldiers came, he was very excited; but after thinking about it, he was worried that his physical condition would not meet the requirements. Therefore, every day when the rooster crowed for the first time and the east turned white, he got up and ran to the fields, ran to the neighboring village and back, and then chopped grass, fed cattle, and went to the fields, without affecting production time. On rainy mornings, he also did morning exercises at home. In the beginning, Yan Pengfei felt out of breath, leg pain, and stomach pain after running for about half a mile. He thought, "Forget it, I won't run anymore, why bother to suffer." But a few days later, Zheng Changlin, who lived next door to him, took leave from the People's Liberation Army to come home to visit his family. He introduced him to the situation in the army and encouraged him to enlist. From then on, thinking about the many things Zheng Changlin said, and seeing the large characters he wrote on the wall: "Exercise your body, prepare to respond to the call of the motherland," he often asked himself: The People's Liberation Army has such good health and still exercises every day. You can't stand running half a mile. How can you go to the army? So he ran as usual, and he didn't get tired even after running more than a mile and a half.
    For several months, Yan Pengfei has insisted on running, taking special care and concern for his body in every way. Every time he went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy things, he always stood on the scales to weigh himself. When he saw his weight constantly increasing, he was very happy and became more active in exercising his body. Now, his weight has increased from 107 pounds three months ago to 130 pounds, becoming a strong young man with a broad chest, thick arms, and firm muscles.
    While exercising his body, Yan Pengfei repeatedly wrote letters to the responsible cadres of the county and the Communist Youth League organization to express his determination and request that he be approved for military service. The letter said: "Serving in the army is the glorious duty of our youth. I am a member of the Communist Youth League and should defend the motherland." When the township started to register for enlistment, he was the first to register. The Yuyao County Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League called on all members of the Youth League and eligible young people in the county to learn from Yan Pengfei.
    Recently, Yan Pengfei passed the examination by the military service bureau and was qualified in all aspects. He has been approved to enlist in the army. His mother and sister made four pairs of new shoes for him, and his 84-year-old grandmother also wanted to see him off. When the reporter interviewed Yan Pengfei, he said excitedly: "I have been looking forward to serving in the army to defend the motherland for a long time, and today I finally got it!"

    严鹏飞锻炼身体应征入伍
    新华社记者  伊心恬
    浙江省余姚县虹桥乡适龄青年严鹏飞为实现自己应征服兵役的志愿，坚持苦炼身体三个多月，终于光荣地被批准入伍了。
    严鹏飞是村民兵队长和生产互助组长。自从国家征集补充兵员的消息传来后，他非常兴奋；但想来想去就耽心自己的身体不合格。因此，每天当鸡叫头遍、东方发白的时候，他便起床到野外跑步，跑到邻村转回来，再铡草、喂牛、下田，不影响生产时间。雨天的早晨，他也在家里做早操。开头几天，严鹏飞跑了里把路，就感到气喘、腿酸、肚子痛。他想：“算了，不跑了，何必自讨苦吃。”可是过了几天，他隔壁的郑长林从人民解放军部队里请假回来看家，对他介绍了部队中的情况，勉励他应征入伍。从此，他想着郑长林说的许多话，又看到自己写在墙壁上的大字：“锻炼身体、准备响应祖国号召。”便常常扪心自问：解放军身体那样好还要天天锻炼，你跑里把路就吃不消，到部队去怎么行？于是他又照样跑步了，而且一气跑三里多路也不累了。
    几个月来，严鹏飞一直坚持跑步，对身体处处都特别爱护和关心。他每次到供销合作社买东西的时候，总要站在磅秤上磅一磅体重，当他看到自己的体重不断增加时，不禁十分高兴，对身体的锻炼也更加积极了。现在，他的体重已由三个月前的一百零七斤增加到了一百三十斤，成为一个胸阔臂粗、肌肉结实的健壮青年了。
    严鹏飞在锻炼身体的时候，就三番五次地写信向县的负责干部和青年团组织表示决心，要求批准他服兵役。信上说：“服兵役是我们青年的光荣义务。我是青年团员，应该去保卫祖国。”当乡里开始报名应征时，他第一个报了名。中国新民主主义青年团余姚县委员会号召全县的青年团员和适龄青年向严鹏飞学习。
    最近，严鹏飞经过兵役局检查，各方面都合格，已批准他应征入伍。他母亲和姐姐为他赶做了四双新鞋，他八十四岁的老祖母也要去送行。当记者访问严鹏飞的时候，他兴奋地说：“我很早就盼着服兵役保卫祖国，今天可盼到了！”
