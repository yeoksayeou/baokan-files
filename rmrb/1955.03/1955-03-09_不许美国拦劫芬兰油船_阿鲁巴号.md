    No Allowing the US to Intercept the Finnish Oil Tanker "Aruba"
    The US State Department spokesman on March 4th threatened the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba", which is carrying goods from Europe to China, saying that the United States believes "this is a matter of serious concern." He based this on the United Nations' illegal resolution on imposing an embargo on China, attempting to prevent this oil tanker from coming to China.
    This is new evidence of the United States using various methods to antagonize and provoke the Chinese people.
    This is not the first time that the US government has openly come forward to obstruct trade, shipping, and economic exchanges between other countries and China. In February 1953, the United States used various unreasonable means to prevent the Finnish oil tanker "Wima" from carrying goods to China. In addition, the United States has consistently directed and assisted the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in intercepting merchant ships of various countries on the Chinese coast and on the high seas. According to incomplete statistics, from September 1949 to October 1954, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique carried out 111 instances of interception, robbery, shelling, or strafing against 67 merchant ships of various countries. Obviously, the US State Department's threat against the "Aruba" shows that the United States is attempting to repeat this tactic against this Finnish oil tanker and intercept it.
    The Chinese people resolutely oppose this sinful behavior of the United States, which obstructs normal trade relations between countries and interferes with the freedom of navigation on the high seas. If the United States dares to direct and assist the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in intercepting it, then it must bear full responsibility for this act of piracy.
    It must be pointed out that the so-called embargo imposed by the United States on China is part of the US plot to carry out aggression in the Far East and create tension. Sterlinger, a reporter for the "Christian Science Monitor," reported on February 15th on the US conspiracy to invade China, saying that "some senior American military thinkers believe that Communist China must not be allowed the time and opportunity to consolidate its position on the mainland and develop into a considerable, modern, and industrialized nation." It is very obvious that the United States is obstructing trade between various countries and China in an attempt to hinder China's economic development so that it can realize its dream of expanding aggression and subverting China.
    However, despite the US's empty-headed attempt to obstruct our country's economic development, its attempt has still failed. The fact that our country's national economy has rapidly recovered, developed, and continuously consolidated in recent years has vividly proven this point.
    In fact, the more direct purpose of the US embargo on China is to cause economic damage to those countries that have traditional trade relations with China, so that they cannot get rid of their economic dependence on the United States. Roland Berger, a director of the British International Trade Council, and Shozo Murata, chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, pointed out in a joint statement issued in Tokyo on March 1: "The continued embargo on exports to the Communist bloc restricts the export of major export commodities from the United Kingdom and Japan, thereby causing economic difficulties for the United Kingdom and Japan; on the other hand, the various countries targeted by the embargo are hardly affected economically."
    Even so, the British authorities are following the United States step by step on the issue of the embargo. Despite the fact that the British cargo ship "Guardian" is being shelled by Chiang's bandit warships directed by the United States, the British authorities followed the United States in threatening the Finnish oil tanker "Aruba" and announced that it would not provide the "Aruba" with facilities for refueling in Singapore or Hong Kong. This behavior of the British authorities can only make people think that the extent to which it cares about the interests of the US aggressive group far exceeds the extent to which it cares about the interests of the British people.
    The Finnish oil tanker "Aruba" has the free right to navigate on the high seas, and the United States must not be allowed to illegally obstruct it; the goods it carries are the property of the Chinese people, and the United States must not be allowed to plunder them.

### 不许美国拦劫芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”

    不许美国拦劫芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”
    美国国务院发言人在三月四日对正由欧洲载运货物前来中国的芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”恫吓说，美国认为“这是一件令人严重关切的事情”。他以联合国关于对中国实施禁运的非法决议为根据，企图不许这艘油船前来中国。
    这是美国用种种方法同中国人民为敌，向中国人民挑衅的新的证据。
    美国政府公开出面阻挠世界各国对中国的贸易航运和经济来往，这已经不是第一次。在一九五三年二月间，美国就曾经以各种蛮横无理的手段，不许芬兰的“维玛号”油船载运货物前来中国。除此之外，美国还一贯地指使和协助蒋介石卖国集团在中国沿海和公海上拦劫各国的商船。据不完全统计，从一九四九年九月到一九五四年十月，蒋介石卖国集团对六十七艘各国商船进行了一百十一次拦截、抢劫、炮击或扫射。显然，美国国务院对“阿鲁巴号”的恫吓表明：美国对这艘芬兰油船也企图如法炮制，加以拦劫。
    中国人民坚决反对美国这种妨碍各国之间的正常贸易关系和妨害公海航行自由的罪恶行为。如果美国竟然指使和协助蒋介石卖国集团加以拦劫，那么它必须对这种海盗行为承担全部责任。
    必须指出，美国对中国实施所谓禁运，是美国在远东进行侵略、制造紧张局势的阴谋的一部分。美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者斯特林格在二月十五日报道美国侵略中国的阴谋时说，“某些美国高级军事思想家认为，绝对不能让共产党中国有时间和机会来巩固它在大陆上的地位，并发展成为一个不可轻视的、现代化的和工业化的国家。”十分明显，美国阻挠世界各国对中国的贸易是企图阻挠中国的经济发展以便它实现扩大侵略，颠覆中国的迷梦。
    但是，尽管美国?空心思想阻挠我国经济发展，它的企图却还是落了空。几年来我国国民经济迅速的恢复发展和不断巩固的事实，就已经生动地证明了这一点。
    其实，美国对中国实施禁运，其更直接的目的是要使那些和中国有传统的贸易关系的国家受到经济上的损害，使它们不能摆脱对美国的经济上的依赖。英国国际贸易理事会理事罗兰·柏格和日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏三月一日在东京发表的联合声明中就指出：“对共产党阵营继续实行出口禁运，使日英两国的主要出口商品的出口受到限制，从而使日英两国在经济方面遭到困难；而在另一方面，成为禁运对象的各个国家在经济上几乎是丝毫没有受到影响。”
    虽然如此，英国当局却在禁运的问题上亦步亦趋地追随美国。尽管英国货船“卫士卫号”正在遭受美国指使的蒋贼军舰的炮轰，英国当局却紧跟在美国对芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”进行恫吓之后，宣布将不予“阿鲁巴号”在新加坡或香港以加煤的方便。英国当局这种行为只能使人认为它关心美国侵略集团的利益的程度，大大超过它关心英国人民的利益。
    芬兰油船“阿鲁巴号”有在公海航行的自由权利，决不容许美国加以非法阻挠；它所载运的货物是中国人民的财产，决不容许美国加以劫夺。
