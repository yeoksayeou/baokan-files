The topics of the scientific discussion forum's paper reports include the following aspects: conclusions of creative specialized research; papers criticizing bourgeois academic thought from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism; reviews and summaries of certain major issues in science or national economic construction; and experiences related to carrying out scientific research work and cultivating new forces.
