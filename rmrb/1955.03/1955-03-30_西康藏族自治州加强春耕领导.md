The People's Governments at all levels of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are actively strengthening the organizational leadership of spring plowing production. Recently, the counties have dispatched work teams or working groups totaling more than 1,200 people to go deep into villages and towns to lead spring plowing production. The large contingent of forty agricultural technology promotion stations, after being reorganized, has also gone down to the countryside, focusing on promoting walking plows, improved seeds, and guiding the improvement of cultivation techniques. In addition, from last winter to this spring, the counties have trained more than 2,500 village and township cadres and peasant activists, educating them on agricultural production policies and agricultural technologies.
