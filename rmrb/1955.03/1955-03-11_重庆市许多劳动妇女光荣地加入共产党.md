Many outstanding working women in Chongqing gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Currently, there are 5,759 female party members in Chongqing.

In recent years, the female party members developed throughout the city are mostly activists who have emerged in production and various tasks. Many of them are industrial and agricultural labor models, advanced producers, and model workers. Qu Xiu, a national textile industry labor model and female worker at the joint state-private Shashi Yarn Factory, who was accepted as a Communist Party member, worked with her group of female workers to create a doffing method that shortened the machine shutdown time and cleaning time for doffing. He Xiuying, a roving frame operator with 24 years of experience, creatively improved the roving operation method. After it was推广 (promoted) at the Yuxin Textile Factory in 1953, it created an additional 72,487 yuan (new currency) of wealth for the country. Recently, she has further improved her working methods and reduced the rate of cotton waste. Wang Chengying, a rural woman who gloriously joined the Communist Party from being a model member of the Communist Youth League, is now the vice chairman of the Dayan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Sixth District. Recently, she and the cooperative members are carrying out preparations for spring plowing and production, and have accumulated more than 1.25 million catties of fertilizer. Lü Shaoyi, director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Chongqing First People's Hospital, actively learns from the advanced experience of Soviet medicine. Many women with difficult labor have safely given birth under her care, and both mothers and children are healthy. After these advanced women joined the Party, they engaged in production and work with even more positive and selfless spirit. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆市许多劳动妇女光荣地加入共产党
    重庆市许多优秀的劳动妇女光荣地加入了中国共产党。目前重庆市共有女党员五千七百五十九人。
    几年来，全市发展的女党员大都是在生产和各项工作中涌现出来的积极分子。她们中间有很多是工业和农业劳动模范、先进生产者和模范工作者。被接受为共产党员的全国纺织工业劳动模范、公私合营沙市纱厂的女工屈秀和全组女工共同研究，创造了落纱工作法，缩短了落纱的关车时间和做清洁工作的时间。有了二十四年工龄的细纱值车工何秀英，创造性地改进了粗纱操作法，一九五三年在她所在的渝新纺织厂推广后，全厂为国家多创造了七万二千四百八十七元（新币）的财富。最近她又改进了工作方法，减少了白花率。由一个模范青年团员光荣加入共产党的农妇王成英，现在是六区大堰农业生产合作社的副社长，最近她正和全社社员展开了春耕生产准备工作，已积肥一百二十五万多斤。重庆市第一人民医院妇产科主任医师吕少仪，积极学习苏联医学的先进经验，经她接生的许多难产产妇都平安生产，并且使得母子们都很健康。这些先进妇女入党后，更加以积极忘我的精神从事生产和工作。（新华社）
