    Let Red Dan Mountain Be Covered with Green Trees
    By our reporter Chen Yongjin
    In the winter without snow, the Yi Meng mountains covered in yellow sand appear even more withered. After traversing countless dry mountains like these, several towering green peaks suddenly appeared before us. From afar, we could clearly see the dense small trees on the mountain. I asked the people walking by: What are the names of these high mountains? People only said, there are so many mountains in the Yi Meng mountain area, who can name them all! We only know that the tallest one is Red Dan Mountain.
    My destination was Gaojialouzi Village in the northwest of YiShui County, but I didn't know exactly which mountain valley Gaojialouzi Village was in. Following the small path people told me about, I climbed into the mountains. In the late afternoon, we crossed another loess mountain, and climbing further up, there were large mountains covered with dense small horsetail pines. At the top of the mountain, two children were herding a large flock of sheep, singing loudly. I asked them where Gaojialouzi was, and he pointed with his whip and said:
      "Just over this Red Dan Mountain."
      "Where is the forestry farm?"
      "The forestry farm is on the east side of the village. Zhang Zongwen has gone to the market!"
    We walked through this street-less Gaojialouzi mountain village and came to a remote little place on the east side of the village. On a piece of land in front of the gate were dense poplar saplings, and there were also saplings in the yard. Zhang Zongwen was indeed not at home. There were several people in the yard carrying sacks, looking like they had come to deliver tree seeds. Those people just said, "You're looking for Zhang Zongwen? We are also looking for Zhang Zongwen." After waiting a short while, a yellowish, thin old man came in, wearing a patched blue uniform, carrying a small bamboo basket, and holding a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth. People in the house and yard greeted him noisily. His small house suddenly became lively.
    After Zhang Zongwen finished dealing with the matters of sending pine seeds and planning winter afforestation, he lit some pine branches, warmed himself by the fire, and began to talk to me.
    Zhang Zongwen remembers it so clearly. He said that he came to Gaojialouzi on June 2, 1950. Before he came here, the county magistrate had talked to him and said: Old Zhang, look how dry our Yi Meng mountains are, you can hardly see a tree. Now we are going to set up a forestry farm in the Gaojialouzi area and plant trees on all those big mountains, so that we can conserve water and soil, and the masses will also have firewood to burn! The county magistrate, afraid that Old Zhang would not want to go, specially pointed out: Why are we asking you to go? Because you are a party member who can connect with the masses; besides, you are also a bit older and can work alone in one place. Zhang Zongwen replied: I obey the needs of the work, I will go wherever I am needed.
    He came to the district, and the comrades in the district also welcomed him. But forestry work was a new job, and the district didn't know what to do, and Zhang Zongwen didn't know what to do either. Zhang Zongwen thought, whether there's a way or not, you have to figure one out, in any case, planting trees on these big mountains will prevent wind and flood disasters. There are mountain after mountain, who knows how big an area it is? He first decided to measure all these mountains to see how big these loess mountains and stone mountains were, so that he could know how many trees to plant, and how many years it would take to change the dry appearance of these mountains. He went out early in the morning with a few pancakes and a small hoe, and came back at night. Whenever he came to a mountain, he would always dig to see how thick the soil was, what kind of soil it was, and how big that area was; he asked the people working on the mountain and the people herding sheep, inquiring about the historical situation of the mountain and the reasons for the people's poverty. Zhang Zongwen couldn't write, so every night he asked a clerk from the district's cooperative to write down the materials for him.
    In order to better connect with the masses, Old Zhang moved his small luggage roll to Gaojialouzi Village on the east side of Red Dan Mountain. The Gaojialouzi Village Party Branch held a meeting that day to welcome him. From then on, he and the party members and masses of Gaojialouzi Village became familiar with each other day by day.
      Zhang Zongwen was determined to complete the task assigned to him by the higher authorities. He was obsessed with it. During the day, he measured the barren mountains, and at night he went to Gaojialouzi Village to publicize to the masses. He often gave the masses a detailed account: One mu of land can plant five hundred horsetail pines, and in the second year it can develop five branches, in the third year it will develop twenty-five branches, in the fourth year... in the fifth year you can cut one thousand five hundred jin of firewood. Firewood is quite expensive in this area, usually costing 15,000 old yuan per hundred jin. Even this cheapest thing will earn him two or three hundred jin of grain every year after five years. But this loess ridge land, even with a good harvest, only yields a hundred jin or so per mu. If you plant apple and walnut trees, when they are ripe, they will pelt your head with bumps. The people laughed and laughed as they listened. When Old Zhang saw those people digging grass roots and planting buckwheat on the barren mountains, he said, "If you dig barren mountains, and then there is a heavy rain, the loess will be washed away, and the masses outside the mountains by the river will suffer even more, turning good land into sandy beaches. We people in the mountainous areas must rely on the mountains to nourish the mountains! " The masses also felt that what Old Zhang said was right, if Red Dan Mountain and other large yellow mountains were not afforested, they would really be exhausted. More and more people came to chat with Zhang Zongwen, and Zhang Zongwen's small house gradually became lively.
      Twenty days later, Zhang Zongwen measured more than 30,000 mu of barren mountain land, and that clerk also recorded a thick book of materials for him. Whenever Old Zhang was tired from measuring the barren mountains, he would sit on a stone, smoking a cigarette and looking at the old barren mountains one after another. How much area can one person occupy in these big mountains? Hardship and difficulty threatened him, but the county magistrate's words encouraged him, that in a few years the masses here would have income, and if all these big barren mountains were afforested, how much wealth would it add to the country! As long as party members lead the masses to follow the path pointed out by the party, there is nothing that cannot be done.
    The rainy summer arrived. Zhang Zongwen began to implement his rainy season afforestation plan. As soon as it rained, he would lead the activists to Red Dan Mountain to plant trees. The masses were quite enthusiastic to see party members and cadres planting trees on Red Dan Mountain; but they were also afraid that they would not benefit if they planted the trees themselves. Some people asked Zhang Zongwen if the trees belonged to them after they were planted. Zhang Zongwen said, I guarantee that whoever plants them owns them, but the cost of the saplings will have to be repaid to the public in the future. The people of Gaojialouzi moved into action. This rainy season, they planted almost all of Red Dan Mountain, plus a total of more than 800,000 trees in the mountains near Red Dan Mountain, and most of them survived. At this time, Zhang Zongwen publicized to this village and that village, saying, wouldn't it be a bigger income if we planted walnut trees, chestnut trees, and apple trees on these mountains? At that time, our mountains will be misty, with green mountains and red fruits, how wonderful. If we build dams in the mountain gullies and raise chickens, ducks, cattle, and sheep in our mountains, and we have planted so many oak trees, wouldn't that be enough to feed silkworms? At that time, comrades, you won't be wearing such ragged clothes. You will wear sheepskin jackets in winter and silk jackets in summer, and you will have enough eggs and duck eggs to eat! The masses listened, laughing and thinking about the future of these loess mountains. At this time, Zhang Zongwen's heart was as happy as if it had blossomed. He said: In ten to eight years, we must turn the sandy land into "gold digging boards."
      Zhang Zongwen has been in Gaojialouzi Village, next to Red Dan Mountain, for three months. In these three months, he has suffered severe difficulties in his life. The county finance section said that the forestry department was a new department, and how to supply it had not yet been stipulated. At this time, Zhang Zongwen had to take pancakes from his home to eat. His home was eighteen or nine miles away from Red Dan Mountain, and Zhang Zongwen had no time to go home, so he asked his wife to bake the pancakes and send them to Shantuan Market, and then ask people going to the market to bring them back to Gaojialouzi. Once he went home, and his wife said:
    "Your revolution is so revolutionary that you can't even get food! What will you do when you get older in a few years!"
    "Our supply hasn't been stipulated yet, and we will pay you back when we receive the allowance!"
    He and his wife both laughed. In these three months, Zhang Zongwen relied entirely on his family to send pancakes and pickles to live on. When Zhang Zongwen's family couldn't supply enough, the people of Gaojialouzi Village often pulled him to their homes to have a meal.
    The chief of the construction section of the county came to check his work, and seeing him eating cold water-soaked pancakes, asked him: "Are you just eating this!"
    "Isn't it," Zhang Zongwen smiled as he ate.
    In fact, Old Zhang didn't eat meals at fixed times. Whenever he was hungry, he would soak a pancake to eat. He ran around on the mountain all day, and at night he had to work with the masses to draw up a plan for closing the mountains for afforestation. In the first year, Zhang Zongwen mobilized the masses of eight villages to carry out afforestation. He personally distributed 840,000 saplings to the masses in the village, and then watched the masses plant the trees, and those small trees grew up on this stone ridge with a bit of loess.
    In the spring of the second year, the work of afforestation was brought up to the district committee for discussion. During the afforestation, all the cadres in the district took action, and more than 800 jin of horsetail pine seeds alone were sown.
    By 1952, those horsetail pines were more than a foot high, and the shade of the trees was as big as a copper basin. Red Dan Mountain was green, and the nearby mountains were also green. At this time, the people of the village and Zhang Zongwen ran to the mountain even more frequently. When it rained, Zhang Zongwen would wear a raincoat and squat by the small mountain gullies to watch. He watched as the water flowing down from the mountain was no longer muddy. The Baisha River flowing through the center of Gaojialouzi Village was also deepened by the clear water. The danger of houses being washed away by water no longer existed.
    The second morning after I came to Red Dan Mountain, I went to Red Dan Mountain with Zhang Zongwen to see those small horsetail pines. Zhang Zongwen said:
    "There are many kinds of trees on this Red Dan Mountain, and we will plant more of this kind of tree in the future. You will know when we go to the mountain to take a look!"
    Old Zhang first led me to the nursery on the east side of the village. The leaves of the small horsetail pine seedlings were a bit red from the frost. I asked Zhang Zongwen:
    "How many horsetail pines are there!"
    Zhang Zongwen hesitated for a while and said:
    "That can't be said, there must be several million in Gaojialouzi Village alone!"
      To the west of a small road, there was a large area of small seedlings that had already lost their leaves. Zhang Zongwen said that they were cotton locusts. This tree species is very good. In this mountainous area where fertilizer is scarce, three hundred jin of its leaves can be worth a hundred jin of soybean cake. If a family plants a few mu of this tree, the fertilizer problem will be solved.
    Old Zhang wanted me to see all the tree species on this mountain. We climbed along the small ditch to Red Dan Mountain. He was a little out of breath, but he still kept climbing. Every time he saw a kind of tree, he always gave me a lecture. He said that the dry leaves were chestnut trees. That large area is apple trees. He touched those one or two foot high frozen red small tree branches more than once, saying that they were tallow trees. Fifteen years later, each tree can bear a hundred jin of seeds. There is a layer of wax on the skin of this seed. In addition to producing wax, it can also produce twenty-five jin of green oil, which is a good oil for wiping machines. The hemp ginseng cake can also be used in the fields to kill insects. This spring, 80,000 trees were planted on these mountains, and 70% of them survived.
    To see all the small trees planted by Zhang Zongwen leading the masses is not a matter of a day or two. The trees covering the area of 40,000 to 50,000 mu are all on those big mountains. Just climbing this Red Dan Mountain will take half a day. We have already climbed halfway up Red Dan Mountain. The old man Zhang Zongwen looked really tired, but he still climbed up, looking here and there. He suddenly bent down and said to me:
      "This is the eucommia tree. In more than ten years, it can produce rubber, which is the rubber used to make rubber shoes and car tires. Planting this kind of tree has a great effect on the country's industrialization. We have cultivated more than 8,000 saplings." He walked to another hillside, and Old Zhang touched a foot-high small branch and asked me:
      "What kind of tree do you think this is!"
      I shook my head to indicate that I didn't know. Old Zhang excitedly said: "This is the privet tree. This tree is very interesting! There is a kind of small insect that specializes in eating its leaves. It eats and excretes, covering the branches with white flowers, and then the branches are cut down and boiled into wax. This wax is the wax used to make waxed paper."
    Old Zhang said this and that, and then asked me in return: "Where do you think these tree species came from? Alas, it's far away! These tree species were all brought from Anhui. In the past two years, I have been thinking about planting trees with greater uses. I want to move the tree species from the south to the north. You know, the camphor trees and Fujian pines in my yard covered with grass haven't been frozen to death!"
    In order to turn the sandy land into "gold digging boards," Zhang Zongwen, who is over fifty years old, runs here and there, and he manages many mountains. People from dozens or hundreds of miles away come here to learn from his experience.
    For the sake of his work, he is more than ten miles away from home, but he doesn't go home for half a year. Not long ago, he fell ill. His wife came to see him with her children, and the people of Gaojialouzi went to see his wife and greet her. This one said that Old Zhang had improved our mountains, and that one said that we were able to plant trees here thanks to Comrade Old Zhang leading us, and that we also have firewood to burn here.
    Zhang Zongwen's wife in Gaojialouzi Village constantly led the children to the edge of the village to see the majestic Red Dan Mountain and the surrounding mountains, saying to herself: The mountains have changed. She said to Zhang Zongwen:
    "In the past few years, you have done a good job here! Do it well, and we will plant trees on the mountains in our area, and there will be no more floods or droughts."
    On the third morning to Red Dan Mountain, Old Zhang led me to the middle of Red Dan Mountain again to take a look.
    Not far after we left the village, Old Zhang stopped by a small river. He looked at the gurgling water for a long, long time before saying:
    "In the past, there were no trees on this Red Dan Mountain. When it rained, it would flow muddy water for one day and clear water for two days, and that was it. Look, now the clear water is flowing continuously! It has been like this for two years, and the water flows like this even when it is dry."

    让红丹山绿树成荫
    本报记者　陈勇进
    在没有落雪的冬天，那为黄沙覆盖着的沂蒙山显得更加枯黄。也不知翻过多少这样干枯的大山，在我们的面前突然出现几个高耸入云的翠绿的山峰。老远就可清楚地看到那山上的稠密的小树，我问走路的人们：这几架高山叫什么名字？人们只说，沂蒙山区有这样多的山，谁能都叫上名字来呀！只知道那个高的是红丹山。
    我的目的地，是到沂水县西北的高家楼子村，我可不知道那高家楼子村到底在那个山窝里。沿着人们告诉我的小路往山里面爬。下半晌，我们又翻过了一架黄土山，再往上爬就是长满密密层层的小马尾松的大山了。山顶上有两个小孩赶着一大群羊，还亮着嗓子唱歌。我问他高家楼子在那里，他用鞭子一指说：
      “翻过这座红丹山就是。”
      “林场在那里？”
      “林场就在村东面，张宗文到集上去啦！”
    我们走过了这没有街道的高家楼子山村，来到村东最偏僻的一个小地方，那大门前面的一片土地上，是稠密密的白杨树秧，进到院里也是些树秧。张宗文果然没在家，院子里有几个人背着口袋，看样儿是来送树种子的。那些人们只是说，你找张宗文？我们也是找张宗文的。等了没大会，一个黄巴巴的干瘦老头进来了，他穿着一身有补绽的蓝制服，提着小竹篮，嘴里噙着旱烟袋。屋子里院子里的人乱给他打招呼。他的小屋里顿时热闹起来。
    张宗文办完了那些送松种子、计划冬季造林的事情后，就点着松枝，一面烤火一面和我谈起来。
    张宗文记得多清楚呀，他说他是一九五○年六月二日来到这高家楼子的。他来这里以前，县长曾找他谈话说：老张，你看咱这沂蒙山有多么干旱呀，连棵树都很少看见，现在咱们要在高家楼子那个区成立个林场，把那大山都栽上树，就能保持水土，群众也有烧的啦！县长恐怕老张不愿去，还特别提出：为啥叫你去呢？因为你是党员能联系群众；再说你的年纪也大一点，能单独地在那一个地方工作。张宗文回答道：我服从工作需要，哪儿用着我就到哪儿去。
    他来到区里，区里的同志也很欢迎。可是林业工作是个新工作，区里不知道怎么办，张宗文也不知道怎么办。张宗文想，没办法也得想办法，反正把这些大山都种上树就免了风灾和水灾啦。这山一架又一架，谁知道有多大个面积呢？他首先确定把这大山都步量过来，看看这黄土山，石头山到底有多大，然后才能知道栽多少树。知道多少年才能改变这大山的干枯样。他早晨带着几张煎饼扛着小镢头出去，晚上回来。每到一座山，总要扒扒那里有多厚土，是什么土，那块地方有多大；他问那山上做活的人、放羊的人，向他们打听这山上的历史情况，人民穷困的原因。张宗文不会写字，他每天晚上请区里的一个区联社文书给他把材料记下来。
    老张为了更好地接近群众，就把自己那个小行李卷搬到红丹山东面的高家楼子村来。高家楼子村的党支部当天开了个会欢迎他。从此，他和高家楼子村的党员群众就一天天地熟悉起来了。
      张宗文一心想完成上级交给他的任务，他像发了迷一样，白天步量荒山，夜里就去高家楼子村向群众宣传。他常常给群众算细账：一亩地能栽五百棵马尾松，第二年它就能发五个叉，第三年就发二十五个叉，第四年……第五年就可割一千五百斤柴。这带的柴挺贵，平常也得旧币一万五千元一百斤。就是这最不值钱的东西，五年后每年收入也要换他二、三百斤粮食。可是这黄土岗子地，一亩地收好了也就是百十来斤。如果种上苹果核桃，到熟的时候，就会砸得你们满头疙瘩。人们听得嘿嘿地笑着。老张见了那些在荒山上刨草根种荞麦的人们就说，你们刨荒山，再一下大雨，就把这黄土冲走了，山外河边的群众更遭殃，把好地变成了黄沙滩。我们山区的群众得靠山养山才行哩！群众也觉得老张说的对，红丹山和别的这些大黄山，再不造林，就真的要山穷水尽了。找张宗文闲扯的人多了，张宗文的小屋里慢慢地热闹了起来。
      二十天后，张宗文步量了三万多亩荒山地，那 个文书也为他记了一本厚厚的材料。每当老张步量荒山疲倦的时候，他就坐在石头上，一面吸着烟，一面瞭望那一架又一架的老荒山。一个人在这些大山上能占多大一点面积呀，艰苦和困难威胁着他，可是县长的话却在鼓舞着他，几年后这里的群众就有了收入，把这大荒山都造起了林来，又为国家增加多少财产呀！只要党员带着群众向党指的路上走，没有办不成的事。
    多雨的夏天来到了。张宗文开始实行他的雨季造林计划。一下雨，他就领着积极分子到红丹山去栽树。群众看着党员干部到红丹山栽树，心里也挺热乎；但又怕栽了自己得不到利。有人问张宗文，栽上树是不是归自己有。张宗文说，保证谁栽归谁有，只是树苗钱将来要还公家。高家楼子的人们动起来了，这一个雨季，他们把红丹山栽得差不多了，加上红丹山附近的大山总共有八十多万棵树，并且大部分都活了。这时张宗文向这个村上宣传，向那个村上宣传，他说咱们这些山再种上核桃树、栗子树、苹果树不是收入更大了吗？到那时咱们这带山上雾气腾腾的，青山红果，有多好。咱们这山里再闸上山沟，喂上鸡鸭和牛羊，咱们不是种了好多柞树吗？再喂上蚕，到那时候，同志，你们穿的就不是这么破烂了。冬天穿羊皮袄，夏天穿个绸子褂，鸡蛋鸭蛋就够你吃的啦！群众听了笑着想着这黄土山的未来。这时张宗文心里像开了花一样的快乐。他说：十年到八年，一定要把黄沙地变成“刮金板”。
      张宗文来到这红丹山旁的高家楼子村，已经三个月了。这三个月里面，他生活上遭受到严重的困难。县财政科里说林业部门是新部门，怎样供给还没规定好，张宗文这时候要从家里拿煎饼出来吃，他家离这红丹山有十八、九里路，张宗文没空回家，就叫他老婆把煎饼烙好送到善疃集上，再叫赶集的人们给他捎回高家楼子来。有一次他回家了，他老婆说：
    “你这革命革的连饭也闹不上啦！等几年你再老了咋办呀！”
    “现在我们的供给还没规定好，等到领了给养再还给你呀！”
    他和他老婆都嘿嘿地笑了。张宗文这三个月里，全凭家里送煎饼和咸菜来生活，没有咸菜的时候就烧点开水泡煎饼吃。高家楼子村的人们，在张宗文家供应不上的时候，也常拉着他到自己家吃顿饭。
    县里建设科长来检查他的工作了，见他吃凉水泡煎饼，问他：“你就吃这个呀！”
    “可不是”，张宗文一面吃着笑了笑。
    其实老张这时吃饭那里论顿，什么时候饿了，就泡个煎饼吃，白天整天在山上跑，晚上得和群众一块打封山造林的谱。第一年，张宗文动员了八个村上的群众造了林。他亲手把八十四万棵树苗分给村里的群众，然后又看着群众把树栽上，那些小树在这有点黄土的石圪梁上长起来了。
    第二年的春天，造林的工作被提到区委会上来研究了。在造林的时候，全区的干部都下手了，光马尾松籽就播种了八百多斤。
    到一九五二年，那些马尾松长有一尺多高，树荫像个铜盆那样大。红丹山青茫茫的，附近这几架大山也青起来了。这时村上的人们和张宗文到山上跑得更勤，张宗文在下雨的时候，就披着蓑衣到小山沟沟边上蹲着看。他眼看着从山上流下来的水没有过去混了。那高家楼子村正中流过的一道白沙河，也被清水涮深了。房子被水冲毁的危险再也没有了。
    我来到红丹山的第二天清早，和张宗文到红丹山上看看那些小马尾松。张宗文说：
    “这红丹山上的树种可多啦，以后我们就多栽这种树。咱们到山上看看你就知道啦！”
    老张先领我到村东的苗圃里，那小马尾松苗苗叶子冻得有点发红。我问张宗文：
    “这马尾松有多少呀！”
    张宗文犹豫了一会说：
    “那可说不了，光这高家楼子村也得有几百万棵呀！”
      一条小路的西面，有一大片已经落叶的小树苗，张宗文说那是棉槐。这个树种可好，在这山地里肥料缺，它的叶子三百斤就能顶一百斤豆饼。一家栽上几亩这个树，肥料问题就解决了。
    老张一心要我把这山上的树种都看完，我们沿着小水沟往红丹山上爬。他有些发喘了，还是不停地爬，每看到一类树种总要给我讲上一番。他说这干叶子的是栗子树。那一大片是苹果树。他不止一次地摸着那一二尺高的冻红的小树条，说那是乌桕树。十五年以后每棵能结一百斤种籽。这种籽皮上有一层蜡，除了出蜡外，还能出二十五斤青油，那可是擦机器的好油，麻参饼还能上地药虫子。今年春天这几架山上栽了八万棵，百分之七十都成活了。
    要看完张宗文领导群众种的小树，可不是一天半天的事，四五万亩面积的树，都在那大山上。光这红丹山也得爬半天。我们已爬到红丹山的半山腰，张宗文老头看样儿实在有点累了，可是他仍然往上爬，他这里瞧瞧那里瞧瞧，猛的弯下腰对我说：
      “这就是杜仲树，十几年后就能出胶，就是造胶鞋、汽车轮胎的胶，种这种树，对国家工业化的作用可大啦。我们已经培养了八千多棵树苗。”又走到一个山坡上，老张摸着尺把高的小枝条问我：
      “你说这是啥树吧！”
      我摇了摇头表示不知道。老张兴奋地说：“这是女贞树。这个树可有味哩！有一种小虫专门吃它的叶子，它一面吃一面屙屎，屙的满树枝上白花花的，然后再把那树条条割下来熬成蜡。这种蜡就是造蜡纸用的蜡。”
    老张说这说那，又反问我：“你说这些树种都从那里来的？咳，可远啦！这些树种都是从安徽弄来的。这二年我光琢磨种用处更大的树啦，我要把南方的树种也搬到北方来，你知道不，我院子里用草盖着的就是南方的樟树，福建松，也没冻死呀！”
    为了把黄沙地变成“刮金板”。五十多岁的张宗文这里跑那里跑，很多山他都管起来了，几十里几百里的人都到这里吸取他的经验。
    他为了工作，离家十几里路却成半年的不回家。不久以前，他病了。他老婆领着孩子来看他，高家楼子的人们都去看他老婆，向她问好。这个说老张把我们的大山弄好了，那个说我们这片片亏了老张同志领着种树，我们这里也有柴烧。
    张宗文的老婆在高家楼子村，不断地领着小孩到村边上看看那巍峨的红丹山，看看那周围的群山，自言自语地说：山是变了。她给张宗文说：
    “这几年，你在这里办工作办的挺好！好好办吧，赶明把咱们家那一带的山上也栽满树，就再也没有水灾旱灾了。”
    到红丹山的第三天早晨，老张领我又到红丹山半腰里看看。
    我们出村没多远，老张在一条小河边上站住了，他看着那股哗哗啦啦的流水，好久好久，才说：
    “过去，这红丹山上没有树木，下雨的时候流一天混水两天清水，就完了。你看现在是清水长流了吧！已经二年啦，天旱的时候水也是这样流。”
