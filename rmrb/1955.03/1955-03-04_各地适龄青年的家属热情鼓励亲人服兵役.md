Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch—Families of eligible youths in various locations across the country are enthusiastically encouraging and seeing off their relatives who are enlisting in response to the state's call for military recruitment. According to preliminary statistics from twenty-four counties in six special districts including Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Xingtai, and Handan in Hebei Province, five thousand two hundred and ninety-eight mothers sent their sons to enlist, and one thousand four hundred and twenty-seven wives sent their husbands to enlist. In the five districts of Chengde County, Rehe Province, parents registered their sons for enlistment in two hundred and fifty cases, and wives registered their husbands in seventy-four cases.

After hearing the news of military recruitment, Hu Shi, a sixty-eight-year-old man in the suburbs of Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, immediately registered his twenty-one-year-old son, Hu Wo, who was working as a painter in another county. This old man originally had seven sons, but in the old society, three sons were given away because he could not afford to raise them, one son was captured by the Kuomintang to serve as a soldier, and another son fled to Southeast Asia to escape being drafted by the Kuomintang. After liberation, his family's life improved day by day. Just as the old man was registering his son for enlistment, Hu Wo also hurried back after hearing that his hometown had begun military recruitment. He wrote on the registration form: "I am a happy youth of the new era. To defend the motherland, I firmly enlist!" When Huang Hui's mother, an eligible youth from Kundong Township, Guangdong Province, encouraged Huang Hui to enlist, she said, "Good young people should defend the motherland and the happy lives of the people. It is an honor for our whole family for you to serve in the military."

During the military recruitment process, young women in various places also regarded encouraging and seeing off their husbands or fiancés to serve in the military as the most glorious thing. Fan Ruizhen, a Zhuang ethnic woman in Xincheng County, Guangxi Province, encouraged her husband to enlist, saying, "It is also an honor for me that you are enlisting to defend the motherland. Don't worry, I will work hard in production at home and strive to be a model worker." Zhang Zhengming and Yong Guiying, an unmarried couple in Xinhua Township, Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, had originally planned to get married this year. After hearing the news of military recruitment, Yong Guiying encouraged her fiancé to enlist, saying, "Although marriage is a major event, defending the motherland is an even greater event." Her fiancé, Zhang Zhengming, also agreed to wait until he finishes his military service before getting married. When Lin Mulan from Donghe Township, Sihui County, Guangdong Province, saw off her husband to serve in the military, she said, "I love the motherland and I love my husband, but without a solid national defense, the happy life of our couple would not be guaranteed, so I must send my husband to defend our beloved motherland."

    各地适龄青年的家属热情鼓励亲人服兵役
    【新华社一日讯】全国各地广大适龄青年的家属热情鼓励和欢送自己的亲人报名响应国家征集补充兵员的号召。据河北省唐山、石家庄、保定、张家口、邢台、邯郸等六个专区二十四个县的初步统计，有五千二百九十八个母亲送儿子应征，有一千四百二十七个妻子送丈夫应征。热河省承德县五个区的统计，父母为儿子报名应征的有二百五十起，妻子为丈夫报名应征的有七十四起。
    福建省泉州市郊区六十八岁的老人胡石听到征集补充兵员的消息后，立刻给在外县做漆工的二十一岁的儿子胡窝报了名。这位老人原来有七个儿子，但在旧社会里，有三个儿子因养不起而送给了别人，有一个儿子被国民党抓去当兵，另一个儿子为逃避国民党抓丁而逃到了南洋。解放后，他家里生活一天比一天好起来。就在老人替儿子报名应征时，胡窝听到家乡已经开始征集补充兵员的消息也连忙赶了回来。他在报名登记表上写着：“我是新时代的幸福青年，为了保卫祖国，我坚决应征服兵役！”广东省昆东乡适龄青年黄辉的母亲在鼓励黄辉报名应征时说：“好青年都应该保卫祖国和人民的幸福生活。你去服兵役，我们全家都光荣。”
    在征集补充兵员过程中，各地青年妇女也都把鼓励和欢送自己的丈夫或未婚夫应征服兵役，看成是最光荣的事情。广西省忻城县僮族妇女樊瑞珍鼓励丈夫报名应征时说：“你应征服兵役保卫祖国，我也很光荣，你尽管放心，我在家里一定努力生产，争取当劳动模范。”四川省南部县新华乡未婚夫妻张正明、雍桂英原已商量好今年结婚，当听见征集补充兵员的消息后，雍桂英就鼓励未婚夫报名应征，她说：“结婚虽然是大事，但保卫祖国是更大的事。”她的未婚夫张正明也同意等服完兵役后回来再结婚。广东省四会县东和乡林木兰在欢送自己的丈夫应征服兵役时说：“我爱祖国，也爱丈夫，但是如果没有巩固的国防，我们夫妻的幸福生活也没有保障，所以我一定送我的丈夫去保卫可爱的祖国。”
