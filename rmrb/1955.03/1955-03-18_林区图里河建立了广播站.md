    A Radio Station Established in the Tuli River Forest Area
    The newly built forest area city of Tuli River in Inner Mongolia recently established a radio station. In the evenings, the radio station not only rebroadcasts the nationwide programs of the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the broadcasting programs of the Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station, but also offers self-produced programs. Most of the residents here are workers and their families. After a day of intense work, they can listen to the radio station's pleasant songs and news of construction from all over the motherland, transmitted from the distant capital, when they rest in the evening.

    林区图里河建立了广播站
    内蒙新建的林区城市图里河最近建立了广播站。广播站在晚间除转播中央人民广播电台全国联播节目和内蒙古人民广播电台的广播节目外，还举办自播节目。在这里居住的大部是工人和干部家属。当紧张地工作了一天以后，他们晚上休息时就能听到广播站播送的悦耳的歌声和从遥远的首都传去的祖国各地建设的消息。  （平歌）
