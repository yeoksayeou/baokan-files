    The Female Train Crew Active on the Chengdu-Chongqing Line
    
    A female youth train crew on the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway consists of sixteen young women. Since the "March 8th" International Women's Day in 1953, the women have consistently treated the train as their home, serving tens of thousands of passengers day and night.

    The patient service attitude of the female train attendants often leaves passengers with unforgettable impressions. Once, a pregnant woman named Qu Xiuqing suddenly experienced abdominal pain as train 52 crossed the Tuo River Bridge. Train attendants Yin Qionghui and medical worker Wang Zehua quickly moved her to a soft-sleeper compartment. These women, who had never witnessed or assisted in childbirth, busily prepared for the delivery. As soon as the baby was born, even the female train attendants who were supposed to be resting excitedly rushed over to help, some washing the baby, others caring for the mother, and providing three quilts for the baby and mother to keep warm. The good news quickly spread throughout the train. When the train arrived at Chengdu Station, the baby's father was overjoyed and repeatedly expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the female train attendants of the People's Railway.

    In December 1954, a wounded and sick soldier of the Volunteer Army was traveling via the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to a hospital for recuperation. Wang Fujin, a nineteen-year-old female train attendant, took special care of him, bringing him tea and food, and telling him stories of national construction. This soldier had difficulty moving and found it difficult to relieve himself. The female train attendant provided him with meticulous care throughout the journey, moving him to tears.

    The enthusiastic service of these female train attendants has been praised and commended by passengers. In the past two years, they have received more than sixty letters of commendation from various locations, and more than one thousand one hundred and ninety comments praising them have been made in the suggestion book. This female youth train crew has continued to maintain the glorious title of advanced group for two years. Many of them have been recognized as outstanding employees. Currently, three members of this female youth crew are Communist Party members, eleven are Communist Youth League members, and the remaining two young women are also active members of the train crew.

    活跃在成渝线上的女列车班
    新华社记者　李治安
    成渝铁路上的一个女青年列车班，共有十六个年轻的姑娘。从一九五三年“三八”国际妇女节起到现在，姑娘们一直是把列车当成自己的家，日日夜夜地为成千成万的旅客们服务。
    女列车员们耐心服务的态度，经常给旅客们留下难忘的印象。有一次，一位名叫屈秀清的孕妇在五二次列车刚跨过沱江大桥时，忽然肚子痛起来，列车员尹琼辉和卫生员王泽华很快地把她移到软席卧车里，这些没有见过也没有接生经验的姑娘们，紧张地忙着做接生的准备工作。婴儿刚一出生，连应该休息的女列车员也兴奋的跑来帮忙，有的去包洗孩子，有的去照顾产妇，并让出三床被子给孩子、产妇取暖。列车上的旅客们立刻传遍了这件喜事。列车到成都车站时，孩子的父亲惊喜交集，对人民铁道的女列车员们一再表示衷心的感谢。
    一九五四年十二月，一位志愿军伤病员途经成渝铁路到医院休养，十九岁的女列车员王福金便特别关心地照顾着他，给他送茶喂饭，讲祖国建设的故事；这位伤病员行动不便，大小便都感到困难，一路上女列车员给了他无微不至的照顾，他被感动得流下了眼泪。
    这些女列车员的服务热情，受到了旅客们的称赞和表扬。两年来，她们收到了来自各地的表扬信有六十多封，在意见簿上提出表扬意见的有一千一百九十多条。这个女青年列车班继续保持了两年优胜小组的光荣称号。其中有许多被评为优秀职工。目前，这个女青年班中有三人是共产党员，十一人是青年团员，其余两名女青年也是列车班中的积极分子。
