Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 24th: A large number of proactive individuals with socialist awareness in the rural areas of Hunan Province have joined the Communist Party of China during the mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to statistics, from October 1954 to the end of February 1955, Party grassroots organizations throughout the province admitted more than 48,000 new Party members. At present, there are more than 120,000 Party members and more than 12,000 branches in rural areas throughout the province. Townships with established Party grassroots organizations account for more than 80% of the total number of townships in the province. In the past, the Xiangxi and Xiangnan ethnic minority areas and some remote areas, where Party work was relatively weak, also established more than 2,000 township branches in the winter of 1954 and the spring of 1955. The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture admitted more than 800 new Party members and newly established 162 branches during the unified purchase and sale of grain in the winter of 1954.

　　The new Party members admitted in rural areas throughout the province are generally proactive individuals who have undergone the test of the general line education and various movements and have socialist awareness. According to statistics from Lingling, Hengyang, Dong'an and other counties, 55% of the newly admitted Party members are core members of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, of which poor peasants (including new middle peasants who were formerly poor peasants) account for 88%. They actively implement the Party's policies in various tasks and lead the masses with their exemplary actions. For example, Deng Xiangzhi, a new Party member in Xiamaduxiang Township, Qiyang County, always paid attention to enlightening the awareness of the peasant masses in the work of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives; after the cooperative was established, the production team he led accumulated more than 2,000 dan of soil fertilizer, driving all the cooperative members to solve the difficulty of lacking fertilizer.

    湖南省农村中已有一万多个共产党的支部
   【新华社长沙二十四日电】湖南省农村中大批具有社会主义觉悟的积极分子，在互助合作运动中加入了中国共产党。据统计，从一九五四年十月到一九五五年二月底全省党的基层组织共接收了四万八千多名新党员。目前，全省农村中共有十二万多名党员和一万二千多个支部，建立了党的基层组织的乡占全省总乡数的百分之八十以上。过去党的工作比较薄弱的湘西和湘南等少数民族地区以及部分偏僻地区，在一九五四年冬天和一九五五年春天也建立了两千多个乡支部。湘西苗族自治州在一九五四年冬季粮食统购统销运动中接收了八百多名新党员，新建立了一百六十二个支部。
    各地农村中被接收的新党员，一般都是经过总路线教育和各项运动的考验，具有社会主义觉悟的积极分子。据零陵、衡阳、东安等县统计，新接收的党员中有百分之五十五是互助合作组织中的骨干分子，其中贫农（包括原为贫农的新中农）占百分之八十八。他们在各项工作中积极贯彻党的政策，并以自己的模范行动带动群众。如祁阳县下马渡乡新党员邓相智在建立农业生产合作社工作中，始终注意启发农民群众的觉悟；合作社建成后，他领导的那个生产小队积了两千多担土肥，带动全体社员解决了缺少肥料的困难。
