Xinhua News Agency, March 9th: Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a radio address on the 8th, discussing the results of the recent Manila Treaty Organization's Bangkok conference and his activities in Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan after the meeting.

In his speech, Dulles reiterated that the purpose of his activities at the Bangkok conference and afterward in Asia was to intensify aggression against China and Asia from the three "fronts" of Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and South Korea. He openly stated that war threats should be imposed on China from the "south, center, and north," and "for military purposes," these "fronts should be regarded as a whole."

Dulles's speech shows that the United States is stepping up preparations for a new war of aggression after the Bangkok conference. He clamored that the U.S. naval and air forces stationed in the Asian region "have been equipped with new and powerful precision weapons." Washington sources explained that Dulles here is conducting atomic war intimidation against the people of Asia. At the same time, Dulles said that the military advisors of the countries participating in the Bangkok conference will hold meetings to "exchange" intelligence on the "armed forces" that can be provided for the United States to use, "reach consensus on strategy," and "formulate plans for joint military exercises." Dulles tried hard to portray these war preparations as a manifestation of the United States' pursuit of "peace."

Dulles indicated that the United States insists on occupying Taiwan and Penghu, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands. He once again threatened that the United States would use armed forces "not necessarily limited to static defense" of Taiwan and Penghu, but also to "defend" "certain coastal positions."

In his speech, Dulles also mentioned that the Bangkok conference discussed the issue of so-called "counter-subversion activities" to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and suppress the national independence movements of various countries. Dulles cited the United States' activities in Laos as an example, thus blatantly revealing the United States' conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords, intensify interference in the internal affairs of Indochinese countries, and sabotage peace in Indochina. He openly stated that there are "disloyal elements" in the regroupment areas of the Laotian fighting forces, and "the Lao government is trying to regain control of its own territory," thus supporting the provocative attacks by the Lao Kingdom government forces on the regroupment areas in violation of the Geneva Accords. He openly instigated the Lao Kingdom government to "suppress internal communists" without having to "worry" about not receiving the "protection" of the United States. When talking about the Vietnam issue, Dulles also revealed the United States' conspiracy to prevent the holding of free elections for reunification in Vietnam as stipulated in the Geneva Accords.

In order to cover up the United States' military aggression deployment in Asia, Dulles also said that the Bangkok conference discussed the issue of "improving (Asian) economic and social conditions." However, he then explained the content of the so-called economic issues in the United States' mind. He said that the first item is "to provide some military equipment and financial support to help" the Manila Treaty countries establish armed forces for the United States to use, because "some countries cannot afford" the burden of establishing such armed forces "without assistance." Dulles said that the U.S. government is already requesting Congress to allocate more funds in the next fiscal year to carry out this military deployment.

    杜勒斯叫嚷加紧侵略中国
    【新华社九日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯八日发表广播演说，谈论最近马尼拉条约国家曼谷会议的结果以及他在会后到东南亚国家和台湾进行的活动。
    杜勒斯在演说里再次说明他在曼谷会议上和会后在亚洲的活动所追求的目的，是要从东南亚、台湾和南朝鲜三条“战线”来加紧对中国和亚洲的侵略。他公开说，要从“南部、中部和北部”来对中国施行战争威胁，“为了军事的目的”，这些“战线应该看作是一个整体”。
    杜勒斯的演说表明，在曼谷会议后，美国正在加紧准备新的侵略战争。他叫嚷说，美国驻在亚洲地区的海空军部队“已有新式和强有力的精确的武器装备起来”。据华盛顿人士解释说，杜勒斯在这里是对亚洲人民进行原子战争恫吓。同时，杜勒斯说，参加曼谷会议各国的军事顾问将举行会议来“交换”能够提供美国驱使的“武装力量的情报”，“就战略取得一致意见”，“制订出进行联合军事演习的计划”。杜勒斯却还竭力把这些战争的准备措施说成是美国追求“和平”的表现。
    杜勒斯表示，美国坚持要侵占台湾和澎湖，阻挠中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和其他沿海岛屿。他再一次恫吓说，美国要使用武装力量“不一定限于静止地保卫”台湾和澎湖，还要“保卫”“某些沿海阵地”。
    杜勒斯在演说里还说到，曼谷会议讨论了干涉东南亚国家内政、镇压各国民族独立运动的所谓“反颠覆活动”问题。杜勒斯举出美国对老挝的活动为例，从而露骨地表明了美国要破坏日内瓦协定加紧干涉印度支那国家内政、破坏印度支那和平的阴谋。他公然说什么寮国战斗部队集结地区内存在着“不忠诚分子”，“老挝政府正在设法恢复对它自己领土的控制”，这样来支持老挝王国政府军队破坏日内瓦协定对集结地区进行的挑衅性进攻。他公开嗾使老挝王国政府“镇压内部的共产党”，不必“担心”得不到美国的“保护”。在谈到越南问题时，杜勒斯也透露了美国企图阻止按照日内瓦协定规定在越南举行恢复统一的自由选举的阴谋。
    为了掩饰美国在亚洲的军事侵略部署，杜勒斯还说到，曼谷会议讨论了“改善（亚洲）经济和社会条件”问题。然而，他接着就说明了美国心目中的所谓经济问题的内容。他说，首先的一项就是“提供某些军事装备和财政支持的办法来帮助”马尼拉条约国家建立供美国驱使的武装部队，因为“有些国家在没有援助的情况下无法承担”建立这种武装部队的负担。杜勒斯说美国政府已在要求国会在下一财政年度再拨出费用以进行这种军事部署。
