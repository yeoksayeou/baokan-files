    Five state-owned beet sugar refineries in Harbin, Acheng, Heping, Hongguang, and Jilin plan to increase sugar production by 2,020,000 jin for the country this year, using existing equipment and without increasing raw materials.

    The main methods for these five sugar refineries to increase sugar production are to reduce sugar loss and increase the sugar extraction rate. To fulfill the plan for increasing sugar production, each factory will vigorously improve enterprise management and standardize operating methods to solve problems such as large beet losses and low sugar extraction rates. The four sugar refineries in Acheng, Hongguang, Heping, and Harbin can reduce the sugar loss rate by 0.04% simply by improving beet storage and uniformly adjusting the temperature of beet fluming and washing, thereby increasing sugar production by 364,000 jin.

    Currently, each factory is preparing to organize workers to discuss beet sugar production operating methods and carry out labor competitions between beet sugar refineries and within factories to ensure the realization of the aforementioned production increase plan.

    哈尔滨等地糖厂提高出糖率
    哈尔滨、阿城、和平、红光、吉林等五个地方国营甜菜制糖厂，今年计划在原有设备和不增加原料的条件下，将为国家增产二百零二万斤食糖。
    这五个糖厂增产食糖的办法主要是降低糖分损耗，提高出糖率。为完成增产食糖的计划，各厂将大力改进企业管理，统一操作方法，以解决甜菜损耗大、出糖率低等问题。阿城、红光、和平、哈尔滨等四个糖厂今年仅改善甜菜的贮存和统一调整甜菜流送同洗涤的温度一项，就可以减少万分之四的糖分损耗率，从而可以增产糖三十六万四千斤。
    目前各厂正准备组织职工讨论甜菜制糖操作法，并开展各甜菜制糖厂之间和厂内的劳动竞赛，以保证实现上述增产计划。
