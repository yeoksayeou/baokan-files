The three major water conservancy projects in the lower reaches of the Han River in Guangdong Province – the Anjie Han River Diversion Irrigation Project, the Beiguan Han River Diversion Irrigation Project, and the Chenghai County Meixi Right Bank Drainage Project – have been successfully completed and began releasing water in early March. From now on, 172,000 mu of farmland in 99 townships in Chao'an, Chenghai, and Jieyang counties, and Chaozhou City, can be freed from the threat of waterlogging, drought, salinity, and tides.

After the Anjie and Beiguan irrigation projects released water, they immediately relieved the drought that had been threatening the first, second, sixth, ninth, and tenth districts of Chao'an County. These districts originally relied on old culverts, small ditches, and ponds for irrigation. Recently, due to a prolonged drought and water shortage, the old culverts were higher than the Han River water level, making it impossible to draw water; the ponds were also nearly dry due to farmers drawing water for drought resistance and planting. On the day of the water release ceremony for the two irrigation projects, although the Han River water level had dropped to near its lowest level in eight years, the two intake gates were only half-opened, and the river water poured in continuously. Within more than 20 hours, all the channels in the irrigation area were filled, benefiting 132,000 mu of farmland, of which 110,000 mu could be irrigated by gravity flow. Farmers in the 17th district of Jieyang County also promptly diverted Han River water to wash away rice seedlings affected by the saline tide from the Rongjiang estuary, preventing damage to the seedlings. The completion of the Meixi Right Bank Drainage Project in Chenghai County will free 40,000 mu of paddy fields in the drainage area from the disaster of waterlogging and enable 4,000 mu of sandy fields to be converted from single-cropping to double-cropping.

    韩江下游三项水利工程完工
    广东省韩江下游三大水利工程——安揭引韩灌溉工程、北关引韩灌溉工程和澄海县梅溪右岸排水工程，已胜利完工，并在三月上旬先后开始放水。从此，潮安、澄海、揭阳三县和潮州市的九十九个乡十七万二千多亩田地，可以摆脱水旱碱潮灾害的威胁。
    安揭、北关灌溉工程放水后，立即解除了最近一直威胁着潮安县第一、二、六、九、十几个区的旱患。这几个区原靠旧涵、小沟、池塘来灌溉，最近因久旱缺水，旧涵高过韩江水位，不能引水；池塘也因为农民车水抗旱播种后而将近干涸。在两个灌溉工程举行放水典礼当天，韩江水位虽然已下降至接近八年来的最低水位，但两个进水闸只半开闸门，江水就源源涌进，在二十多小时内，灌满了灌溉区内所有渠道，受益的田亩达十三万二千亩，其中有十一万亩可以自流灌溉。揭阳县第十七区农民也已及时引韩江水冲洗受到榕江口碱潮侵袭的秧田，使秧苗不受损害。澄海县梅溪右岸排水工程的完成，将使排水区内四万亩水田免受内涝灾害并使四千亩沙田由种单造改为种双造。
