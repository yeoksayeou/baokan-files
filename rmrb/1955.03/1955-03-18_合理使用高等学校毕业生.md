Rational Utilization of University Graduates

Our country's socialist construction urgently requires various cadres with professional knowledge. Both now and in the future, university graduates are one of the main sources of the nation's advanced specialized talent. However, the current number of university graduates is, generally speaking, far from meeting the country's needs, especially in the fields of science and engineering, where the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand is quite serious. Therefore, assigning the limited number of graduates to the most needed and appropriate positions in the country and rationally utilizing them to fully exert their capabilities is of great significance to the development of the national construction cause.

In general, employing units value this issue, and therefore the job assignments for the vast majority of university graduates are appropriate, and the graduates have played a significant role in various construction endeavors. However, some units, due to the existence of bureaucratic work styles and departmentalism, use a small number of university graduates in an extremely unreasonable manner, often wasting talent. These units are the loudest in shouting that they lack talent, using various methods to request more university graduates from higher authorities. However, their use of talent is often irresponsible; they neither study the graduates' professional expertise nor understand the business needs of their subordinate units. As long as there is a "shortage of people" somewhere, they put them there, regardless of whether the use is rational. Regarding this phenomenon, Stalin once said, "In reality, we often see the fact that workers are treated with a bureaucratic, mean attitude, and with an attitude that is simply preposterous. Precisely because of this, they often fail to examine talent, and instead of employing them after examination, they often throw them around like pawns on a chessboard." The attitude of some of our units towards talent is exactly like the "bureaucratic, mean attitude" and "simply preposterous attitude" that Stalin described.

These employing units have yet to fully appreciate how difficult it is for the country to cultivate talent. Leaving aside the enormous financial and material resources that the state invests in training a university graduate; just looking at how much painstaking work educators do year after year, and how much energy and time graduates themselves devote to diligent study, we can understand how intolerable the waste of talent is.

Stalin taught us, "If we want to successfully eliminate the phenomenon of extreme talent shortage and provide our country with a sufficient number of cadres capable of advancing technology and applying technology, we must first learn to value talent, value cadres, and value every worker who is beneficial to our common cause." However, here, the act of wasting the country's most valuable asset—talent—has not yet received the severe criticism it deserves. Since we have gradually come to understand that we should criticize and correct the behavior of wasting large amounts of steel or hoarding large numbers of lathes, can we still turn a blind eye to the behavior of seriously wasting construction talent, and can we still fail to give it serious criticism and correction? We should understand that the loss to the country from wasting talent is immeasurable! We should expose the phenomenon of wasting talent more ruthlessly than we expose the behavior of wasting materials, give it severe criticism, and wage an uncompromising struggle against these phenomena. All employing units should welcome such criticism to improve their work.

Of course, the current university majors and the talent cultivated may not fully meet the needs of the country's modern industrial construction, and some graduates may still find it difficult to find completely suitable jobs. Therefore, it is still inevitable that a small number of graduates will be assigned to jobs that are slightly different or even significantly different from what they have studied. For example, the number of graduates in some majors is significantly different from the number of cadres urgently needed by the country in this area, so some graduates with similar professional backgrounds have to be assigned to do this work as well. This is necessary and reasonable. However, determining which major's graduates are more suitable to change careers to meet the needs of a certain area of work is a very complex issue that must be carefully studied and handled. Some employing units often unilaterally emphasize the needs of the work, emphasizing the shortage of talent, and carelessly allow graduates to change careers without careful study, sometimes making extremely inappropriate changes, letting them do work that is far removed from what they have studied, and even letting graduates in certain majors that the country urgently needs change careers to meet the so-called "urgent needs" of their units. This is incorrect. It should be understood that assigning graduates to change careers due to work needs is one thing; blindly letting graduates change careers out of departmentalism is another. We must never use work needs as an excuse to waste talent.

Some employing units, on the one hand, handle the job assignment of graduates with the wrong attitude, and on the other hand, treat graduates' opinions on job assignment with the wrong attitude. Without specific analysis, they immediately say that graduates have ideological problems and criticize them if they request adjustments to their jobs. Individual units have even adopted the wrong approach of unreasonable suppression. To consider the graduates' work more appropriately, their opinions must be heard. For their reasonable requests, those that can be resolved must be resolved appropriately; for their unreasonable requests, they should be patiently persuaded and educated. Suppressing graduates from expressing their opinions is not allowed.

In order to overcome the unreasonable phenomena in the allocation and use of university graduates, the responsible comrades of all employing departments, especially the various industrial departments and their subordinate factories and mines, must personally take care of these matters. First of all, it is necessary to determine how many graduates the department needs based on the actual situation; at the same time, the cadres responsible for the allocation of university graduates should be required to strengthen their professional learning, study the graduates' majors and the department's business needs, so that the two can be well integrated and the work of each graduate can be properly allocated. The current use of university graduates in the unit should be carefully checked, and if there are any phenomena of improper use and waste of talent, they should be quickly and resolutely adjusted, and they should be transferred to the work posts where they are needed. Only in this way can people be used to their full potential, further stimulating the enthusiasm and creativity of university graduates, and enabling them to do more work for the country.

### 合理使用高等学校毕业生

    合理使用高等学校毕业生
    我国的社会主义建设，迫切需要各种具有专业知识的干部。不论是目前或是将来，高等学校毕业生都是国家高级专门人材的主要来源之一。但是，目前高等学校毕业生的人数，总的说来，还远不敷国家的需要，特别是理、工科的毕业生，供不应求的现象是相当严重的。因此把为数有限的毕业生分配到国家最需要、最合适的岗位上，合理地使用他们，充分发挥他们的作用，这对国家建设事业的发展是有重要意义的。
    用人的单位一般是重视这个问题的，因而绝大部分高等学校毕业生的工作分配是恰当的，毕业生在各项建设工作中都起了很大的作用。但也有一些单位，由于存在着官僚主义作风和本位主义思想，对少数高等学校毕业生的使用极不合理，往往浪费了人材。这些单位最会叫喊人材不够，用许多方法争取上级分配给他们的高等学校毕业生人数加多。但是，他们对人材的使用，却往往是不负责任的，既不研究毕业生的专业用途，也不了解所属单位的业务需要，只要那里“缺人”，就往那里放，不管使用是否合理。对于这种现象，斯大林曾经说过：“我们在实际上却往往看见那种用官僚主义的刻薄态度，用一种简直岂有此理的态度对待工作者的事实。也正因为如此，所以往往也就不去考察人材，不把他们考察以后才任用他们，而是往往把他们东抛西掷，如同抛掷棋盘上的小卒一样。”我们有些单位对待人材的态度，恰恰就像斯大林所说的这种“官僚主义的刻薄态度”、“简直岂有此理的态度”一样。
    这些用人单位还远远没有体会到，国家培养人材是极不容易的。姑且不说国家培养一个高等学校毕业生所付出的大量财力、物力；只须看一看一个专门人材从高等学校毕业，需要多少教育工作者积年累月的辛勤工作，需要毕业生自己用多少精力和时间来孜孜不倦地学习，我们就会懂得浪费人材是如何地不能容忍。
    斯大林教导我们：“我们如果想要顺利地消灭十分缺乏人材的现象，并使我国得到充分数量能够推进技术和运用技术的干部，首先就应当学会重视人材，重视干部，重视每一个有益于我们共同事业的工作者。”但是，在我们这里，浪费国家最宝贵的财产——人材的行为，却还没有受到应有的严厉批评。我们对于浪费了大量钢材或者积压了大批车床的行为，既然逐渐懂得应该给以批评和纠正了，那末，对于严重地浪费建设人材的行为，难道还可以熟视无睹，还能够不给以严重的批评和纠正吗？我们应该懂得，浪费人材对国家的损失是无法估量的啊！我们应该比揭发浪费物资的行为更加无情地揭发浪费人材的现象，给以严厉的批评，向这些现象作不调和的斗争。所有用人的单位应该欢迎这样的批评，以改进工作。
    当然，目前高等学校的专业设置和培养出来的人材，还不可能完全符合国家现代化工业建设的需要，有些毕业生也还难于找到完全合适的工作岗位。因此，还不可免地要分配少数毕业生去做和他所学稍有距离甚至有不小距离的工作。例如，有些专业毕业生的人数和国家在这方面工作迫切需要的干部数量相比较，相差很大，这样，就不能不分配一些专业性质相近的毕业生也来做这方面的工作。这是必要的，合理的。但分配什么专业的毕业生改行去适应某一方面工作的需要较为合适，这是一个十分复杂的问题，必须慎重地研究和处理。有的用人单位往往片面地强调工作需要，强调人材缺乏，不经过慎重地研究就轻率地让毕业生改行，有时改得极不合适，让他们去作同他们所学相距很远的工作，甚至让国家当前急需的某些专业的毕业生改行去适应本单位的所谓“急迫的需要”。这是不正确的。应当了解，因工作需要而分配毕业生改行是一回事；从本位主义思想出发，盲目地让毕业生改行又是一回事，决不能借口工作需要而去浪费人材。
    有的用人单位一方面用错误的态度处理毕业生的工作分配问题，一方面又用错误的态度对待毕业生对工作分配的意见。他们不加具体分析，一听他们要求调整工作，就说他们有思想问题，横加批评，个别单位甚至采取了无理压制的错误作法。为了更恰当地考虑毕业生的工作，必须倾听他们的意见。对于他们的合理要求，能够解决的必须予以适当解决；对于他们的不合理的要求，应该耐心地进行说服教育。压制毕业生提意见的作法，是不能容许的。
    为了克服高等学校毕业生分配和使用中的不合理现象，所有的用人部门，特别是各工业部门和它们所属厂矿的负责同志，必须亲自过问这些事情。首先，要根据实际情况来确定本部门究竟需要多少毕业生；同时，应责成负责高等学校毕业生分配工作的干部加强业务学习，研究毕业生所学的专业和本单位的业务需要，使二者很好地结合起来，恰当地分配每个毕业生的工作。对于本单位现有的高等学校毕业生的使用情况，应该认真地进行检查，如有使用不当、浪费人材的现象，应当迅速地、坚决地予以调整，把他们调到需要他们的工作岗位上去。这样，才能做到人尽其材，进一步发挥高等学校毕业生的积极性和创造性，使他们为国家作更多的工作。
