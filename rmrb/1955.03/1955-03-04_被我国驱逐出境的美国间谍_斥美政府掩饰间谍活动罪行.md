Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 3rd: According to reports in Hong Kong's "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" on the 3rd, Meng Yi and Li You'an, American spies who were expelled from the People's Republic of China, gave a press conference in Hong Kong on the 1st, accusing the U.S. government of attempting to cover up its espionage activities in China.

When Meng Yi and Li You'an revealed the truth about American espionage in China in Hong Kong, U.S. State Department officials dismissed it as "a tragedy" and said that the two of them were "parrots." Meng Yi and Li You'an told reporters, "We believe that telling the truth like this will help promote mutual understanding between people of all countries. It is no wonder that the U.S. government considers it a 'tragedy'." They said, "As for saying we are parrots, I think they probably want to keep a person who tells the truth in a cage like a bird." Li You'an said, "The U.S. State Department doesn't like us telling the truth, which exposes their fear of the truth."

Meng Yi and Li You'an told reporters that after they made statements admitting their crimes, the official U.S. agency in Hong Kong sent a "psychotherapist" to talk to them. They also considered that they would be persecuted after returning to the United States, but they said that no one could stop them from telling the truth.

Meng Yi said, "Before I was arrested by the Chinese government, U.S. agent Potov threatened me that if I revealed the secrets of the intelligence, I would be sentenced to ten years in prison and fined $10,000 after returning. But I have made up my mind never to do anything that betrays the people again."

    被我国驱逐出境的美国间谍
    斥美政府掩饰间谍活动罪行
    【新华社广州三日电】据香港“大公报”、“文汇报”三日报道，被中华人民共和国政府驱逐出境的美国间谍孟义和李又安，一日在香港对记者发表谈话，斥责美国官方企图掩饰在中国进行间谍活动的罪行。
    当孟义和李又安在香港揭露了美国在中国进行间谍活动的真相后，美国国务院的官员就把这说成是“一个悲剧”而且说他们两人是“学舌鹦鹉”。孟义和李又安对记者说：“我们这样把真实的话说出来，相信对促进各国人民之间的互相了解是有些帮助的，难怪被美国官方认为是‘悲剧’了”，他们说，“至于说我们是鹦鹉，我想他们大概是要想把一个说实话的人当做鸟儿一样的关在笼子里”。李又安说，“美国国务院不喜欢我们说老实话，这正暴露了他们害怕真理的真面目。”
    孟义、李又安告诉记者说，在他们发表承认罪行的谈话后，美国驻香港的官方机关就派了一位“心理治疗专家”来找他们谈话。他们也考虑到回美国后会受到迫害，但是，他们表示，任何人都不能阻止他们把事实真相说出来。
    孟义说：“在我被中国政府逮捕前，美国特务波托夫就曾恐吓我说，如果说出情报的秘密，回去后将会被判处十年徒刑并且罚款一万美元。但我已下了决心永远不再做背叛人民的坏事了。”
