    Xinjiang Petroleum Company Expands Production to Increase Crude Oil Output Plan
    Qinghai Province Convenes First Local State-Owned Industry Conference
    Xinhua News Agency: Xinjiang Petroleum Company plans to increase its crude oil output by 63.87 percent this year compared to 1954. The company's gasoline and diesel refining will also increase by half to double that of last year. In this way, the vast majority of fuel used by transportation vehicles, factory machinery, and tractors in the Xinjiang region this year will be supplied by the Xinjiang Petroleum Company. The company will also supply kerosene produced for lighting to people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang; and supply Shitan Reef and asphalt for industrial fuel and urban construction. This year, the company's drilling footage will double compared to last year. In addition to continuing to drill many exploratory wells to determine the reserves and location of oil layers in the oil field, the footage of production wells will also increase by more than double that of last year. These production wells can be put into production one after another this year. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, employees have also researched and formulated many methods to increase production in old wells.
    Xinhua News Agency: In the recent Qinghai Provincial First Local State-Owned Industry Conference convened by the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, it was determined that Qinghai's local state-owned industry should further serve agricultural and pastoral production and support the resource exploration work in the Qaidam Basin. The Xining Machinery Repair Factory, which mainly produces agricultural implements, will this year trial-produce disc harrows, walking plows, and "Yushu plows" suitable for farmers in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region, as well as parts for various new-style animal-powered agricultural implements. The Qinghai People's Chemical Plant is preparing to build a workshop for manufacturing bone meal to increase fertilizer sources. The meeting also decided to expand and build food industries such as oil extraction, brewing, and milk powder production, to develop small coal mines, and to develop industries such as ceramics and glass manufacturing. To meet the needs of resource exploration in the Qaidam Basin and the development of state-owned farms, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Industry has sent prospecting teams to the Qaidam Basin to explore coalfields and phosphate fertilizer resources.

    新疆石油公司扩大生产提高原油产量计划
    青海省召开第一次地方国营工业会议
    新疆石油公司今年的原油产量，计划比一九五四年增加百分之六十三点八七。这个公司今年提炼的汽油和柴油，也将比去年提高半倍到一倍。这样，新疆地区今年的运输车辆、各个厂矿的机器和拖拉机所用的燃料，绝大部分将由新疆石油公司供给。这个公司还要将生产的煤油供应新疆各族人民照明；将石炭礁和沥青供应工业作燃料和城市建设用。今年，这个公司钻井进尺比去年增加一倍，除继续打许多探井探明油田的储量和油层的位置外，生产井的进尺也要比去年增加一倍以上。这些生产井在今年都可陆续投入生产。职工们在苏联专家的指导下，还研究和制定了许多使旧井增产的办法。（新华社）
    中共青海省委员会在最近召开的青海省第一次地方国营工业会议中，确定了青海省地方国营工业要进一步为农、牧业生产服务和支援柴达木盆地的资源勘察工作。以生产农具为主的西宁机械修配厂，今年将试制圆盘耙、步犁和适应玉树藏族自治区农民使用的“玉树铧”以及各种新式畜力农具的零件。青海人民化工厂准备增建制造骨粉的车间，以增加肥源。会议还确定扩建和新建榨油、酿酒、奶粉等食品工业，开采小型煤矿以及发展陶瓷、玻璃制造等工业。为适应柴达木盆地资源勘察和国营农场发展的需要，青海省工业厅已派出探矿队去柴达木盆地勘察煤田和磷肥资源。
