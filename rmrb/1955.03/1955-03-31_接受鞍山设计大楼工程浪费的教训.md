    Accept the Lessons of Waste in the Anshan Design Building Project
    By our reporter Gu Lei
    The office building of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company has a four-story main building, plus a basement and a spire on top of the main building, making it nine stories in total, the tallest of all civilian buildings in Anshan.
    The entire design of this building was done by the Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company itself. The original planned investment was 1.8 million yuan. The preliminary design was completed at the end of March 1953, and the investment rose to 2.41 million yuan. The Ministry of Heavy Industry approved this design, reducing the investment to 2.3 million yuan. Construction began in May 1953, and by October, four stories had been built. It was only then that an investment budget was compiled, and it was discovered that an investment of 3.31 million yuan was needed, and the building area was no longer 15,000 square meters, but 17,000 square meters. The construction unit then reported the overspending to the Ministry of Heavy Industry, requesting additional investment. As a result, the Ministry of Heavy Industry approved another 699,400 yuan. Still not enough! After the completion of the project, according to the final accounts of the Capital Construction Finance Department, the investment expenditure reached 4,199,500 yuan, exceeding the control number initially approved by the Ministry of Heavy Industry by 1,899,500 yuan. Excluding certain specially approved projects, communication equipment, and movable furniture, the 15,880 square meters of buildings cost 3.78 million yuan, with a cost of nearly 240 yuan per square meter. However, the usable area of the building is less than 50 percent of the construction area.
    A "design building" should be built, but it is not a special building. Without special approval, it should fully use the investment according to the control indicators approved by the state. However, they did not do so. Therefore, it should be said that all the overspending is waste. Based on the investment amount approved by the Ministry of Heavy Industry for the second time, the amount of waste should be 1.2 million yuan. That is to say, out of the 4,199,500 yuan investment, waste accounted for more than 28 percent. If calculated according to the investment plan initially approved by the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the overspending would be more than 1.8 million yuan.
    One of the main reasons for the waste is that the designers did not consider how to ensure the rational and economical use of state funds when designing. In the preliminary design description, they especially emphasized that "This building is located in the center of Anshan City Square, ..., facing the main road to the railway station, and is the only way for foreign tourists to pass. Therefore, this building must be added with a spire so that foreign tourists can see it as a symbol of the city center after getting off the train or from other distant places." So a very tall spire was built on top of the building. The construction standard of the "design building" is quite high. At present, the state stipulates that the floor height of general offices is 3.5 meters to 4 meters, but here it is 4.5 meters to 5 meters; the floor thickness of general buildings is 2 centimeters, but here the original design was 4 centimeters, and it was actually made according to 4.5 centimeters; the stairs of general office buildings are made of concrete, but here steel structures are used. The "small hardware" used for doors and windows in general buildings is prohibited from using copper, but here they are all copper; the heating trenches in general buildings are made of brick, but here reinforced concrete is used. In order to improve the construction standards, the methods of industrial construction were mechanically copied. Here, the waterproof layer of the boiler room is not made of asphalt and linen, but of metal waterproof boxes. The 33-meter-high chimney is lined with refractory bricks inside. Natural ventilation could have been used here, but mechanical ventilation, which is necessary in factories, was also adopted. Excessive consideration of decoration has also greatly increased investment. In order to express the "solemnity" and "grandeur" of the building, there are four lighthouses around the spire. Concrete eaves, 1.2 meters long and 1.13 meters high, protrude from the outer walls on the fourth and seventh floors. In order to beautify the side shadows of the wall, thick false inlaid brick pillars and columns and waistlines were protruded on the wall, increasing the foundation. The "plinth" (the part of the wall close to the ground) is entirely covered with natural granite flakes, which alone cost more than 40,000 yuan. The interior decoration is also excessive! For example, the floor of the cafeteria is made of white cement, which is more than ten times more expensive than ordinary cement. What is even more incomprehensible is that a lot of money was spent without considering the use problem. The "drawing library" is the "treasure house" of the design institute, which needs to be moisture-proof, fire-proof, waterproof, and isolated from everything that may lead to various dangers. However, when designing this "drawing library", the designers spent a lot of effort designing an "arcade" style door, but allowed many water pipes, heating pipes, and gas pipes to pass through the "drawing library", and they were all exposed outside, which is very dangerous. There is mechanical ventilation everywhere else, but the "drawing library", which needs to be moisture-proof and mildew-proof, has no ventilation device; because mechanical ventilation is required, even the kitchen has it, but it was not considered that the kitchen is next to the road, and as a result, the exhaust fan draws in the dust raised from the road.
    However, it must be stated that the responsibility for this waste cannot be entirely attributed to the designers. There are more lessons to be learned. First of all, the leadership of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is responsible. The preliminary design approval clearly stated: "Because the design adopts higher standards, the cost cannot be the same as other buildings, so the investment must be increased." Although this refers to the second investment plan, from an ideological point of view, they are willing to improve the standards. Why should the "design building" be different from general buildings! The state has long required all enterprise cadres to rationally and economically use state funds and use the funds in the most urgent places to ensure that the forces are concentrated on developing heavy industry and accelerating the speed of socialist industrialization. Judging from the approval of the "design building" design, the leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company did not adhere to the principle and implement the policy of economy. Although the words "strive to be concise and economical" were also written on the approval, they were only proposed "under the condition that the integrity of the entire building is not affected in the decoration." Precisely because they agreed to this wrong design ideologically, although some extravagant decorations were cut off during construction, the wrong parts were certainly not thoroughly corrected, and they failed to check this project in time. On the contrary, they agreed to repeatedly add investment. The Ministry of Heavy Industry did not conduct a specific review when reviewing and approving this design, and it was too late when waste was discovered, and no decisive measures were taken to solve it, and it continued to agree to increase investment, resulting in the waste of more state funds. Neglecting this aspect of leadership thinking is the main reason for the waste. This is a very serious lesson. Another lies in the fact that the leading cadres of the design company neglected to regularly strengthen the political and ideological education of the designers, especially regularly educating the designers to pay attention to saving state funds in the design, and educating the designers to correctly understand that the growth rate of people's material living standards must be subordinate to the growth rate of production. Before this design, the leaders of the design company not only agreed to the wasteful design of the "design building", but also supported the construction drawing design without technical design, and no one was designated to be responsible during the design process, and no comparison of various design schemes was made. As a result, construction was guided by a design with very high construction standards. Furthermore, the planning, materials, and finance departments relaxed their supervisory responsibilities in this matter. During the construction of the "design building", the planning department only helped to add investment plans and helped to submit applications for approval from higher authorities. It did not investigate the reasons for the overspending after it was discovered, and did not offer any opinions; the materials department and the equipment department knew that the materials stipulated by the design were in violation of general construction standards, but not only did they not offer any opinions, but also helped to purchase them; the finance department only issued investment and settled accounts afterwards, neither controlling it in advance nor inspecting it during the construction process. By the time it was discovered that the investment was exceeded, "the rice was already cooked." These departments took a liberal attitude on this matter, opening the door to waste. The construction department also had waste phenomena in the construction process, and was also responsible to a certain extent.
    For this matter, the manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company responsible for leading the design company and the manager of the Ferrous Metallurgical Design Company both wrote written self-criticisms, expressing their willingness to accept criticism and punishment from higher authorities, and conducted education among the designers through this matter. The "Heavy Industry Communications" published by the Ministry of Heavy Industry also published an editorial entitled "Opposing Wasteful Architectural Design", focusing on criticizing the leadership of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. These practices are necessary and correct. However, since this kind of error is relatively common, and some of the lessons learned have universal significance, it is necessary to expose them here so that all agencies and enterprises can learn from them, and resolutely criticize the tendency to simply pursue high standards and luxury in general construction without implementing the state investment policy, so as to ensure the rational and economical use of state funds, and to prevent the situation of reviewing after wasting state funds from happening again.

### 接受鞍山设计大楼工程浪费的教训

    接受鞍山设计大楼工程浪费的教训
    本报记者　顾雷
    鞍山钢铁公司黑色冶金设计公司的办公大楼，主楼是四层，加上地下室和矗立在主楼上的尖塔共九层，是鞍山市所有民用建筑中最高的一个。
    这座楼的全部设计是黑色冶金设计公司自己做的，原计划投资是一百八十万元。初步设计于一九五三年三月底完成，投资升至二百四十一万元。重工业部批准了这个设计，把投资削减为二百三十万元。一九五三年五月份开工，十月份已盖起了四层，这时才编出投资预算，发觉需要三百三十一万的投资，其建筑面积已不是一万五千平方公尺，而是一万七千平方公尺了。建筑单位便将超支部分报重工业部，请求追加投资。结果，重工业部又批给六十九万九千四百元。还是不够！工程竣工后，根据基本建设财务处的决算的结果，支出的投资竟达四百一十九万九千五百元，超过重工业部第一次批准的控制数一百八十九万九千五百元，除去特殊批准的某些工程及通讯设备、流动家具外，所盖的一万五千八百八十平方公尺的房子用去三百七十八万元，每平方公尺的造价近二百四十元。但楼的使用面积还不到建筑面积百分之五十。
    “设计大楼”是应该盖的，但它并非是一个特殊的建筑，在没有经过特别的批准时，完全应该依照国家批准的控制指标使用投资，然而他们没有这样做。因此，应该说，凡是超支的部分都是浪费。以重工业部第二次批准的投资数为准，其浪费的数字应是一百二十万元。这就是说，在四百一十九万九千五百元的投资中，浪费的竟占百分之二十八强。如果依照重工业部第一次批准的投资计划计算，则超支一百八十万余元。
    浪费的主要原因之一是设计人员进行设计时，没有考虑如何保证合理地、节省地使用国家资金。他们在初步设计说明书上特别强调“本建筑位于鞍山市中心广场，……，面临通往火车站的大路，为外来旅客必经之途。故本建筑必须加上尖塔，俾使外来旅客，在下火车后或在其他远处，可以看见作为市中心的标帜。”于是就在楼顶盖了一个很高的尖塔。“设计大楼”的建筑标准是相当高的。目前，国家规定一般办公室的楼层高度是三点五公尺至四公尺，这里是四点五公尺到五公尺；一般建筑的地板厚两公分，这里原设计是四公分，实际上是按四点五公分下料；一般办公大楼的楼梯是混凝土做的，这里用钢的结构。一般建筑门窗用的“小五金”禁止用铜，这里都是铜的；一般建筑的暖气沟用砖砌，这里用钢筋混凝土。为了提高建筑标准，竟机械地搬用工业建筑的方法。这里锅炉房的防水层不是用沥青、麻布，而是用金属防水箱。三十三公尺高的烟囱，内部的衬砖全部用耐火砖砌成。这里本可以用自然通风，也采用了工厂中必须用的机械通风。过多地考虑装饰，也大大增加了投资。为了表现建筑的“庄严”和“雄伟”，尖塔周围有四个灯塔。在外墙四楼、七楼伸出一点二公尺长、一点一三公尺高的混凝土飞檐。为了墙的侧面立影的美，在墙面上突出很厚的假镶的砖柱和圆柱、腰线，加大了地基。“勒脚”（墙的靠地面部分）全部贴上天然花岗石片，只此一项就花了四万多元。内部的装饰也是过份了！如食堂的地面用比普通水泥价钱高十几倍的白水泥。更令人费解的是花了很多钱而不考虑使用问题。“图库”是设计机关的“宝库”，要防潮、防火、防水，要和一切可能导致各种危险的东西隔绝。但设计人员在设计这个“图库”时，花很大力量设计了一个“连拱”式的门，却让许多水管、暖气管、瓦斯管通过“图库”，而且都露在外面，这是十分危险的。别处都有机械通风，而需要防潮、防霉的“图库”反而没有通风装置；因为要机械通风，连厨房里都是，但并未考虑厨房靠着马路，结果抽风机把路上扬起的尘土都抽进来。
      但，必须说明，绝不能把这一浪费的责任全推在设计人员身上，其中还有更多的教训。首先，鞍山钢铁公司领导上是有责任的。在初步设计批准书上明白地写着：“由于设计采用较高的标准，因之造价不能与其他建筑物相同，故得升高投资。”尽管这是指第二次投资计划说的，但从思想上看，是愿意提高标准的。为什么“设计大楼”就要和一般建筑不同呢！国家很早就要求所有企业的干部，必须合理地、节省地使用国家资金，把资金用到最急需的地方，以保证集中力量发展重工业，加速社会主义工业化的速度。从批准“设计大楼”的设计看来，鞍山钢铁公司和黑色冶金设计公司的领导人没有坚持原则、贯彻节约这一方针。虽然在批准书上也写了“力求精简、俾资节约”的字样，只是在
  “在装修上不影响整个建筑完整性的条件下”提出的。正因为在思想上同意这一错误的设计，尽管在施工中曾削掉一部分奢华的装饰，当然不会彻底纠正错误部分，也就未能及时对这一工程进行检查，相反地却同意一再追加投资。重工业部在审查、批准这一设计时，未作具体审查，及至发现有浪费为时已晚，而又没有采取果断的办法解决，并继续同意增加投资，以致浪费了国家更多的资金。领导思想对这方面的忽视，是造成浪费的主要原因，这是个很严重的教训。另外一个，还在于设计公司的领导干部，忽视了经常加强设计人员的政治思想教育，特别是经常教育设计人员在设计中注意节省国家的资金，教育设计人员正确认识人民物质生活水平的增长速度必须服从生产的增长速度。在这个设计之前，设计公司领导上不但同意了“设计大楼”这一浪费的设计，而且支持在没有技术设计时就进行施工图设计，而在设计过程中，又没有确定专人负责，又不进行各种设计方案的比较。结果，就用建筑标准很高的设计指导施工。再一个，是计划、材料、财务部门在这件事情上放松了监督的责任。在“设计大楼”修建过程中，计划处只做到了帮助追加投资计划、帮助呈请上级批准，发现超支后也不追究原因，不提出意见；材料处和设备处知道设计所规定的材料是违反一般建筑标准的，不但未提出意见，而且帮助购买；财务部门，只是发给投资和事后算账，既不事先控制，也未在施工过程中进行检查，待发觉投资超过时“生米已煮成熟饭”。这些部门在这件事情上采取自由主义态度，给浪费开了方便之门。施工部门在施工中也有浪费现象，同样负有一定的责任。
    为这件事，鞍山钢铁公司负责领导设计公司的经理、黑色冶金设计公司的经理都写了书面检讨，表示愿意接受上级的批评和处分，并通过这件事在设计人员中进行过教育。重工业部出版的“重工业通讯”又以“反对浪费的建筑设计”为题发表社论，着重批评了鞍山钢铁公司的领导。这些做法都是必要的、正确的。但由于这种错误比较普遍，其中的一些教训也有普遍意义，有必要在这里揭发出来，使一切机关和企业部门引以为戒，切实批判在一般建筑上单纯追求高标准、追求奢华不执行国家投资方针的倾向，以保证合理地、节省地使用国家资金，以求浪费了国家资金之后再进行检讨的事情不再发生。
