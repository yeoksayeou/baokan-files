Old "Model Village"

Liu Qingyan Sun Zhenzhu

In Zhuanghe County, Liaoning Province, when you mention Ganggou Village in Chengguan District, every cadre knows it is a famous old "model village."

The so-called "model village" is named because of "pilot projects." It is not accidental that Ganggou Village became a "model village" because it is only three miles away from the county seat, the terrain is flat, the residents are concentrated, and mutual cooperation is developing well with six agricultural production cooperatives. Various departments have taken a fancy to it, and when they want to test something, they think of Ganggou Village. Ganggou Village has thus become an old "model village."

Since becoming a "model village," Ganggou Village has become lively. Throughout the year, there is an endless stream of people coming to conduct pilot projects. Taking 1954 as an example, not counting the people from the province and county who came to conduct typical investigations, there were more than 30 groups who came for pilot projects alone. The county party committee's rural work group's production plan pilot project, the district's agricultural technology pilot project, the district's credit pilot project, the county party committee's grain purchase pilot project, the civil affairs section's administrative organization improvement pilot project, the culture and education section's middle school results announcement work pilot project, the health section's maternal and child health pilot project... Oh, it's really countless pilot projects!

In June 1954, the county party committee's cooperative building work group and the county's draft constitution propaganda work group came one after another. Twenty days later, the village cadres had just sent away these two groups when the county culture and education section's "middle school results announcement work pilot group" and the credit cooperative pilot group arrived one after another. Then came the increased production and guaranteed harvest pilot project, the social investigation pilot project...

Their working method was to first grab the village cadres, and everyone said that their work was the "central task."

With so many "central tasks," of course, there would be times when they would bump into each other. So, one could often hear conversations like this: "Hey, you're here too?"
"Yes, why are you here too?" At this time, both sides felt a little uncomfortable: the real "center" feared that the "non-center" would get in the way, while the "non-center" feared that the center would overwhelm everything and squeeze out their own "center." By November, the civil affairs section's administrative organization improvement pilot work group had arrived. While this pilot work was in progress, the county party committee's grain purchase pilot work group arrived again. Grain purchase was naturally more important at that time, so the administrative organization improvement pilot group had to hurriedly reorganize the local administrative group, notify them that "your village is now Group ×," and then return. Before they left, they severely criticized the village head, saying that he "did not pay attention to administrative work."

As soon as the civil affairs section's work group left, the county health section's maternal and child health pilot group arrived. The village cadres were busy with other work and did not have much time to accompany them, so the pilot group stayed for seven days, only found a few old midwives, held two days of meetings, and then returned. Before leaving, they gave the village cadres another scolding. A comrade Yu from the pilot group said indignantly: "Your village cadres value grain purchase and do not value maternal and child health work. I will definitely write a notice when I get back to the county!" Write it if you want, what can we do?

Before the grain purchase work was finished, the county government's "pig raising pilot work group" arrived. They came and immediately looked for the village head and party branch secretary. At that time, they were in a meeting, so the work group stayed overnight at the Zhongxing Cooperative of the sixth group. The next day before noon, the village head and branch secretary were still at a branch meeting. The branch secretary spared five minutes to meet the work group and said, "Our meeting cannot be stopped. We will discuss it with you after the meeting." Fine, anyway, they wouldn't start work without contacting the branch secretary and village head, so the comrades of the work group were determined to wait. The six of them lay down, sat up, slept, and chatted at the home of clerk Yu Youzhang, waiting until the branch meeting broke up at 3:00 p.m.

During the slack farming season, four groups came in three months; during the grain purchase period, five groups came in one month, and five other groups left because they bumped into each other. The village cadres really couldn't stand this "wheel war" style pilot projects. Let's calculate, each pilot project takes at least five days and up to a month. The party branch secretary, village head, youth league branch secretary, women's director, and other cadres have to accompany them from beginning to end. How much time do they have to do specific work and engage in production? Village head Sheng Guangde only managed to do more than 70 workdays during the spring and autumn harvest seasons in the year he participated in the cooperative, spending all his time running errands. Once, after branch secretary Sui Xijun and the county party committee work group finished discussing the increased production and guaranteed harvest work, he was about to go to Yangdianzi Village when he ran into the "middle school results announcement work pilot group" as soon as he went out, so he had to come back and sit there for half a day.

However, no one could be neglected! Because everyone said they were doing "central work." The branch secretary sighed and said: "I don't know what the central task is. I'll just dedicate myself to it. Anyway, everything is central, everyone is a superior, and I'll deal with whoever comes!"

Logically speaking, it would be very good for a village to have work groups from the district, county, and even province coming to conduct pilot projects frequently: the work is lacking a plan, and the work group brings the plan; the work is having difficulties, and the work group comes to help solve them. Why wouldn't the village cadres welcome them? But they are afraid that regardless of the time, regardless of the village's situation, various pilot groups and work groups from above will flock to the same "model village," making the village cadres overwhelmed and dizzy, not knowing which end to take care of, and the village's daily work order is completely disrupted. No wonder some people call this phenomenon "too much focus becomes a disaster."

"In any given area, there cannot be many central tasks at the same time. At any given time, there can only be one central task, supplemented by other secondary and tertiary tasks." (Mao Zedong: "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership") If our pilot groups and work groups could understand the relationship between their own work and the current central task, or at least be considerate of the situation at the grassroots level, and not make a big splash as soon as they arrive, casually holding meetings, asking for this statistic, asking for that material, but instead quietly go to the masses to conduct investigations and research, and act as propagandists, truly helping the work of the village cadres – the village cadres would never mind having more of such work groups.

However, from the perspective of higher-level leaders, it is not very good to allow various work groups to always go to an old "model village" to conduct pilot projects. The purpose of our pilot projects is to gain experience and promote it comprehensively. Although this old "model village" is relatively easy to gain experience because of its good foundation and advancement, it is precisely because of this that the experience created here is often not applicable to general villages, let alone backward villages. It is very doubtful what the effect is of coming to this old "model village" to gather experience for everything.

Moreover, it is almost a rule: when the "model" becomes lively, the "surface" is always very desolate. Comrades who are keen on running to "model villages," I hope you will broaden your horizons. Perhaps when the old "model village" is tired of you, the vast "surface" is waiting for you with eager eyes!

### 老“点村”

    老“点村”
    刘青艳　孙振珠
    在辽宁省庄河县，一提起城关区的干沟村，每一个干部都知道它是个鼎鼎大名的老“点村”。
    所谓“点村”，是因“试点”而得名的。干沟村成为“点村”不是偶然的，因为它离县城只有三里路，地势平坦，居民集中，互助合作发展得好，有六个农业生产合作社。它就被各个部门看中了，要试什么点，一想就想到干沟村。干沟村就这样成了老“点村”。
    自从成了“点村”以后，干沟村可就热闹起来了。一年四季，来试点的络绎不绝。单拿一九五四年来说，省、县里来人作典型调查的不算，光来试点的就有三十多帮。县委农村组的生产计划试点，区的农业技术试点，区的信贷试点，县委的购粮试点，民政科的健全行政组织试点，文教科的中学发榜工作试点，卫生科的妇幼保健试点……嗳哟，真是数不完的试点！
    一九五四年六月间，县委建社工作组和县宪法草案宣传工作组先后来到。二十多天之后，村干部刚送走这两个组，县文教科的“中学发榜工作试点组”和信贷社试点小组又接踵而至。接着是增产保收试点，社会调查试点……。
    他们的工作方法都是首先抓住村干部，而且谁都说自己的工作是“中心工作”。
    这么多的“中心工作”，当然会有碰头的时候。所以常常能听到这样的对话：“哎，你也来了？”
  “是啊，怎么你也来了？”这时双方都有些不自在：那真正的“中心”怕“非中心”会碍事，而
  “非中心”又怕中心压倒一切，挤掉自己的“中心”。到十一月，民政科的健全行政组织试点工作组来了。这个试点工作正在进行，县委购粮试点工作组又来了。购粮在当时自然更要紧，健全行政组织试点组只好匆匆地改编了当地的行政组，通知一下“你屯现在是第×组”，就回去了。他们临走前把村长狠狠批评了一通，说是“不重视行政工作”。
    民政科工作组刚走，县卫生科妇幼保健试点组来了。村干部正忙于其他工作，没有多少时间奉陪，试点组呆了七天，只找了几个旧产婆开了两天会，就回去了。临走时又给村干部一顿批评。试点组的一位于同志愤愤不平地说：“你们这村干部，重视购粮，不重视妇幼保健工作，回县非写个通报不可！”写就写吧，有什么办法呢？
    购粮工作还未做完，又来了县政府的“发展毛猪试点工作组”。一来就找村长和党支部书记，当时他们正在开会，工作组就到第六组众生合作社住了一宿。第二天午前，村长和支部书记还是在开支部会，支部书记抽出五分钟见了工作组，说：“我们会议不能停止，待开完会再和你们研究。”好吧，反正不和支部书记、村长接头就不开始工作，工作组的同志们决心等待了。他们六位在文书于有章家里横倒竖卧地睡觉、谈天，一直等到午后三点钟支部散会。
    在挂锄时期，三个月中间来了四帮；购粮时期，一个月工夫来了五帮，因碰头而走的还有五帮。村干部实在受不了这种“车轮大战”式的试点。我们不妨算一下，每试一次点，少则五天，多则一个月，党支部书记、村长、团支部书记、妇女主任等干部，总得从头陪到最后。他们还有多少时间做具体工作和搞生产呢？村长盛光德参加合作社一年，只在春秋两季抽空做了七十多个劳动日，时间都花在跑腿上了。有一次支部书记隋希君和县委工作组研究完增产保收工作，刚要到杨甸子屯去，一出门就碰见了“中学发榜工作试点组”，只好回来，一坐就是一头晌。
    可是，谁来都不能怠慢啊！因为大家都说自己干的是“中心工作”。支部书记叹着气说：“不知到底什么是中心工作，我就豁出这一个人，反正事事是中心，人人是上级，谁来我就应付谁！”
    按理说，一个村能够经常有区、县甚至省的工作组来试点，那是很不错的：工作正缺少方案，工作组把方案带来了；工作正有困难，工作组来帮助解决了。村干部怎么不欢迎呢？可是他们怕的是：也不问什么时间，不顾村里的情况，上面的各种性质的试点组、工作组，一起拥到同一个“点村”里来，把村干部忙得人仰马翻，蒙头转向，不知顾哪一头好，村里的日常工作秩序就完全被破坏了。怪不得有人把这种现象叫做“重点成灾”。
      “在任何一个地区内，不能同时有许多中心工作，在一定时间内只能有一个中心工作，辅以别的第二位、第三位的工作。”（毛主席：“关于领导方法的若干问题”）如果我们的试点组、工作组都能理解自己的工作和当前中心工作的关系，或者至少能体谅一些下情，不是一来就兴师动众，随便开会，要这个统计，要那个材料，而是不声张地到群众中去作调查研究，作宣传员，真正帮助了村干部的工作——对于这样的工作组，村干部是决不会嫌多的。
    不过从高一级的领导上讲，允许各种工作组老是到一个老“点村”去试点，总是不大好的。我们试点的目的是取得经验，向全面推广；这种老“点村”虽然由于基础好、先进而比较容易取得经验，但是也正因为如此，在这里创造出来的经验，往往不一定适用于一般村，更不必说是落后村了。什么经验都到这个老“点村”来摸，其效果是很值得怀疑的。
    而且，几乎是一种规律：“点”搞得热闹了，“面”总是冷清得很。热中于跑“点村”的同志们，希望你们把目光放得更宽更远一些。也许当老“点村”对你们已感到厌烦的时候，广大的“面”却在眼巴巴地等待着你们去呢！
