    Mobilize Cooperative Members to Actively Invest and Expand Production
    Su Nong
    At present, the work of establishing and expanding agricultural production cooperatives in various regions has been largely completed, and agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are carrying out or preparing for spring plowing. However, the problem of production funds for many new cooperatives this year has not yet been resolved; some old cooperatives have also not resolved this problem well. A considerable number of cooperative members are unwilling to invest in the cooperative. Many cooperatives lack the fertilizers, fodder, and seeds needed for spring plowing. According to a survey conducted in Yan厝乡, Longxi County, Fujian Province, at the end of January, the existing production investment in all cooperatives in the township accounted for only a little over 26% of the required amount. This is a serious problem in the current spring plowing preparation work. This is directly related to whether the cooperative's production can be successful this year, and will affect the consolidation and improvement of the cooperative.

    Regarding this issue, many cooperative cadres currently have blindly optimistic sentiments. They believe: "Since the masses can set up cooperatives, what is the problem with investment?" "The boat will naturally straighten when it reaches the bridgehead, no need to worry." Some comrades, seeing that cooperative members are unwilling to invest, are at a loss and do not know what to do.

    The problem of production funds is the first problem encountered by agricultural production cooperatives when they put into production. This problem clearly reflects the contradiction between the private psychology of small farmers and the collective operation of cooperatives. Many cooperative members only care about their own small calculations and do not care about the cooperative's production. They believe: After joining the cooperative, the lack of seeds and fertilizers is no longer their own business; production is the responsibility of the cooperative director, if there is no money, loans can be obtained from the government, and they can "enjoy the cool under the big tree." Some new cooperative members want to rely on the investment of old cooperative members, and do not invest or invest less themselves. Some old cooperative members advocate converting all public property into shares, and asking new cooperative members to pay a share, fearing that new cooperative members will take advantage of them. Some cooperative members put the fertilizer they have accumulated in their private plots and are unwilling to invest in the cooperative. The cooperative members' land has been put into the cooperative, and the livestock is beginning to be used uniformly by the cooperative, but some people are unwilling to put the seeds and fodder left over from selling grain into the cooperative. Some cooperative members, upon hearing that they have to invest, eat or sell the seeds. Some cooperative members have a lot of money saved, but they only plan to build houses and buy bicycles, and are unwilling to invest in the cooperative as production funds. Some cooperative members joined the cooperative in order to take advantage of national assistance; after joining the cooperative, they are unwilling to invest. Some cooperative cadres also have the idea of relying on government loans, believing: "Borrowing some money from the government will do, why bother to mobilize cooperative members to invest in this way?"

    These phenomena are bound to occur in the process of changing production relations. After the peasants join the cooperative, they change from individual production to collective production, but the selfish psychology of small producers cannot be completely eliminated overnight. Therefore, on the one hand, the solution of this problem cannot be taken too lightly; on the other hand, there is no need to be alarmed by these phenomena.

    To mobilize cooperative members to invest, first of all, it is necessary to do a good job in ideological mobilization and raise the socialist consciousness of cooperative members. It is necessary to make all cooperative members understand that the interests of the cooperative and the interests of the cooperative members are consistent; only through everyone's efforts and joint management can the cooperative increase production; only when the cooperative's production continues to develop can the individual income of cooperative members continue to increase. At the same time, it is necessary to explain to the cooperative members that the interests of the state and the interests of the cooperative members are also consistent; if they put more funds into production and require fewer state loans, the state can use more money for economic construction, which is beneficial to both the state and themselves. The production funds of the Qunfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, could not be collected at first. The cooperative cadres saw that the cooperative had been established and thought that "everything was going well", and did not promptly mobilize cooperative members to invest; the cooperative members thought that "after joining the cooperative, good or bad is not my family's business", and did not care about the cooperative's affairs, and said "there are difficulties" when it came to investment. Later, the cooperative cadres reviewed the shortcomings of relaxing production leadership to the cooperative members, mobilized the cooperative members to discuss investment issues, and gave the cooperative members a detailed account: There are 30,000 cooperatives in the province, if everyone wants state loans, it will disperse state funds and tractors will not be able to be built, which is not good for the state or for themselves. Zhao Fuquan, a member of the cooperative affairs committee, also calculated his own account. He said: "Originally, I was like everyone else, only caring about myself, and felt heartache when it came to investing production funds. I did not see that if I don't invest now, production will not be good, and income will be reduced. Later, I figured it out: if I use the money from selling surplus grain for production, if I can distribute five more catties of rice per labor day in the future, my family will distribute five hundred more catties of rice for one hundred labor days. If I use it to buy white fine cloth, my whole family of six can be wrapped in cloth. Isn't this something that benefits both the cooperative and myself?" After talking like this, everyone understood the principle of "if there is something in the pot, there will be something in the bowl", and they all actively put the money from selling grain into the cooperative.

    One of the reasons why cooperative members in many regions are not enthusiastic about investing is that the policy has not been thoroughly publicized, or the investment methods are not specific or complete, and some cooperative members still have concerns about investing. Some are afraid of "losing out" or "showing off their wealth" if they invest early or invest more, some are afraid that people will say that they did not thoroughly sell grain if they take out seeds, and some are afraid that "it will be easy to invest and difficult to take out", and they all want to wait and see how others act. For this part of the cooperative members, it is necessary to clarify the policy of unified grain purchase, the principle of mutual benefit in running cooperatives, the standards for investment, and the methods for returning capital and paying interest, to eliminate their concerns. You can also use methods such as calculating detailed accounts to make cooperative members understand that investing more and investing early is not only not a loss, but also has interest to gain, and encourage cooperative members to invest more and invest early. If the existing investment methods are not perfect, they should be revised in a timely manner by mobilizing cooperative members to discuss them democratically.

    The funds that cooperative members invest in the cooperative can be divided into two types: one is the share fund; the other is the general investment. There are also two main types of funds needed by the cooperative: one is the production fund; the other is the basic construction fund. When mobilizing cooperative members to invest, these should be distinguished and treated differently. The share fund is a part of the funds shared by cooperative members when joining the cooperative according to the land (cooperatives with very low land remuneration can also share according to the proportion of land and labor); after sharing the share fund according to regulations, if the cooperative's funds are still insufficient, cooperative members can be mobilized to invest again. Generally speaking, the share fund is a must for every cooperative member (poor cooperative members can postpone or reduce the payment, and individual extremely poor cooperative members can be exempted); investment is according to the cooperative member's economic ability, invest more if you have more, invest less if you have less. The share fund does not give interest and cannot be withdrawn at ordinary times, and can be taken away at the original amount when withdrawing from the cooperative; investment other than the share fund can give interest (not exceeding the interest rate of bank loans to cooperatives); some investments (such as manure) can also be agreed to only be priced and not to pay interest. Investments used in the production of the current year should be returned after the harvest of the current year, except for disaster relief measures that should be discussed by the cooperative members' meeting; investments used in basic construction (including the purchase of draught animals, agricultural implements, farmland water conservancy, afforestation, etc.) can generally be returned within five years. Cooperative members' seeds, fertilizers, and fodder, brought into the cooperative according to the land and livestock, can be priced as share funds, and the amount exceeding the share fund that should be paid can be used as investment. When cooperative members' cattle and agricultural implements are priced and transferred to the cooperative for public ownership, the amount due can be offset against the share fund. If the amount due is not enough for the share fund that should be allocated, it can be made up in installments within five years; if it is more than the amount that should be allocated, the excess part will be used as personal investment, and the cooperative will pay it off in installments within five years. Cooperative members can pay the share fund and investment in kind such as fertilizer or in cash. Newly established cooperatives need working capital for production, and cooperative members should be mobilized to pay a part of the cash. Some cooperative cadres are unwilling to receive in kind and ask cooperative members to pay entirely in cash, as a result, the existing means of production in the homes of cooperative members are useless and they cannot pay the cash. This practice is detrimental to both the cooperative and the cooperative members.

    When formulating production investment plans, agricultural production cooperatives should adhere to the spirit of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" based on production needs, and strive to save money, reduce production costs, and not burden cooperative members too much. Some cooperatives do not start with production first, but are busy spreading out the stalls and adding cars and horses; when cooperative members see "poor production and a lot of debt", they dare not invest in the cooperative. The calculation of the share fund should also be based on facts and seek truth from facts, limited to what most cooperative members can afford. In areas with two or three harvests a year, cooperative members can be allowed to pay the share fund and investment in installments. If the share fund and investment paid by cooperative members are indeed not enough to meet the needs of production, money can be borrowed from banks or credit cooperatives.

    It should be noted that the handling of investment issues is closely related to the unity of poor and middle peasants in the cooperative. There have now been some cooperatives where the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants has occurred. The relatively wealthy middle peasant cooperative members demand equal investment and squeeze out poor peasants. Some middle peasant cooperative members said: "Let the poor peasants take it out first! Ours is ready-made, locked in the cupboard! We will take it out when they take it out." Wang Yueliang (a wealthy household), the director of an agricultural production cooperative in Xinfu Village, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, said to six poor households in the cooperative: "You were the most determined when the cooperative was established, are you still determined this time? If you are determined, you have to take things to the cooperative." In the Qigan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linpu Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, five of the nineteen cooperative members were poor peasants who could not afford to pay the share fund, and the middle peasants in the cooperative forced the poor peasants to withdraw from the cooperative. Some cooperatives also used the method of "estimating family assets" to force poor peasants to invest more. This greatly dampened the enthusiasm of poor peasants to participate in cooperatives. There are also some cooperatives that do not pay attention to persuasion and education to middle peasant cooperative members, but only generally call for "investing more if you have more" or use administrative orders to force middle peasants to invest more, without explaining how to return it or how to calculate interest; the middle peasants believe that this is "digging the flesh of the middle peasants to fill the pit of the poor peasants", and are unwilling to take out money even if they have it.

    The method of dividing the share fund according to land and investing "more if you have more, less if you have less" is reasonable and beneficial to both poor and middle peasants. If cooperative members invest more, the production of the entire cooperative will develop, and they can share more dividends and get a certain amount of interest. If middle peasants invest more, it can solve the difficulties of poor cooperative members who cannot afford to invest temporarily, and the labor enthusiasm of poor cooperative members can be improved, which is good for developing production and strengthening the unity of poor and middle peasant cooperative members. Generally, middle peasant cooperative members have a higher investment capacity, and they have already prepared the seeds, fertilizers, etc. needed for this year before joining the cooperative, and investment is not difficult. Local experience proves that as long as cooperative members can be told the truth, poor peasant cooperative members and middle peasant cooperative members will actively support this method. Some wealthy middle peasant cooperative members in the Second and Third Cooperatives in Daoling Village, Baicheng County, Jilin Province, originally advocated that everyone should take out horse feed before they were willing to bring their horses to the cooperative for centralized production; they wanted good horse feed and they wanted to take it out all at once, in order to embarrass the poor peasant cooperative members. Later, after conducting socialist education for wealthy middle peasants and conducting individual persuasion according to everyone's thoughts, they all agreed to take out horse feed according to their own ability. Among the forty-six cooperative members, twenty-six cooperative members took it out all at once, twelve cooperative members took it out on a deferred basis, seven cooperative members took out less, and one cooperative member did not take it out; interest was given at the credit cooperative interest rate for those who took out more, and everyone was very satisfied. Some cooperative cadres only see the point that poor peasants cannot afford to pay, and doubt the policy of "relying on poor peasants", which is wrong; it is even more wrong to exclude poor peasants for this problem.

    发动社员积极投资扩大生产
    苏农
    目前各地建立和扩大农业生产合作社的工作已经大体结束，各地的农业生产合作社正在进行春耕或准备春耕。但是，很多新社今年的生产资金问题还没有解决；有些老社对于这个问题也解决得不好。相当多的一部分社员不愿向社里投资。许多社春耕需要的肥料、饲料和种籽都没有着落。据福建省龙溪县颜厝乡一月底的调查，全乡各社现有的生产投资只占需要数的百分之二十六多一点。这是当前各社春耕准备工作中的一个严重问题。这直接关系着各社今年的生产能不能搞好，而且会影响到社的巩固和提高。
    对待这个问题，目前还有不少办社干部有盲目乐观情绪。他们认为：“群众既能办社，投资还成什么问题？”“船到桥门自然直，不用操心。”另一些同志看到社员不肯投资，又束手无策，不知怎么办才好。
    生产资金问题是农业生产合作社投入生产时首先遇到的一个问题。在这个问题上，明显地反映出小农的私有心理和合作社集体经营的矛盾。许多社员只顾打自己的小算盘，对社里的生产不关心。他们认为：入了社，缺种籽缺肥料不是自己一个人的事了；生产有社长负责，没钱向政府贷款，自己可以“大树底下乘风凉”了。有些新社员想依靠老社员的投资，自己不投资或少投资。有些老社员主张把所有的公共财产折成股，叫新社员照纳一份，唯恐新社员沾了自己的光。有些社员把自己积的肥料下在自留地里，不愿向社里投资。社员的土地入了社，牲畜开始由社统一使用，但有些人不肯把卖粮时留下的种籽和饲料入到社里。有些社员听说要投资，就把种籽吃掉、卖掉。有些社员存着不少钱，只是打算自己盖房子、买自行车，不愿投到社里做生产资金。有些社员是为了沾国家援助的便宜才入社的；入社后要他们投资，他们就不肯干了。有的社干部也有依赖政府贷款的思想，认为：“向政府借些钱就行了，何必这样费力去动员社员投资？”
    这些现象是在生产关系改变过程中必然会发生的。农民入了社，由个体生产变为集体生产，但是小生产者的自私心理不是一朝一夕能够完全消除的。因此，一方面不能把这个问题的解决看得太轻易了；另方面也不必看到这些现象就大惊小怪。
    发动社员投资，首先要做好思想发动工作，提高社员的社会主义觉悟。要使全体社员懂得：合作社的利益和社员利益是一致的；只有大家努力，共同经营，合作社才能增产；合作社的生产不断发展，社员个人收入才能不断增加。同时要向社员说明：国家利益和社员的利益也是一致的；自己多拿出资金来生产，少要国家贷款，国家就可以把更多的钱用来进行经济建设，这样做对国家、对自己都有利。江苏无锡县群丰农业生产合作社的生产资金起初一直收不齐。社干部看见社建起来了，以为“万事大吉”了，没有及时发动社员投资；社员以为“入了社，好坏不是我一家”，也不管社里的事，提起投资都说“有困难”。后来社干部向社员检讨了放松生产领导的缺点，发动社员讨论投资问题，并给社员算了细账：全省现有三万个社，如果大家都要国家贷款，就会分散国家资金，拖拉机造不出来，对国家对自己都不利。社务委员赵富泉又算了自家的账，他说：“原来我和大家一样，只顾到自己，对要出生产资金感到心痛，没有看到现在不投资，生产就搞不好，收入也就要减少。后来我想通了：如果把卖余粮的钱用在生产上，日后一个劳动日如果能多分五斤稻，我家做一百个劳动日，就要多分五百斤稻，若是拿来买白细布，一家六个人就包在布里了。这不是利社又利己的事吗？”这样拉开来一谈，大家明白了“锅里有，碗里才有”的道理，就都积极把卖粮的钱投到社里。
    许多地区社员投资积极性不高的一个原因是政策宣传得不透彻，或者投资的办法规定得不具体、不完备，有些社员对投资还有顾虑。有的怕早投、多投了“吃亏”、“露富”，有的怕拿出种籽来人家说他卖粮不彻底，有的怕“投进去容易拿出来难”，都想等一等，看人家行事。对待这一部分社员，要针对他们的不同思想，讲清粮食统购政策，办社的互利原则，投资的标准和还本付息的办法，消除他们的顾虑。还可以采用算细账等方法，使社员了解多投、早投不但不吃亏，还有利息可得，鼓励社员多投、早投。现有投资办法订得不完善的，应及时发动社员民主讨论加以修订。
    社员投到社里的资金可以分为两种：一种是股份基金；一种是一般的投资。社里所需要的最主要的资金也有两种：一种是生产资金；一种是基本建设资金。在发动社员投资时，应当把这些分别清楚，采取不同的办法分别对待。股份基金是社员入社时按土地分摊的一部分资金（土地报酬很低的社也可以按土地、劳力各占一定比例分摊）；按规定分摊了股份基金以后，如果社里的资金仍然不足，可以再发动社员投资。股份基金一般地说是每个社员必须交的（贫苦社员可以缓交、少交，个别极贫苦的社员可以免交）；投资则是按照社员的经济能力，多有多投、少有少投。股份基金不给利息，平时不能抽回，退社时可以按原数带走；股份基金以外的投资，可以给利息（不能超过银行对合作社放款的利息）；某些投资（如粪肥等）也可以议定只作价、不行息。用在当年生产上的投资，除了遭受了灾荒应由社员大会商议缓还的办法以外，当年收获以后就归还；用在基本建设方面（包括购买耕畜、农具、兴修农田水利、造林等等）的投资，一般地说可以在五年以内归还。社员的种籽、肥料、饲料，按入社土地和牲畜带进社，可折价作为股份基金，超过应交股份基金数目的可以作为投资。社员的耕牛、农具作价归社公有时，应得价款可以抵作股份基金，如果应得的价款不够应摊的股份基金，可以在五年内分期补足；如果比应摊的多，超过部分作为个人投资，由社在五年内分期还清。社员交股份基金和投资，可以用肥料等实物，也可以用现金。新建的社生产上需要有周转资金，应当动员社员交纳一部分现金。有些社干部不愿意收实物，叫社员完全拿现金，结果社员家中现有的生产资料放着无用，又交不出现金。这样做法对社和社员都是不利的。
    农业生产合作社在制订生产投资计划时，应当根据生产需要，坚持“勤俭办社”的精神，尽量节约，降低生产成本，不使社员负担太重。有的社不先着手搞生产，先忙着铺大摊子，添车买马；社员看到“生产不好、负债不少”，就不敢往社里投资了。计算股份基金也应当实事求是，以多数社员出得起为限，在一年两收或三收的地区，股份基金和投资可以允许社员分期缴纳。如果社员交的股份基金和投资确实不能满足生产的需要，可以向银行或信用社借钱。
    应当注意：投资问题处理得好坏，同社内贫农中农的团结有密切的关系。现在已经有些社在这个问题上发生了排斥贫农的现象，比较富裕的中农社员要求平均投资，挤贫农。有的中农社员说：“叫他们贫农先拿吧！我们的是现成的，在柜里锁着哩！他们拿了我们就拿。”黑龙江讷河县新富村的一个农业生产合作社主任王月亮（富裕户）对社内六户贫困户说：“建社时顶数你们坚决，这回你们还坚决不坚决？坚决就得往社里拿东西。”福建闽侯县林浦乡旗杆农业生产合作社十九户社员中有五户贫农交不起股份基金，社内中农便逼着贫农退社。有的社还采用“估家底”的办法硬挤贫农多投资。这样就大大挫伤了贫农参加合作社的积极性。也有的社对中农社员不注意说服教育，只笼统地号召“多有多投”或者用行政命令的手段硬叫中农多投资，不说明怎样归还，怎样计息；中农认为这是“挖中农的肉，填贫农的坑”，有钱也不愿往外拿。
    按土地分摊股份基金和“多有多投、少有少投”的投资办法是合情合理的，是对贫农和中农都有利的。社员多投资，全社生产发展了，自己可以多分红，还可以得到一定的利息。中农多投资，可以解决贫困社员暂时投不起资的困难，贫困社员的劳动积极性可以提高，对发展生产和加强贫农和中农社员的团结都有好处。一般中农社员投资能力都较高，在入社前对于今年需要的种籽、肥料等已有准备，投资并不困难。各地经验证明：只要能够向社员讲清道理，贫农社员和中农社员都会积极拥护这个办法。吉林省白城县道岭村第二、第三两社部分富裕中农社员，原来主张大家都拿出马料来，他们才肯把马牵到社里集中生产；要拿好马料，而且要一次拿齐，以此来和贫农社员为难。后来向富裕中农进行了社会主义教育，又针对各人思想进行个别说服，他们都同意根据自己能力出马料了。四十六户社员中，有二十六户社员一次拿齐，有十二户社员缓期拿齐，有七户少拿，有一户不拿；多拿的按信用合作社利率给利息，大家都很满意。有一些办社干部，只是看到贫农出不起钱这一点，就对“依靠贫农”的政策发生怀疑，这是不对的；为了这个问题排斥贫农，那就更错误了。
