Xinhua News Agency report: Liaoning Province's total grain output in 1955 is required to reach more than 5.43 million tons. If this production plan can be completed, grain production in 1955 will increase by 300,000 tons compared to the prosperous year of 1954 in most parts of the province.

At present, there are already 31,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Liaoning Province, accounting for about 32 percent of the total number of farm households in the province. This is the main force for striving for increased grain production. At the same time, the province will also carry out various agricultural technical reforms in accordance with local conditions. In 1955, the province plans to promote more than 52,400 new-style animal-powered farm implements; develop mass small-scale water conservancy projects to expand paddy field areas by 23,000 hectares; promote the cultivation area of double-cropping crops from 25,000 hectares to 30,000 hectares; and expand the planting area of various improved varieties by 300,000 hectares. Expanding the planting area of high-yield crops such as rice and corn alone can increase grain production by more than 100,800 tons. In addition, farmers in various regions will promote effective local high-yield experiences, further improve cultivation methods, and strive to increase the yield per unit area of grain crops.

At present, the state has taken many measures to support farmers in developing production. The 14 million yuan agricultural loan issued by the State Bank to farmers during the spring plowing season is being distributed to farmers. Grain departments in various regions have prepared more than 23,476,000 jin of seeds for farmers, of which 1.2 million jin of wheat seeds have been fully distributed to farmers. The agricultural departments have basically completed the plan to train 100,000 technical backbones and accountants for agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the province.

Xinhua News Agency report: In 1955, Shandong Province will increase the planting of high-yield crops and expand intercropping and mixed cropping areas in accordance with local conditions. According to the characteristics of Shandong Province, which has a large population and little land, these measures are important ways to increase grain production.

According to the 1955 plan, the province will increase the planting of corn by 640,000 mu, rice by 90,000 mu, promote the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato by 2.35 million mu, and expand the intercropping and mixed cropping area by 1.5 million mu. Farmers in the Linyi area used to be accustomed to planting low-yield crops such as sorghum and millet; in the past two years, local agriculture and forestry departments have promoted a portion of corn, and farmers have become convinced that planting corn can produce more grain. Therefore, this year the corn planting area in this area will increase from 530,000 mu in 1954 to 970,000 mu. Farmers in the peanut-producing areas of the Jiaodong Peninsula originally had the habit of intercropping peanuts and corn, and this will be vigorously promoted this year. Wheat-producing areas will, according to local conditions, encourage intercropping peanuts, soybeans, or corn before the wheat harvest. At present, farmers in various regions are preparing to increase the planting of high-yield crops and expand intercropping and mixed cropping areas.

    辽宁省今年计划增产粮食三十万吨
    山东省计划增种高产作物和扩大间作、套种面积
    据新华社讯：辽宁省一九五五年粮食总产量要求达到五百四十三万多吨。如能完成这个生产计划，一九五五年比一九五四年全省大部地区丰收的年景可增产粮食三十万吨。
    现在，辽宁省农业生产合作社已发展到三万一千个，占全省农户总数的百分之三十二左右，这是争取粮食增产的主要力量。同时，全省还将因地制宜地开展多方面的农业技术改革。一九五五年全省计划推广新式畜力农具五万二千四百多件；发展群众性的小型水利，扩大水田面积二万三千公顷；推广二季作物的栽培面积两万五千公顷到三万公顷；扩大各种良种种植面积三十万公顷。仅扩大高产作物水稻和玉米播种面积两项，即可增产粮食十万零八千多吨。此外，各地农民并将推广当地行之有效的丰产经验，进一步改进耕作方法，努力提高粮食作物的单位面积产量。
    目前国家已采取了许多扶助农民发展生产的措施。国家银行在春耕时期发给农民的一千四百万元农业贷款，正向农民发放。各地粮食部门为农民准备了二千三百四十七万六千多斤种籽，其中一百二十万斤小麦种已全部发到农民手里。农业部门目前已基本上完成为全省农业生产合作社训练技术骨干和会计员十万人的计划。
    据新华社讯：山东省一九五五年将因地制宜增种高产作物和扩大间作、套种面积。根据山东省人多地少的特点，这些措施是增产粮食的重要办法。
    按照一九五五年的计划，全省将增种玉米六十四万亩、稻子九万亩，推广“胜利百号”甘薯二百三十五万亩，扩大间作、套种面积一百五十万亩。临沂专区农民过去习惯种植产量较低的高粱、穇子等作物；近两年来当地农林部门推广了一部分玉米，农民已相信种玉米能多收粮食。因此，今年这个专区的玉米种植面积将从一九五四年的五十三万亩增加到九十七万亩。胶东半岛花生产区农民原来就有花生、玉米间作的习惯，今年将大力提倡推广。各小麦产区将根据当地条件，提倡在小麦收割前套种花生、大豆或玉米。现在各地农民正在为增种高产作物和扩大间作、套种面积进行准备。
