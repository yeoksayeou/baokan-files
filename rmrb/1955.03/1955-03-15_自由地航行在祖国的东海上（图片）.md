    Freely Sailing on the East Sea of the Motherland
    Since the liberation of all islands along the coast of Zhejiang Province, shipping between Shanghai and Haimen, Wenzhou has been unimpeded. Agricultural and specialty products from the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, such as rice, alum, leather, and seafood, are being transported from ports such as Haimen and Wenzhou to Shanghai in a steady stream. Ships sailing from north to south are also fully loaded with daily necessities, hardware, medicines, flour, fertilizer, and "666" insecticide powder produced in Shanghai, supplying farmers in the coastal areas of Zhejiang.

    This cargo ship has set sail from Haimen Port in Zhejiang Province.
    When the cargo ship passes the waters of Yijiangshan Island and Dachen Island, which were liberated not long ago, the crew members excitedly come to the deck to look out.
    Ships heading to Shanghai are often encountered on the sea, and the crew members greet each other warmly.
    The crew members are discussing taking practical actions to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.
    Rice seeds from Zhejiang Province are transported to Shanghai by this cargo ship and then transshipped to farmers in disaster-stricken areas of Anhui Province.
    A large quantity of seafood is transported to Shanghai by this ship.

    自由地航行在祖国的东海上
    浙江省沿海所有岛屿解放后，上海和海门、温州间的航运已畅通无阻。浙江省沿海地区出产的大米、明矾、皮革、海味等土产品和特产品，正从海门、温州等港口源源运到上海，由北向南航行的船只，也满载着上海生产的日用品、五金器材、药品、面粉、肥田粉、“六六六”杀虫药粉等商品，供应浙江沿海地区的农民。

    这艘货轮从浙江省海门港起航了。
    货轮经过解放不久的一江山岛和大陈岛的海面时，船员们都兴奋地到甲板上来眺望。
    在海面上经常遇到开往上海的船只，船员们互相热情地打着招呼。
    船员们在甲板上讨论要以实际行动来支援解放台湾的斗争。
    浙江省的稻种由这艘货轮运往上海，再转运给安徽省受灾地区的农民。
    大批的海味由这艘船运到上海去。
