    Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, March 6th: Observers here have noted that the government crisis in Nepal, triggered by the resignation of the Koirala government, occurred against the backdrop of intensified subversive activities by U.S. intelligence agencies in Nepal. For instance, the "Delhi Times" weekly reported that, according to Delhi diplomatic observers, the Nepalese government crisis is the result of actions taken by the Americans, who, seeing Nepal's proximity to China, are attempting to turn it into their own military base.

    The "Delhi Times" weekly wrote in another issue: There is much evidence to prove U.S. subversive activities in Nepal. The weekly reported that the U.S. spends more than 1.5 million U.S. dollars annually on subversive activities in Nepal. Under the guise of "experts," "doctors," "teachers," "scientific workers," and "missionaries," the U.S. dispatches its henchmen to various strategic strongholds in Nepal. Many "scientific expeditions" are collecting intelligence materials, conducting observations, and drawing maps.

    The weekly emphasized that U.S. Ambassador to Ceylon, Crowe, and former U.S. Ambassador to India, Allen, both visited Nepal during their tenures. They are active figures in organizing U.S. subversive activities in Nepal.

    美国对尼泊尔进行颠覆活动
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社德里六日讯：此间人士注意到，尼泊尔因为柯伊拉腊政府辞职而发生的政府危机，是在美国特务机关加紧在尼泊尔进行颠覆活动的情况下发生的。例如，“德里时代”周刊报道，据德里外交观察家的看法，尼泊尔政府危机是美国人看中尼泊尔离中国近，企图把它变为自己的军事基地而采取行动的结果。
      “德里时代”周刊在另一期中写道：有许多证据可以证明美国对尼泊尔进行颠覆活动。这家周刊报道，美国对尼泊尔的颠覆活动的经费每年为一百五十多万美元。美国在“专家”、“医生”、“教师”、“科学工作者”和“传教师”等名义的掩饰下，将自己的爪牙派遣到尼泊尔的各个战略据点。许多“科学考察团”在收集情报材料，进行观察和绘制地图。
    这家周刊着重指出，美国驻锡兰大使克劳和前美国驻印度大使艾伦任职时都曾经访问过尼泊尔。他们是组织美国在尼泊尔的颠覆活动的积极角色。
