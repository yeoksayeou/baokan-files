    Making Newspapers and Periodicals Penetrate the Countryside to Promote the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

    The Party's newspapers and periodicals are powerful weapons for the Party to conduct propaganda and education among the broad masses. In mobilizing and organizing the people to actively participate in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the Party and the people's newspapers and periodicals should be brought into full play; everyone who can read newspapers and periodicals urgently needs them. Therefore, we should ensure that every newspaper and periodical can be delivered to the readers who need it, which is a work of important political significance.

    In recent years, with the care of Party organizations at all levels and the support of the people, and with the efforts of postal and telecommunications departments at all levels, our newspaper and periodical distribution work has made considerable progress. Comparing the number of newspapers and periodicals distributed by the post office with the national population, in 1950 there was one newspaper for every 274 people, and in 1954 there was one newspaper for every 64 people; in 1952 there was one magazine for every 137 people, and in 1954 there was one magazine for every 53 people. Not only has the circulation of newspapers and periodicals increased, but the distribution coverage of newspapers and periodicals has also expanded. However, at present, there are still problems and shortcomings in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. The weak distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas is a problem that cannot be ignored. Taking December 1954 as an example, the post office distributed a total of more than 1.47 million copies of various newspapers mainly aimed at farmers. Although this number increased by 39 percent compared with December 1953, it is still disproportionate when compared with the improvement of the material and cultural life of farmers in our country and the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Facts in many places have shown that the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas lags behind the actual needs of rural areas. For example, according to a survey in June last year, only 18 copies of the "Hebei Daily" were subscribed to by 818 agricultural production cooperatives in Raoyang County, Hebei Province, of which 7 copies were subscribed to by the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative; and according to a survey in October last year, among the 41 villages for which a deliveryman from the Handan Post and Telecommunications Bureau was responsible, there was only one copy of "Current Events Handbook" and one copy of "Rural Propagandist." In Bishan County, Sichuan Province, there were 82 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 5,000 mutual aid groups, but only 20 percent of them subscribed to newspapers as of September last year. These show that at present, there are still a large number of farmers, especially those who have been organized, who cannot see the newspapers and periodicals they like.

    However, the vast number of grassroots cadres and the masses in rural areas are in great need of newspapers and periodicals. This can be proved by the wide and profound influence of newspapers and periodicals on the ideology and life of farmers. "Shanxi Peasants" newspaper, in coordination with the general line propaganda in rural areas, launched a discussion on "What road should farmers take?" at the end of 1953 and the first half of 1954. This discussion attracted the participation of many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups and farmers in various parts of Shanxi. After participating in the discussion, many farmers clarified the boundary between the two roads of socialism and capitalism and actively participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and grain unified purchase work. For example, after participating in the discussion, the farmers in Dianshang Village, Xiangyuan County, increased the number of agricultural production cooperatives from 2 to 6, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives increased from 39 to 189; after the farmers in Dongwa Village, Tunliu County, who participated in the reading group, conducted discussions, they sold 6,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Not only the discussions on major ideological issues organized by newspapers were welcomed by the broad masses of farmers, but also the experiences related to mutual aid and cooperation and production reported in newspapers on a daily basis were valued by the broad masses of farmers. The director of the Tonghua Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hejin County, Shanxi Province, affectionately called the newspaper the "resident cadre" of their cooperative because he often learned experience in running the cooperative from the newspaper. However, farmers in many areas cannot easily subscribe to newspapers and periodicals. From this, it can be seen that the current distribution of newspapers and periodicals in many rural areas lags behind the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and cannot meet the growing demand of the broad masses of farmers for learning politics and culture. Therefore, it must be improved.

    The postal and telecommunications departments bear the direct responsibility for distributing newspapers and periodicals in rural areas. In 1952, due to the blind pursuit of quantity by postal and telecommunications departments in many areas, the phenomenon of apportionment appeared in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, which violated the principle that mass subscription to newspapers and periodicals must be voluntary. However, after correcting the bias of apportionment in 1953, post offices and telecommunications bureaus in many areas adopted a passive attitude towards the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas to varying degrees. They ignored the fact that after vigorously publicizing the general line and rapidly developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the political awareness of the peasant masses has been increasing day by day. At the same time, with a large number of graduates from higher primary schools and junior high schools participating in agricultural production and the development of farmers' amateur cultural education, the cultural level of the peasant masses has also been increasing day by day, and the demand for newspapers and periodicals has been increasing day by day. They did not actively expand the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas based on this new situation. They held the attitude of "waiting for readers to come to the door" and "making fewer mistakes by ordering less." This has made the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in many rural areas basically in a state of laissez-faire. This is very detrimental to rural work and the political and cultural life of farmers.

    In order to strengthen the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas, the postal and telecommunications departments in various places must educate the vast number of employees to clearly recognize the political significance of doing a good job in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas, enhance their sense of responsibility for distribution work, and give full play to their enthusiasm for promoting newspapers and periodicals. At the same time, they should also reasonably adjust rural postal routes, improve and simplify subscription methods, and improve the transmission of newspapers and periodicals. At present, the phenomena of missing the subscription period and refusing to accept subscriptions and the backlog, misdelivery, and delay in transmission in the newspaper and periodical subscription work, although they have been corrected and rectified, are still very serious in some areas. This situation has aroused dissatisfaction among many readers and affected the development of newspaper and periodical distribution work, and should be improved. Only by conscientiously improving the subscription and transmission of newspapers and periodicals and improving the quality of distribution work can we better expand the distribution of newspapers and periodicals.

    It should be pointed out that doing a good job in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals is not only the responsibility of the postal and telecommunications departments, but also the responsibility of the Party organizations. Party committees at all levels, especially the propaganda departments of Party committees, should strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the postal and telecommunications departments, give instructions on the guidelines and principles for the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, guide the postal and telecommunications departments to formulate practical and feasible distribution plans based on local social conditions, and use correct methods to realize their plans. It is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of apportionment and overcome the phenomenon of laissez-faire. At the same time, it is necessary to regularly inspect and supervise the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, and eliminate the shortcomings in the distribution work. It is necessary for the Party organization to mobilize the forces of all parties to assist the postal and telecommunications departments in jointly doing a good job in the propaganda, subscription and delivery of newspapers and periodicals. In recent years, various places have created some experience in this regard. For example, Shanxi, Hebei and other provinces have implemented the method of organizing rural postal delivery stations by township governments and setting up receiving and dispatching staff in villages to handle the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. In some rural areas of Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other provinces, primary schools, folk schools, newspaper reading groups, libraries, clubs, supply and marketing cooperatives, etc., have established business contacts with post offices and telecommunications bureaus, and accepted the entrustment of post offices and telecommunications bureaus to handle the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. In some areas where the agricultural cooperation movement has developed well, some larger agricultural production cooperatives have also signed contracts with post offices and telecommunications bureaus for the transfer of newspapers and periodicals and mail. These successful experiences in the distribution of newspapers and periodicals should be summarized and gradually imitated in areas where conditions are suitable.

    Party committees in various places should also strengthen the leadership of newspaper reading in rural areas. This can make the newspapers and periodicals distributed to rural areas play a greater role in propaganda and education. For example, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee paid attention to newspaper reading work, and many rural branches established newspaper reading groups in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, which made newspapers play a huge role in the socialist transformation of agriculture in Shanxi Province, and the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas throughout the province has been greatly developed. The circulation of "Shanxi Peasants" newspaper increased by nearly one time in December 1954 compared with December 1953.

    The editorial departments of newspapers and magazines should also give great attention to distribution work. The primary responsibility of the editorial department is naturally to run the newspapers and periodicals better, to pay attention to the needs of the broad masses at all times to edit newspapers and periodicals, especially newspapers and periodicals aimed at farmers should be seen and heard by the broad masses of farmers from content to form. The editorial department also has the responsibility to regularly publish articles introducing publications, helping readers choose newspapers and magazines that suit their needs; it also has the responsibility to regularly pay attention to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals and the reading of newspapers by the masses, introduce experiences, point out shortcomings, and promote these works. Doing a good job in the editing, distribution and reading of newspapers and periodicals is an indispensable link in making newspapers and periodicals play a role.

    With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the needs of the broad masses of farmers for newspapers and periodicals, this important spiritual food, are constantly growing. To meet this growing need of farmers as much as possible and to make newspapers and periodicals penetrate the countryside and the masses is a major task for Party organizations and postal and telecommunications departments in various places. Under these conditions that Party committees in various places attach importance to leading and supervising the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, the employees of postal and telecommunications departments are good at giving play to their enthusiasm and initiative, and various social forces give support and assistance to the distribution of newspapers and periodicals, the distribution of newspapers and periodicals in rural areas will surely be rapidly improved, and the Party and the people's newspapers and periodicals will surely be able to play a greater role in mobilizing and organizing in the socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 使报刊深入农村推动互助合作运动

    使报刊深入农村推动互助合作运动
    党的报刊是党向广大群众进行宣传教育的有力武器。在动员和组织人民群众积极参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业方面，应该使党和人民的报刊充分发挥作用；一切能够阅读报刊的人都迫切需要报刊。因此我们应使每一份报刊都能送到需要它的读者手里去，这是一件具有重要政治意义的工作。
    几年来，在各地党组织的关怀和人民群众的支持下，在各级邮电部门的努力下，我们的报刊发行工作有了相当的发展。拿邮电局发行的报刊份数同全国人口作比较，一九五○年每二七四人才有一份报纸，一九五四年是每六四人有一份报纸；一九五二年每一三七人才有一份杂志，一九五四年是每五三人有一份杂志。不仅报刊的发行量增加，而且报刊的发行面也扩大了。但是目前在报刊发行工作方面，并不是没有问题和缺点的。农村中的报刊发行工作还很薄弱，就是一个不容忽视的问题。以一九五四年十二月份为例，邮电局共发行了以农民为主要对象的各种报纸一百四十七万多份。这个数字虽然比一九五三年十二月份增加了百分之三十九，但是如果同我国农民物质和文化生活水平的提高、互助合作运动迅速发展的情况相比较，则仍然是不相称的。许多地方的事实都说明了农村的报刊发行工作落后于农村的实际需要。例如，据去年六月份调查，河北省饶阳县的八百一十八个农业生产合作社只订阅了十八份河北日报，其中有七份是耿长锁农业生产合作社订的；又据去年十月份调查，邯郸邮电局一个投递员所负责投递的四十一个乡村中，只有一份“时事手册”和一份“农村宣传员”。四川省璧山县有八十二个农业生产合作社和五千多个互助组，到去年九月为止订报的只有百分之二十。这些就说明，目前还有广大的农民群众，特别是已经组织起来的农民群众，看不到他们所喜欢的报刊。
    但是农村的广大基层干部和群众是十分需要报刊的。这可以从报刊对农民的思想和生活所产生的广泛和深刻的影响得到证明。“山西农民”报曾在一九五三年底和一九五四年上半年配合农村中的总路线宣传开展了“农民应当走什么道路”的讨论。这个讨论吸引了山西各地许多农业生产合作社、互助组和农民群众的参加，许多农民在参加讨论后划清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的界限，积极参加了互助合作组织和粮食统购工作。如襄垣县店上村农民参加讨论后，农业生产合作社由两个增加到六个，入社农户由三十九户增加到一百八十九户；屯留县东洼村参加读报组的农民进行讨论后，就把六千斤余粮卖给国家。不仅报纸所组织的对重大思想问题的讨论，受到了广大农民的欢迎；就是报纸上日常报道的有关互助合作和生产的经验，也受到了广大农民的重视。山西河津县四区通化村农业生产合作社的社长就因为经常从报纸上学到办社经验，而亲切地称报纸为他们社的“驻社干部”。可是许多地区的农民却不能很方便地订到报刊。由此可见，目前许多农村的报刊发行工作，还落后于互助合作运动发展的情况，还不能满足广大农民日益增长的学习政治和文化的要求，因而是必须加以改善的。
    邮电部门担负着在农村中发行报刊的直接责任。一九五二年由于许多地区的邮电部门盲目地追求数量，在报刊发行工作中曾经出现了摊派的现象，违背了群众订阅报刊必须出于自愿的原则。但是在一九五三年纠正了摊派的偏向以后，不少地区的邮电局又在不同的程度上对农村报刊发行工作采取了消极态度。他们忽视了这样的事实：经过大张旗鼓地宣传总路线和迅速地发展互助合作运动以后，农民群众的政治觉悟日益提高，同时随着农村大量高小和初中毕业生参加农业生产和农民业余文化教育的开展，农民群众的文化水平也日益提高，对报刊的需要日益增长。他们没有根据这种新的情况来积极地扩大报刊在农村中的发行。他们抱着“等读者上门”和“少订少犯错误”的态度。这就使得许多农村的报刊发行工作基本上处于自流状态。这对农村工作和农民的政治、文化生活是十分不利的。
    为了加强农村的报刊发行工作，各地邮电部门必须教育广大职工明确认识做好农村报刊发行工作的政治意义，提高他们对发行工作的责任感，发挥他们推销报刊的积极性。同时，还应该合理调整乡邮路线，改进和简化收订办法，改进报刊的传递工作。目前报刊收订工作中的错过收订期就拒绝接受订阅和传递中的积压、错投、延误等现象，虽然经过纠正和整顿，但有些地区仍然很严重。这种情况引起了许多读者的不满，也影响了报刊发行工作的开展，应当加以改进。只有认真地改进报刊的收订和传递，提高发行工作的质量，才能更好地扩大报刊的发行。
    应当指出，做好报刊的发行工作，不仅是邮电部门的责任，而且是党组织的责任。各级党委特别是党委宣传部门应加强对邮电部门的政治思想领导，对报刊发行工作给以方针和原则的指示，指导邮电部门根据当地社会情况制订切实可行的发行计划，并用正确的方法去实现自己的计划，既要防止摊派现象，又要克服自流现象；同时要经常检查和监督报刊发行工作，消除发行工作中的缺点。党组织有必要动员各方面的力量来协助邮电部门共同做好报刊的宣传、收订和投递工作。几年来各地在这方面已经创造了一些经验。如山西、河北等省实行了由乡政府组织乡邮收发站、村设收发员，办理报刊发行的办法。四川、黑龙江、广东、浙江、江西等省有些农村的小学、民校、读报组、图书室、俱乐部、供销合作社等同邮电局建立了发行报刊的业务联系，接受邮电局的委托办理报刊发行工作。在有些农业合作化运动开展得较好的地区，某些较大的农业生产合作社还同邮电局签订了报刊邮件交接联系合同。对于发行报刊的这些成功经验，应该加以总结和在条件适合的地区逐步仿行。
    各地党委还应该加强对农村读报工作的领导。这样才可以使发到农村的报刊发挥更大的宣传教育作用。例如，山西省委注意了读报工作，许多农村支部在互助合作组织中建立了读报组，这就使报纸在山西省的农业社会主义改造事业中发挥了巨大的推动作用，全省农村报刊发行工作有了很大的开展。“山西农民”报的发行数量一九五四年十二月就比一九五三年十二月增加了将近一倍。
    报纸和杂志的编辑部对于发行工作也应该给以极大的重视。编辑部的首要职责，自然是要把报刊办得更好，时时注意到广大群众的需要来编辑报刊，特别是以农民为对象的报刊更应从内容到形式都做到为广大农民所喜见乐闻。编辑部同时有责任经常发表介绍出版物的文章，帮助读者选择适合他们需要的报纸和杂志；也有责任经常注意报刊发行工作和群众读报工作的情况，介绍经验，指出缺点，推动这些工作。做好报刊的编辑、发行和读报工作，这是使报刊发挥作用的不可缺少的三个环节。
    随着互助合作运动的发展，广大农民对于报刊这一重要的精神食粮的需要正在不断增长。尽可能地满足农民的这种日益增长的需要，使报刊深入农村，深入群众，这是各地党组织和邮电部门的重大任务。在各地党委重视领导和监督报刊发行工作，邮电部门的职工善于发挥积极性和主动性，各方面社会力量对报刊发行的工作给以支持和协助的这些条件之下，农村的报刊发行工作一定能够迅速改进，党和人民的报刊一定能够在农业的社会主义改造事业中发挥更大的动员和组织作用。
