    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Introduction to the Chinese Edition, 1955, Issue 8
    The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1955, issue 8, has been published.
    This issue features an editorial entitled "Vigorously Launch the Movement Against the Preparation of Atomic War!" The editorial points out: Countries around the world are responding to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and launching the signature campaign for the "Appeal to the Peoples of the World." Judging from the initial scale of development of the signature campaign, it can be completely affirmed that this movement will definitely express the unwavering and strong will of the people to strive for peace in an even more magnificent and truly powerful way. The current movement will surely make the people of all countries more vigilant against the conspiracies of the warmongers, redouble the ranks of activists, and unite more people who are prepared to do their best to prevent war and resolutely fight for the prohibition of atomic weapons around them.
    Important articles published in this issue include: "The Program of the Communist Party of Brazil is the Banner of the Brazilian People's Struggle for Freedom and Independence" by Arrudas, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Brazil, "Heavy Industry, Butter, and Cannons" by Longo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Italy, and "The Luxembourg People Oppose the Rearmament of West Germany" by Kiel, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Luxembourg.
    Arrudas' article emphasizes: The Program of the Communist Party of Brazil adopted by the Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of Brazil marks an important stage in the party's historical development. The Program of the Communist Party of Brazil, based on the Marxist-Leninist analysis of the domestic economic and political situation, determines that the Brazilian revolution is an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal land revolution, stipulates the goals and tasks of the Brazilian revolutionary movement, and points out the ways for Brazil to embark on the path of progress, democracy, and independence. The Party Program points out that the main task of the party is to carry out revolutionary struggle, overthrow the regime of the large landowners and big capitalists, and establish a people's democratic system. The current issue is to intensify the struggle to achieve the following two main goals: to ensure that all party members thoroughly understand the tasks prescribed by the party; to turn the Party Program into the program of all democratic and progressive forces and all the people.
    Kiel's article points out: For several years, the Communist Party of Luxembourg has been persistently struggling against the revival of German militarism and policies that endanger national independence. All progressive and patriotic groups are currently sparing no effort to urge parliamentarians to recognize the need to reject the Paris Accords.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五五年第八期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第八期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“大力展开反对准备原子战争的运动！”为题发表社论。社论指出：世界各国响应世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召，展开了“告全世界人民书”的签名运动。从签名运动最初的发展规模看来，可以完全肯定地说，这个运动一定会更加波澜壮阔地、真正有力地表现出人民争取和平的不可动摇的坚强意志。当前的运动一定会使各国人民对战争贩子的阴谋提高警惕，加倍地扩大积极分子的队伍，并把更多的准备尽力防止战争和坚决为禁止原子武器而斗争的人团结在他们的周围。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：巴西共产党中央委员会书记阿鲁达的“巴西共产党纲领是巴西人民为自由独立而斗争的旗帜”，意大利共产党副总书记隆哥的“重工业、牛油和大炮”，卢森堡共产党中央委员基尔的“卢森堡人民反对重新武装西德”等。
    阿鲁达的文章着重指出：巴西共产党第四次代表大会所通过的巴西共产党纲领标志着党的历史发展中的一个重要阶段。巴西共产党纲领根据国内的经济和政治形势所作的马克思列宁主义的分析，确定巴西的革命是反帝反封建的土地革命，规定了巴西革命运动的目标和任务，指出了巴西走上进步、民主和独立的道路的办法。党纲指出，党的主要任务是进行革命斗争，推翻大庄园主和大资本家的政权，建立人民民主制度。目前的问题是加紧进行斗争以达到下面两个主要目标：保证全体党员都彻底了解党所规定的任务；把党纲变成所有民主力量和进步力量以及全体人民的纲领。
    基尔的文章指出：几年来，卢森堡共产党坚持不懈地进行斗争，反对复活德国军国主义和危害国家独立的政策。各进步团体和爱国团体目前都在不遗余力地促使议员们认识到必须拒绝巴黎协定。
