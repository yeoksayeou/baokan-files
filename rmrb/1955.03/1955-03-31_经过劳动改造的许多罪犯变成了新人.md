Xinhua News Agency, March 30th. China's labor reform institutions are transforming many criminals sentenced according to law into new people. Their work has been praised by the broad masses of the people and foreign guests.

In recent years, labor reform institutions across the country have supervised various counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders. Among them were secret agents dispatched by American and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies to carry out sabotage activities in our country; reactionary landlords guilty of serious counter-revolutionary activities; bandits and local bullies with blood debts; habitual thieves, habitual burglars, and consistently evil hooligans, swindlers, and smugglers who disrupt social order and damage the lives and property of the people. The vast majority of these criminals were sentenced to imprisonment by the people's courts, and a small number of those with heinous crimes were sentenced to death with a reprieve. In order to finally win them over to reform and start anew, state organs organized them to engage in labor production during their punishment and control, transforming them through labor.

In recent years, labor reform institutions have organized criminals to engage in various types of labor based on actual conditions. Some places have established farms, and some farms have implemented semi-mechanized cultivation. Some have established industrial and mining enterprises and production units; others have established handicraft workshops. For those elderly and frail prisoners, labor reform institutions have provided appropriate care, organizing them to undertake lighter labor.

While criminals are engaged in labor, labor reform institutions across the country also organize them to study, so that they gradually understand the development of the international situation and the state's construction, and recognize their past crimes. Many criminals have expressed their desire to "atone for their crimes through meritorious service" in labor reform. Some criminals have become more enthusiastic about labor. In 1954, criminals supervised by labor reform institutions across the country put forward many rationalization proposals for improving production, and many were adopted after research. Some criminals have diligently studied technology in production and have made many new creations.

In order to enable criminals to find employment after serving their sentences, labor reform institutions across the country have organized them to learn various production techniques. Many labor reform institutions have specifically organized prisoner production technology training classes or established technology research groups. Now, in a labor reform unit in Beijing engaged in agricultural production, many prisoners have been trained to become technical personnel in agriculture, water conservancy, medical care, electrical engineering, carpentry, and bricklaying. According to statistics from Rehe Province in the first half of 1954, 69.6% of prisoners in custody had learned various production techniques. Peng Zizhen, a counter-revolutionary criminal in Wuhan, learned brick-making techniques during labor reform. After serving his sentence, he quickly found a job in the Xinsheng Brick and Tile Factory. Peng Zizhen said gratefully: The People's Government has truly saved my life.

Labor reform institutions across the country have also universally organized criminals to conduct cultural studies. In Shanxi Province Prison, 71% of illiterate criminals recognized 700 to 1,000 characters after cultural studies. One-third of the illiterate criminals in the No. 1 Labor Reform Team directly under Hebei Province recognized 1,500 characters, and the rest recognized about 900 characters. Labor reform institutions also gave due care to criminals with physical ailments. Many prisoners suffering from chronic diseases were cured during labor reform.

After serving their sentences, criminals who have undergone labor reform have generally developed labor habits and learned production skills during labor reform. Some have returned home and participated in labor production, while others have been introduced to jobs by labor reform institutions. Some have voluntarily stayed to continue production, and some have even brought their families to settle down in the fields. Some released prisoners have received rewards and commendations for their good performance in production. Jin Shikai, a reformed thief in Beijing, found a job in the Electrical Installation Company of the Beijing Construction Company. He was active in production and was promoted to leader of the installation team. His team was awarded a collective prize twice for exceeding the task and was named an advanced team in 1954.

The broad masses of the people and many family members of prisoners have expressed enthusiastic support and praise for these achievements made by labor reform institutions. After seeing the fact that many criminals have been transformed into new people, people said: Old prisons turn people into ghosts, while new prisons transform bad people into good people. Tao Jie, a prisoner in Shanghai, underwent ideological transformation and developed labor habits after labor reform. After he was released and returned home, his wife, Zhou Weixian, wrote to the labor reform institution saying: After my husband came home, the neighbors all said that he had changed and made progress. I feel that the People's Government has not only reformed my husband but also brought happiness to my whole family.

Many foreign guests who visited our country's prisons have also expressed great praise for our country's policy of labor reform for criminals. From September 1952 to February 1955, a total of 403 foreign guests from 49 countries visited our country's prisons and left a good impression. Batchelor, the deputy head of the British trade union delegation who came to China to attend the National Day celebrations, said after the visit: "All insults to prisoners have been completely abolished here. They can see many good books and newspapers, and prisoners can also operate machines and learn technology. From this point of view, your prisons are truly for reforming criminals." Argentine lawyer Birkin said after the visit: "I am a lawyer and I am very familiar with prisons in capitalist countries. There, punishment and rude behavior are everywhere. In China, the principle of reforming prisoners through labor is adopted, and prisoners do not have any mental suffering."

### 经过劳动改造的许多罪犯变成了新人

    经过劳动改造的许多罪犯变成了新人
    新华社三十日讯　我国劳动改造罪犯的机关把许多依法被判刑的罪犯改造成为新人。他们的工作得到了广大人民和国外人士的赞扬。
    几年来，各地劳动改造罪犯的机关监管了各种反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子。其中有的是美国和蒋贼特务机关秘密派遣来我国进行破坏活动的特务分子；有的是进行反革命活动的罪恶重大的反动地主；有的是血债累累的土匪和恶霸；有的是扰乱社会秩序、损害人民生命财产的惯盗、惯窃和一贯作恶的流氓恶棍、骗子手、走私犯。这些犯罪分子中，绝大多数被人民法院判处了徒刑，少数罪恶深重的被判处死刑缓期执行。国家机关为了最后争取他们改过自新，在惩罚管制期间组织他们从事劳动生产，从劳动中改造他们。
    几年来，劳动改造罪犯的机关根据实际情况和条件组织罪犯们从事各种劳动。有的地方建立了农场，有的农场已实行了半机械化的耕作；有的建立了工矿企业生产单位；有的建立了手工业工场。对于那些年老和体弱的犯人，劳动改造机关给予了适当的照顾，组织他们担负一些比较轻微的劳动。
    在罪犯进行劳动的同时，各地劳动改造机关还组织罪犯进行学习，使他们逐渐明了了国际形势的发展和国家建设的情况，认识了自己过去的罪恶。许多罪犯表示要在劳动改造中“立功赎罪”。有些罪犯的劳动积极性有了提高。在一九五四年内，各地劳动改造机关所监管的罪犯提出了许多改进生产的合理化建议，经过研究采纳的不少。有些罪犯在生产中认真钻研技术，有了许多新的创造。
    各地劳动改造罪犯的机关为了使罪犯们在刑满释放后能够找到职业，曾组织了他们学习各种生产技术。不少的劳动改造机关专门举办了犯人生产技术训练班或成立技术研究小组。现在在北京市一个从事农业生产的劳动改造单位中，已有许多犯人被培养成为农业、水利、医务、电工、木工、瓦工等技术人员。据热河省一九五四年上半年的统计，有百分之六十九点六的在押犯人学会了各种生产技术。武汉市反革命罪犯彭子桢在劳动改造期间学会了烧砖的技术，刑满释放后，他很快地在新生砖瓦厂找到了职业。彭子桢感激地说：人民政府真是救了我的一生。
    各地劳动改造机关还普遍组织罪犯们进行文化学习。山西省监狱内不识字的罪犯经过文化学习后，识了七百字到一千字的占百分之七十一。河北省直属第一劳动改造队罪犯中的文盲，有三分之一的人识了一千五百字，其余的也认了九百字左右。劳动改造机关对于身体有病的罪犯，还给予了应有的关怀。许多患有慢性病的犯人，在劳动改造期间被医治好了。
    经过劳动改造的罪犯在刑满以后，由于他们大都在劳动改造期间养成了劳动习惯，学会了生产技能，有的回家便参加了劳动生产，有的由劳动改造机关给他们介绍职业。也有一些人自愿留下继续生产，其中还有的接来家眷，在场里安家立业。有些刑满释放的犯人因为在生产中表现很好，还得到了奖励和表扬。北京市经过改造的盗窃犯金世凯在北京市建筑公司电器安装公司找到了职业，生产积极，被提升为安装小组长；他领导的小组因超额完成任务，曾两次获得了集体奖，并在一九五四年被评为先进小组。
    广大人民群众和许多犯人家属对于劳动改造机关所取得的这些成绩，都表示热烈拥护和赞扬。人们见到许多罪犯被改造成为新人的事实后说：旧监狱把人变成鬼，新监狱把坏人改造成好人。上海市犯人陶洁经过劳动改造后，思想有了转变，并养成了劳动习惯。当他刑满释放回家后，他的妻子周薇仙写信给劳动改造机关说：我的丈夫回家后，邻居们都说他变了，有了进步。我觉得人民政府不仅改造了我的丈夫，还给我全家带来了幸福。
    许多外国人士参观了我国监狱后，对我国劳动改造罪犯的政策也表示非常赞扬。从一九五二年九月到一九五五年二月先后有四十九个国家的四百零三个外宾参观了我国监狱，他们留下了良好的印象。曾来我国参加国庆节观礼的英国工会代表团副团长巴契勒尔参观后说：“这里已完全废除了对犯人的侮辱，他们能看到很多内容很好的书报，犯人还可以开机器，学技术；从这点看，你们的监狱是真正为了改造罪犯。”阿根廷律师比尔金参观后说：“我是一个律师，对资本主义国家监狱很熟悉，在那里，到处都是惩罚和粗暴的行为；在中国则是采用通过劳动改造犯人的原则，犯人没有任何精神上的痛苦。”
