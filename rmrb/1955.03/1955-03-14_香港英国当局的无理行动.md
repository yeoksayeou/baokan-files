    The British authorities in Hong Kong have suddenly imposed restrictions on the entry of Chinese people into Hong Kong since March 5th. This has resulted in a large number of travelers being unreasonably refused entry, adversely affecting normal traffic between Guangdong and Hong Kong, causing economic losses to the local people, and creating a tense and uneasy situation in the region. This situation has aroused serious concern among the Chinese people.
    For a long time, the movement of Chinese people to and from Hong Kong has never been restricted. Such exchanges are beneficial to the Chinese people, including Hong Kong residents and overseas Chinese. The recent measures taken by the British authorities in Hong Kong, which impose extremely unreasonable restrictions on the movement of Chinese people, not only damage the interests of the Chinese people and violate long-standing practices, but also harm the interests of Hong Kong itself.
    It should be pointed out that the unreasonable actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong in damaging the interests and rights of the Chinese people are not new. As early as April 28, 1950, the British authorities in Hong Kong announced the so-called cancellation of the right of Chinese people to freely enter Hong Kong, which was protested by our people and our government. Now, the British authorities in Hong Kong have once again taken unreasonable measures to damage the interests of the Chinese people, which cannot but be regarded as an extremely unfriendly act.
    The Chinese people believe that the British government must pay serious attention to the fact that this abnormal situation should be eliminated immediately, and normal exchanges should be restored immediately.

    香港英国当局的无理行动
    香港的英国当局从三月五日起对中国人民进入香港突然加以限制，致使大批旅客被无理拒绝不能前往香港，粤港间的正常交通受到不良影响，当地人民的经济遭到损失，并且在这个地区造成了紧张和不安的局势。这种情况引起了中国人民的严重注意。
    中国人民来往香港，长期以来从未受过限制。这种往来是有利于中国人民包括香港居民和海外华侨的。最近香港英国当局所采取的措施，对中国人民的来往加上了极不合理的限制，这不但损害了中国人民的利益，违反了长期存在的惯例，而且，也会损害到香港本身的利益。
    应该指出，香港英国当局损害中国人民的利益和权利的无理行为，今天并非首次。早在一九五○年四月二十八日，香港英国当局就宣布过所谓取消中国人民自由进入香港的权利，遭到了我国人民和我国政府的抗议。现在香港英国当局竟又一次采取了损害中国人民利益的无理措施，不能不被认为是一种极不友好的行为。
    中国人民认为必须引起英国政府的严重注意：这种不正常的状态应该立即消除，正常的来往应该立即恢复。
