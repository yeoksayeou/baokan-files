    A Women's Survey Team on the Gobi Desert
    By Our Correspondent Yuan Liang
    The people of Yumen Oilfield are proud of the "404" Women's Survey Team. On November 3rd of last year, the survey team exceeded its annual survey task and returned indoors from the field. It was at this time that I visited them.

    At that time, the women were working on their drafting work. Although the topographic map they drew did not look large, it represented more than 400 square kilometers of vast land. Every hair-like line on the drawing paper was imprinted with the footprints of these twenty-odd women, and permeated with their sweat. For it, they had been subjected to hail, floods and black winds under the Qilian Mountains and on the Gobi Desert; they had crossed countless mountains and waded through countless waters, living a nomadic, mobile life for a long time; under the dazzling candlelight, they had stayed up late, their eyes bloodshot, still insisting on calculating the results of daily measurements; for it, the women's hair was disheveled, their clothes were torn, a layer of skin was tanned on their faces, and their hands were chapped from the cold, but none of them cared.

    Early August of last year was the third month after they formally started working. When they were engaged in field surveying work under the Qilian Mountains, the 105th Geological Team requested that they supply a topographic map of a certain area before August 15th. The geological team wanted to use it to find out the geological structure there. The team sent Fu Jiaoying from the traverse group and Chen Meijuan from the second topographic team to undertake this temporary mapping work.

    These two young women were like sisters, similar in height and build, and around the age of eighteen, both with big eyes. Accepting the mapping task was the first time since the establishment of their team, and they felt honored and exceptionally nervous. On August 5th, when they first stood in front of the drawing board, their hearts couldn't help but thump.

    "Oh my god, it's over! It's over! Damn arm, how did it knock over the ink bottle? Ink spilled all over the place. The drawings that had been made for several days were all stained. What should I do? I was so anxious, tears streamed down my face, I was almost frantic." Fu Jiaoying told me about this dream at the time, and she found it a little funny.

    Because tracing paper expands and contracts with heat and deforms immediately when heated. The hottest time on the Gobi Desert in summer is from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The tents were as hot as steamers. They had to stop working to ensure the accuracy of the drawings; at that time, the topographic group, which was not skilled enough, also often had to take the drawing board out to rework. So, seeing that it was already August 10th—only five days left before the delivery date—a large part of the drawings had not yet been mapped. Everyone in the survey team was a little panicked. Everyone focused their thoughts on the mapping.

    At dinner, they sat around on the open space outside the tent, discussing the matter of working late.

    "It's infuriating, how could the gas lamp break down at this time?"
    "Can't we hang up a few more kerosene lamps?"
    "No, the light from the kerosene lamp is not concentrated."
    "Let's light candles."
    "How can that work? It will get candle wax on the drawings."
    "Let's use flashlights." This suggestion attracted attention, and after everyone's consideration, it was decided to adopt this method.

    Fu Jiaoying and Chen Meijuan stood side by side in front of the table. The drawing board was placed at an angle on the table, and a layer of tracing paper was covered on the drawing board. They stood strenuously, using the thumb and forefinger of their left hand to tightly pinch the flashlight, and then using the four fingers and little finger to spread out and press down the area on the tracing paper where they were about to draw, so as not to let it bulge. Then they aimed the light ring of the lamp head at the place where their vision was concentrated. The right hand pinched the small drawing pen, carefully and meticulously stroking it stroke by stroke. What a difficult labor it was, this outdoor indoor night shift! When they felt back pain, they straightened their backs, or asked each other: "Help me beat it a little...." When their fingers ached, they put down the flashlight and shook their wrists vigorously a few times. ...

    In order to allow the two of them to rest better, all the comrades in the team took special care of them. Others couldn't eat eggs, but the cook specially fried eggs for them. There was little oil in the dishes, so they were given extra portions. The warm care and consideration of the comrades further encouraged them. For several nights in a row, Fu Jiaoying and Chen Meijuan stayed up until three or four o'clock before resting, sometimes even staying up all night. Fu Jiaoying encouraged herself in her diary: "... The life of battle will make you more resilient. Dear Jiaoying: Dedicate all your energy to the country's petroleum industry..."—Night of August 14th.

    Forcing their way across the Maying River was an unforgettable scene for everyone.

    In order to complete a new task, the topographic team led by Huang Jinhong set out for a new work site at three or four o'clock one afternoon. In the wilderness of the Gobi Desert, it is easy to lose your way. Just as everyone was walking with vigor with their heads down, suddenly a cliff blocked their way.
      "What to do?"
      "If we go back the way we came, we will always find a road."
    The sky gradually darkened. Looking north, the Gobi Desert was like a vast, dark gray sea. Night fell.

    It was a narrow valley more than two hundred meters deep, with cliffs on both sides that looked like they were about to fall down. In the middle was a steep path full of pebbles. Entering the narrow valley was like walking into a dark cave, and people could not be seen on the opposite side. Looking up, one could only see a narrow wisp of sky, and the twinkling stars in the sky. At this time, they had to carry instruments and tools and walk down this little-traveled path. They warned each other: "Be careful! You must not fall, it is dangerous for the instrument to fall!" Before the words were finished, a comrade slipped and staggered, almost falling to the ground. Seeing this situation, someone suggested: "It's safer to take the 'natural elevator'." Saying that, everyone sat down, one hand holding the drawing board, instrument box and target pole on their backs, and one hand pressing on the ground, sliding to the bottom of the ditch.

    The Maying River roared, and from a distance came bursts of roars from unknown wild beasts. There was not a single person in sight, and not a single light. An atmosphere of terror enveloped this group of young women.

    Of course, no one cared about being afraid at this time, so they took off their trousers and walked into the river. As soon as Huang Jinhong put one foot into the water, she couldn't help but immediately withdraw it. On a late September night, the snowmelt river water of the Qilian Mountains was so cold to the bone! "Charge over, comrades!" Zhou Yumei, who was usually silent and reticent, seemed to give a military order like a commander. So, splash, splash, everyone jumped into the rapids. They walked slowly, hand in hand. They forgot the cold, forgot the pain of the stones piercing their feet. By the time they had crossed the river and reached the campsite, it was already half past eleven.

    For the sake of the country's petroleum industry, this group of young women on the Gobi Desert not only work bravely, but also study tirelessly. They understand that building the country cannot rely solely on enthusiasm and courage, but must also strive to improve the level of science and technology—and learn and master it with the same enthusiasm.
   
    When they left their hometown on both sides of the Ao River in southern Zhejiang last July and walked out of the classroom of Wenzhou Normal School in Zhejiang, they had never even heard of what a theodolite, a plane table, or common surveying terms were. However, the country needed them to learn surveying work as quickly as possible, and they only received three months of classroom training before entering production practice. During the internship, they overcame the unprecedented cold they encountered for the first time in their lives, and tried their best to adapt to the northern lifestyle; they also initially learned some surveying knowledge. However, their technical level was far from meeting the needs of their work. They were clumsy in using instruments, and the measurement efficiency was less than one-tenth of a square kilometer per day. In terms of calculation, they didn't even know how to move the beads on the abacus. The drawings they drew were neither round nor square. Because the initial work was not done well, some young women had secretly shed tears. After seven or eight months of work, they began to be competent for the job. Chen Liangzhen, Huang Xiaoxiao, Hu Yuanchun, Huang Jinhong, and Yang Yongxiang are all members of the Communist Youth League who are under the age of eighteen, and now they are leading a small team to work in the field.
   
    Of course, technical progress is not always smooth sailing. In October of last year, Chen Liangzhen's team went to a new area on the Gobi Desert to measure. The task given to them by their superiors was: to measure the terrain of 113.5 square kilometers within fifty days. However, they spent twenty-five days and only measured a little more than thirteen square kilometers. She was a little anxious, but what was the use of being anxious? She had to use her brains to think of a solution. At this time, the person in charge of the Geological Bureau of the Petroleum Management Bureau came to their team and brought them great encouragement. They thought of the various help and encouragement given to them by the captain of the Geological Brigade and the secretary of the Party branch; they thought of the words of hope and care sent to them by people they knew and did not know from all over the country; they thought of the visits of reporters and how they were captured by the camera; they thought of the film crew of the Central News Film Studio coming to their team to shoot color films. All of these became the force that spurred them on. "Can the people who are about to appear on the screen continue to work so behind?" "No!" So, day and night, they actively looked for the reasons for the slow measurement. Countless questions were like tangled silk threads in Chen Liangzhen's mind: "Maybe there is a problem with the ranging method, maybe they are not familiar with the instrument!..." At this time, Zhang Motian, a first-level surveying technician from the brigade, came to inspect the work and pointed out to them: "You should improve the ranging method—you need to unify the ranging direction." These words hit the nail on the head, and they implemented it the next day, and the efficiency increased from less than one square kilometer to four square kilometers. But they were not satisfied, and they still studied it back and forth, wanting to further improve the ranging method. After everyone's discussion, they realized that: if the circular ranging method is adopted, wouldn't it be possible to shorten the ranging distance for surveyors? Wouldn't it be possible to stand more points in the least amount of time? On the third day, they made new improvements again, and as a result, under the same terrain and requirements, the work efficiency was increased to five square kilometers. Later, after painstaking exploration of the characteristics of the new instrument, they were able to use it freely, and the work efficiency was further improved. In the last period, they actually measured an area of seven square kilometers a day.

    How happy they were. Every day after work, on the ground outside the tent, they danced collective dances and Tibetan dances, beating face basins and wooden sticks to accompany them. Sometimes, they recklessly pressed each other, pressing "stacks." Li Lianling, the seventeen-year-old young woman who is the chairman of the trade union, said to me: "Hard work is glory, and victory will be achieved if you are not afraid of difficulties." Indeed, that is how they understand life.

    戈壁滩上的一支女子测量队
    本报记者　袁良
    玉门油矿的人们，都把“四○四”女子测量队引为他们的骄傲。去年十一月三日，测量队就超额完成了全年测量任务，从野外回到了室内。就在这时候，我去访问了她们。
    那时候姑娘们正在进行案头的绘图工作。她们绘出的地形图，看起来虽然不大，可是它却代表着四百多平方公里的广阔土地。图纸上每一根发丝般的线条里，都印着这二十多位姑娘的脚迹，渗透着姑娘们的汗珠。为了它，她们曾遭受到祁连山下、戈壁滩上的冰雹、洪水和黑风的侵袭；不知翻过多少山，涉过多少水，长期过着游牧式的流动生活；在晃眼的蜡烛光下，熬红了眼珠，还在坚持计算每天测量的成果；为了它，姑娘们的头发蓬乱了，衣服扯破了，脸上晒起了一层皮，手上冻得生了疮，她们谁也不介意。
    去年八月初，这是她们正式参加工作后的第三个月。当她们正在祁连山下从事野外测量工作的时候，一零五地质队要求她们在八月十五日以前，供给一张某地区的地形图。地质队要根据它去弄清楚那里的地质构造情况。队里派导线组的傅蕉影和第二地形小队的陈美娟，去担任这项临时的描图工作。
    这两位姑娘，好像两姊妹一样，高低、胖瘦都差不多，年龄也都在十八岁上下，都长着一双大眼睛。接受描图任务，是她们全队成立以来的第一次，她们感到光荣，也分外紧张。当八月五日那天，她们刚刚站到图版跟前的时候，心里不禁咕咚咕咚地直跳。
    “天哪，完了！完了！该死的胳膊，怎么把墨水瓶撞翻了？墨汁洒开了一大片。把几天来描出的图纸都弄脏了。这该怎么办呀？真急死人了，我的眼泪流下来了，我几乎要急得发狂了。”傅蕉影对我说起当时这一段梦境来，倒觉得有些好笑。
    因为透明纸热胀冷缩，遇热马上就要变形。戈壁滩上的夏季，上午十一点到下午三点钟的时刻最热。帐篷里热得像蒸笼。她们只得停止工作，以便保证图纸的精度；当时，不够熟练的地形组，也时常要带着图版出去返工。所以眼看已到了八月十日——离交工日期只剩下五天了，图纸还有一大半没有描出。测量队所有的人心里都有些慌。大家都把思想集中到描图这件事情上来。
    吃晚饭的时候，她们围坐在帐篷外面的空地上，商量着开夜车的事。
    “真气死人，怎么正在这个时候汽灯坏了？”
    “多挂起几盏马灯不行吗？”
    “不行，马灯的光线不集中。”
    “点起蜡烛吧。”
    “那怎么能行呢？那会把蜡烛油沾在图纸上的。”
    “还是用手电筒罢。”这个建议引起了重视，经过大伙考虑，决定采用这个办法。
    傅蕉影和陈美娟两个人并排站在桌子前边。桌子上面斜立着图版，图版上蒙着一层透明纸。她们吃力地站着，用左手的姆指和食指紧紧地捏住手电筒，再用四指和小指叉开来捺实透明纸上准备落笔的地方，不让它鼓起来。然后把灯头的光环对准视线集中的地方。右手捏紧细小的绘图笔，小心翼翼地、丝毫不苟地一笔一笔涂抹着。这种野外的室内夜班，是多么艰辛的劳动啊！当她们感到腰痛的时候，便直一直腰，或者互相央求着：“你帮我捶一捶……。”手指疼痛的时候，她们又放下手电筒，把手腕用力甩几下。……
    为了使她俩休息得好一些，全队的同志都特别爱护她们。别人吃不到鸡蛋，而炊事员特地给她们煎鸡蛋。菜里的油少，又格外给她们多加一些。同志们亲切的关怀和体贴，更加鼓舞了她们。一连几个夜晚，傅蕉影和陈美娟都熬到三、四点钟才休息，有时候还整整熬个通宵。傅蕉影在日记里这样勉励着自己：“……战斗的生活，会使你锻炼得更坚毅。亲爱的蕉影：拿出你的全副精力，献给祖国的石油事业……。”——八月十四日夜。
    强渡马营河，是大家难以忘却的一幕。
    为着完成一件新的任务，黄金洪领导的地形小队，在一天下午三、四点钟，开始往新的工作地点出发。戈壁滩上的野外，很容易使你迷失方向。大伙低着头正走得有劲，猛然一道悬崖拦住了去路。
      “怎么办呢？”
      “从原路上返回去，总会找到道路的。”
    天色渐渐灰黯下来。向北望去，戈壁滩宛如深灰色的茫茫大海。夜幕降临了。
    那是一道两百多公尺深的狭谷，两厢的绝壁看去好像要倒下来。中间夹着一条陡立的满是小石子的小路。进入狭谷，犹如走进了乌黑的山洞，对面看不到人。仰起脸来，只可见到窄窄的一绺天空，和天空中眨着眼儿的繁星。她们就要在这个时候，扛着仪器、工具从这条人迹罕到的小路上走下去。她们互相警告着：“当心啊！千万不能跌倒，跌倒了仪器有危险！”话音未落，就有一个同志脚下一滑，踉踉跄跄差星儿坐到地上。看到这情形，有人提议：“还是坐‘天然电梯’保险些。”说着，大家都坐下去，一只手扶着背上的图版、仪器箱和肩上的标杆，一只手按在地上，溜到了沟底。
    马营河咆哮着，远处又传来一阵阵不知名的野兽的吼叫声。四周看不到一个人影，也看不到一点灯火。恐怖的气氛笼罩着这群姑娘们。
    当然，这时候谁也顾不得害怕了，只管脱掉长裤向河水走去。黄金洪刚把一只脚伸进水里，不由得又马上缩了回来。九月末的夜晚，祁连山融雪的河水是那样的冰凉渗骨！“冲过去呀，同志们！”平时沉默寡言的周玉梅俨如指挥官下军令一样。于是扑通，扑通，大伙都跳进了激流。她们手牵着手慢慢地挪动着步子。她们忘记了寒冷，忘记了脚被石块刺痛。当涉过河水赶到宿营地时，已经是十一点半了。
    为着祖国的石油事业，这群在戈壁滩上的姑娘们不仅勇敢地工作着，而且不倦地学习着。她们懂得：建设祖国决不能单凭热情和勇敢，还必须努力提高科学技术水平——用同样的热情去学习和掌握它。
   去年七月，她们离开浙南鳌江两岸的故乡，走出浙江温州师范的课堂时，她们连什么是经纬仪，什么是平版仪，以及测量方面的普通名词，都没有听说过。然而祖国需要她们最迅速地学会测量工作，她们只受了三个月课堂训练，即进入了生产实习。在实习期间，她们战胜了平生初次遇到的奇寒，竭力适应了北方的生活习惯；也初步学得了一些测量知识。但技术水平还远远不能适应工作的需要。使用仪器笨手笨脚，测量效率一天达不到一平方公里的十分之一。计算方面连算盘珠儿怎样拨法都不懂得。绘出来的图圆不成圆，方不成方。由于开头工作做不好，有些姑娘曾背地里流过眼泪。经过七、八个月的工作以后，她们开始胜任工作了。陈良珍、黄肖肖、胡元春、黄金洪、杨永香都是不满十八岁的青年团员，现在已领导着一个小队，在野外工作了。
   当然，技术的长进，并不是一帆风顺的。去年十月份，陈良珍小队到戈壁滩上一个新的地区测量。上级给她们的任务是：在五十天内测完一百十三点五平方公里的地形。可是，她们用了二十五天的时间，只测出了十三平方公里多一点的面积。她有些着急了，但急有什么用呢？必须动脑筋想办法。这时候，石油管理总局地质局的负责人到她们队里来，带给了她们很大的鼓舞，她们想到了地质大队大队长、党总支书记给她们的种种帮助和鼓励；想到了各地相识的、不相识的人们写给她们那种充满着希望和关怀的寄语；想到记者们的来访和如何把她们摄入了镜头；想到中央新闻电影制片厂摄制组到她们队上来摄制彩色影片。这些，都变成了策励她们的力量。“难道即将出现在银幕上的人，工作能够这样落后下去吗？”“不能够！”于是，黑地、白天，她们积极寻找测量迟缓的原因。无数的问题像乱丝一样纠缠在陈良珍的脑际：“也许是跑尺的方法有问题，也许是对仪器不熟悉！……”正在这时候，大队的一级测量技术员张墨田来检查工作，给她们指出：“你们跑尺的方法应该改进——需要统一跑尺的方向。”这话道着了她们的要害，第二天她们便照着实行，效率就由不到一平方公里提高到四平方公里。但她们并没有满足，仍然反来复去地研究着，想进一步改进跑尺的方法。经过大家座谈后，她们认识到：如果采取圆圈跑尺的方法，不是更可以缩短测工跑尺的路程吗？不是就能用最少的时间，站更多的点子吗？第三天，她们又作了新的改进，结果在同样的地形和要求下，工作效率又提高到五平方公里。后来又经过对新仪器特性的苦心摸索，也能运用自如了，工作效率更加提高，到了最后一个时期，她们竟然一天测量出七平方公里的面积。
    她们是多么高兴啊，每天收工以后，在帐篷外的场地上，跳着集体舞和藏民舞，敲打着脸盆和木棒来伴奏，有时候，她们还放肆地你压我，我压你，压起“堆堆”来。十七岁的小姑娘——工会主席李莲菱对我说：“艰苦奋斗就是光荣，不怕困难就会胜利。”的确，她们就是那样地认识生活。
