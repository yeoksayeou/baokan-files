Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Under the instigation of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits who are roaming in the border areas of Burma, Laos, and Thailand have recently intensified their activities.

    According to a Reuters report on the 7th, the Chiang bandit troops entrenched in Burma are "crossing the border into Laos, less than one hundred miles from Burma and Thailand." "It is said that the Kuomintang troops have repaired an old airport in Laos from wartime." Moreover, those Chiang bandit remnants have recently "received weapons, ammunition, and other supplies by air."

    News from Laos says that while Chiang bandit remnants in Burma continue to invade northern Laos, Chiang bandit troops originally entrenched in Laos are actively preparing for military operations. A group of Chiang bandit remnants who sneaked into the Meng Hsin area of Laos in January and February have established many military strongholds on the border between Laos and Burma. This group of bandits has also expanded its ranks. A group of Chiang bandit troops that has been active in the area of Long Nantang, at the junction of the Huai Sai Province and Phong Saly Province in Laos, is also stirring up trouble. News says that under the direction of the United States, these Chiang bandit remnants are preparing to attack Phong Saly Province's Bang Dai area, where the Lao Fighting Units are concentrated.

    The "New Burma Times" recently reported on the news of the Chiang bandit army gathering in this area. The newspaper said that in late January and mid-February, a large number of transport planes airlifted Chiang bandit remnants to the Meng Hsin area of Huai Sai Province.

    At the same time, the news points out that the Chiang bandit remnants who are still entrenched in Burma are also gathering and intensifying their activities.

    The recent rampant activities of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits in the border areas of Burma, Laos, and Thailand are entirely instigated and planned by the United States. The United States' plan is to use these Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits to threaten and attempt to invade the People's Republic of China, and at the same time instruct these bandit remnants to attack the Lao Fighting Units' assembly area, thereby undermining the Geneva Accords and peace in Laos.

    Regarding this point, a commentary in the "New Burma Times" on the 8th pointed out: "The Kuomintang army's establishment of an invasion base in the triangle area of Laos, Burma, and Thailand is a new plan by it and foreign countries with vested interests, with the aim of encircling China with troops and military bases." The newspaper pointed out that "the entry of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Burma into Laos makes the development of the situation full of danger, because Laos is within the scope of the Geneva armistice agreement."

    Burmese newspapers also believe that the activities that the United States is directing Chiang bandit remnants to intensify also endanger Burma's security. Burma's "Yangon Daily" wrote: The gathering of Chiang bandit remnants "is a threat to Burma."

### 在美国策动下的蒋贼残匪  在缅、泰、老挝边境加紧活动

    在美国策动下的蒋贼残匪
    在缅、泰、老挝边境加紧活动
    【新华社十二日讯】在美国的策动下，流窜在缅甸、老挝、泰国边境地带的蒋介石残匪最近加紧活动。
    据路透社七日报道，盘踞在缅甸境内的蒋匪军队“正越境进入离缅甸、泰国不到一百英里的老挝”。“据说，国民党军队已经修复了老挝境内的一个战争时候旧有的机场”。并且，那些蒋贼残匪就在最近“还得到空投的武器、弹药和其他供应品”。
    来自老挝的消息说，在缅甸境内蒋贼残匪继续侵入老挝北部的同时，原来盘踞在老挝的蒋贼军正在积极准备进行军事行动。一、二月间窜入老挝孟新地区的一批蒋贼残匪已经在老挝、缅甸边境建立起了许多军事据点。这批匪徒并且已经扩充了队伍。一直在老挝的会晒省和丰沙里省交界处隆南达一带活动的一批蒋匪队伍也在蠢蠢欲动。消息说，这些蒋贼残匪在美国的指使下，正在准备进攻寮国战斗部队集结区丰沙里省的磅待地方。
    关于蒋匪军在这个地区进行集结的消息，“缅甸新时代报”最近曾有报道。这个报纸说，在一月底和二月中旬，曾有大批运输机把蒋贼残匪空运到会晒省的孟新地区。
    同时，消息指出，现在仍旧盘踞在缅甸境内的蒋贼残匪也在进行集结，并且加紧他们的活动。
    蒋介石残匪最近在缅甸、老挝、泰国边境地区的嚣张活动，完全是美国所指使和策动的。美国的计划是要利用这些蒋介石残匪来威胁和伺机进犯中华人民共和国，同时指使这些残匪进攻寮国战斗部队集结区，从而破坏日内瓦协定和老挝的和平。
    关于这一点，“缅甸新时代报”八日的评论曾指出：“国民党军队在老挝、缅甸、泰国三角地区建立侵略基地，是它和与它有利害关系的外国人的一个新计划，目的在以军队和军事基地来包围中国”。报纸指出，“在缅甸的蒋介石军队进入老挝，使形势的发展充满了危险性，因为老挝是在日内瓦停战协定范围内的。”
    缅甸报纸并且认为，美国指使蒋贼残匪加紧进行着的活动也危害着缅甸的安全。缅甸“仰光日报”写道：蒋贼残匪的集结，“对缅甸是一种威胁”。
