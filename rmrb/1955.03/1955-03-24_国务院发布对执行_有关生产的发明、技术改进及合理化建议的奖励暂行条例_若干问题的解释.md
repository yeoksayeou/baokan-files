Following the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions Related to Production, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals" by the former Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on August 28, 1954, various factories and mines raised several questions during implementation. Based on these questions, the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued on February 18, 1955, "Interpretations on Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the 'Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions Related to Production, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals'." The full text of the interpretations is as follows:

I. On the Effective Date of These Regulations

These regulations are effective from the date of promulgation by the Government Administration Council on August 28, 1954.

II. On the Departments to Which These Regulations Apply

Any invention, technical improvement, or rationalization proposal related to production that is applicable to one of the following departments shall be rewarded according to these regulations after adoption. The applicable departments refer to: industry, construction, transportation, state-owned farms (excluding the discovery of new agricultural and pastoral varieties), state-owned tractor stations, forestry industry, water conservancy projects, geological exploration (excluding the discovery of new mineral deposits), postal and telecommunications industry, and production units affiliated to departments such as government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and cooperatives.

Non-production-related technical suggestions applicable to the above departments or other departments are not subject to these regulations. However, in order to encourage the initiative of the suggester and to facilitate the improvement of work and increase work efficiency, the adopting unit may, at its discretion, provide material or honorary rewards based on the significance of the suggestion.

III. On the Questions of Which Authority Should Review Production-Related Technical Suggestions Proposed by Chinese Citizens and Foreign Nationals, and the Rewards After Adoption

Production-related technical suggestions proposed by Chinese citizens and foreign nationals working in enterprises shall be reviewed by the enterprise's designated management agency. Major production-related technical suggestions proposed by Chinese citizens and foreign nationals not working in enterprises may be reviewed by the central technical management authority; general production-related technical suggestions may be reviewed by the relevant production departments of the people's committees at all levels or the designated management agency of the central industrial departments; production-related technical suggestions applicable only to a specific enterprise may be reviewed by that enterprise.

After the adoption of production-related technical suggestions proposed by Chinese citizens and foreign nationals, bonuses shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 of these regulations.

IV. On the Issue of Rewards for Suggestions Proposed by Criminals and Citizens Subject to Administrative Penalties

These regulations do not apply to production-related technical suggestions proposed by counter-revolutionaries and other criminals. For production-related technical suggestions proposed by prisoners undergoing labor reform, the provisions of Chapter VII on rewards and punishments of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Labor Reform" promulgated by the Government Administration Council in September 1954 shall apply. For production-related technical suggestions proposed by counter-revolutionaries and other criminals not in detention, the unit adopting the suggestion shall consult with public security and judicial organs and handle the matter with reference to Article 8 of the "Interim Measures for the Control of Counter-Revolutionary Elements" and the provisions of Chapter VII of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Labor Reform," depending on the specific circumstances.

Production-related technical suggestions proposed by citizens subject to administrative penalties (such as demotion, demerit, warning, etc.) shall still be rewarded in accordance with these regulations after adoption.

V. On Whether to Re-Issue Bonuses According to These Regulations for Production-Related Technical Suggestions Adopted Before the Promulgation of These Regulations

For production-related technical suggestions adopted before the promulgation of these regulations, no past accounts shall be settled. Over-awarded bonuses shall not be returned, and under-awarded bonuses shall not be supplemented. However, in either of the following situations, the matter may still be handled in accordance with these regulations:

	(1) Production-related technical suggestions proposed in the past but adopted and implemented after the promulgation of these regulations;

	(2) For larger production-related technical suggestions adopted before the promulgation of these regulations, where the payment period for the bonus has not expired, the unpaid portion shall be calculated and issued in accordance with these regulations.

VI. On the Minimum Bonus Amount

The provisions in Article 7 of these regulations regarding the minimum bonus amount refer to the following: if the annual savings value of an invention is less than 667,000 yuan (referring to old currency, same below), and the bonus calculated at 30% is less than 200,000 yuan, a bonus of 200,000 yuan shall still be issued; if the savings value of a technical improvement is less than 500,000 yuan, and the bonus calculated at 20% is less than 100,000 yuan, a bonus of 100,000 yuan shall still be issued; if the savings value of a rationalization proposal is less than 500,000 yuan, and the bonus calculated at 10% is less than 50,000 yuan, a bonus of 50,000 yuan shall still be issued.

However, for production-related technical suggestions where the savings value is difficult to calculate, the matter may be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of these regulations.

VII. On the Additional Number

The significance of the provisions regarding the additional number in Article 7 of these regulations lies in making the additional number correspond to the decreasing percentage of the bonus rate, so that the absolute amount of the bonus received by the suggester still increases with the increase in savings value. Therefore, the greater the savings value created by the suggestion, the more the suggester's bonus will be.

The method for calculating the bonus is: the savings value of the suggestion multiplied by the bonus percentage, plus the additional number. For example, if the savings value of an invention is 2 million yuan, multiplying 2 million yuan by 12% yields 240,000 yuan, plus the additional number of 210,000 yuan, then the bonus due for that invention is 450,000 yuan.

VIII. On Whether the Suggestion Proposer (or Work Group) Should Also Implement the New Quotas and New Piece-Rate Wage Unit Prices Implemented Due to the Adoption of the Suggestion

When new quotas and new piece-rate wage unit prices are implemented due to the adoption of a suggestion, the suggester (or work group) should also implement the new quotas and new piece-rate wage unit prices, because the suggester has already received a bonus in accordance with the regulations after submitting the suggestion.

The provisions in the current piece-rate wage regulations or piece-rate wage procedures of various industries and enterprises that conflict with the provisions of Article 13 of these regulations shall be abolished.

IX. On the Issue of Rewarding Those Who Assist Others in Realizing Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals

According to the provisions of Chapter III of these regulations, personnel who provide assistance to the suggester in the process of submitting the suggestion shall be rewarded quarterly. The total amount of bonuses for all assisting personnel (the bonuses for assisting personnel and the suggester's bonus come from the same source and shall not be paid from the suggester's bonus) shall be 25% of the total amount of bonuses calculated based on the savings value of the various suggestions adopted within the quarter, calculated over twelve months, and the maximum amount of the bonus received by each assisting personnel shall not exceed two months of their actual wages. The distribution of bonuses to assisting personnel shall be determined by the enterprise supervisor based on the initiative and effort demonstrated by each assisting personnel in realizing the suggestion in each quarter, as well as the completion of the work tasks assigned to them.

X. On Whether to Reward Inventions, Technical Improvements, or Rationalization Proposals That Already Exist in Other Countries or in Our Own Country But Are Successfully Created by the Suggester Without Expert Advice or Publication Introduction

We should vigorously promote inventions, technical improvements, or rationalization proposals that already exist in other countries or in our own country into production in order to create more wealth for the country. At the same time, promoting suggestions can avoid spending effort to recreate existing production-related technical suggestions. If an invention already exists in another country, but has not been suggested by experts or introduced in publications, or even if its name is known but its content is unknown, and the suggester has successfully created it through careful research, this invention shall be rewarded in accordance with these regulations after adoption. However, if an invention already exists in our own country, and is later successfully created by another suggester, then this same production-related technical suggestion later proposed shall not be considered an invention. Because an invention refers to a suggestion that creates a new and more complete structure or technological process. If a technical improvement or rationalization proposal already exists in another country or in our own country, but the leadership has not promoted it, and the suggester has indeed successfully created it through careful research, this technical improvement or rationalization proposal shall also be rewarded in accordance with these regulations after adoption.

XI. How to Calculate the Bonus If an Adopted Production-Related Technical Suggestion Cannot Continue to Be Adopted for Some Reason

If an adopted production-related technical suggestion cannot continue to be adopted for some reason, the bonus shall be calculated and issued in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of these regulations based on the actual time that the suggestion was used in production. If the aforementioned suggestion is later continued to be adopted within the reward period (the reward period for inventions is three to five years, and the reward period for technical improvements and rationalization proposals is one year), the bonus shall be calculated and issued in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of these regulations based on the actual time that the suggestion was later used in production.

XII. If, After a Production-Related Technical Suggestion Proposed by One Suggester is Adopted, Another Suggester Proposes a New Production-Related Technical Suggestion Based on the Previous Suggester's Suggestion, Should This Be Rewarded?

If, after a production-related technical suggestion proposed by one suggester is adopted, another suggester proposes a new production-related technical suggestion based on the previous suggester's suggestion, it shall be rewarded in accordance with these regulations after adoption, because this new production-related technical suggestion has generated new savings value in production. For example, based on a suggestion previously made to improve the capacity of kilns, someone proposes a suggestion to rearrange the same volume of blanks, and after this suggestion is adopted, the capacity of the original kiln is increased by 10%. The bonus shall be calculated and issued according to the savings value created by this suggestion.

XIII. Can Assistance Be Given to Suggestions That Have Not Been Successfully Researched?

According to the provisions of Article 17 of the "Provisional Regulations on Guaranteeing Invention Rights and Patent Rights," for production-related technical suggestions that already have specific plans and drawings, and are deemed by the central competent authority to be valuable and have a hope of success after review, relevant enterprises or research and experimental institutions may be designated to provide convenience for research and experimentation, and may be given appropriate material subsidies. If only the comprehensive reaction equation of a certain compound is proposed, this is a theoretical synthesis method, and the conditions for promoting the completion of the reaction, such as catalysts, temperature, pressure, and devices, still need to be researched and tested, then assistance cannot be given to this type of suggestion for the time being.

    国务院发布对执行“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”若干问题的解释
    前中央人民政府政务院在一九五四年八月二十八日颁布“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”以后，各地厂矿企业在执行中提出了若干问题。中华人民共和国国务院根据这些问题，又在一九五五年二月十八日发布了对执行“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”若干问题的解释。解释全文如下：
    一、关于本条例的实行日期问题
    本条例从一九五四年八月二十八日政务院发布之日起实行。
    二、关于本条例适用的部门问题
    凡有关生产的发明、技术改进和合理化建议适用于下列部门之一的，经采用后都按照本条例给以奖励。适用的部门是指：工业、建筑业、交通运输业、国营农场（发现新的农牧业品种不包括在内）、国营拖拉机站、森林工业、水利工程、地质勘探（发现新矿藏不包括在内）、邮电业以及机关、团体、企业、合作社等部门所属的生产单位。
    凡适用于上述部门或其他部门的非生产技术性的建议，不适用本条例。但为了鼓励建议人的积极性，以利于改进工作，提高工作效率，采用建议的单位可根据建议的意义酌情给予物质奖励或荣誉奖励。
    三、关于我国公民及外国侨民提出的生产技术性的建议由何机关审查和采用建议后的奖励问题
    在企业中工作的我国公民及外国侨民所提出的有关生产技术性的建议，由本企业的专管机构审查。不在企业中工作的我国公民及外国侨民所提出的有关生产技术性的重大建议，可以由中央技术管理机关审查；有关生产技术性的一般建议，可以由各级人民委员会的主管生产部门或者中央产业部门的专管机关审查；只适用于某一企业的有关生产技术性的建议，可以由该企业审查。
    我国公民和外国侨民提出的有关生产技术性的建议，经采用后按照本条例第二十九条规定核发奖金。
    四、关于刑事犯和受行政处分的公民提出的建议的奖励问题
    本条例不适用于反革命犯和其他刑事犯所提出的有关生产技术性的建议。对于劳动改造中的犯人提出的有关生产技术性的建议，应按一九五四年九月政务院颁布的“中华人民共和国劳动改造条例”第七章奖惩的规定办理；对于不在关押中的反革命犯和其他刑事犯所提出的有关生产技术性的建议，应当由采用建议的单位商同公安、司法机关，分别情况参照“管制反革命分子暂行办法”第八条和“中华人民共和国劳动改造条例”第七章的规定办理。
    受行政处分（如降级、记过、警告等）的公民提出的有关生产技术性的建议，经采用后仍按本条例奖励。
    五、关于本条例发布以前所采用的生产技术性的建议是否重新按照本条例核发奖金的问题
    凡在本条例发布以前所采用的生产技术性的建议，一律不算旧账，多奖者不退，少奖者不补。但有下列一种情况的，可以仍按照本条例办理：
      （一）过去提出的有关生产技术性的建议，在本条例发布以后采用实施的；
    （二）本条例发布以前采用的较大的生产技术性的建议，支付奖金的期限未满的，对尚未支付部分，按本条例计发奖金。
    六、关于奖金最低额问题
    本条例第七条中关于奖金最低额的规定，是指：发明的每年节约价值不满六十六万七千元（指旧币，下同），按照百分之三十提奖不到二十万元的，仍发给二十万元奖金；技术改进的节约价值不满五十万元，按照百分之二十提奖不到十万元的，仍发给十万元奖金；合理化建议的节约价值不满五十万元，按照百分之十提奖不到五万元的，仍发给五万元奖金。
    但属于难以计算节约价值的有关生产技术性的建议，可以按照本条例第十四条的规定办理。
    七、关于附加数问题
    本条例第七条中关于附加数的规定，它的意义在于使附加数与递减的提奖百分比相适应，使建议人所得奖金的绝对数仍然随着节约价值的增多而递增，因此建议所造成的节约价值愈大，则建议人所得奖金就愈多。
    计算奖金的方法是：建议的节约价值乘以提奖百分数，加上附加数。例如，某项发明的节约价值为二百万元，将二百万元乘以百分之十二，得出二十四万元，再加上附加数二十一万元，则该项发明应得的奖金为四十五万元。
    八、因采用建议而实行新定额和新的计件工资单价、建议人本人（或工组）是否同样实行的问题
    因采用建议而实行新定额和新的计件工资单价的时候，建议人本人（或工组）应同样实行新定额和新的计件工资单价，因为建议人提出建议后已按照规定领取了奖金。
    各产业、企业现行的计件工资条例或者计件工资规程中有关这一问题的规定如同本条例第十三条的规定有抵触的应予废除。
    九、对协助他人实现发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励问题
    根据本条例第三章的规定，凡对建议人在提出建议过程中给以协助的人员，应按季度给以奖励。所有协助人员的奖金总额（协助人员的奖金和建议人奖金同一来源，不得从建议人奖金中支付）为该季度内采用的各项建议按照十二个月节约价值计算出的奖金总额的百分之二十五，而每个协助人员所得奖金的最高额，则不得超过本人两个月的实际工资。对协助人员的奖金分配，由企业主管人按照每一协助人员在每一季度实现建议中所表现的主动性和努力程度，以及分配给他们的工作任务完成情况来分配。
    十、他国或本国已有的发明、技术改进或合理化建议，未经专家建议和刊 物介绍，而为建议人创造成功，是否按照本条例给予奖励的问题
    对他国或本国已有的发明、技术改进或合理化建议，我们应该大力推广到生产中去，以便为国家创造更多的财富，同时推广了建议以后，可以避免花费精力再去创造已有的生产技术性的建议。他国已有的发明，未经专家建议和刊物介绍或虽知其名而不知其内容，为建议人本人精心研究创造成功，此项发明经采用后按照本条例给以奖励。但本国已有的发明，如果后来又为另一建议人创造成功，则后来提出的这个同样的生产技术性的建议不算发明。因为发明是指创造新的更为完善的结构或工艺技术过程的建议。如果他国或本国已有的技术改进或合理化建议，而领导未加推广，确为建议人本人精心研究创造成功，此项技术改进或合理化建议，经采用后亦按照本条例给予奖励。
    十一、已采用的生产技术性的建议因某种原因不能继续采用，奖金如何算法
    已采用的生产技术性的建议，如因某种原因不能继续采用时，奖金应根据该项建议在生产中实际采用的时间按照本条例第七条的规定计算发给。如前项建议在奖励期限内（发明的奖励期限为三年到五年，技术改进及合理化建议的奖励期限为一年）后来继续采用时，奖金则根据该项建议后来在生产中实际采用的时间，按照本条例第七条的规定计算发给。
    十二、某建议人提出的生产技术性的建议经采用后，另一建议人又在前人建议的基础上提出新的生产技术性的建议，这样是否给以奖励
    某建议人提出的生产技术性的建议经采用后，另一建议人又在前人建议的基础上提出新的生产技术性的建议，经采用后按照本条例给以奖励，因为此项新的生产技术性的建议在生产中产生了新的节约价值。例如，在前人提出改进窑炉容量建议的基础上，有人提出把同样体积的坯件重新排列一下的建议，此项建议经采用后使原有窑炉的容量增加了百分之十，奖金则按照此项建议所创造的节约价值核发。
    十三、对未研究成功的建议能否给予帮助的问题
    根据“保障发明权与专利权暂行条例”第十七条的规定，凡已有具体计划和图样，经中央主管机关审查认为确有价值并有成功希望的生产技术性的建议，可以指定有关企业或研究实验机关给予研究实验之方便，并酌量予以物质补助。如果只提出某种化合物的综合反应方程式，这是理论的综合方法，而促成反应完成的条件，如触煤、温度、压力和装置等尚待研究试验，对这种建议暂时还不能给予帮助。（新华社）
