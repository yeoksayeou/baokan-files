Recently, scientists in Beijing organized an Atomic Energy Popular Lecture Organizing Committee. To cooperate with the work of giving lectures on atomic energy science knowledge in various places, they compiled a popular booklet based on the lecture drafts of some scientists - "Popular Talks on Atomic Energy." The content of this booklet is more in line with current needs, and the text is relatively popular, suitable for readers who generally lack specialized knowledge but have a certain ability to understand, and also suitable for lecturers in various places to use as lecture materials. In particular, the discussion on the political struggle of atomic energy, the basic viewpoints described in the book, are of certain reference value for lecturers in various places.

This booklet is divided into five parts. The first part introduces the basic knowledge needed to understand "What is Atomic Energy," mainly "energy," "atoms," and "chemical energy and atomic energy," etc.

The booklet first starts from daily life, describing "energy" and its uses. Then, it introduces the history of mankind's use of "energy," explaining the huge role that atomic energy plays in society.

Regarding the structure of the atom, the booklet introduces the size and weight of the atom, and what it is made of.

Based on the knowledge of atomic structure, the author answers the questions of what is chemical energy and what is atomic energy. And according to the principle of relativity—the heavier the thing, the greater the energy it contains—it is explained that the energy released by the nucleus is millions or even tens of millions of times greater than chemical energy.

The second part of "Popular Talks on Atomic Energy" explains the history of mankind's discovery and mastery of atomic energy. The discovery and utilization of atomic energy are the inevitable results of the development of modern industry and science. Following the clues of scientists in search of ways to liberate atomic energy, the author tells the reader what difficulties people encountered and how they overcame these difficulties on the road to liberating atomic energy. These historical narratives show that the discovery and utilization of atomic energy is the result of the collective efforts of scientists from all over the world.

In the history of about fifty years of searching for methods to liberate atomic energy, the booklet focuses on describing five important discoveries of scientists. They are: First, the discovery of natural radioactive phenomena of substances such as uranium and radium, these discoveries opened the door to the study of atomic energy. Second, it was proved that the atomic nucleus can be artificially changed. Third, the neutron was discovered. Fourth, artificial radioactive isotopes were discovered. These last two discoveries greatly developed the work of liberating atomic energy. Fifth, the discovery of the fission phenomenon of uranium-235 and the proof of the possibility of a chain reaction of uranium fission. In this way, scientists finally found the way to liberate atomic energy.

"Popular Talks on Atomic Energy" uses more space to introduce atomic reactors. Atomic reactors are the most basic equipment for large-scale liberation of atomic energy in industry today, therefore, the introduction of this knowledge is of great practical significance. In addition, this part of "Popular Talks on Atomic Energy" also introduces methods of using fast chain reactions and thermonuclear reactions to obtain atomic energy.

The narration of the peaceful use of atomic energy is the third part of "Popular Talks on Atomic Energy," and also one of the focuses of this booklet. The booklet introduces the extremely wide applications of atomic energy in industry, agriculture, and medicine, pointing out that the peaceful use of atomic energy will bring great happiness to mankind.

The author first introduces the atomic energy power station. Everyone knows that Soviet scientists have already achieved great achievements in this regard. When introducing this issue, the booklet points out that to achieve such great achievements, a series of very difficult technical problems must be solved, which convincingly illustrates that the scientific and technological level of the Soviet Union has far exceeded that of the United States.

The booklet also introduces the atomic energy engine using enriched uranium, which can make airplanes and submarines travel long distances without adding fuel.

When talking about the application of radioactive isotopes, the booklet emphasizes that it has a huge effect on all sciences, just like the telescope had on astronomy and the microscope had on physiology and medicine.

The application of radioactive isotopes mainly relies on their two characteristics. One characteristic is that they can continuously emit rays with strong penetrating power. Using this characteristic, we can often check the damage of the refractory layer of the blast furnace, inspect the internal injuries and sand holes of metal castings, automatically control the hot rolling process of steel plates, and so on. The other characteristic is the "tracer" property. Using this property, the problem of foliar topdressing of phosphorus can be solved in agriculture, the circulation of blood in the human body can be studied in medicine, the wear of machines can be tested in industry, and so on.

At the end of this part, the author also narrates how much the world will change when mankind masters atomic energy: the climate will be appropriately changed, the desert will become land where crops can be grown, and factories that directly manufacture food from inorganic matter will also appear... These beautiful fantasies and miracles can be fully realized by relying on human wisdom and labor.

The fourth part of the booklet introduces the principles, structure, power, and defense methods of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.

The author first explains the principle of the rapid chain reaction of atomic bombs, focusing on explaining that the size of atomic bombs is limited by the "critical volume" and cannot be made too large or too small. The hydrogen bomb is made using the thermonuclear reaction of deuterium and tritium, so its size is not limited by the "critical volume" and its power is much greater than that of atomic bombs. However, hydrogen bombs are much more difficult to manufacture than atomic bombs, so they are not easy to mass-produce.

The booklet relatively accurately narrates the power of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and refutes some exaggerated rumors, especially citing some scientific arguments to smash the vicious propaganda of some warmongers who believe that atomic bombs are indefensible. The author here introduces reliable methods to defend against atomic bombs and reduce casualties. For example, in areas beyond 800 meters, if the underground air defense facilities are relatively strong, covered with a layer of cement more than half a meter thick or a layer of soil one meter thick, and there are no flammable materials around, then it is enough to defend against shock waves, light radiation, and penetrating radiation attacks. And, fifteen minutes after the explosion, radioactive materials will be greatly reduced. As for more effective defense methods, they are to prevent enemy aircraft carrying atomic bombs from flying into our country's airspace and to destroy enemy bases storing atomic weapons.

Since atomic war is after all a very cruel war, the author especially emphasizes: Of course, the most active way to prevent atomic weapons war from bringing disasters to the people is for the people of the world to rise up to oppose imperialism launching atomic war, ban the use of atomic weapons, and destroy existing atomic weapons.

The struggle surrounding the atomic energy issue of "banning the use of atomic weapons and peacefully using atomic energy" is a major event in the world today, and the fifth part of this booklet is to explain this issue.

Our people, like the Soviet Union, resolutely advocate banning the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. At the same time, we must also, with the help of the Soviet Union, rapidly develop the cause of peaceful use of atomic energy, to accelerate our country's socialist construction and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Our country already has all the conditions for developing the peaceful use of atomic energy.

After discussing the basic positions taken by the Soviet Union and our country and the United States separately, the author turned to refute the various lies fabricated by the American imperialists about atomic weapons. And based on the experience of World War II, it pointed out that the so-called strategic bombing by the air force (including bombing with atomic weapons) cannot play a decisive role in the war.

The author analyzed the balance of power between the peace and democracy camp and the aggressive camp, and pointed out that the peace and democracy camp has always maintained an advantage in politics and military affairs, and has always maintained continuous growth in the economy. In particular, the Soviet Union has already gained an advantage in atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. At the same time, the Soviet Union and China also have many superiorities in geographical conditions. The land is vast, and the population and industry are not very concentrated, which gives us many favorable conditions in dealing with atomic bomb attacks compared to the United States and even Britain. These facts cannot but fundamentally determine that if American imperialists dare to launch an atomic war, then they will be the ones who will be destroyed!

Despite this, we still resolutely advocate opposing the use of atomic weapons and advocate destroying existing atomic weapons, because atomic war will bring huge disasters to the peaceful residents of any party.

The booklet also answered the question of whether atomic war can be stopped, pointing out that if the people of the world unite to stop atomic war, then atomic war can be completely stopped.

Although "Popular Talks on Atomic Energy" has the above-mentioned advantages, it also has many shortcomings because it was written in a short period of time. The main ones are that the material is not organized and hierarchical enough, the text is relatively plain and dry, and there are fewer examples and metaphors. In short, this booklet is not shallow, vivid, and popular enough. We hope that the author of this booklet will revise it in the second edition, and hope that more scientific workers will write more and better popular readings introducing atomic energy knowledge.

专栏：

    介绍“原子能通俗讲话”
    原子能通俗讲座组织委员会编
    中华全国科学技术普及协会出版
    何浩容
    最近，北京市的科学家们组织了一个原子能通俗讲座组织委员会。为了配合各地关于原子能科学知识演讲的工作，他们根据部分科学家的讲稿编写了一本通俗小册子——“原子能通俗讲话”。这本小册子的内容比较切合当前需要，文字也比较通俗，适合于一般缺乏专门知识而有一定理解能力的读者阅读，也适合于各地演讲者用作演讲的材料。特别是关于原子能的政治斗争的论述，该书所叙述的基本观点，对于各地演讲者是有一定的参考价值的。
    这本小册子分五部分。第一部分是介绍对于理解“什么是原子能”所需要的基本知识，主要是“能”、“原子”，以及“化学能与原子能”等。
    小册子首先从日常生活出发，叙述了“能”及其用途。接着，它便介绍了人类利用“能”的历史，说明了原子能对社会所起的巨大作用。
    关于原子的结构，小册子介绍了原子的大小和重量，以及原子是由什么东西构成的。
    根据关于原子结构的知识，作者回答了什么是化学能和原子能的问题。并根据相对论的原理——愈重的东西所蕴含的能量愈大，说明：由原子核放出的能量，要比化学能大上百万倍，甚至千万倍。
    “原子能通俗讲话”的第二部分，说明了人类发现和掌握原子能的历史。原子能的发现和利用，是现代工业和科学发展的必然结果。作者循着科学家们寻找解放原子能方法的线索，告诉读者在解放原子能的道路上，人们曾遇到过什么困难和怎样克服了这些困难。这些历史的叙述，表明了原子能的发现和利用乃是世界各国科学家集体努力的结果。
    在五十年左右的寻找解放原子能方法的历史中，小册子着重叙述了科学家们的五个重要的发现。它们就是：一，发现了铀和镭等物质的自然放射现象，这些发现揭开了研究原子能的门户。二，证明了原子核是可以用人工的方法使它发生变化的。三，发现了中子。四，发现了人工放射性同位素。这后两个发现使解放原子能的工作得到了大大的发展。五，发现了铀二三五的分裂现象和证明了铀分裂的链式反应的可能。这样，科学家们便终于找到了解放原子能的道路。
    “原子能通俗讲话”以较多的篇幅来介绍原子反应堆。原子反应堆是今天工业上大规模解放原子能的最基本的设备，因此，这些知识的介绍是很有实际意义的。此外，“原子能通俗讲话”这一部分里还介绍了利用快速链式反应和热核反应来取得原子能的方法。
    原子能和平利用的叙述，是“原子能通俗讲话”的第三部分，也是这本小册子的重点之一。小册子介绍了原子能在工业、农业和医学上的极其广泛的应用，指出和平使用原子能将给人类带来很大的幸福。
    作者首先介绍的是原子能电力站。大家知道，在这方面苏联科学家们已经获得了伟大的成就。小册子在介绍这一问题时，指出：要取得这样伟大的成就，必须解决一系列十分困难的技术问题，这就令人信服地说明了苏联的科学技术水平已经远远地超过了美国。
    小册子还介绍了使用浓缩铀的原子能发动机，这种发动机可以使飞机和潜水艇等行驶很长距离而不需添加燃料。
    在谈到放射性同位素的应用时，小册子着重地指出了它对于各门科学，正像当年望远镜对于天文学和显微镜对于生理学和医学那样具有巨大的作用。
    放射性同位素的应用，主要是依靠了它们的两个特性。一个特性是它们能够不断地放射出穿透力很强的射线。利用这一特性，我们可以经常检查高炉耐火层损坏的情况，透视金属铸件的内伤和砂孔，自动控制钢板的热轧过程，等等。另一个特性是“示踪”性质。利用这个性质，在农业上可以解决磷的根外追肥问题，在医学上可以研究人体内血液的循环，在工业上可以检验机器的磨损，等等。
    作者在这一部分的最后，还叙述了人类掌握了原子能，将使整个世界发生多大的变化：气候将被适当地改变，沙漠也将成为可以生长作物的土地，直接从无机物中制造出食品来的工厂也将出现……。这些美丽的幻想和奇迹，依靠人类的智慧和劳动，是完全可以实现的。
    小册子的第四部分介绍了原子弹和氢弹的原理、结构、威力和防御方法。
    作者首先说明的是原子弹的快速的链式反应的原理，着重地说明原子弹的大小要受到“临界体积”的限制，不能做得太大或太小。而氢弹是利用重氢和超重氢的热核反应来做的，所以它的大小不受“临界体积”的限制，它的威力也比原子弹大得很多。但是，氢弹在制造上要比原子弹困难得多，因而不易进行大规模生产。
    小册子比较正确地叙述了原子弹和氢弹的威力，并驳斥了某些虚夸的传说，特别是举出了一些科学论据，粉碎了某些战争贩子认为原子弹不可防御的恶毒宣传。作者在这里介绍了防御原子弹和减少杀伤的可靠方法。比如，在八百公尺以外的地区，如果地下的防空设备造得比较坚固，盖有一层半公尺多厚的水泥或一公尺厚的土层，以及周围没有易燃物，那么，它就足以防御冲击波、光辐射和贯穿辐射的袭击。并且，在爆炸了十五分钟后，放射性物质就要大大减少。至于更有效的防御方法，则是阻止敌人携有原子弹的飞机飞入我国上空和摧毁敌人储有原子武器的基地。
    由于原子战争毕竟是一场十分残酷的战争，所以作者特别强调地指出：当然，防止原子武器战争带给人民以灾难的最积极的办法，还是全世界人民起来反对帝国主义发动原子战争，禁止使用原子武器，并且销毁现有的原子武器。
    围绕着原子能问题而展开的“禁止使用原子武器、和平使用原子能”的斗争，是今天世界上一件大事，这本小册子的第五部分就是说明这一问题的。
    我国人民同苏联一样，坚决主张禁止使用原子武器和氢武器。但同时，我们也一定要在苏联帮助之下，迅速地发展和平使用原子能的事业，来加快我国的社会主义建设，保卫远东和世界的和平。
    我国已经具备了发展和平使用原子能的一切条件。
    作者在分别论述了苏联和我国以及美国所采取的基本立场后，便转向驳斥美帝国主义者在原子武器上所捏造的各种谎话。并根据第二次世界大战的经验，指出了所谓空军的战略轰炸（包括原子武器的轰炸在内）在战争中并不能起决定作用。
    作者分析了和平民主阵营同侵略阵营之间的力量对比，并指出：和平民主阵营在政治上和军事上都一直保持着优势，在经济上也一直保持着不断的高涨。特别是，苏联在原子武器、氢武器上，已经占有了优势。同时，苏联和中国在地理条件上还有许多优越的地方。土地广大，人口和工业不很集中，这就使我们在应付原子弹的攻击上比起美国，乃至英国都有许多有利的条件。这些事实不能不根本地决定了：假如美帝国主义者敢于发动原子战争，那末，遭到毁灭的一定是他们自己！
    尽管如此，我们还是坚决主张反对使用原子武器，主张销毁现存的原子武器，因为原子战争会给任何一方和平居民带来巨大的灾难。
    小册子还回答了原子战争能不能被制止的问题，指出：如果全世界人民一致来制止原子战争，那么，原子战争是完全可以制止的。
    虽然，“原子能通俗讲话”有上述一些优点，但是，由于它是在短时间内赶写出来的，所以它也有不少缺点。主要的是，取材不够有条理、有层次，文字比较平淡枯燥，例子和比喻也较少一些。总之，这本小册子在浅近、生动和通俗方面，是作得还不够的。我们希望这本小册子的作者在再版时加以修订，并希望有更多的科学工作者写出更多更好介绍原子能知识的通俗读物。
