The Working Committee of the National Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Trade Union of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened the first National Forestry Trade Union Work Conference in Beijing from February 21st to March 4th.

　　In recent years, thanks to the implementation of the Party and the government's policy of protecting forests and developing forestry, forestry work has achieved great results. The forest industry has now developed into a considerable industrial sector. Along with the recovery and development of forest industrial production, trade union organizations have been established in various units, except in a few overly dispersed areas. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, trade union organizations at all levels have conducted extensive patriotic education among forest industry workers across the country, promoted the Party's general line during the transition period, continuously enhanced the class consciousness of the working masses, played an active and creative role in production, launched labor competitions, and improved the labor productivity of the forest industry, powerfully ensuring the supply of timber needed for national construction and people's lives. On the basis of increased production, labor insurance has been implemented in most forest areas, and many collective welfare undertakings have been organized, with significant improvements in the material and cultural lives of workers.

　　This conference exchanged experiences in forestry trade union work. The meeting also considered that: according to the state's requirements for forest industrial production and the instructions of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the central task of forest industry trade union organizations in 1955 is: under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to maintain close ties with the masses, continue to carry out labor competitions in a deep and comprehensive manner, actively assist the administration in strengthening planning management and technical management, effectively ensure the specifications and quality of timber, complete tree planting plans, resolutely oppose waste, increase timber yield, reduce costs, and continuously improve labor productivity, so as to ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion and overfulfillment of the 1955 national plan and support the liberation of Taiwan.

　　During the meeting, Vice Minister of Forestry Yong Wentao and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Liu Ningyi delivered reports.

　　The meeting also elected members of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Forestry Trade Union, and the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Forestry Trade Union was officially established.
