    Chinese Fir
    Meng Xixiong

    The tree planting season has arrived, and farmers in the vast areas of southern China are creating Chinese fir forests.

    Chinese fir has many advantages. Its trunk is straight, its wood is light and soft, it is easy to process, it has a fragrance, and it is resistant to decay and termites. Therefore, it has become an important material for construction, tools, ships, bridges, mine supports, and utility poles; it is also a raw material for papermaking. Chinese fir grows rapidly. Generally, after two or three decades, it can grow into timber that is six or seven inches in diameter and five or six zhang in height (one zhang is about 3.3 meters); some Chinese fir can grow to ten zhang in height.

    Natural Chinese fir forests have long been unable to meet people's needs. As early as 1370 (during the Ming Dynasty's Taizu era) or even earlier, in the mountainous areas south of the Yangtze River, people of all ethnic groups began to cultivate fir forests. In their long-term labor, the working people have accumulated rich experience in planting fir trees. Cultivating fir forests is like planting crops, requiring a lot of labor. However, a large amount of timber can be obtained on a small piece of land in a relatively short period of time.

    When fir seedlings are still young, farmers often take advantage of the gaps between the seedlings to plant tung trees and miscellaneous grains. This not only yields one or two years of grain and three or four years of tung seeds, but also avoids the harm of weeds and promotes the growth of fir trees. As the Chinese fir gradually grows, crops are gradually discontinued, and tung trees are cut down. After that, only pruning and thinning are required, and after two or three decades, it can be harvested and utilized. On the harvested sites, the land can be re-prepared for afforestation. This set of fir planting experiences created by the working people of our country is very valuable.

    Chinese fir is widely distributed in our country: from the southern slope of the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province in the north to Guangdong in the south, from the Dadu River in the west to Taiwan in the east, as long as it is not too cold or too dry, and the mountain slopes have loose topsoil and good drainage, Chinese fir can be planted. Since our country began implementing its first five-year plan, farmers in southern China have organized themselves to carry out large-scale Chinese fir afforestation, creating about one million hectares of Chinese fir forests every year. After two or three decades, 300 million cubic meters of timber can be harvested. By then, not only will the barren mountains be covered with greenery, but a large amount of timber needed by the country and the people can be supplied. (Attached picture)

    杉木
    孟夏雄
    植树季节已到，江南广大地区林农正在营造杉木林。
    杉木有很多优点。它的树干端直，材质轻软，加工容易，有香气，耐朽力强，白蚁不能蛀蚀。因此，它就成为建筑、器具、船只、桥梁、矿柱、电杆等的重要用材；它还是造纸的原料。杉木生长迅速，一般经过二、三十年，就能长成粗六、七寸（直径）、高五、六丈的木材；有的杉木能长到十丈高。
    杉木的天然林，久已不能满足人们的需要。远在一三七○年（明太祖时代）或更久以前，在长江以南的山岳地带，各族劳动人民就开始经营杉林。劳动人民在长期的劳动中，积累了丰富的植杉经验。经营杉林和种庄稼一样，需要用很大的劳力。但在小块的土地上，在较短的时间内，就能获得大量的木材。
    农民在杉苗还是幼小的时候，常利用树苗间隙地点种油桐和杂粮。这样不但可以收获一两年粮食和三、四年桐籽，而且可以避免杂草的为害，促进杉木的生长。杉木逐渐成长，陆续停种作物，砍去桐树。以后只要修枝间伐，二、三十年后，便可采伐利用。在采伐后的迹地上，又可重新整地造林。我国劳动人民所创造的这一套植杉经验，是很珍贵的。
    杉木在我国分布很广：北自陕西省秦岭南坡，南至广东，西自大渡河，东至台湾，只要不太寒冷，不太干旱，表土疏松、排水良好的山坡，都可以栽植杉木。自从我国开始执行第一个五年计划以来，江南的林农已组织起来，进行大片的杉木造林，每年约营造杉木林一百万公顷，二、三十年后，即可采伐三亿立方公尺的木材。到那时，不但荒山披上了绿衣，还可大量供应国家和人民需要的木材。（附图片）
