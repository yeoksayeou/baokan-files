    Helping Farmers in Specialty Product Areas Manage Funds
    Sheng Qiwen
    After the concentrated sale of cotton, peanuts, and fruits, farmers in some specialty product areas of Shandong Province have seen a significant increase in income and a substantial improvement in their living standards. However, some farmers have not managed their money properly. For example, in Zhongzhuang Township, Guan County, fifty households bought bricks to build tombs; lavish eating and drinking have occurred in many areas; and some private merchants have even borrowed money from farmers for speculative business. This situation shows that in the abundant special crop production areas, it is particularly necessary to carry out ideological education and various economic tasks to help farmers properly manage the large amounts of funds in their hands.
    In the agricultural production cooperative led by Feng Yu-shen in Guanshang Fengjia Village, Sixth District of Rushan County, some cooperative members were urging the cooperative director to sell the peanuts quickly before they were even dried, and were rushing to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy necessities. The agricultural cooperative held a cooperative affairs committee meeting, analyzed the members' thinking, and then educated the members by summarizing production to help them make specific plans. The cooperative's leaders praised Feng Deping, a member who was thrifty and actively saved, and criticized Feng Lantian, a member who did not know how to manage money. As a result, the members began to make long-term plans, voluntarily participated in savings, and accumulated more than 7 million yuan (old currency) in production funds for the agricultural cooperative, preparing to purchase fertilizers and other production materials.
    After discovering that many farmers were squandering and wasting money, the Lei Jia Township branch of the Communist Party in Gaomi County led the credit cooperative to help farmers calculate income and expenditure accounts, make production plans, and accumulate production funds. Liu Yongchun, a new middle peasant in Yinjialou Village of this township, could earn 15 million yuan after selling cotton, in addition to paying public grain and buying rations. His family already had a house to live in, but he wanted to build four more rooms. Later, with the help of cadres, he calculated his income and expenditure and abandoned his plan to build a house. Besides buying an ox, some fodder, chemical fertilizers, and cloth, he planned to save 12 million yuan in the bank in installments and buy 200,000 yuan in public bonds. Liu Yongchun said with satisfaction, "Where can you find such a good money box! If you put money at home, you spend it casually; if you deposit it in the bank, it earns interest and supports national industrial construction." During this period, the farmers of Lei Jia Township saved a total of 530.86 million yuan in the bank, with savings households accounting for 69 percent of the total number of households in the township. In this way, the township had a reliable material foundation for this year's spring plowing.
    It is evident that as long as we conduct ideological education for farmers, help them calculate income and expenditure accounts, make production plans, and do a good job in various economic tasks, we can guide rural funds to the right path and accumulate funds for expanding production.

    帮助特产区农民安排资金
    盛奇文
    山东某些特产区的农民在集中出售棉花、花生、水果后，收入大大增加，生活有了很大的改善；但是也有部分农民没有正当地支配手里的钱。例如冠县中庄乡有五十户农民买砖做坟；大吃大喝现象也在不少地区发生了；有些私商竟向农民借钱做投机生意。这种情况说明，在丰收的特种作物产区特别需要做好思想教育和各项经济工作，帮助农民正当地安排他们手里的大量资金。
    乳山县六区观上冯家村冯玉慎领导的农业生产合作社的花生收获后还没有晒干，就有一些社员催着社长快卖花生，并到供销社去抢着买生活资料。农业社召开了社务委员会，分析了社员的思想，便对社员进行教育，通过总结生产，帮助社员具体打谱。社的领导干部表扬了会过日子、积极储蓄的社员冯德平，批评了不会过日子的社员冯蓝田。这样，社员们开始做了长远打算，自愿地参加储蓄，为农业社积累了七百多万元（旧币，下同）的生产资金，准备购买肥料等生产资料。
    高密县雷家乡支部发现不少农民挥霍浪费的现象后，便领导信用合作社帮助农民算收支账，打生产谱，积累生产资金。这个乡的殷家楼村新中农刘永春，出卖棉花后除了缴公粮和买口粮外，还可以收入一千五百多万元。他家已有房子住，还想再盖上四间房子。后来他在干部的帮助下算了收支账，便打消了盖房子的计划，除买了一头牛和一部分牲口草、化学肥料和布等以外，并计划在银行陆续储蓄一千二百万元，购买公债二十万元。刘永春满意地说：“哪有这样的好钱柜！钱搁在家里随手就花了，存到银行又生利息，又能支援国家工业建设。”在这期间，雷家乡全乡农民共在银行储蓄了五亿三千零八十六万元，储蓄户占全乡总户数的百分之六十九。这样，这个乡今年春耕生产就有了可靠的物质基础。
    由此可见，只要向农民进行思想教育，帮助农民算收支账，打生产谱，并做好各项经济工作，就能够把农村的资金引向正当的出路，就能为扩大生产积累下资金。
