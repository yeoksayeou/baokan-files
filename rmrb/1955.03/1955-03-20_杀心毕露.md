    Murderous Intent Fully Exposed
    Jiang Yuanchun

    Recently, U.S. government figures such as Dulles, while clamoring for the use of atomic weapons, have adopted a new tone, saying that the U.S. would use so-called "precise" tactical atomic weapons in war, and that these atomic weapons would supposedly only be used on "purely military targets" and would not harm civilians or non-combatants.

    What exactly do U.S. government figures mean by trying so hard to promote atomic warfare with this new tone?

    Do they think that only the U.S. has tactical atomic weapons, and are therefore eager to use them to achieve a quick victory in a war of aggression? Obviously, this is pure delusion. Today, when the U.S. has already lost its atomic advantage, only the insane would think that tactical atomic weapons could be the exclusive possession of the U.S., or that they could smoothly carry out a war of aggression with tactical atomic weapons or other atomic weapons.

    The U.S. atomic maniacs are now deceiving the world by saying that they will only use so-called "precise" tactical atomic weapons. Does this mean that they will mercifully refrain from using weapons of mass destruction to wage war? No, that is not the case. Eisenhower himself said that there could be no distinction between the tactical and strategic use of atomic weapons. "Newsweek" in its January 3rd commentary on Dulles's so-called strict distinction between tactical atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction, also pointed out that the use of tactical atomic weapons would lead to strategic bombing with atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    From this, it can be seen that the U.S. aggressive bloc has not become more merciful in the slightest. It adopts this new tone because it has encountered difficulties in promoting atomic warfare. Therefore, it needs to change its tune to entice the people to agree to its launching of atomic warfare.

    Clearly, the U.S. has seen that the constant atomic intimidation carried out by the U.S. over the past few months has not frightened the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world, but has frightened the U.S. itself and its allies. Even Eisenhower himself said on the 16th that the U.S. public now "has a natural tendency to be fearful at the mere thought of the explosion of such weapons." The hydrogen bomb explosion has caused great panic in the U.S.. The American people also have a strong aversion to the atomic bomb explosions carried out in Nevada. The allies of the U.S. are particularly afraid that the U.S. will provoke an atomic war. Moreover, the signature campaign to ban atomic weapons is unfolding vigorously throughout the world. This movement is increasingly arousing the firm will of the people of the world to oppose atomic war and strengthening their struggle. All this is of course very unfavorable to the U.S. war plans.

    Therefore, the U.S. aggressive bloc is now promoting so-called "precise" tactical atomic weapons in order to paralyze the whole world, entice the people of the world to allow it to drop atomic weapons, so as to create a fait accompli and drag the whole world into an atomic war. The U.S. aggressive bloc also wants people to die without complaint in the atomic war provoked by the U.S.. Therefore, while it is trying to create a hysterical atmosphere of the inevitability of war, it also wants to portray its use of "tactical atomic weapons" as a merciful act because it will not harm civilians. It is as if the whole world should be endlessly grateful to them when it is plunged into an atomic war.

    However, paper cannot contain fire. If the U.S. aggressive bloc's hypocritical propaganda of the peaceful use of atomic energy cannot make people believe that it does not want an atomic war, then its vigorous promotion of the use of tactical atomic weapons cannot possibly make people regard it as a peace angel. On the contrary, its tireless enticement of the people to agree to its launching of atomic warfare is precisely exposing its murderous intent, which cannot be concealed.

    杀心毕露
    蒋元椿
    最近美国当政人物如杜勒斯等在叫嚣使用原子武器的时候，纷纷采用一种新的腔调，说美国在战争中要使用的是一种所谓“精确的”战术原子武器，而且据说这种原子武器将只用于“纯粹军事目标”，不会伤害到平民和非战斗人员。
    美国当政人物竭力用这种新腔调来宣传原子战争究竟是什么意思呢？
    他们是不是以为只有美国才有战术原子武器，因而急于想用来在侵略战争中取得速战速决的胜利呢？显然，这完全是妄想。在美国已经丧失原子优势的今天，只有那些昏了头的人才认为战术原子武器可以是美国独家专有的东西，才认为凭着战术原子武器或者其他原子武器就可以顺利地进行侵略战争。
    美国原子狂人们现在欺骗全世界说，他们将只使用所谓“精确的”战术原子武器。这难道表示他们将仁慈地不使用大规模毁灭性武器来进行战争么？不，不是这样。艾森豪威尔自己就说过，在原子武器的战术和战略使用方面不可能有什么差别。美国“新闻周刊”在一月三日评论杜勒斯的所谓严格区分战术原子武器和大规模毁灭性武器的论调时也指出，使用战术原子武器就会导致用原子弹和氢弹进行战略轰炸。
    由此可见，美国侵略集团近来丝毫也没变得更仁慈些。它采用这种新腔调，是因为它在宣传原子战争方面发生了困难。因此需要变一个花样来诱迫人民同意它发动原子战争。
    显然，美国看到几个月来美国不断进行的原子恫吓，吓不倒中国人民和爱好和平的世界人民，却吓倒了美国自己和它的盟国。甚至艾森豪威尔自己在十六日也说，现在美国公众“有着一种一想到这种武器的爆炸就望而生畏的自然趋向”。氢弹爆炸在美国引起了巨大的恐慌。美国人民对于在内华达州进行的原子弹爆炸也怀着强烈的反感。美国的盟国们特别害怕美国会挑起一场原子战争。而且，要求禁止原子武器的签名运动正在全世界轰轰烈烈地展开。这个运动正在越来越激起世界人民反对原子战争的坚决意志，加强了他们的斗争。这一切对于美国的战争计划当然是很不利的。
    因此，美国侵略集团现在宣传所谓“精确的”战术原子武器，就是要麻痹全世界，诱迫世界人民容许它投掷原子武器，以便制造事实，把全世界拖进一场原子战争。美国侵略集团还要人们在美国挑起的原子战争中死而无怨。所以它一面竭力制造战争不可避免的歇斯底里情绪，一面还想把自己使用“战术原子武器”说成是不会伤害平民，因而是一种仁慈的行为。好像全世界在被投入一场原子战争的时候，还应该对他们感恩不尽。
    但是，纸是包不住火的。如果美国侵略集团假意宣传的和平使用原子能的欺骗，都不可能使人相信它要的不是原子战争，那么，它竭力宣传使用战术原子武器就更不可能使人把它当做和平天使。恰恰相反，它这样不疲倦地诱迫人民同意它发动原子战争，正使它杀心毕露，无可掩饰。
