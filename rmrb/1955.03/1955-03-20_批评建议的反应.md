    Wuhan is Solving the Problem of Wharf Chaos

    A letter from the General Office of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China: After the People's Daily published He Zhishen's letter on January 23 criticizing the chaotic order at the Hankou wharf and ferry, the Municipal Party Committee instructed the Shuishang (Waterfront) District Committee to conduct an inspection.

    According to the report after the Shuishang District Committee's inspection, He Zhishen's criticism was completely correct. The Wuhan wharves, especially the Jijiazui wharf, have suffered from chaos for a long time. The people had raised over a hundred proposals on this issue at the district People's Congress meetings. The Shuishang District People's Government had repeatedly convened meetings with relevant units such as the Changjiang (Yangtze) Navigation Bureau, the Hubei Provincial Inland Navigation Administration, and the Shuishang Public Security Sub-bureau to study the matter, but because there were too many departments and no unified leadership, the chaos at the wharves and ferries was never fundamentally resolved. The Municipal People's Government has now instructed the Municipal Transportation Bureau to establish the Wuhan Wharf Adjustment Committee to thoroughly adjust the situation. Before a wharf reorganization plan is put forward, some temporary measures will be taken first:

      (1) The Hubei Provincial Inland Navigation Administration will notify relevant departments to vacate Baojiaxiang and Chuli wharves as operating areas for ships. Moored ships will be moved between Piers 8 and 14 of the Hankou Port Authority (with the Port Authority's consent) to expand the operating wharves for civil vessels loading and unloading goods, thereby reducing congestion at the ferry.

      (2) The Jijiazui wharf will be kept at a width of 20 meters for use by boat operators and passengers; the Shuishang Public Security Sub-bureau will be responsible for delineating the boundaries.

      (3) Lijilu will be designated as an operating wharf, and Qiujiadang will be designated as a boat operating wharf; the Shuishang Public Security Sub-bureau will be responsible for liaison and execution.

      (4) All transfer departments should allocate ships in a planned manner and educate workers and boatmen not to rush to grab mooring spots or crowd.

      (5) The stevedoring company should issue chips to boatmen for loading and unloading goods, designating wharves for loading and unloading, and the stevedoring company should strengthen the loading and unloading plan to unload goods as soon as they arrive, avoiding ships occupying the wharves.

    The Shuishang District Committee bears a certain responsibility for the long-term unresolved chaos at the Wuhan ferry wharves. This shows insufficient concern for the vital interests of the people and the existence of irresponsible bureaucracy. We must strive to correct this in the future.

    Review of Improper Xun River Dyke Restoration Construction

    In November 1954, this newspaper received a letter from Comrade Bo Ping of the Xiacang Headquarters of Jixian County, Hebei Province, reflecting that after the Xun River dyke restoration project in Jixian County began last autumn, more than 5,000 laborers arrived at the construction site and worked for only half a day before receiving a phone call from the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department ordering them to stop work, which caused dissatisfaction among the laborers. This newspaper forwarded this letter to the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department for handling. Recently, we received a reply from the Water Conservancy Department, which stated in its review: "Comrade Bo Ping's criticism is correct... This incident fully exposed our lack of planning in water conservancy work, our failure to promptly report to higher authorities, our one-sided approach to dealing with problems, and our lack of seriousness and responsibility towards the masses. We had made general arrangements for the repair of small tributary rivers, but when the Special District put forward the Xun River dyke restoration plan, we approved it without detailed study. Later, we realized that the Xun River construction was inappropriate, so we decided that it was better to accept some losses and stop work, otherwise the losses would be even greater. However, at that time, we did not give good consideration to the adverse consequences and losses caused by the suspension of work and how to remedy them. This lesson is worth remembering. In the future, we must strengthen our studies, thoroughly overcome bureaucratic and decentralized leadership styles, and do a good job in water conservancy construction."

    批评建议的反应
    武汉市正在解决码头混乱问题
    中共武汉市委员会办公厅来信：一月二十三日人民日报发表何志深批评汉口码头渡口秩序混乱的来信以后，市委即责成水上区委进行检查。
    据水上区委检查后的报告，何志深的批评是完全正确的。武汉市的码头，特别是集家嘴码头长时间存在着混乱现象。人民群众为此曾在区人民代表大会会议上提出提案达百余件。水上区人民政府曾多次召集长江航运局、湖北省内河航运管理局和水上公安分局等有关单位开会研究，但终因部门多，领导不统一，码头渡口的混乱情况始终未得到根本解决。这个问题现在已由市人民政府责成市交通运输局成立武汉市码头调整委员会，彻底进行调整。在整理码头方案未提出前，先采取一些临时性措施：
      （一）由湖北省内河航运管理局通知有关部门让出鲍家巷和楚利码头作为船只作业区。停泊船只改在汉口港务局港八码头至十四码头之间（已取得港务局同意），以扩大民船装卸物资的作业码头，减少渡口的拥挤现象。
      （二）经常保持集家嘴码头有二十公尺宽度，供划运作业、旅客过渡之用，由水上公安分局负责划定界线。
      （三）利济路划为作业码头，邱家壋为划渡作业码头，由水上公安分局负责联系、执行。
      （四）各调运部门应有计划地调拨船只，并教育工人和船民不使抢壋和挤壋。
      （五）由搬运公司发给船民起卸货的筹码，指定码头起卸，并由搬运公司加强起卸计划，随到随卸，避免船只占用码头。
    武汉市渡口码头长期混乱现象没有得到解决，水上区委是负有一定责任的。这是对人民群众的切身利益关心不够和存在不负责任的官僚主义。今后要努力改正。
    对洵河复堤施工不当的检讨
    一九五四年十一月份本报接到河北蓟县下仓指挥部泊萍同志来信，反映去秋蓟县洵河复堤工程开工后，五千多民工到工地刚作了半天活，突然接到河北省水利厅的电话要他们停工，引起了民工们的不满。本报曾将这一信件转到河北省水利厅去处理。最近接到水利厅的复信，信中检讨说：“泊萍同志的批评是正确的……这个事件，充分暴露了我们在水利工作上计划性不够，又没有及时向上级请示，处理问题带有片面性，对群众不够严肃负责。我们对支流小河的修整工作，曾作过一般的布置，当专区提出洵河复堤计划的时候，我们未作详细研究就批准了。后来才发觉洵河施工不当，因而决定宁可受些损失，也要停工，否则损失会更大。但是，当时对停工所造成的不良后果和损失如何补救，却没有很好考虑。这个教训是值得我们记取的。今后我们要加强学习，彻底克服官僚主义和分散主义的领导作风，把水利建设工作做好。”
