    The Great Achievements of the Soviet Union in Reclaiming Wasteland

    A year ago, Comrade Khrushchev made a high evaluation of the Soviet Union's plan to reclaim virgin and fallow land at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February-March. He said that this plan is a splendid undertaking, which, in terms of the scale of land reclamation and its great significance to the Soviet Union, can be compared with the greatest undertakings completed by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party. Over the past year, the Soviet people have responded to the call of the Communist Party and the Soviet government and have achieved great success.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, following the instructions of Lenin and Stalin on national industrialization, has always adhered to the line of vigorously developing heavy industry. Because heavy industry is the decisive condition for developing agriculture, light industry, the food industry, and all economic sectors, the source of improving people's welfare and the foundation for strengthening national defense. For more than 30 years, the Soviet people have achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of national industrialization. Despite the serious destruction of the Second World War, compared with 1952 and 1913, the total output of Soviet large-scale industry (calculated at comparable prices) has increased 26 times, and the output of means of production has increased 46 times. The strong development of heavy industry has enabled the Soviet Union to greatly increase the production of people's consumer goods. Therefore, the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee put forward a nationwide task: on the basis of continuing to vigorously develop socialist industry, to fully meet the growing needs of the Soviet people for food in the next two or three years, and to ensure the supply of raw materials for light industry and the food industry.

    To ensure the completion of this important task, it is necessary to rapidly develop agriculture, especially to rapidly increase the production of grain, because grain production is the foundation of agricultural production and plays a very important role in raising people's living standards and producing a large number of consumer goods. Increasing grain production, as a food problem, has long been solved in the Soviet Union. However, with the continuous improvement of the living standards of the Soviet people, it is necessary to further increase grain production to meet the growing needs, supply the needs of developing animal husbandry, replenish the country's grain reserves, and increase grain exports. An important source of rapidly increasing grain production is the reclamation of wasteland.

    In the vast territory of the Soviet Union, especially in the eastern region, there is still a large amount of uncultivated wasteland. According to the Soviet government's investigation, in 14 states of the Russian Federation and 8 states of the Kazakh Republic alone, there are about 40 million hectares (15 mu per hectare) of fallow land, virgin land, cultivated fallow land, etc. These lands contain enormous potential for the development of agriculture. On these vast and fertile lands, it is very convenient to implement fully mechanized grain farming, and a bumper harvest can be obtained without much investment. At the same time, the Soviet Union's socialist collectivized agriculture and highly developed socialist industry, as well as a large number of agricultural cadres trained by the state in a planned way, provide sufficient conditions for the realization of a large-scale wasteland reclamation plan.

    According to the "Resolution on Further Expanding Grain Production in the Soviet Union and on Reclaiming Virgin and Fallow Land" adopted by the February-March 1954 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the Soviet Union will, within the two years of 1954 and 1955, reclaim 13 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River Basin, and parts of the North Caucasus, and harvest 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion poods of grain, of which 800 million to 900 million poods are commercial grain. This plan is an important part of the Soviet people's great program for building a communist society.

    Such a large-scale reclamation of wasteland is not only impossible in capitalist countries, but it is also the first time in the Soviet Union. In the pre-war period of 1928 to 1938, the Soviet Union's sown area increased by about 24 million hectares, and in the seven or eight years after the war, it increased by about 7 million hectares. This time, the reclamation of wasteland will increase the sown area of the Soviet Union by 13 million hectares in the next two years! As for the 1.1 billion to 1.2 billion poods of grain expected to be harvested on the 13 million hectares of newly reclaimed land, it is almost equal to the total grain harvest of the two largest capitalist countries in Europe—Britain and France.

    Thousands of working people and young people in the Soviet Union enthusiastically responded to the call of the Communist Party and the government and plunged into the large-scale reclamation movement. By last October, more than 150,000 skilled workers, engineers, technicians, and agricultural experts from industries, machine tractor stations, and state farms had gone to the reclamation areas to work. The Soviet government has prepared all material and technical conditions for those participating in the reclamation.

    Last August, the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union inspected the rapid progress of the reclamation work and proposed additional tasks, stipulating that at least another 15 million hectares of virgin and fallow land should be reclaimed by 1955. In this way, by 1956, the Soviet Union will have 28 million to 30 million hectares of newly reclaimed land to sow grain and other crops. This huge reclamation figure means a large increase in grain, as well as a large increase in meat, milk, and textiles, meaning a more affluent and happy life for the Soviet people.

    The Soviet people greatly overfulfilled the 1954 wasteland reclamation plan. In the past year, a total of 17.6 million hectares of virgin and fallow land were reclaimed, which greatly increased the grain production in the Soviet Union. Therefore, although the climatic conditions were not good in the southern part of Ukraine and the Volga River basin last year, the total grain harvest in the Soviet Union and the amount of grain purchased and acquired were still higher than in 1953. From this, it can be seen how important it is to increase grain production by reclaiming wasteland for the development of the Soviet national economy.

    The result of the Soviet Union's reclamation of wasteland has not only expanded grain production, but also improved the material welfare of collective farm members and further consolidated the economy of collective farms. For example, the "May 1st" collective farm in Borishe Narinsk district, East Kazakhstan Province, reclaimed 500 hectares of wasteland in 1954, harvesting 132 poods of millet and 156 poods of wheat per hectare. This collective farm received more than 700,000 rubles from selling these grains, which is almost four times more than the average annual income of this collective farm in the past ten years. Therefore, the members of the "May 1st" collective farm decided to reclaim another 600 hectares of wasteland in 1955.

    The Soviet Union's strong socialist industrial strength is an important guarantee for the smooth completion of such a large-scale reclamation plan. In 1954 alone, the Soviet government transported 115,000 tractors, 18,000 grain harvesting combines, and a large number of other agricultural machines to the reclamation areas, ensuring that the reclamation work could be carried out rapidly on a large scale under full mechanization. Therefore, the wasteland reclamation plan was greatly overfulfilled.

    The high political enthusiasm and communist construction enthusiasm of the Soviet working people are one of the decisive factors in making great achievements in the reclamation work. Thousands of collective farm members, machine tractor station and state farm workers and experts in the reclamation areas have shown high labor enthusiasm and creativity in their efforts to realize the Communist Party's and the Soviet government's plan to reclaim wasteland on a large scale and rapidly develop grain production. The Soviet people know that every step taken by the Communist Party and the Soviet government to develop the national economy is for the benefit of all the Soviet people.

    The great achievements of the Soviet Union in reclaiming wasteland vividly demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. When the Soviet Union was reclaiming wasteland on a large scale, the United States was restricting the sown area. For example, in 1954, the wheat sown area in the United States decreased by 30%, and the cotton sown area decreased by 19.3%. In the Soviet Union, the state organizes and helps the people to turn millions of hectares of wasteland into fertile land in order to continue to increase grain production, so as to fully meet the growing needs of the people. In the United States, although there are tens of millions of people who are undernourished, the capitalist system, for the sake of the profits of a small handful of agricultural monopoly capitalists, maintains high monopoly prices domestically, turns large areas of fertile land into wasteland, and allows grain to pile up in warehouses and mold.

    The achievements made by the Soviet Union in reclaiming wasteland in 1954 are only the beginning of the brilliant cause of expanding grain production. This January, the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee put forward another extremely important task: to further develop grain production, so that the annual grain output will reach at least 10 billion poods in 1960. In this way, it will be possible to fully meet the Soviet Union's entire need for food, establish more adequate grain reserves and expand foreign trade, and also supply the needs of developing animal husbandry. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are further reclaiming virgin and fallow land, and making full use of various conditions and potentials for increasing grain production, and are moving forward to the goal of "10 billion poods" with full confidence!

    苏联开垦荒地的巨大成就
    程光锐
    一年前，赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党中央委员会二—三月全体会议上对苏联开垦生荒地和熟荒地的计划作了很高的评价。他说，这个计划是一桩辉煌的事业，按照开垦荒地的规模和它对苏联的重大意义来说，可以同苏联人民在共产党领导下所完成的最伟大的事业媲美。一年来，苏联人民响应共产党和苏联政府的号召，已经获得了巨大的成就。
    苏联共产党遵循着列宁和斯大林关于国家工业化的指示，一向坚持地执行着全力发展重工业的路线。因为重工业是发展农业、轻工业、食品工业和一切经济部门的决定性条件，是增进人民福利的源泉和增强国防力量的基础。三十余年来，苏联人民在国家工业化的事业中已经获得了光辉的成就。尽管经历了第二次大战的严重破坏，以一九五二年和一九一三年比较，苏联大型工业的总产量（以比较价格计算）已增加了二十六倍，生产资料的产量增加了四十六倍。重工业的强大发展已使苏联有条件来大规模增加人民消费品的生产了。因此，苏共中央一九五三年九月全会提出了一项全民性任务：在继续大力发展社会主义工业的基础上，在最近两三年内充分满足苏联人民对食品的不断增长的需要，并保证以原料供应轻工业和食品工业。
    要保证完成这一项重要任务，就必须迅速发展农业，特别是迅速增加谷物的生产，因为谷物生产是农业生产的基础，对提高人民生活水平和大量生产消费品具有极重要的作用。增加谷物生产，作为粮食问题，苏联早就解决了。然而，随着苏联人民生活水平的不断提高，必须进一步增加谷物生产，以满足日益增长的需要，并供应发展畜牧业的需要、充实国家的粮食储备和增加粮食的出口量。而迅速增加谷物生产的一个重要的源泉就是开垦荒地。
    在苏联辽阔的国土上，特别是在东部地区还有大量未开垦的荒地。根据苏联政府调查的结果，仅在俄罗斯联邦的十四个州里和哈萨克共和国的八个州里，约有四千万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的休闲地、生荒地、熟荒地等。这些土地蕴藏着发展农业的巨大潜力。在这些广阔而肥沃的土地上，实行完全机械化的谷物经营是非常方便的，而且不需要再作多大的投资就可以得到丰收了。同时，苏联的社会主义集体化农业和高度发展的社会主义工业，以及国家有计划地培养出来的大批农业干部，为实现大规模开垦荒地计划提供了充足的条件。
    按照苏共中央一九五四年二—三月全会通过的“关于进一步扩大苏联谷物生产和关于开垦生荒地和熟荒地的决议”，苏联要在一九五四年与一九五五年两年内，在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔、伏尔加河流域和北高加索部分地区，开垦一千三百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，将收获十一亿到十二亿普特的谷物，其中有八亿到九亿普特的商品谷物。这个计划是苏联人民建设共产主义社会的伟大纲领的一个重要部分。
    这样大规模地开垦荒地，不仅在资本主义国家中是从来不可能有的，而且在苏联也是第一次。苏联在战前时期一九二八年到一九三八年的十一年中，播种面积大约增加了二千四百万公顷，战后七、八年中大约增加了七百万公顷，而这次开垦荒地就将使苏联的播种面积在最近两年中增加一千三百万公顷！至于预计在一千三百万公顷新开垦的土地上收获的十一亿到十二亿普特的谷物，几乎等于欧洲两个最大的资本主义国家——英国和法国的谷物收获量的总和。
    苏联千千万万的劳动人民和青年热情地响应共产党和政府的号召，投入规模宏大的开垦运动中去。到去年十月为止，前往开垦地区担任工作的工业、机器拖拉机站、国营农场的熟练工人、工程师、技术、农业专家等已超过十五万人。苏联政府给参加开垦者准备了一切物质技术条件。
    去年八月，苏共中央和苏联部长会议检查了开垦工作迅速进展的情况，提出追加任务，规定到一九五五年至少再开垦一千五百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地。这样，到一九五六年，苏联就将有二千八百万到三千万公顷新开垦的土地来播种谷物和其他农作物了。这个庞大的开垦数字意味着大量的粮食的增加，也意味着大量的肉类、牛奶和纺织品的增加，意味着苏联人民生活的更加丰裕和幸福。
    苏联人民大大超额完成了一九五四年开垦荒地的计划，在过去一年中一共开垦了一千七百六十万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，这使苏联的谷物生产大大增加。因此，虽然去年在乌克兰南部和伏尔加河流域各区气候条件不好，但是苏联全国的谷物总收获量以及谷物的征购和收购量还是比一九五三年高。从这里可以看出用开垦荒地的办法来增加谷物生产对于苏联国民经济发展具有多么重大的意义。
    苏联开垦荒地的结果，不仅扩大了谷物生产，而且也提高集体农庄庄员们的物质福利，进一步巩固了集体农庄的经济。例如，东哈萨克州波里舍那林斯克区的“五一”集体农庄，一九五四年开垦了五百公顷荒地，每公顷土地上收获了一百三十二普特谷子和一百五十六普特小麦。这个集体农庄因为出售这些谷物而得到七十多万卢布，比这个集体农庄近十年来每年平均收入几乎多了四倍。因此，“五一”集体农庄的庄员们决定在一九五五年再开垦六百公顷荒地。
    苏联强大的社会主义工业力量，是顺利完成这样大规模开垦计划的重要保证。苏联政府在一九五四年一年内，就以十一万五千台拖拉机、一万八千台谷物收割联合机和大批的其他农业机器运往开垦地区，保证开垦工作能够在完全机械化的情况下，以巨大的规模迅速地进行，因此，使开垦荒地的计划大大超额完成了。
    苏联劳动人民高度的政治积极性和共产主义建设的热情，是使开垦工作获得巨大成就的决定性因素之一。开垦地区千千万万的集体农庄庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员和专家们，在努力实现共产党和苏联政府大规模开垦荒地、迅速发展谷物生产的计划时，表现了高度的劳动热情和创造精神。苏联人民知道共产党和苏联政府发展国民经济的每一步措施，都是为了谋取苏联全体人民的福利。
    苏联开垦荒地的巨大成就，生动地表现了社会主义制度的优越性。当苏联大规模开垦荒地的时候，美国却在限制播种面积，例如，在一九五四年内，美国小麦播种面积减少了百分之三十，棉花播种面积减少了百分之十九点三。在苏联，国家组织和帮助人民把千百万公顷的荒地变成良田，以继续增加谷物产量，为的是充分满足人民日益增长的需要。而在美国，虽然有着成千万的人过着吃不饱的日子，资本主义制度却为了一小撮农业垄断资本家的利润，在国内维持高的垄断价格，把大片良田变成荒地，使粮食堆积在仓库里发霉。
    一九五四年苏联开垦荒地所取得的成就，只是扩大谷物生产这件辉煌事业的开始。今年一月，苏共中央全会又提出一项极重要的任务：进一步发展谷物生产，使谷物的年产量在一九六零年达到至少一百亿普特的水平。这样，就能够完全满足苏联对粮食的全部需要，建立更加充分的粮食储备和扩大对外贸易，还可以供应发展畜牧业的需要。现在，苏联人民在共产党的领导下，正在进一步开垦生荒地和熟荒地，并充分利用增加谷物生产的各种条件和潜力，满怀信心地向“一百亿普特”的目标前进！
