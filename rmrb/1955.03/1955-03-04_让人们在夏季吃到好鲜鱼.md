Let People Eat Good Fresh Fish in Summer

In the coastal fishing villages of Lüda City, large quantities of fresh fish are shipped out every year during the peak fishing season in summer and autumn. In the past, some fresh fish would often rot because artificial ice could not be used to preserve large quantities of fresh fish by the sea. This year, cadres of the Jin County Cooperatives have developed a method of storing natural ice by the sea. Now, they have organized the procurement stations along the coast of Jin County to store 350,000 jin of natural ice. In the summer and autumn seasons, this ice can not only be used to store large quantities of fresh fish by the sea, but can also be used to transport fresh fish to other places. When the members of the Red Star Fishery Production Cooperative learned about the cooperatives storing natural ice, they excitedly said: “In this way, our increased fishing catches will not be wasted. This year, we will work harder to catch more fish to supply the cities.”

    让人们在夏季吃到好鲜鱼
    旅大市沿海各渔村，在每年夏秋产鱼旺季，都要外运大量鲜鱼。因为不能用人造冰在海边保管大量鲜鱼，过去常有一部分鲜鱼腐臭。今年，金县合作社的干部研究出了在海边储藏天然冰的办法。现在，他们已经组织金县各沿海收购处储藏了三十五万斤天然冰。到夏秋季节，不但可以用这些冰在海边储藏大量鲜鱼，还可以用来把鲜鱼运到外地。合作社储藏天然冰的事被红星渔业生产合作社的社员们知道了，他们兴奋地说：这样，咱们多打鱼就不会浪费了。今年咱们要更加劲地多打鱼来供应城市。
