He said: Following the return of seven divisions to the motherland last year, another six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers are now returning home. This action of our army once again fully demonstrates to the people of the world the sincerity and confidence of the Chinese people in peacefully resolving the Korean issue, and embodies yet another major effort on our part to strive for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

Chen Fangren continued by saying that today, as we are about to leave this heroic land, we are particularly pleased to see the brilliant achievements you have made in the work of restoration and construction. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the heroic Korean people will surely achieve equally brilliant victories in building a better life for their motherland.
