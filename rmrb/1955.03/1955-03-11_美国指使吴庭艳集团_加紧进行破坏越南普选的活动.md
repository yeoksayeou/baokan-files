Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 10th: The United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's activities to undermine the Vietnamese free general election are becoming increasingly blatant.

The French weekly "International Forum" said: "The United States is carrying out a plan to make the Vietnamese general election impossible." To this end, American diplomatic and military personnel have held many meetings with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. "International Forum" weekly said that the US plan to undermine the Vietnamese general election is to order Ngo Dinh Diem to establish a special agency to purge those who are not "loyal" to Ngo Dinh Diem, and at the same time, it will plan to create "abnormal incidents" on the temporary military demarcation line. After these incidents occur, the Ngo Dinh Diem government will declare martial law in South Vietnam, making the general election impossible.

Under the direction of the United States, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is making every effort to clamor against the Geneva Accords and against holding a general election. The Saigon Radio, reflecting the opinions of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, broadcast on the day that US Secretary of State Dulles arrived in Saigon that the South Vietnamese authorities "do not legally recognize the Geneva Accords." The broadcast also tried its best to slander the Vietnam International Supervisory and Inspection Commission, saying that it could not supervise the general election in Vietnam. Saigon Radio said that therefore, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique "legally and practically" "cannot tolerate the 1956 general election stipulated in the Geneva Accords."

Throughout South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is intensifying its activities against the Geneva Accords and undermining the general election. As previously reported, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is creating an illegal "National Assembly" as a step to undermine the general election, and it has also instigated a "signature campaign" to oppose the implementation of the Geneva Accords and demand the dissolution of the International Commission. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique also constantly obstructs and sabotages the investigation work carried out by the International Commission in the South. Ngo Dinh Diem's agents even threw stones at the International Commission personnel and shouted slogans against the International Commission.

The Ngo Dinh Diem clique is further strengthening its reign of terror throughout South Vietnam, persecuting and assassinating demobilized veterans and people who support the Geneva Accords, and strictly prohibiting people from talking about the general election. In My Tho Province, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's secret agents and soldiers killed the demobilized former head of the Education Section of My Tho Province, and then publicly told the people that because this demobilized person had prestige in his hometown, the people might elect him in the general election, so he had to be killed.

    美国指使吴庭艳集团
    加紧进行破坏越南普选的活动
    【新华社河内十日电】美国和吴庭艳集团破坏越南自由普选的活动正愈来愈露骨。
    法国“国际论坛”周刊说：“美国正在进行一个使越南普选不能实现的计划”。为此，美国的外交和军事人员已接连和吴庭艳集团举行许多次会谈。“国际论坛”周刊说，美国提出的破坏越南普选的计划是，命令吴庭艳成立一个专门的机构来肃清那些对吴庭艳不“忠诚”的人，同时，将要策划在临时军事分界线制造“不正常的事件”，在这些事件发生后，吴庭艳政府将在南越宣布戒严，使普选不能进行。
    在美国的使指下，吴庭艳集团正在竭力叫嚣反对日内瓦协定和反对举行普选。反映美国和吴庭艳集团意见的西贡电台在美国国务卿杜勒斯到达西贡的那一天广播说：南越当局“在法律上不承认日内瓦协定”。广播还竭力诋毁越南国际监督和监察委员会，说它不能监督越南的普选。西贡电台说，因此，吴庭艳集团“在法律上和实际上”“都不能容忍日内瓦协定所规定的一九五六年的普选”。
    在南越各地，吴庭艳集团已经在加紧进行反对日内瓦协定、破坏普选的活动。前已报道，吴庭艳集团正在制造一个非法的“国民议会”作为破坏普选的一个步骤，它并且策动了一个“签名运动”，来反对执行日内瓦协定和要求解散国际委员会，吴庭艳集团还不断阻挠和破坏国际委员会在南部进行的调查工作，吴庭艳的特务甚至向国际委员会人员投掷石块和高呼反对国际委员会的口号。
    吴庭艳集团更在南越各地加强恐怖统治，迫害和暗杀复员抗战人员和拥护日内瓦协定的人，严禁人民谈论普选。在美萩省，吴庭艳集团的密探和士兵杀死了复员返乡的前越南美萩省教育科科长，然后公开对人民说，因为这个复员人员在故乡有威望，普选时人民可能选他，所以要杀死他。
