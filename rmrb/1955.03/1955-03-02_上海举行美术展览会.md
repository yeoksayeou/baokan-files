    Shanghai Holds Art Exhibition
    Xinhua News Agency: On February 26th, over two thousand two hundred workers, students, soldiers, and art workers in Shanghai enjoyed the four hundred and eighty-one art pieces displayed at the "1955 East China Region Art Exhibition" held at the Cultural Square Exhibition Hall.

    The vast majority of these works are the labor achievements of three hundred and eighteen art workers from various provinces in the East China region, as well as the East China Military Region and Shanghai Municipality of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past year. They include New Year pictures, propaganda posters, cartoons, traditional Chinese paintings, prints, watercolors, sketches, pastels, comic strips, and sculptures. Works such as "Bombarding Yijiangshan Island," "We Must Liberate Taiwan," "Completion Ceremony of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir," "Expanding Factories," "Cooperative Cadres," as well as "Night Scene of New Shanghai" and "Workshop Doctor" are very popular among the audience. Many elderly writers of traditional Chinese paintings have broken through their decades-long style of applying ancient brushwork and focusing on schools of painting, and have begun to delve into real life, creating many works that reflect real life.

    The exhibition is sponsored by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Artists Association and started on February 16th and will end in mid-March.

    上海举行美术展览会
    二月二十六日，上海市有二千二百多个工人、学生、战士以及文艺工作者，在文化广场展览馆里欣赏了“一九五五年华东地区美术作品展览会”展出的四百八十一件美术作品。
    这些作品绝大部分是过去一年来华东地区各省以及中国人民解放军华东军区和上海市的三百十八个美术工作者的劳动成果，其中有年画、宣传画、漫画、彩墨画、版画、水彩、素描、粉画、连环画和雕塑等。作品中的“炮击一江山岛”、“我们一定要解放台湾”、“佛子岭水库竣工典礼”、“扩建中的工厂”、“合作社干部”以及“新上海之夜”和“车间医生”等都很受观众喜爱。不少彩墨画的年老作家，已经突破了他们几十年来套用古人笔法、讲究行派的作风，开始深入生活，创作出许多反映现实生活的作品。
    展览会是由中国美术家协会上海分会主办的，从二月十六日开始，到三月中旬结束。
