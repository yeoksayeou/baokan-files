A "National Conference on Nursery Work in Factories and Mines," convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, was held in Beijing from February 21st to March 2nd. More than 170 people attended and observed the conference, including female worker department heads and labor protection department heads from trade unions of various provinces and cities, female worker committee members and labor protection committee members from grassroots trade unions in factories and mines, nursery directors, and staff members from women's federations and government health departments of some provinces and cities.

The conference first exchanged experiences in running nurseries. The nursery of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory introduced its experience of nursery staff signing contact agreements with female workers, taking good care of children, and promoting production. The Women Workers Department of the Qingdao Federation of Trade Unions introduced the experience of small factories in Qingdao organizing joint nurseries. The Chongqing and Tianjin Women's Federations introduced their experience in running street nursery stations. The conference also introduced the experience of the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Wool Textile Factory nursery in practicing strict economy and actively serving the children, the experience of the worker dormitory nursery station of the state-owned Shanghai No. 12 Cotton Textile Factory, the experience of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau in providing guidance on health care, and the experiences of factory, mine, and school nurseries in Tianjin, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places. The representatives believed that these experiences were very valuable and, in light of these experiences, examined the waste of manpower and financial resources and other problems in their respective nurseries in a spirit of self-criticism.

The conference held that the general guiding principle for nursery work should be: to serve production and to serve the masses. In response to existing problems and to meet the growing needs of female workers, the conference determined that the specific guiding principles for nursery work in factories and mines at the current stage are: First, to consolidate existing nursery organizations and improve management and professional standards in order to fully utilize potential strengths. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen the assistance and supervision of trade union organizations in nursery work, to strengthen ideological education for nursery staff, and to improve the professional standards of nursery staff. Second, to develop diverse forms of nursery organizations in a planned and guided manner based on needs and possibilities. The grassroots trade union organizations of general medium and small factories should, according to the specific conditions such as small factories, crowded houses, and insufficient economic conditions, assist the administrative side or the capitalists to organize various simple forms of nursery organizations. In addition to running formal nurseries well, large factories should also rely on the strength of workers' family members and the masses to develop worker dormitory nursery stations and appropriately resolve the funding problems of nursery stations in order to meet needs. Furthermore, rely on the strength of local women's federations, district people's governments, and street activists to run nursery stations and kindergartens in factory areas and female workers' residential areas to take care of female workers' children and popularize parenting knowledge. Third, strengthen ties with provincial and municipal women's federations and health agencies to improve the quality of nursery work. Provincial and municipal trade union organizations must advise women's federations, health agencies, and others to hold regular meetings to study nursery work, solve common regional problems, and organize experience exchange work to comprehensively improve the level of nursery work.

At the conference, Soviet expert on maternal and child health care, Leziuskina, also reported on the situation and experience of Soviet nursery work. In the discussion, the representatives unanimously believed that this report was equivalent to a very good professional lesson for them, especially for having a clear understanding of the principle of thrift that should be implemented in running nurseries, and for having a strong confidence in the future nursery work, and feeling that the solution to the existing problems has also become more directional.

    全国工会厂矿企业托儿所工作会议在京举行
    确定厂矿企业托儿所工作方针
    中华全国总工会召开的“全国工会厂矿企业托儿所工作会议”，从二月二十一日到三月二日在北京举行。出席和列席会议的有各省、市工会女工部长、劳保部长、厂矿基层工会女工委员、劳保委员、托儿所所长，和一些省、市民主妇女联合会、政府卫生部门的工作人员等，共计一百七十多人。
    会议首先交流了办理托儿所的经验。国营上海第一棉纺织厂托儿所介绍了保育员和托儿女工订立联系合同而带好孩子、推进生产的经验；青岛市工会联合会女工部介绍了青岛市小厂举办联合托儿所的经验；重庆、天津两市民主妇女联合会介绍了举办街道托儿站的经验。还有国营上海第三毛纺织厂托儿所如何精打细算、积极为孩子服务的经验，国营上海第十二棉纺织厂职工宿舍托儿站的经验，上海市卫生局对保健业务进行指导的经验，以及天津、沈阳、南京、无锡等地厂矿企业和学校托儿所的经验，也在会议上作了介绍。代表们认为这些经验很宝贵，结合这些经验，用自我批评的精神，检查了各自托儿所在人力、财力方面的浪费情况和其他问题。
    会议认为托儿所工作的总方针应该是：为生产服务，为群众服务。针对现在存在的问题和适应女工们日益增长的需要，会议确定现阶段厂矿企业托儿所的具体工作方针为：第一，整顿已有的托儿组织，提高管理水平和业务水平，以充分发挥潜在力量。因此必须进一步加强工会组织对托儿所工作的协助、监督和对保育工作人员的思想教育工作，提高保育工作人员的业务水平等。第二，根据需要和可能，有领导、有计划地发展多种多样形式的托儿组织。一般中、小工厂的工会基层组织即应根据厂小、房子挤、经济条件不足等具体情况协助行政方面或资方因陋就简举办各种简便形式的托儿组织。大厂除了办好正规托儿所以外，为了适应需要，还应该依靠职工家属群众的力量，发展职工宿舍托儿站，并适当解决托儿站的经费问题。再就是依靠各地民主妇女联合会、区人民政府、街道积极分子等的力量，在工厂区和女工居住区举办托儿站、幼儿园，收托女工的孩子，并普及育儿知识。第三，要加强和省、市民主妇女联合会、卫生机关等的联系，从而提高托儿所工作的质量。省、市级工会组织，必须建议民主妇女联合会、卫生机关等，定期集会研究托儿所工作，解决地区共同性的问题，组织交流经验的工作，以全面提高托儿所的工作水平。
    会议还由苏联妇幼保健工作专家列兹乌斯基娜报告了苏联托儿所工作的情况和经验。到会代表在讨论中一致认为这个报告等于给他们上了很好的业务课，特别对办理托儿所应该贯彻节约原则有了明确认识，并对今后托儿所工作有了坚强信心，感到对现在存在问题的解决也更有了方向。
