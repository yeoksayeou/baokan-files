    Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd—The People's Bank of China Headquarters convened a National Rural Financial Conference from March 1st to 17th, determining the work tasks of state banks in rural areas for 1955. The work tasks for 1955 are: to rationally use state agricultural loans, strengthen credit cooperative work, vigorously mobilize rural funds, and support the development of agricultural production and agricultural cooperativization, to meet the needs of developing agricultural production; and to adapt to market conditions, strengthen credit and settlement work for rural socialist commerce, regulate currency circulation, and serve the expansion of commodity circulation.
    Based on this task, the conference believed that in terms of agricultural credit work for 1955, it is necessary to actively help the existing 600,000 agricultural production cooperatives expand reproduction in agricultural loans. Under the circumstance of giving full play to the investment strength of agricultural production cooperatives and their members, appropriate loan support should be given after a thorough calculation of the annual production and income of agricultural production cooperatives. The main purposes of the loans are to help agricultural production cooperatives carry out basic construction and improve production tools. In the north, in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation of the masses, focus on handling loans for new agricultural implements (mainly double-wheeled double-shared plows, etc.); in the south, in accordance with the principle of government assistance and public management, focus on handling small-scale farmland water conservancy loans, as well as issuing fertilizer loans. For agricultural production mutual aid groups, the main focus is to help poor group members overcome general production and living difficulties. Mutual aid groups that are perennial, especially those preparing to transition to agricultural production cooperatives, can also be given loans to help them purchase large agricultural implements. Individual poor peasants and middle peasants with difficulties should also be helped through loans to solve the difficulties of joining the cooperative and general means of production or emergency living difficulties. In addition, the conference also made arrangements for loans to state-owned farms, areas affected by floods last year, ethnic minority areas, and fishing areas.
    In terms of credit cooperation, the central task in the first half of the year is to consolidate the existing 130,000+ credit cooperatives. Before the autumn harvest, each province should generally resolutely stop development and fully shift to consolidation. In order to do this work well, the conference believes that it is necessary to strengthen ideological education and business guidance for credit cooperative cadres under the unified leadership of the Party and the government. Existing credit cooperatives must actively help poor peasants and middle peasants with difficulties solve production and living difficulties, and combat usury activities during the spring plowing production process and the period of food shortage; they must also help overcome the difficulties of short-term working capital of agricultural production cooperatives. And it is necessary to strengthen financial accounting work, implement the articles of association, and improve the democratic management system. All localities should adopt methods such as holding meetings to exchange experiences and conducting rotational training to improve the policy and business levels of the directors and accountants of credit cooperatives. In the consolidation work, it is necessary to implement the Party's class line in rural areas. State banks should provide appropriate support to cooperatives with difficulties in capital turnover.
    The conference also made arrangements for the exchange of preferential grain and cotton savings.

    中国人民银行总行召开全国农村金融会议
    确定今年国家银行在农村中的工作任务
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民银行总行在三月一日到十七日召开全国农村金融会议，确定了一九五五年国家银行在农村的工作任务。一九五五年的工作任务是：既要合理运用国家的农业贷款，加强信用合作工作，大力动员农村资金，扶助农业生产和农业合作化的发展，以适应发展农业生产的需要；又要适应市场情况，加强对农村社会主义商业的信贷结算工作，调节货币流通，为扩大商品流转服务。
    根据这个任务，一九五五年的农业信贷工作，会议认为在农业贷款方面，要积极帮助已有的六十万个农业生产合作社扩大再生产。在充分发挥农业生产合作社及社员投资力量的情况下，经过对农业生产合作社全年生产和收入的通盘计算，给以适当的贷款支持。贷款用途主要是帮助农业生产合作社进行基本建设和改进生产工具。在北方根据群众自愿原则，着重办好新式农具（主要是双轮双铧犁等）的贷款；在南方根据民办公助的原则着重办好小型农田水利贷款，以及发放好肥料贷款。对农业生产互助组，主要是扶助贫困组员克服一般生产和生活困难，对常年互助组特别是准备转为农业生产合作社的互助组，也可贷款扶助他们购置大型农具。对个体贫农和有困难的中农，也应通过贷款帮助他们解决入社资金的困难和一般生产资料或紧急的生活困难。此外，对国营农场和去年遭受水灾地区、少数民族地区、渔业区的贷款，会议也分别作了布置。
    在信用合作方面，上半年的中心任务是巩固现有的十三万多个信用合作社。在秋收以前，各省一般都应坚决停止发展，全力转向巩固。为了做好这一工作，会议认为，必须在党和政府的统一领导下，加强对信用合作社干部的思想教育和业务指导。现有的信用合作社必须在春耕生产过程中和青黄不接时期，积极帮助贫农和有困难的中农解决生产、生活困难，打击高利贷活动；对农业生产合作社短期周转资金的困难，也要帮助克服。并且要加强财务会计工作，贯彻社章，健全民主管理制度。各地应采取开会交流经验和轮训等办法，提高信用合作社主任和会计的政策、业务水平。在巩固工作中，要贯彻党在农村的阶级路线。国家银行对资金周转有困难的社，应予以适当支持。
    在兑付粮棉优待储蓄方面，会议也作了安排。
