    Soviet Plant Protection Experts in China
    Cao Hualin Wang Yongqiang
    In order to strengthen cooperation in plant protection between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet government dispatched a group of six plant protection experts, headed by V.N. Obolensky, to China for scientific investigation. They spent more than five months in our country conducting investigations. This investigation not only enriched the content of plant protection science in both China and the Soviet Union, but also opened up broad avenues for future technical cooperation in plant protection between the two countries.
    During the investigation, the Soviet experts helped us discover and solve many important problems. For example, in the vineyards of the Zhangyu Winery in Yantai, Shandong, Expert Obolensky helped us discover grape phylloxera, an international plant quarantine target (in the late 19th century, French vineyards were devastated by this pest, destroying more than two million hectares). Expert Gorlenko, together with professors from Beijing Agricultural University and Southwest Agricultural College in China, jointly confirmed that citrus seedlings in the Chongqing No. 1 Orchard and the Municipal Farm in Sichuan Province had been infected with citrus canker, the most dangerous citrus disease (this disease is also an international plant quarantine target, and it was previously believed that the province did not have this citrus disease).
    This investigation by Soviet experts played an active role in promoting plant protection work in our country. They earnestly told us that experimental research work must have a clear purpose of serving production. In terms of methods for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, comprehensive control methods should be studied, making it possible to use local materials and the immunity of the plants themselves. During the investigation, Soviet experts enthusiastically encouraged the experimental research work in various places that had correct methods. The experts believed that our comprehensive control methods for preventing and controlling cotton bollworms had sufficient theoretical basis and should be vigorously promoted. Regarding the research work of the Sichuan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences on preventing and controlling cotton wilt disease, Expert Gorlenko pointed out that the direction of selecting disease-free plants from diseased fields for disease-resistant breeding was correct and should be continued. Expert Sutova believed that the introduction of large red ladybugs to control citrus cottony cushion scale in Hubei and other provinces and the research on propagating Trichogramma wasps from pine caterpillar eggs in Guangdong Province were both very good and should be given attention. At the same time, the Soviet experts also pointed out many shortcomings in our experimental research work. For example, Expert Bebiyanko pointed out that research work on rice stem borers and rice blast should be carried out under a unified plan, with division of labor and cooperation, and frequent exchange of experience to avoid wasting manpower and material resources. The experts also reminded us that the task of science is not only to solve today's problems, but also to pay attention to future prospects. According to the speed of agricultural collectivization in our country, there should be at least one agricultural science research institute conducting research on mechanical stem borer control. Expert Bakhsheyev pointed out that China has vast land and abundant resources, and hoped that China's entomologists would strengthen scientific research on plant protection. Expert Sutova told us that the use of biology to control pests has broad prospects in China, but it has not been fully explored and utilized. She hoped that Chinese plant protection workers would pay attention to the investigation and research of beneficial insects. These valuable opinions pointed out the correct direction of efforts for our country's future plant protection work.
    Field observation and specimen collection are one of the important methods of this investigation. Although the experts saw and collected many of the same specimens in various places, they still collected a large number of specimens each time they went to a new area and recorded their ecological environment in detail. The experts believe that the relationship between organisms and the outside world is inseparable. Only by carefully observing and repeatedly studying the different manifestations of organisms under different ecological conditions can we well grasp the laws of their occurrence and development. From this, we can realize the importance of ecological research work.
    From the process of Soviet experts helping to identify specimens in various places, we can see and appreciate the experts' breadth of knowledge and their humble and sincere attitude. Bebiyanko is an internationally renowned entomologist and a winner of the Stalin Science Prize. When visiting various places, he took the initiative to help agricultural colleges and research institutions identify many orthopteran insect specimens (many of which were locusts or grasshoppers that had not been identified for more than ten years). However, for those insects that were difficult to identify from the outside, he never easily confirmed their scientific names, and always said: "Can you let me take them back, study them carefully, and then tell you!" Expert Bakhsheyev is a world-renowned expert in scale insect classification. For some scale insects that he collected, he generally only said the genus name and not the species name.

    苏联植物保护专家在中国
    曹华林　王永强
    为了加强中苏两国植物保护事业的合作，苏联政府派遣了以维·尼·奥波连斯基为首的植物保护专家六人，来我国进行科学考察工作。他们在我国进行了五个多月时间的考察。通过这次考察，不仅丰富了中苏两国植物保护科学的内容，而且给今后中苏两国的植物保护技术合作开辟了广阔的道路。
    在考察期间，苏联专家帮助我们发现和解决了很多重要问题。如奥波连斯基专家在山东烟台张裕酿酒公司的葡萄园内，帮助我们发现了国际植物检疫对象之一的葡萄根瘤蚜虫（在十九世纪末，法国葡萄园因这种虫为害，毁掉二百多万公顷）；戈尔连科专家和我国北京农业大学、西南农学院的教授，共同证实了四川省重庆市立第一果园和市立农场的柑桔苗木，已经感染最危险的柑桔?疡病（这种病害也是国际植物检疫对象之一，过去一向认为该省没有这种柑桔病）。
    苏联专家这次考察，对我国植物保护工作起了积极的推动作用。他们殷切地告诉我们，试验研究工作，必须有为生产服务的明确目的。在防治病虫的方法上，则应研究综合性的防治办法，尽可能地就地取材和利用植物本身的免疫性。考察期间，苏联专家对各地的试验研究工作，凡是方法正确的，都予以热情的鼓励。对我国防治红铃虫的综合防治方法，专家们认为是有充分理论根据的，应该大力宣传推广。对四川省农业科学研究所防治棉花枯萎病的研究工作，戈尔连科专家指出：从发病田中选不感染病的植株进行抗病育种的方向是正确的，应该继续进行。苏托娃专家认为湖北等省引用大红瓢虫防治柑桔吹绵介壳虫和广东省用松毛虫卵繁殖赤眼卵寄生蜂的研究都很好，应该予以重视。但同时苏联专家也指出了我们试验研究工作中的不少缺点。如贝比岩柯专家指出水稻螟虫和稻热病等研究工作，应在统一计划下进行，分工合作，经常交流经验，以避免人力物力的浪费。专家并提醒我们：科学的任务不仅要解决今天的问题，还必须注意到将来的远景。根据我国农业合作化的发展速度，目前至少应有一个农业科学研究所进行机械治螟的研究工作。巴赫谢尼乌斯专家指出我国地大物博，希望我国的昆虫学家加强植物保护的科学研究工作。苏托娃专家告诉我们：利用生物学来防治害虫，在中国有广阔的前途，但没有充分发掘和利用。她希望中国的植物保护工作者，能注意对有益昆虫的调查和研究。这些宝贵的意见，给我国今后的植物保护事业，指出了正确的努力方向。
    田间观察和采集标本是这次考察工作的重要方法之一。专家虽然在各地看到和采到很多大多相同的标本，但每到一个新的地区后，还要大量采集，并详细记载其生态环境。专家们认为有机体和外界的联系是不可分割的，只有详细观察和反复研究生物体在不同生态条件下的不同表现，才能很好掌握其发生发展规律。从这里可以使我们认识到生态学研究工作的重要意义。
    从苏联专家帮助各地鉴定标本的过程中，我们可以看出和体会到专家们学识的渊博，态度的谦逊真诚。贝比岩柯是享有国际声誉的昆虫学家，斯大林科学奖金获得者，他在各地参观时，主动地帮助农学院校和研究机关鉴定了很多直翅目的昆虫标本（其中有不少蝗虫或螽斯是十多年来没有定名的），但他对那些从外表上难以肯定的昆虫，则决不轻易肯定它的学名，总是说：“能不能让我带回去，仔细研究出来再告诉你们！”巴赫谢尼乌斯专家是世界著名的介壳虫分类专家，对自己采到的有些介壳虫，一般只说属名而不说种名。
