A Letter to the Editor about Punishing Those Who Retaliate and Deceive the Party Newspaper
Letter from Hu Weiren:

To the Editors:

I want to accuse Yu Nengfu, the Chief of the Finance and Food Section of the People's Government of Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province, of framing and persecuting me, and of fabricating facts to deceive the Party newspaper.

I was originally the bookkeeper of the private Daxin Cotton Ginning Factory in Datuan Town, Nanhui County. In 1949, I joined the Communist Youth League and served as the secretary of the factory's Youth League branch, and later was elected as a county people's representative. In the autumn of 1951, the factory was leased to the Nanhui County Supply and Marketing Cooperative and renamed the No. 2 Cotton Processing Factory of the County Cooperative. I was designated by the County Cooperative as the person in charge of the new factory.

In April 1954, the higher-level People's Court found that the Daxin Factory was originally the property of a traitor and instructed the Nanhui County People's Government to confiscate it. Just as all the factory workers were enthusiastically celebrating the government's takeover, the county magistrate suddenly ordered our factory to be converted into a dormitory for a local state-owned yarn factory, the factory was shut down, and the workers were told to "find their own way out." This order caused a great shock among the more than one hundred employees.

At the request of all the factory workers, I repeatedly went to the Nanhui County People's Government to suggest: do not dismantle this complete and well-equipped factory; it would be a loss to convert the factory building into a general dormitory, and this factory was needed for the production tasks at the time (it has now been proven that this factory was dismantled and other cotton ginning factories were expanded). If the government insisted on closing down the factory, it should be responsible for resettling all the employees. However, Yu Nengfu, the chief of the County Finance and Food Section who was directly responsible for the takeover work, not only did not accept the workers' opinions, but also believed that we were "making trouble" for the government and that there were "counter-revolutionary elements active."

At that time, in addition to persuading the workers to help the government to do a good job in the takeover work, I also reported this situation to the local Party newspaper and the People's Daily. The Party newspaper forwarded my letter to the relevant departments for handling, but this letter did not attract the attention of the person in charge of the Nanhui County People's Government. On the contrary, Yu Nengfu held a greater grudge against me and instructed section member Shen Guozhang to fabricate my crimes, resorting to the vile means of deceiving the Party newspaper, and labeling me as an agent of the capitalists and a member of a reactionary party group; and saying that I was inciting workers against the government and resisting the government's takeover of the factory. Under these charges, I was "purged."

After I was "purged," I immediately felt the pain of unemployment and the threat to my livelihood. At this time, my cousin asked me to go to Inner Mongolia temporarily (my cousin works for the Inner Mongolia Daily). He also wanted me to appeal to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily about this matter. I thought that only by relying on the Party newspaper could this injustice be clarified, so I came to Beijing in person to file a complaint with you. With the support of the Party newspaper, the Songjiang Prefectural People's Supervisory Office of Jiangsu Province sent people to investigate and proved that the charges Yu Nengfu had made against me were all untrue; and notified me to return to the county immediately to be reassigned a job. However, the lawbreaker Yu Nengfu is still at large.

I request the Songjiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Jiangsu Province to give Yu Nengfu the punishment he deserves.

Investigation by the Readers' Letters Department of This Newspaper

Yu Nengfu (Communist Party member), the Chief of the Finance and Food Section of the Nanhui County People's Government, is extremely vile in his retaliation against Hu Weiren and his fabrication of facts and deception of the Party newspaper.

When this newspaper received Comrade Hu Weiren's written complaint, it wrote to the Nanhui County People's Government, requesting an investigation and handling. On June 21, 1954, the Nanhui County People's Government gave this newspaper a reply. It said: "Hu Weiren is a member of the Sanqing Corps and an agent of the capitalists. He has long been trying to embezzle the factory. According to existing materials, he has embezzled 180 'zhu' of cotton (73 'jin' each). He has consistently wooed backward workers and provoked relations between the government and the workers, so that some workers have been influenced by him and have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the factory's takeover..." After our investigation, the contents of this letter are all false. First, Hu Weiren was designated by the County Cooperative as the person in charge of the factory after the County Cooperative leased the private Daxin Cotton Ginning Factory, and was not an agent of the capitalists; second, the issue of embezzling 180 'zhu' of cotton had already been clarified in the "Three-Anti" movement and was not true; third, saying that Hu Weiren "attempted to embezzle the factory" and "provoked relations between the government and the workers" are all without factual basis. As for the "Sanqing Corps member" issue, it is even more fabricated out of thin air. It turns out that this false letter was written by Shen Guozhang (a member of the Finance and Food Section) under the instruction of Yu Nengfu.

On the one hand, Yu Nengfu sent a letter to this newspaper fabricating facts, and on the other hand, he spread rumors that Hu Weiren was resisting the government's takeover of the factory and organizing riots, causing the Nanhui County People's Court to feel that the problem was serious and prepare to arrest Hu Weiren and bring him to justice. After Chen Changda, the president of the court, personally investigated, it was proven that the situation described by Yu Nengfu was all untrue. The president of the court reported the investigation results at the county government meeting, and Yu Nengfu, the instigator of fabricating the materials, also participated in the meeting. However, Yu Nengfu did not stop there. In order to prevent Hu Weiren's cousin from interfering in this matter, he instructed Shen Guozhang to use those fabricated materials to write a letter to the president of the Inner Mongolia Daily, slandering Hu Weiren for inciting workers when resisting the government's takeover of the factory, saying "more people can become kings" and "the bigger the issue, the better." At the same time, he fabricated out of thin air that Hu Weiren had solicited money from capitalists to speculate in gold, etc., and asked the Inner Mongolia Daily to educate Hu Weiren's cousin and tell him not to interfere in this matter.

Why did Yu Nengfu retaliate against Hu Weiren? According to our understanding: Hu Weiren repeatedly raised different opinions on the decision of the Nanhui County People's Government to shut down the Daxin Cotton Ginning Factory, which Yu Nengfu thought was detrimental to the government's "prestige"; Hu Weiren also argued with Yu Nengfu when he was "purged," so Yu Nengfu held a grudge and was determined to "fix" Hu Weiren. Therefore, Yu Nengfu viciously fabricated facts, insisting on portraying Hu Weiren as a counter-revolutionary element, deceiving organizations and the Party newspaper everywhere, completely losing the qualities that a Communist Party member should have.

The leaders of the Nanhui County People's Government also made serious bureaucratic errors in handling the letters entrusted by the newspaper. First of all, they irresponsibly transferred the letter criticizing the reader to the person being criticized, and then lightly believed the opinions of the person being criticized, and sent the newspaper a reply letter that confused right and wrong, which fueled Yu Nengfu's illegal behavior. This bureaucratic style of the leaders of the Nanhui County People's Government cannot but damage the relationship between the Party and the masses. We believe that the Nanhui County Committee of the Communist Party of China should seriously examine this incident and give the lawbreakers the necessary punishment.

    给打击报复、欺骗党报的人以处分
    胡维伦的来信编辑同志：
    我要向你们控诉江苏省南汇县人民政府财粮科科长郁能富对我进行诬陷和迫害，并捏造事实，欺骗党报的行为。
    我原是南汇县大团镇私营大新轧花工厂的记账员。一九四九年参加了青年团，担任本厂团支部书记，后又当选为县人民代表。一九五一年秋天，这个工厂租给南汇县供销合作社经营，改为县合作社的第二棉花加工厂。我被县合作社指定为新厂的负责人。
    一九五四年四月，上级人民法院查明大新厂原是属于汉奸的产业，指令南汇县人民政府予以没收。正当全厂职工热烈庆祝政府接收的时候，突然，县长下令把我们的工厂改作一个地方国营纱厂的职工宿舍，工厂停工，职工“自找出路”。这个命令在一百多名职工中引起了很大的震动。
    在全厂职工的要求下，我曾多次出面向南汇县人民政府建议：不要把这个设备完整、机器优良的工厂拆散；利用厂房改建一般宿舍将是得不偿失的，而且这个工厂就当时生产任务来说，也是需要的（现在证明，拆了这个厂又扩建了其他的轧花厂）。如果政府一定要停办这个工厂，也应该负责安置全部职工。可是直接负责接管工作的县财粮科科长郁能富，不但不接受职工意见，反而认为我们是同政府“捣麻烦”，有“反革命分子活动”。
    当时，我除了劝说职工很好地帮助政府做好接收工作外，并将这一情况向当地党报和人民日报反映。党报将我的信件转达有关部门处理，但是这封信并未引起南汇县人民政府负责人的重视。相反地，郁能富对我更加怀恨，指示科员沈国璋捏造我的罪名，不惜用欺骗党报的恶劣手段，给我加上了资方代理人、反动党团成员的帽子；并说我挑拨工人同政府的关系，对抗政府接收工厂。就在这些罪名下，我被“清洗”出去了。
    我被“清洗”以后，立即感到失业的痛苦和生活的威胁，这时我的堂兄要我暂时到内蒙去（我的堂兄在内蒙古日报工作）。并要我把这事向南京新华日报申诉。我想，也只有依靠党报才能把这件冤事搞清楚，所以亲自来北京向你们提出控诉。在党报的支持下，江苏省松江专署人民监察处曾派人进行调查，证明郁能富给我加上的罪状全非事实；并通知我立即回县重新分配工作。可是违法分子郁能富却还是逍遥法外。
    我要求江苏省松江专署给郁能富以应得的处分。
  　胡维伦
    本报读者来信部的调查
    南汇县人民政府财粮科科长郁能富（共产党员）对胡维伦的打击报复，和他捏造事实、欺骗党报的行为，是极为恶劣的。
    本报接到胡维伦同志书面控诉时，曾写信给南汇县人民政府，请予调查处理。一九五四年六月二十一日，南汇县人民政府给本报来了一个答复。说：“胡维伦，系三青团员，资方代理人，他很早就企图独吞该厂。据现有材料，他已挪用棉花一百八十砠（每砠七十三市斤）。他一贯拉拢落后工人，从中挑拨政府同工人间的关系，以致部分工人受他的影响，而对政府接收这个工厂的处理表示不满……”经过我们的调查，这封信的内容全部是假的。第一，胡维伦是县合作社租用私营大新轧花工厂以后由合作社指定的工厂负责人，并不是什么资方代理人；第二，挪用棉花一百八十砠的问题，在“三反”运动中已经查清，并非事实；第三，说胡维伦
  “企图独吞该厂”、“挑拨政府同工人间的关系”，都是没有事实根据的。至于“三青团员”问题更是凭空捏造的。原来这封假信是在郁能富授意下，由沈国璋（财粮科科员）写的。
    郁能富一方面给本报发出了捏造事实的信件，一方面又散播胡维伦对抗政府接收工厂、组织暴动等谣言，致使南汇县人民法院感到问题严重，准备逮捕胡维伦法办。后经法院院长陈昌达亲自调查，证明郁能富所说的情况全非事实。法院院长曾将调查结果在县府会议上作了报告，捏造材料的主使人郁能富也参与了这次会议。但是郁能富并不就此罢休，他为了堵塞胡维伦的堂兄干预这件事情，又指示沈国璋利用那些捏造的材料，写信给内蒙古日报社社长，诬蔑胡维伦在对抗政府接收工厂时，曾挑拨工人说  “人多成王”、“事情搞得越大越好”。同时，还无中生有地说胡维伦曾索取资本家的钱捣卖黄金等等，要求内蒙古日报对胡维伦的堂兄加以教育，要他不干预这件事情。
    郁能富为什么要对胡维伦进行打击报复呢？据了解：胡维伦对南汇县人民政府停办大新轧花工厂的决定，曾多次提出了不同的意见，这在郁能富看来是有损政府“威信”的；胡维伦在被“清洗”时，又曾和郁能富争论过，因此郁能富就怀恨在心，下决心要“整”胡维伦一下。于是，郁能富就恶毒地捏造事实，硬把胡维伦说成是反革命分子，到处欺骗组织，欺骗党报，完全丧失了一个共产党员应有的品质。
    南汇县人民政府领导人在处理报社委托办理的信件上，也犯了严重的官僚主义错误。首先他们不负责地把读者批评的信件转到被批评人的手里，又轻信被批评人的意见，给报社寄来一个混淆是非的答复信，助长了郁能富的犯法行为。南汇县人民政府领导人的这种官僚主义作风，不能不使党同群众的联系受到损害。我们认为，中共南汇县委员会应该严肃检查这一事件，并给违法分子以必要的惩处。
