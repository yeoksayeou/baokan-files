Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 19th: TASS Moscow, March 19th - "Pravda" published an article signed by an Observer regarding the publication on March 18th of the correspondence between Churchill and Molotov concerning a meeting of the heads of government of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The article is entitled: "The Unseemly Tricks of British Diplomacy."

The Observer said: A careful analysis of these letters and the many statements Churchill made about a meeting of the heads of government of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union reveals that the British Prime Minister, in suggesting such a meeting, was often pursuing goals that had nothing in common with a genuine desire to ease international tensions. This view is confirmed by the fact that Churchill did nothing to realize his proposal.

The British and other nations' public firmly demanded a way to resolve international disputes, and the Labour Party in Parliament supported these demands. This forced Churchill to occasionally portray himself as a supporter of a summit of great powers. It is evident that frequent inquiries in Parliament about the intentions and practical steps of the British diplomatic authorities in this regard compelled Churchill to resort to correspondence with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.

All subsequent developments indicate that the British Prime Minister was not serious about organizing a meeting between the heads of government of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The documents published on March 18th give the impression that Churchill did not want such a meeting at all. The reasons Churchill put forward for refusing to hold the meeting, if not fabricated, are very weak. The statement that the Soviet proposal for a conference of European countries and the United States on European collective security temporarily replaced the Anglo-Soviet summit proposed by Churchill is clearly unfounded. The falsity of this excuse has been clearly exposed by the fact that the British government first used the Soviet proposal for a European security conference as a reason to refuse to hold a bilateral summit, and then refused to attend the European security conference.

The Observer went on to say: These documents (the correspondence between Churchill and Molotov) prove that the meeting between the leaders of the British and Soviet governments did not take place, not because the Soviet government's proposal to hold a conference to discuss ensuring European security hindered such a meeting, but because the British Prime Minister, having made the proposal for a meeting, was unwilling to carry it through to the end.

Churchill's attempt to gain political capital by publishing these letters naturally leads to the conclusion that the British Prime Minister's letters and many remarks on this important international issue stemmed from considerations far removed from a genuine concern for easing international tensions. It is difficult not to get the impression that the British diplomatic authorities are speculating on the widespread desire of the people of Britain and other countries for international cooperation, playing an unseemly trick, using the idea of ​​meeting with the leaders of the Soviet government to strengthen its bargaining position with its American partners.

The Observer concluded: Soviet society has always paid close attention to Churchill's suggestions on the possibilities and methods of resolving outstanding international issues. The Soviet Union is prepared to study with a very serious and sincere attitude any proposal whose purpose is to achieve peace and strengthen international economic and cultural relations. The Soviet Union has always been willing to do so in the past, and it still is today. But the Soviet people judge politicians and political leaders not only by their words, but primarily by their actions and deeds.

However, a diplomatic trick aimed at winning cheap popularity inside and outside Parliament will not gain the support and approval of all nations.

    英国外交的不体面的把戏
    ——“真理报”观察家评论的摘要
   【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：“真理报”就三月十八日公布邱吉尔和莫洛托夫关于英、苏两国政府首脑会谈的来往信件这件事发表了由观察家署名的一篇文章，文章题目是：“英国外交的不体面的把戏”。
    观察家说：仔细分析一下这些信件和邱吉尔发表的关于英苏两国政府首脑会谈的许多声明，就可以看出：英国首相在建议大国政府首脑举行会议的时候，常常是追逐那种同关心国际紧张局势缓和毫无共同之处的目的，邱吉尔并没有做任何事情来实现他的建议，这个事实就证实了这种看法。
    英国和其他国家的社会人士坚决要求想办法来解决国际争端，特别是工党在议会中支持这些要求，这就迫使邱吉尔不时把自己扮演成大国首脑会议的支持者。显然是议会中经常提出的关于英国外交当局在这方面的意图和实际步骤的质询，使得邱吉尔不得不求助于同苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的通信。
    随后的一切发展都说明：英国首相并不是认真想组织英、苏两国政府首脑的会谈。三月十八日公布的文件给人这样一种印象：邱吉尔根本不希望举行这样一个会谈。邱吉尔提出来的拒绝举行会谈的理由，如果不是虚构的话，也是非常没有力量的。关于苏联建议的由欧洲各国和美国举行关于欧洲集体安全问题的会议暂时代替了邱吉尔所建议的英、苏两国政府首脑的会谈的这种说法，显然是毫无根据的。这种借口的虚伪性已经被下面这个事实揭露得清清楚楚了：英国政府首先以苏联建议举行欧洲安全会议为理由，拒绝了举行两国政府首脑会谈的主张，随后却拒绝出席欧洲安全会议。
    观察家接着说：这些文件（邱吉尔和莫洛托夫的来往信件）证明：英国和苏联政府领袖之间的会谈没有举行，并不是因为苏联政府主张举行讨论保障欧洲安全问题的会议的建议阻碍了这样的会谈，而是因为英国首相在提出了会谈的建议之后，不愿意贯彻到底。
    邱吉尔想靠公开这些信件来取得政治资本，这种举动很自然地使人得出这样的结论：这位英国首相关于这个重要的国际问题的信件以及他的许多言论，都是出于那种远不是关心国际紧张局势缓和的考虑的。很难使人不产生这样的印象：英国外交当局借英国和其他国家的人民要求国际合作的普遍愿望进行投机，玩弄一种不体面的把戏，利用要同苏联政府的领袖们会谈的主张来加强它和它的美国伙伴进行讨价还价的地位。
    观察家最后说：苏联社会人士一向密切注意邱吉尔的关于解决悬而未决的国际问题的可能性和方法的建议。苏联准备以非常认真、诚恳的态度来研究其目的在获得和平和加强国际经济、文化关系的任何建议。苏联在过去一向愿意这样做，而且现在仍然如此。但是苏联人民去判断政治家和政界领袖，不仅仅是根据他们的言论，而首先是根据他们的作为和作法。
    但是，其目的在于议会内外哗众取宠的一种外交把戏，是得不到各民族的支持和赞同的。
