Huaibei Salt Field Begins Construction of Tainan Seawall

The Tainan Seawall construction project of the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field commenced on March 2nd, with over 10,000 migrant workers engaged in intense labor.

The seawall will be a total of 71.5 *li* (approximately 35.75 kilometers) long. The height of the seawall is designed according to the safe water level of the highest historical tide. This is a large-scale project for the Huaibei Salt Field. After the completion of this seawall, the Tainan field area will no longer be threatened by sea tides, more than 790 *fen* of tidal flats can be guaranteed for safe production, and more than 600,000 *mu* of interspersed tidal flat area, after being reorganized, can be used to store and evaporate seawater; the soil extraction ponds of the seawall (the soil extraction ponds inside the seawall become a river) can also increase the seawater storage volume, which can be used for the storage and turnover of seawater for an annual salt production of 500,000 tons. The five large sluice gates attached to the seawall can all be used for tidal intake during the production season, three of which can also be used for freshwater drainage during the rainy season, and wooden boats carrying 15 tons can also smoothly navigate through the Guankou sluice gate.

    淮北盐场开工兴建台南海堤
    国营淮北盐场台南海堤建筑工程已在三月二日开工，一万多个民工投入了紧张的劳动。
    这个海堤全长共七十一点五华里。海堤的高度，是按历史上最高潮水的安全水位设计的。这是淮北盐场的一项规模巨大的工程。这个海堤建成后，台南场一带将不再遭受海潮威胁，七百九十多份滩地可以保证安全生产，还有六十多万公亩的夹滩面积，经整理后可以用来储存和蒸发海水；海堤的取土塘（堤内取土塘成为一条河），也可以增加海水的储存容积，可供年产五十万吨盐的海水的储存和周转之用。海堤上附设的五座大水闸，在生产季节可以全部用于纳潮，其中有三座还能在雨季用于排淡，载重十五吨的木船，也可以由管港水闸顺畅地通航。
