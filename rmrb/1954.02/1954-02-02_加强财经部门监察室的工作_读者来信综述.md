Summary of Readers' Letters

Strengthening the Work of Supervision Offices in Financial and Economic Departments

The Central People's Government's Government Administration Council issued an order on December 27, 1952, stipulating the establishment of supervision agencies in financial and economic organs and state-owned financial and economic enterprise departments above the provincial (municipal) level nationwide. Over the past year, many financial and economic organs and enterprise departments in various regions have successively established supervision offices, equipped with full-time cadres, and have done a lot of work, playing a certain role in ensuring the smooth progress of national economic construction. However, according to readers' letters: some leading cadres and personnel responsible for supervision work in certain units do not sufficiently recognize the great significance of establishing supervision offices, which makes it impossible to carry out supervision work effectively.

The leading cadres of some units do not pay enough attention to the establishment of supervision offices and the allocation of cadres. For example, reader Shi Hui wrote that Tianjin Steel Plant established a supervision office in June of last year only after repeated urging from the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the active assistance of the Tianjin Municipal People's Supervision Committee. The deputy director of the supervision office has since been transferred, and of the other three full-time cadres, one is on long-term sick leave due to lung disease, and another has been transferred to other work, leaving only one person, who cannot undertake the tasks of the supervision office. For example, the Shandong Mining and Metallurgical Office of the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau established a supervision office in May last year, which in reality was only composed of three people's supervision correspondents who did not separate themselves from production, making it impossible to carry out regular work. Some leading cadres of units lack regular and specific guidance and assistance to the work of the supervision office. Reader Wang Jifu wrote that the Tianjin No. 2 Construction Engineering Company established a supervision office in July last year, but the company's leadership has never studied the work of the supervision office. The Supervision Office of the Shanghai Steel Plant of the East China Iron and Steel Company made a work plan in September last year and sent it to the factory director and the Party Committee secretary for approval, but the factory director lost the plan before even looking at it. More seriously, some leading cadres even regard the work of the supervision office as a "burden." For example, the Tobacco and Hemp Company's Tianjin Branch once requested the cancellation of the supervision office. The North China Commercial Bureau even abolished the supervision office in October last year without authorization.

From the perspective of the work of the supervision offices themselves, according to readers' letters, some supervision offices cannot combine their work with the main business and production issues of their departments, thus becoming mired in routine affairs. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's supervision office once took charge of all the suggestion boxes set up in the plant's various systems, and was busy opening and checking the suggestion boxes and distributing people's letters every day, making it overwhelmed. Wang Chengsheng of the Tianjin Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau's supervision office reflected that the office initially only handled people's letters that were not handled by the bureau's various departments, and abandoned the inspection and supervision of the central work. In addition, some cadres of the supervision offices have the negative idea of "waiting for the leadership to pay attention," and do not actively improve their work; some cadres themselves lack understanding of the importance of supervision work, and therefore do not work with peace of mind. These factors have also affected the development of supervision work.

It should be recognized that the establishment of supervision agencies in financial and economic organs and enterprise departments is to safeguard the implementation of state laws and plans, and to regularly supervise and inspect all staff members to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction. Strengthening supervision work so that it serves economic construction is of great significance for implementing the general line of the state during the transition period. The leading cadres of each unit should correctly recognize this point and regard the supervision office as their assistant, and give play to its role in promoting the improvement of the work of their unit. To achieve this, the leading cadres need to earnestly value this work and provide necessary support and assistance regularly. Every person engaged in supervision work must also recognize the importance of their work, pay attention to combining their work with the central work for supervision and inspection, and complete the glorious tasks given to them by the state with peace of mind and actively.

From the readers' letters we have received, we can see that some units have done a relatively good job because they correctly recognize the importance of the work of the supervision office. For example, Ye Shengwen of the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory's supervision office reflected that the factory's supervision office often takes the initiative to find leading comrades to study and report on work, so that the leading comrades feel that the supervision office is helpful to their work, and thus has gained the active support of the leading comrades. For example, in August last year, the supervision office found that many cadres in the factory (including the factory director) had behaviors of not following the rules to varying degrees, and even violating state policies, so they reported it to the leading comrades; the factory director attached great importance to this issue, and first made a self-criticism at the conference held by the supervision office, which played a great role in educating the factory's cadres to conscientiously abide by the rules. For another example, the Shenyang Screw Factory's supervision office took the initiative to report the work situation to the factory director, conscientiously conveyed the instructions of the superior supervision agencies, and put forward specific suggestions for strengthening supervision work. At that time, the factory director asked the office to be responsible for checking the problem of the factory's water and heating project exceeding the budget, and actively helped to carry out supervision work. It is hoped that the supervision offices of other units will also conscientiously implement the regulations of the Government Administration Council, and actively work hard under the leadership of the Party and the support of the workers and masses, so that supervision work can play its due role under the glorious illumination of the state's general line during the transition period.

### 加强财经部门监察室的工作——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    加强财经部门监察室的工作
    ——读者来信综述
    中央人民政府政务院在一九五二年十二月二十七日发布命令，规定在全国省（市）以上各级人民政府财经机关和国营财经企业部门设立监察机构。一年多来，各地许多财经机关和企业部门先后建立了监察室，配备了专职干部，并且做了不少工作，对保证国家经济建设的顺利进行起了一定的作用。但是，根据读者来信反映：还有某些单位的领导干部和负责监察工作的人员对建立监察室的重大意义认识不足，以致使监察工作不能很好开展。
    某些单位的领导干部对监察室的机构建立和干部配备不够重视。如读者石惠来信反映：天津钢厂在重工业部钢铁工业局一再督促和天津市人民监察委员会积极协助下，才在去年六月成立了监察室，由副厂长兼监察室主任。到现在，监察室副主任已调了工作，其他三个专职干部，一个因有肺病而长期休养，一个被调作其他工作，留下一个人，无法担负监察室的任务。又如钢铁工业局山东矿冶办事处去年五月成立了监察室，实际上只是由三名不脱离生产的人民监察通讯员组成的，无法进行经常的工作。有些单位的领导干部对监察室的工作缺乏经常的、具体的指导和帮助。读者王吉符来信反映：天津第二建筑工程公司在去年七月成立了监察室，但该公司领导方面从来没有研究过监察室的工作。华东钢铁公司上海钢铁厂监察室在去年九月作了工作计划，送给厂长及党委书记审批，结果厂长还没看就把计划丢失了。更严重的是，有些单位的领导干部甚至把监察室的工作看作是个“累赘”。如菸麻公司天津市分公司，就曾要求取消监察室。华北商业管理局在去年十月竟擅自撤消了监察室的机构。
    从监察室本身工作来说，根据读者来信反映，有些监察室还不能结合本部门主要业务及生产问题进行工作，以致陷于日常事务。如石景山钢铁厂监察室曾有一段时间把厂内各系统所设的意见箱都管起来，每天忙于开检意见箱和分发人民来信，弄得应接不暇。天津市建筑工程局监察室王晨声反映，该室在最初只是处理本局各科室不处理的人民来信，而放弃了对中心工作的检查和监督。此外，有些监察室的干部有着“等待领导重视”的消极思想，不去主动地积极地改进工作；甚至有的干部本身就对监察工作的重要性缺乏认识，因而不安心工作。这些，也都影响了监察工作的开展。
    应该认识，在财经机关和企业部门建立监察机构，是为了维护国家法律、计划的执行，经常地对所有工作人员监督检查，以保障经济建设的顺利进行。加强监察工作，使它为经济建设服务，对贯彻执行国家过渡时期总路线是有重大意义的。各单位的领导干部应该正确认识这一点，把监察室作为自己的一个助手，发挥它推动本单位改进工作的作用。而要做到这一点，就需要领导干部切实重视这项工作，并经常加以必要的支持和帮助。每一个做监察工作的人员，也必须认识他们工作的重要意义，注意结合中心工作进行监督检查，安心而积极地完成国家给他们的光荣任务。
    从我们收到的读者来信中可以看出，目前有些单位由于正确地认识了监察室工作的重要性，工作就做得比较好。如国营天津第一棉纺织厂监察室叶盛文反映：该厂监察室经常主动地找领导同志研究和汇报工作，使领导同志感到监察室对他的工作有帮助，因而得到了领导同志的积极支持。例如，去年八月监察室发现本厂不少干部（连厂长在内）程度不一地有不遵守制度、甚至违反国家政策的行为，就向领导同志汇报；厂长对这个问题很重视，就在监察室召开的大会上首先作了检讨，对教育全厂干部认真遵守制度起了很大作用。又如沈阳螺钉厂监察室主动向厂长汇报工作情况，认真传达上级监察机构的指示，并提出对加强监察工作的具体建议。当时厂长就让该室负责检查本厂水暖工程超支问题，并积极帮助监察工作的开展。希望其它单位的监察室也能认真贯彻政务院的规定，在党的领导和职工群众的支持下积极努力，使监察工作在国家过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下发挥应有的作用。
