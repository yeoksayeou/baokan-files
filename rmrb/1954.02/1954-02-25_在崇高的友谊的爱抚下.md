    Under the Caress of Noble Friendship
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    Year after year, the number of university students and graduate students coming from the motherland to study in the Soviet Union increases. Currently, Chinese students are studying in fourteen cities in the Soviet Union. In the fifty-eight higher education institutions in Moscow, there are hundreds of Chinese students. When they first arrive, almost all of them have difficulty understanding the lectures, and they are not accustomed to the food and daily life. However, when you meet them again after a year or six months, their academic performance is rarely not a "five," they have grown accustomed to eating bread, and they chat and laugh with their Soviet classmates. If you ask what force is supporting their efforts, it is the ardent expectations of the people of the motherland and the loving care of Soviet teachers and friends.

    Soviet higher education institutions have opened their doors wide to Chinese students. Among the students of famous comprehensive universities and specialized colleges, there are few without Chinese faces. Many faculty members and students in various schools like having Chinese students in their schools and departments, and they are willing to spend more time and energy helping them. One student had not completed university in China, and according to his level, he could not be a graduate student. However, a professor in the Physics Department of Moscow University liked having Chinese graduate students and voluntarily offered to train this student for five years: helping him complete the university course in two and a half years, and the graduate course in two and a half years.

    Mastering Russian is the key for students to enter Soviet classrooms. Soviet teachers and students spare no effort in helping Chinese students obtain this key. Many schools hire special Russian teachers for newly arrived students, sometimes opening a class for just one person. An elderly female teacher at the Academy of Sciences' Institute, who teaches Russian to Chinese graduate students, lives in the countryside and takes a boat to teach the class each time. Once, it rained, and she missed the boat, walking ten kilometers to take the train, getting soaked all over. This selfless spirit encourages those learning Russian. A student studying in the Geology Department of Moscow University could hardly say a few words to Soviet classmates when he first enrolled. That evening, a Soviet classmate came to visit him and said, "I see you have difficulty speaking, and I am willing to help you." This student lived in the new Lenin Hills campus in the suburbs, while the Soviet classmate lived in the old campus in the city, making the long trip every other day to teach him to read newspapers, talk about Soviet life, revise notes, and help him review before exams. An old academician at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy is very busy, and many people seek him out, requiring them to wait in line. But he allowed Chinese students to see him out of turn. He revised the theses written by Chinese graduate students very carefully, correcting not only the content, but also the grammar and the capitalization of letters. Shop assistants near the Agricultural Academy also helped Chinese students correct grammatical errors when selling them things. In an environment where they receive instruction everywhere, Chinese students quickly lay a foundation in Russian, even though Russian, with its rich vocabulary and precise grammar, is a relatively difficult foreign language to master.

    The foundation of Soviet middle schools and universities is relatively high, and some Chinese students have not had the opportunity to formally complete middle school or university. After entering university or graduate school, many students have to go back and make up some courses, and many students cannot take notes when they first start listening to lectures. Many schools have opened special remedial classes for Chinese students, and many professors tutor Chinese students individually. A student studying in the Biology Department of Moscow University could not understand the lectures, so Soviet classmates organized themselves to help him, re-lecturing the course, but he still did not understand. The Soviet classmates clarified that the reason he did not understand was because his math foundation was poor, so before each re-lecture, they first explained the math problems in the course clearly. A student studying in the Geology Department of Moscow University could not remember specialized terms in paleontology, so the department sent a graduate student to listen to the lecture, write notes, and give them to the Chinese student to copy. The Communist Youth League organization of the Moscow Institute of Economics entrusted outstanding students to help Chinese students, copying notes for them. To make it easier for Chinese students to read, the handwriting was very clear, and each time it took three or four hours to copy. The Chinese students felt bad about this, but the Soviet students still scrambled to copy. In order for Chinese students to review well on Sundays, they finished the notes for Saturday's classes that very evening. The professor at the Institute of Economics explained the main terms in economic history during lectures to help Chinese students study Soviet economic history.

    Chinese students receive the same education as Soviet students in Soviet higher education institutions. Soviet schools teach the most advanced scientific knowledge, from theory to practice, to Soviet students, and also to Chinese students. Soviet professors and students like the Chinese students' studious attitude, but they also pay attention to their ideological development and physical health. A student studying at the Moscow Institute of Hydraulic Engineering designed roads too wide in a problem set. The professor pointed out: such a wide dimension would cause the state to pay 40 percent more funds; problem sets must be taken seriously; and the quality of valuing frugality must be cultivated at school. One professor told the students: If you make mistakes when you return to work in your country because you have not studied well, we are also responsible. Soviet professors are so conscientious and responsible, hoping that Chinese students will not only learn the knowledge in books, but also understand the spirit of Soviet socialist society. The Party Committee Secretary of the Moscow Petroleum Institute takes Chinese students on trips every summer vacation to increase their understanding of the Soviet Union. Soviet students at various schools often persuade Chinese students not to bury themselves in books all day long, and welcome them to actively participate in the school's social activities. Soviet professors and students care about the health of Chinese students, want them to pay attention to sports, take them to exercise, ice skate, ski, and give them convenience to go to sanatoriums and rest homes.

    When Chinese students leave school for internships, they also feel the warm friendship of the Soviet people everywhere. Several students from the Geological Institute went to the countryside about one hundred and sixty kilometers from Moscow to study loess. There were no hotels in the area, so they had to live in the homes of collective farm members. They planned to go to a few farm members' homes to see if there were any empty rooms. They went to the first house, which had two rooms. The owner was an old peasant woman who had a son and a foster girl. When she asked if they were Chinese and were going to live in the village for a month or so, she kept them in her house and insisted on giving up the inner room. After two hours of persuasion, she finally decided that her son and the Chinese students would live in the inner room. She took care of them every day as if they were her sons. The students were tired from their internships and did not eat much. The next day, rice porridge and scrambled eggs were placed on the table. Everyone was surprised. Later, one of the students remembered that he had said he liked to eat these two things in a casual conversation. After a long time, she sent her son to Moscow to invite the students to celebrate the New Year.

    It is in this way that Chinese students, under the caress of the noble internationalist friendship of Soviet schools and society, professors and students, are working hard to study, not disappointing the ardent expectations of the people of the motherland. They are as comfortable as if they were in their own country and are making rapid progress. This year, another group of students and graduate students will graduate, and more students will come to study.

    在崇高的友谊的爱抚下
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    从祖国来苏联学习的大学生和研究生一年年增多。现在苏联的十四个城市中有我国的留学生。在莫斯科的五十八个高等学校中，就有几百个我国留学生。他们初来时，差不多都听不懂课，饮食起居也不习惯。但是过了一年半载再见面时，他们的学习成绩很少不是五分，面包也吃惯了，和苏联同学也有说有笑了。要问什么力量在支持他们的努力，这就是祖国人民的殷望和苏联师友的爱抚。
    苏联的高等学校向中国留学生敞开着大门。著名的综合大学和专科学院的学生中，很少没有中国人的脸孔。许多学校的教职员和学生，都喜欢自己的学校、自己的科系有中国留学生，宁愿多花许多时间和精力来帮助他们。有一位留学生在国内没有修完大学，按他的程度是当不了研究生的。但是莫斯科大学的物理系教授很喜欢有中国研究生，他自愿培养这位留学生五年：帮助他两年半修完大学课程，两年半修完研究生课程。
    掌握俄文，这是留学生进入苏联课堂的钥匙。苏联师生对于帮助中国同学取得这个钥匙，是不遗余力的。许多学校为新来的留学生聘请了专门的俄文教员，有时为一个人开一班。在科学院研究所教中国研究生俄文的一位老年女教员，住在乡下，每次搭轮船来教课。有一次下雨，她没有赶上轮船，步行了十公里搭火车，全身都淋湿了。这种忘我的精神鼓励着学习俄文的人。在莫斯科大学地质系学习的一位留学生，入学时和苏联同学谈不上几句话。当晚有一位苏联同学来拜访他说：“我看你说话很吃力，我愿意帮助你。”这位留学生住在市郊列宁山新校，而那位苏联同学在市内旧校，老远地隔天去一次，教他读报，谈苏联生活，修改笔记，临考前帮助他复习功课。季米里雅泽夫农学院有一位老院士，工作很忙，找他的人很多，要排队。但他允许中国留学生越次找他。他对我国研究生写的论文，改得很仔细，不但内容，连文法和字母的大小写都修改。农学院附近的商店店员在卖东西给中国同学时也帮助他们纠正说话中的文法错误。在无处不得到教益的环境中，我国留学生较快地打下俄文基础，虽然俄文以其语汇的丰富和文法的精密，是较难掌握的外国语。
    苏联中学和大学的基础比较高，而我国留学生中有些人没有机会正规地念完大、中学。不少留学生进大学或研究班后必须回头来补修一些课程，不少留学生开始听讲时笔记不下来。许多学校为我国留学生开了特别补习班，许多教授对中国同学单独补课。在莫斯科大学生物系学习的一位留学生，听不懂课，苏联同学组织起来帮助他，把课重讲一遍，他还是不懂。苏联同学弄清他不懂的原因在于数学基础差，后来每次重讲前先把课程中的数学问题解释清楚。在莫斯科大学地质系学习的留学生，上古生物学时记不下专有名辞，系里派了一位研究生去听课，写好笔记给中国同学抄。莫斯科经济学院青年团组织委托了优等生来帮助中国同学，替中国同学抄写笔记。为了中国同学读起来方便，笔迹抄写得非常清楚，每抄写一次要花三、四个钟头。中国同学过意不去，苏联同学还是抢着抄。为了中国同学星期天好复习，星期六上的课当晚就把笔记赶出来了。经济学院的教授为了帮助中国同学学习苏联经济史，在讲课时把经济史上的主要术语都解释了。
    我国留学生在苏联高等学校受着和苏联学生一样的教育。苏联学校把最先进的科学知识，从理论到实际，教给苏联学生，也教给中国学生。苏联教授和同学很喜欢中国留学生的好学态度，但也注意他们的思想的发展和身体的健康。一位在莫斯科水利工程学院学习的留学生在做习题时，把道路设计得太宽了。教授指出：这样宽的尺寸会使国家多付百分之四十的经费；做习题要认真；在学校就要养成重视节约的品质。一位教授对留学生说：你们回国工作时如果因为没有学习好而犯了错误，我们也有责任。苏联教授就是这样认真负责地希望我国留学生不仅学取书本上的知识，而且领会苏联社会主义社会的精神。莫斯科石油学院的党委书记每年暑假带中国同学去旅行，以增进他们对苏联的认识。各学校的苏联学生经常说服中国同学不要整天抱着书本不放，欢迎他们积极地参加学校的社会活动。苏联教授和学生关心中国同学的身体，要中国同学重视体育，带他们运动、溜冰、滑雪，给他们到疗养所、休养所去的方便。
    我国留学生在离校实习时，也到处感受到苏联人民的温暖情谊。地质学院有几个留学生，到离莫斯科一百六十公里左右的乡下去研究黄土。当地没有旅馆，要住在集体农庄庄员的家里。他们打算进几户庄员家里看看有没有空房间。他们进了第一家，那里有两个房间，主人是一位老农妇，她有一个儿子和一个寄养的小女孩。她一问是中国人，要在庄上住个把月，就留他们住在她家，并且一定要让出内屋。让了两个钟头，最后决定她的儿子和留学生住在内屋。她每天像待儿子一样照顾他们。留学生们因为实习累了，吃得不多。第二天吃饭时，桌上摆好大米粥和炒鸡蛋。大家很惊奇。后来一位留学生想起他在闲谈时说过爱吃这两样东西。以后隔了好久，她还派了她的儿子到莫斯科来请留学生们去过年。
    我国留学生就是这样在苏联的学校和社会、教授和同学的崇高的国际主义的友谊的爱抚下，不辜负祖国人民的殷望努力地学习着。他们像在自己的祖国一样方便，进步很快。今年将又有一批留学生和研究生毕业，将有更多的留学生来学习。
