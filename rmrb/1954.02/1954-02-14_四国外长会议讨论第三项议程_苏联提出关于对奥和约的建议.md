(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 13th) The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference met on February 12th at the former Allied Control Council building, chaired by Bidault.

    The conference discussed the third agenda item, "The Question of the Austrian State Treaty." Chairman Bidault announced the opening of the meeting and invited the Austrian government delegation, led by Austrian Foreign Minister Figl, to enter the meeting hall.

    Figl delivered a speech at the meeting. In his speech, he first stated that the Austrian government requested to participate in the entire process of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference discussing the Austrian State Treaty. In his speech, Figl called on the four countries to conclude the Austrian State Treaty in order to rebuild a free and independent Austria. At the same time, he attempted to shirk the responsibility that Western countries and the Austrian ruling clique should bear for Austria's delayed restoration of freedom and independence.

    Figl's speech did not mention the so-called "Concise Treaty" draft of the Western countries. However, it was this draft that deliberately made it impossible for the four countries to reach an agreement on the Austrian issue because it left broad room for the restoration of fascist regimes in Austria and did not include clauses regarding the Soviet Union's economic interests in Austria. Figl demanded the revision of Clause 35 of the Austrian State Treaty draft, which had already been agreed upon, regarding the Soviet Union's economic interests in Austria, particularly Article 35. Article 35 stipulates that Austria should pay compensation to the Soviet Union to compensate for the German assets transferred to it. This article also stipulates that the Soviet Union has the right to exploit oil in Austria.

    After Figl's speech, Eden spoke. He agreed to allow the Austrian government to participate in the discussion. Eden said that the four countries participating in the conference all supported the realization of the Moscow Declaration of 1943 regarding Austria. Eden also supported Figl's request to revise Article 35 of the Austrian State Treaty draft, which the four countries had already agreed upon. Eden suggested that the four foreign ministers reach an agreement at this conference on the points in Articles 16, 27, 41, and 48(b), which are still outstanding, and study the Austrian delegation's request regarding Article 35 in order to complete the Austrian State Treaty.

    Molotov then spoke. He said that the Soviet government attaches great importance to the immediate resolution of the Austrian issue. The conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty based on the agreement reached by the four countries on the provisions of the Austrian State Treaty draft would enable Austria to be restored as a free and independent country. The Soviet government believes that it is abnormal for negotiations on the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty to have been held for seven years without reaching an agreement.

    Molotov pointed out that in 1949, the governments of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States had largely reached an agreement on the draft of the Austrian State Treaty. However, the unwillingness of the US, British, and French governments to study issues closely related to the future independence and freedom of Austria is a major obstacle to completing the preparation of the Austrian State Treaty. The Soviet government believes that the United States and Britain's transformation of the Free Territory of Trieste into a military base is unacceptable. In view of this, the Soviet government will do its best to prevent Austria from suffering the same fate.

    Molotov said that in March 1952, the US, British, and French governments unilaterally drafted the so-called "Concise Treaty," overturning the previous agreements reached by the four countries. The Austrian government even supported this draft, so the Austrian issue could not be resolved for a long time, and the Austrian government cannot shirk its responsibility.

    Molotov further pointed out that the Soviet Union cannot accept the "Concise Treaty" draft because, first, it ignores the democratic rights of the Austrian people unanimously stipulated by the four countries; second, it seriously infringes on the Soviet rights recognized by the US, British, and French governments in the Potsdam decisions. Now that the US, British, and French governments have withdrawn the "Concise Treaty" draft, the Soviet government believes that it is possible and necessary to make every effort to accelerate the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty.

    Molotov said that today it is entirely possible to restore Austria as an autonomous, independent, and democratic country. The Austrian State Treaty must pay special attention to ensuring the democratic and peaceful development of Austria as an independent country and must not allow Austria's manpower and resources to be used for foreign interests. A free, independent, and peaceful Austria will become an important stabilizing factor in the center of Europe, which will be a major contribution to consolidating European security.

    Molotov pointed out that when German militarism engaged in aggression in Europe in recent decades, it first dragged Austria into a military bloc against other European countries. This requires taking very effective measures to prevent West Germany from reattempting to annex Austria. The clauses of the Austrian State Treaty draft stipulate that the German State Treaty must ensure that Germany recognizes Austria's sovereignty and independence, prohibits Austria and Germany from forming political and economic alliances, and instructs Austria to cooperate with the Allies and participating countries to prevent Germany from rebuilding its armed forces outside German territory.

    Molotov said that the importance of the above-mentioned clauses is particularly clearly illustrated by the fact that the resurgent West German militarism has formed a major threat to Austria. Concluding a German State Treaty that can eliminate the revival of German militarism would provide the most important guarantee for Austria's existence as an independent and autonomous country. Once the German State Treaty is concluded, all these measures will no longer be necessary and will become superfluous.

    Molotov then welcomed Austrian Foreign Minister Figl to the meeting and pointed out that although Austria should be held responsible for fighting on the side of Hitler's Germany, the Soviet Union has not and does not intend to force Austria to assume any reparations obligations. As for Article 35 of the State Treaty draft, it only concerns former German assets in Austria, and even these assets will become Austrian property after the period stipulated in the treaty has passed.

    Molotov said that the Soviet Union's proposal to this conference for discussion, "Regarding the Conclusion of an Austrian State Treaty to Restore Austria as an Independent and Democratic Country," is based on these considerations. The content of the Soviet proposal is as follows:

     I.  Instruct the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Assistants to complete the final draft of the "Austrian State Treaty to Restore Austria as an Independent and Democratic Country" within three months, drafting it based on the following principles:

     A. Complete the drafting of the Austrian State Treaty draft that the four countries had basically agreed upon in 1949. This draft stipulates that Austria should be restored as an autonomous, independent, and democratic country, abolish the Four-Power Control, abolish the existing control agencies—the Allied Control Council for Austria and its subordinate agencies—and terminate the occupation of Austria.

     B. Include the following supplementary clauses in the Austrian State Treaty draft: "Austria shall guarantee not to participate in any alliance or military alliance aimed at opposing any country that sent troops to participate in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria.

     Austria shall also not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory, nor shall it use foreign military instructors and military experts to work in Austria."

     The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union shall abide by the provisions of this article.

     C. The Soviet government accepts the Austrian government's request and agrees that Austria shall repay the compensation for former German assets that should be paid to the Soviet Union as stipulated in Article 35 of the Austrian State Treaty draft in the form of goods.

     II. In order to prevent new German-Austrian merger conspiracies, postpone the withdrawal of the four countries' occupying forces in Austria until the German State Treaty is concluded.

     Simultaneous with the abolition of the Allied Control Council for Austria, all foreign troops should withdraw from Vienna.

     The four countries' troops temporarily remaining in Austria should no longer be called occupying forces and should not perform occupying tasks, nor should they interfere in Austria's internal affairs, social, and political life.

     The legal status of such troops shall be stipulated by a special agreement, which shall be jointly drafted by the four countries together with Austria and shall take effect simultaneously with the Austrian State Treaty.

     III. Instruct the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Assistants to discuss the Trieste issue in accordance with the Soviet government's proposal. The city of Trieste and its surrounding areas must not be used as military bases.

    Molotov concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation hopes that this Berlin conference will complete the resolution of the Austrian State Treaty issue. The Soviet proposal for resolving the Austrian State Treaty issue is of great significance for easing international tensions.

    After Molotov finished speaking, he submitted the full text of the Soviet delegation's proposal "Regarding the Conclusion of an Austrian State Treaty to Restore Austria as an Independent and Democratic Country" to the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the Austrian delegation.

    Following Molotov, Dulles spoke. He insisted that the Austrian State Treaty has not been concluded to this day due to the fault of the Soviet Union. Dulles said that the only obstacle to concluding the Austrian State Treaty is that a small part of the clauses of the treaty draft have not been agreed upon. However, he did not mention that it was precisely the governments of the United States, Britain, and France that had evaded discussing these unresolved clauses for many years, and later, after they put forward the so-called "Concise Treaty," it became fundamentally impossible to discuss the Austrian issue. Dulles expressed support for Eden's proposal. Dulles said that he would comment on the Soviet proposal later.

    Bidault then spoke, saying that the French delegation was willing to promote the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty. He also supported Eden's proposal. He added that he intended to discuss Molotov's proposal later.

    At the end of the meeting, Chairman Bidault said that the issue of the Austrian delegation's participation in the discussion must be resolved. Molotov suggested that the Austrian delegation participate in all meetings of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers discussing the Austrian issue. Molotov's suggestion was adopted.

    It was decided to continue the meeting on February 13 to discuss the Austrian issue.

    四国外长会议讨论第三项议程
    苏联提出关于对奥和约的建议
   【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林十三日讯：四国外长会议于二月十二日在前盟国管制委员会大厦开会，皮杜尔任主席。
    会议讨论第三项议程“关于对奥和约问题”。主席皮杜尔宣布会议开始，邀请由奥地利外长费格尔率领的奥地利政府代表团进入会场。
    费格尔在会上作了发言。他在发言中首先说，奥地利政府要求让它参加四国外长会议讨论对奥和约问题的整个过程。费格尔在发言中呼吁四国缔结对奥和约，以重建一个自由独立的奥地利。同时，他企图推卸西方国家和奥地利统治集团对于奥地利迟迟没有恢复自由和独立应负的责任。
    费格尔在发言中只字未提西方国家的所谓“简要条约”草案。然而，正是这个草案故意使得四国没有可能就奥地利问题达成协议。因为它给法西斯政权在奥地利的复辟留下了广泛的余地，并且没有包含关于苏联在奥经济利益的条款。费格尔要求修改对奥和约草案中已经获得协议的、关于苏联在奥地利的经济利益的条款，特别是第三十五条。第三十五条规定：奥地利应付给苏联补偿费，以补偿移交给它的德国资产。这一条并规定苏联在奥地利有开采石油权。
    费格尔发言后，艾登发言。他同意让奥地利政府参与讨论。艾登说，参加会议的四国都支持实现
  一九四三年的关于奥地利的莫斯科宣言。艾登同时赞成费格尔的要求，即修改四国已经取得协议的对奥和约草案第三十五条。艾登建议：四国外长在这次会议上就保留到今天的第十六、二十七、四十
  一、四十八（乙）条中的各点取得协议，并研究奥地利代表团关于第三十五条的要求，以便完成对奥和约。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。他说：苏联政府对于立即解决奥地利问题非常重视，根据四国就对奥和约草案的条文达成的协议缔结对奥和约，就会使奥地利恢复成为一个自由与独立的国家。苏联政府认为，就缔结对奥和约的问题举行谈判已达七年之久，而至今还没有达成协议，这种情况是不正常的。
    莫洛托夫指出：在一九四九年，苏、法、英、美四国政府已大体上就对奥和约草案获致协议，但是，美、英、法政府不愿研究与奥地利未来的独立和自由的命运有密切关系的问题，是完成准备对奥和约工作的一个主要障碍。苏联政府认为，美国和英国把的里雅斯特自由区变为军事基地，是不能容许的。有鉴于此，苏联政府要竭力不使奥地利遭遇同样的命运。
    莫洛托夫说：一九五二年三月，美、英、法政府片面草拟了所谓“简要条约”草案，推翻了四国以前获得的协议。而奥地利政府也居然支持这个草案，所以对奥和约问题迟迟不能解决，奥地利政府也不能推卸它的责任。
    莫洛托夫又指出：苏联不能接受“简要条约”草案，因为第一，它忽视了四国一致同意规定的奥地利人民的民主权利；第二，它严重侵犯了美、英、法政府在波茨坦决定中承认的苏联权利。现在，由于美、英、法政府已收回了“简要条约”草案，因此，苏联政府认为有可能而且有必要尽力加速缔结对奥和约。
    莫洛托夫说：今天有完全可能使奥地利恢复成为一个自主的、独立的和民主的国家。对奥和约必须特别注意保证奥地利作为一个独立国家的民主和平发展，不得利用奥地利的人力和物力为外国利益服务。自由的、独立的、和平的奥地利将成为欧洲中心的重要稳定因素，这将是对巩固欧洲安全的重大贡献。
    莫洛托夫指出：德国军国主义近几十年在欧洲从事侵略时，首先就是把奥地利拖入反对其他欧洲国家的军事集团。这要求采取十分有效的措施来防止西德重新企图合并奥地利。对奥和约草案的条款中规定要在对德和约中保证德国承认奥地利的主权和独立，禁止奥地利和德国结成政治和经济同盟，责成奥地利和盟国及参与国合作以防止德国在德国领土以外重建武装。
    莫洛托夫说：正在复活的西德军国主义已形成对奥地利的重大威胁，这一事实特别清楚地说明了上述条款的重要性。缔结一个能排除德国军国主义复活的对德和约，就可以为使奥地利作为一个独立自主的国家存在提供最重要的保证。一旦缔结了对德和约，所有这些措施就没有必要和成为多余了。
    莫洛托夫接着表示欢迎奥地利外交部部长费格尔参加会议，并指出：虽然奥地利应对它站在希特勒德国一边作战负责，但苏联在过去和现在都没有强要奥地利承担任何赔偿义务。至于和约草案的第三十五条，也只是关于奥境前德国资产方面的，而在条约所规定的期限过去之后，甚至这笔资产也将成为奥地利的财产。
    莫洛托夫说：苏联要提交这次会议讨论的“关于缔结使奥地利恢复成为一个独立、民主的国家的对奥和约”的建议就是根据我所提出的这些考虑出发的，苏联建议的内容如下：
      一、指令四国外长助理会议在三个月内把“使奥地利恢复成为一个独立、民主的国家的对奥和约”的最后草案草拟完毕，起草时应从下列原则出发：
    甲、完成一九四九年四国已基本上同意的对奥和约草案的起草工作，这个草案规定，奥地利应恢复成为一个自主、独立和民主的国家，取消四国管制，取消现有的管制机构——盟国对奥管制委员会及其所属各机构，并终止对奥的占领。
    乙、将下列补充条款列入对奥和约草案：“奥地利应保证不参加任何旨在反对任何派遣军队参加对德战争和解放奥地利的战争的国家的联盟和军事同盟。
    奥地利也不得允许在其领土上建立外国军事基地，不得利用外国军事教官和军事专家在奥地利工作。”
    美国、联合王国、法国、苏联四国政府应遵守本款的规定。
    丙、苏联政府接受奥地利政府的要求，同意奥地利以商品来偿付对奥和约草案第三十五条所规定的应向苏联偿付的抵偿前德国资产的款项。
    二、为了防止新的德奥合并阴谋，延期撤退四国在奥地利的占领军队，直到对德和约缔结为止。
    与撤消盟国对奥管制委员会同时，一切外国军队应撤离维也纳。
    暂时留在奥地利的四国军队不应再称为占领军并不得执行占领任务，不得干涉奥地利的内政、社会与政治生活。
    此种部队的法律地位，应由特别协定规定之，该协定应由四国会同奥地利共同拟定，并与对奥和约同时开始生效。
    三、指令四国外长助理会议按照苏联政府的建议，讨论的里雅斯特问题。不得利用的里雅斯特市及其附近地区作为军事基地。
    莫洛托夫最后说：苏联代表团希望这次柏林会议完成解决对奥和约问题，苏联提出的解决对奥和约问题的办法，对于缓和国际紧张局势有着重大意义。
    莫洛托夫发言完毕后，即将苏联代表团的“关于缔结使奥地利恢复成为一个独立、民主的国家的对奥和约”的建议全文提交法、英、美三国外长以及奥地利代表团。
    继莫洛托夫之后，杜勒斯发言。他硬说，对奥和约至今没有缔结，是苏联的过失。杜勒斯说，缔结对奥和约的唯一障碍是：条约草案的一小部分条款没有取得协议。但是他却只字不提这件事：正是美、英、法三国政府多年以来逃避讨论这些没有取得一致意见的条款，而后来它们提出所谓“简要条约”后，更使得根本无法讨论奥地利问题。杜勒斯表示支持艾登提出的建议。杜勒斯表示以后再对苏联建议发表意见。
    皮杜尔接着发言说，法国代表团愿意促进对奥和约的缔结。他也支持艾登的建议。他又说，他打算以后再谈莫洛托夫的建议。
    会议结束时，主席皮杜尔说，必须解决奥地利代表团参与讨论的问题。莫洛托夫建议让奥地利代表团参加四外长讨论奥地利问题的一切会议。莫洛托夫的建议被通过。
    决定二月十三日继续开会讨论奥地利问题。
