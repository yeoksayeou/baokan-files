North China, East China, and Central and South China People Enthusiastically Subscribe to Public Bonds
[Our Newspaper] After being educated on the general line of the state's transition period, people from all walks of life in North China enthusiastically subscribed to national economic construction bonds. In Beijing and Tianjin, the bond subscription work has concluded. Beijing's subscription amount reached 152.8% of the expected figure; Tianjin's subscription amount reached 136.92% of the expected figure. Subscribers are now paying their money into the treasury. Cities such as Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Handan, Xuanhua, Tangshan, and Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province have also fully launched subscriptions. Zhangjiakou's subscription figure in early February exceeded the expected figure by 86.2%; in Handan, as of February 15, the city's subscription figure exceeded the expected figure by 33.9%. The subscription figure for staff and workers in organs and factories in Taiyuan exceeded the expected figure by 21.5%.

In subscribing to national economic construction bonds, people from all walks of life demonstrated a high degree of patriotism. The broad masses of workers and public employees took the lead in subscribing. Many factories, mines, organs, and schools completed their subscriptions in one or two days, or in three to five hours. Many workers, shop assistants, and cadres used their savings that they had planned to use for radios or watches, and money saved from wedding expenses, to purchase public bonds.

Peasants in various places, especially those participating in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, also enthusiastically subscribed to public bonds, as they recognized that only national industrialization could more quickly improve agricultural production. Farmers in 39 townships in Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, subscribed to more than 200 million yuan in public bonds; 44 members of the Li Youwang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Wuxiang County, subscribed to 3.2 million yuan in public bonds. The Guo Shunxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Baoding City, Hebei Province, had a bumper vegetable harvest last year. All members of the cooperative enthusiastically subscribed to public bonds. In half a day, all 22 households in the cooperative subscribed to 8.85 million yuan. The subscription situation among industrial and commercial circles and urban residents was also very enthusiastic.

Currently, many large and medium-sized cities in the region have exceeded their expected subscription figures and are entering the payment stage. General county towns and the vast countryside are enthusiastically subscribing.
[Our Newspaper] The work of people in various parts of East China subscribing to national economic construction bonds began gradually in late January. At present, some cities have basically completed the subscription work and have begun making payments.

Workers and peasants in various parts of East China are enthusiastically subscribing to public bonds. 1.4 million workers in Shanghai have begun subscribing to the 1954 national economic construction bonds. By the 22nd, more than 30 factories had completed their subscriptions. These units completed their subscriptions in two or three days. The workers' enthusiasm for raising funds for national industrialization is extremely high. Huang Fulin, a worker at the Dalong Machinery Factory, heard the news of the issuance of national bonds at the end of last year and deposited his surplus money in the bank. When bond subscriptions began, he immediately bought 500,000 yuan and paid the full amount. The Yi Shijuan production team of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, with 34 members, subscribed to more than 10 million yuan. While filling out the subscription forms, they discussed the prospects of the motherland's industrial construction. They said: Most of the machines in our factory are made in Japan. These machines look good but are not very useful. In the future, the large factories we build will all use our own machines to spin and weave cloth. Liang Shimin, a model worker in the industry, visited the countryside as part of a Shanghai worker delegation during the Spring Festival this year. The warm reception from the peasants and their eagerness for the worker brothers to produce more water pumps, sprayers, and new-style farm implements deeply moved him. He said: "In addition to actively increasing production, I will also purchase public bonds to the best of my ability to accelerate the speed of industrial construction and meet the needs of the peasant brothers." Ning Jintang, a worker at the Huafeng Paper Mill, had saved 5 million yuan in the bank in the years since liberation. This time, he took it out to buy public bonds. His family said that the bank interest was high and the bond interest was low, but he said that the "interest" brought by the successful construction of a socialist society would be too great to calculate.

When the subscription for public bonds began at the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui, Fang Shiliang, a surface transport worker, took out the money he had planned to buy a clock and bought public bonds instead. Zhou Guoxiang, a member of the Zheng Shengui Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Group in Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, personally experienced the benefits of the People's Government's construction of water conservancy projects and the issuance of agricultural loans. He realized that the improvement of life was inseparable from the construction of the country. He said: "Our peasants support national industrialization, and the benefits that industrialization will bring to our peasants in the future will be inexhaustible. I will definitely purchase public bonds to the best of my ability."

From January 20th to 23rd, staff members of the Shandong Province and Jinan City-level organs subscribed to public bonds exceeding the expected sales figure by 120%. The public bonds subscribed to by staff members of the Fujian Province-level organs exceeded the expected figure by more than three times. The work of staff members of the Fuzhou City organs subscribing to public bonds was basically completed on February 11, and the actual subscription figure exceeded the expected figure by more than 60%. The work of staff members of the Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City-level organs subscribing to public bonds has also been basically completed. The number of public bonds subscribed to by staff members of the provincial-level organs exceeded the expected figure by 5.5 times. Now, the staff members of the provincial and municipal organs are actively preparing to make payments and strive to pay them off in advance. Other regions and units that have not yet completed the subscription work are enthusiastically subscribing. Wu Deming, a cadre of the Hangzhou City XiaCheng District Work Committee of the Communist Youth League, took out more than 6 million yuan stored in the bank to buy public bonds. He said: "The interests of national industrialization are consistent with individual interests. I should contribute as much as I can to support national construction." Urban residents and industrialists and businessmen are also actively subscribing to public bonds.
[Our Newspaper] People in various parts of Central and South China are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1954 national economic construction bonds. The work of staff members of various units in the financial, trade, and industrial systems in Guangzhou, and the vast majority of organs and schools of the Central and South China Grand Administrative Region stationed in Guangzhou subscribing to public bonds has been basically completed, and all have exceeded the expected figures. According to preliminary statistics, the public bonds subscribed to by staff members of the Guangzhou financial system reached 144.1% of the expected figure; the trade system reached 186.3% of the expected figure; and the industrial system reached 165.8% of the expected figure. Workers in various factories showed great enthusiasm in subscribing, fully demonstrating the patriotism of the working masses. The work of promoting public bonds in various factories has now ended. Except for the South China Agricultural College and the South China Normal College, which have not completed their subscriptions due to the holiday, 19 units, including the Guangzhou District Committee of the China Railway Workers' Union, the Guangzhou Post Office, the Telecommunications Bureau, and the Electric Power Bureau, had subscribed to 5.03842 billion yuan as of February 18, reaching 160.9% of the expected figure.

As of February 18, the subscription figure for industrial and commercial circles in Guangzhou had reached 60.441 billion yuan. Many industrialists and businessmen, after studying the general line of the state during the transition period, realized that purchasing public bonds is supporting national economic construction and is a concrete manifestation of patriotism; they realized that purchasing public bonds is beneficial to the country and also beneficial to themselves, so they enthusiastically subscribed. Wang Yuanxing of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Co., Ltd. and the company's shareholders initially subscribed to 2.9 billion yuan. Wang Yuanxing said: "Our enterprise is a joint state-private enterprise, and it made a lot of profit last year. After the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the regulations on the 1954 national economic construction bonds, the shareholders expressed their desire to enthusiastically purchase public bonds." The Guangdong Heji Flashlight Factory in the battery industry earned 2.4 billion yuan in profit last year, and the factory representative Han Liji also subscribed to 700 million yuan and actively promoted it to other industrial and commercial households. The Municipal Industrial and Commercial Circles Public Bond Promotion Committee is further carrying out publicity and mobilization work.

After studying the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan have generally launched a wave of enthusiasm for subscribing to public bonds. Sixteen townships in Huiji District, four townships including Heping, Yong'an, Folin, and Nanmu in Nanhu District, and four townships including Guanyuan, Hudong, Moshan, and Luxiang in Donghu District have now basically completed the subscription work. Zhu Tai Township in Huiji District was scheduled to subscribe to 12.6 million yuan, and has now completed about 20 million yuan; Guanyuan Township, Hudong, and Moshan Townships in Donghu District have also oversubscribed by 20% to 30%.
