The Chengdu-Aba Highway in Sichuan Province has opened to traffic from Xuecheng Town in Li County to Shanjiao Dam, with a total of 288 kilometers now open. A ceremony was held in Xuecheng Town on the 11th to celebrate the opening of the new section. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Sichuan Provincial People's Government, and the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government all sent representatives to offer congratulations.

The Chengdu-Aba Highway is 526 kilometers long. The overall survey work began in 1950, and construction officially started in March 1951. It opened to traffic to Xuecheng Town last March. Last April, work began on the most difficult section of the entire line – the section from Xuecheng Town to Matang. This section of the highway stretches along the turbulent Zagunao River, through high mountains and deep valleys with an average altitude of 3,000 meters above sea level, and passes through the uninhabited Zhegu Mountain at an altitude of 4,300 meters. The roadbed and pavement engineering for the 109-kilometer section from Xuecheng Town to Shanjiao Dam was completed in January of this year; the roadbed engineering for the 30.9-kilometer section from Shanjiao Dam to Matang is also basically completed.

The Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region has overlapping mountains and extremely inconvenient transportation. In the past, the famous medicinal materials and local products abundant in the area could not be exported in large quantities, and the supply of industrial products was also very difficult. The Chengdu-Aba Highway is the only highway in the area, and after it opens to traffic, it will stimulate the exchange of goods and greatly change the face of the autonomous region.

    四川成阿公路通车到山脚坝
    四川省成（都）阿（坝）公路由理县薛城镇通车到山脚坝，全线已通车二百八十八公里。十一日薛城镇举行了新线通车典礼。中国共产党四川省委员会、四川省人民政府、四川省藏族自治区人民政府都派代表前往祝贺。
    成阿公路全长五百二十六公里，从一九五零年就开始全线的勘测工作，一九五一年三月正式开工，去年三月通车到薛城镇。去年四月开始了全线最艰巨的一段——薛城镇到马塘的工程。这段公路沿着汹涌的杂谷脑河，在平均拔海三千公尺的高山深谷间向前伸展，并经过拔海四千三百公尺的人迹罕到的鹧鸪山。薛城镇到山脚坝长一百零九公里的路基路面工程，于今年一月全部竣工；山脚坝到马塘三十点九公里的路基工程，也已基本完工。
    四川省藏族自治区境内山岭重叠，交通十分不便。过去境内盛产的著名药材和土特产品无法大量输出，工业品的供应也很困难。成阿公路是境内唯一的公路，通车后将会活跃物资交流，大大改变自治区的面貌。　（据新华社讯）
