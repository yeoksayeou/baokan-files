Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The first National Congress of Members of the China Geological Society was held in Beijing from the 11th to the 14th.

    After discussion, the congress clearly defined the society's task as: uniting geological workers nationwide to engage in academic research, exchange academic experiences, and serve the country's economic and cultural construction. The congress adopted the society's new constitution, elected a seventeen-member council, discussed the society's work guidelines for the immediate future, and formulated a work plan for 1954.

    More than 30 people attended the meeting, including representatives from the General Society and various regions, and specially invited representatives Li Siguang, Sun Yunzhu, Huang Jiqing, Tian Qijun, and Xie Jiarong. Song Ying, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, and Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were also invited to attend.

    At the opening ceremony of the congress on the 11th, Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Song Ying, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government, both delivered speeches. Wu Youxun first affirmed the achievements of geological workers in the past few years since liberation and further called on geological workers across the country to strive to study and create, explore the country's underground resources, cultivate outstanding geological cadres for the country, and victoriously complete the glorious task of the country's socialist industrialization. In his speech, Song Ying emphasized the close relationship between geological workers and national socialist industrialization, and expressed the hope that geological workers, facing heavy tasks and limited resources, would conduct creative labor with a scientific attitude, based on the needs of national construction and the requirements of the development of geological science itself. He specifically pointed out that the work that geological workers should do during the transition period is: to discover and explore mineral resources in large quantities, to prepare for the country's water conservancy projects and other engineering constructions, and to gradually strengthen scientific research work and cultivate new forces in large quantities.

    In the afternoon of the 11th, Li Siguang gave a special lecture entitled "Vortex Structure and Other Composite Problems Related to the Northwest Geotectonic System." From the 12th to the 14th, three consecutive academic discussion meetings were held on the topics: "Types of Chinese Coalfields and Geotectonic Problems," "Metallogenic Regularities and Prospecting Problems of Copper and Chromium," and "Geological Problems of the Upper Yellow River."

    Li Siguang gave a summary report at the end of the congress. After summarizing the gains of the congress, he called on geological workers to better cooperate with national construction and exert potential strength to complete their glorious tasks under the guidance of the general line and with the close care and guidance of relevant departments.

    After the closing of the congress, the Council of the China Geological Society held a meeting at 4 pm on the 14th, and mutually elected Li Siguang, Song Ying, Hou Defeng, Sun Yunzhu, and Wang Hongzhen to form the Standing Council, and elected Li Siguang as Chairman.
