    American Special Agents Abroad
    Uninvited Guests in Nepal
    Recently, a large number of American spies, under the guise of so-called "missionaries" and "experts" of various kinds, have infiltrated Nepal. The American intelligence organization, the United States Information Service, has established so-called "cultural" strongholds in Nepal in order to establish close ties with them. These "missionaries" usually specialize in "visiting" strategic locations in Nepal, and they are now active in the Terai region of southern Nepal.
    According to Michael Mansfield, an American official who returned to Washington from Nepal last November, the US government is now "trying to help" Nepal move towards the "free world." However, the Nepalese people oppose this "help," and the leaders of nine political parties have lodged serious protests against this American "help."
    It seems that the United States is really finding it a case of "'loving' Nepal but unable to 'help' it."
    Going Beyond the Scope of "Aid"
    According to a TASS report from Beirut on December 2nd of last year, many members of parliament exposed the subversive schemes of American agents in Lebanon at a meeting of the Lebanese parliament on December 1st of last year. Member of Parliament Ajib Furzli said: American personnel implementing the so-called "Point Four Program" have gone beyond the scope of "aid" and are engaged in "espionage reconnaissance activities." Member of Parliament Naim Gatri said: "When we know the bad intentions of the agency implementing the 'Point Four Program,' shouldn't we abolish the agreements concluded under the 'Point Four Program' that violate our national interests?"
    Furzli discovered that the agency implementing the so-called Truman "Point Four Program" in Lebanon had built very deep reinforced concrete underground structures in the Turbul area. He said: These buildings, apart from being "undoubtedly ammunition depots for storing weapons and ammunition," "cannot be used for other purposes."
    Regardless of whether the agreement can be abolished, these American personnel, who are "easy to invite but difficult to send away," are like what Kashmir Prime Minister Muhammad said: "Once they have gained a foothold, it is difficult to drive them away."
    "Insurance Merchants" in Sydney
    According to a report in the Sydney "Tribune" on November 18th of last year, special agents from the US "Central Intelligence Agency" headquarters in Sydney often disguise themselves as insurance merchants, installment collectors, and rent collectors to carry out espionage activities. They not only spy on trade union activities, but also spy on ball games, chess games, and various programs at workers' clubs. They sometimes also dress up as salesmen traveling in the suburbs, asking and spying door-to-door.
    This is of course a kind of "American way of life," but how incompatible it is with the lives of people in other countries!
    The "United Fruit Company" indeed
    According to a United Press International dispatch from Guatemala City on January 29th, the Guatemalan government revealed a case of sabotage by American agents in a statement on January 29th. The US government has used its so-called "United Fruit Company" in Guatemala to recruit a large number of frustrated Guatemalan politicians, such as the defeated presidential candidate Idígoras Fuentes and the political exile Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas, to use them to carry out "fifth column" activities and organize armed coups. In addition, this "company" is also colluding with Anastasio Somoza, the president of Nicaragua. Somoza promised to train troops for this American intelligence organization so that they could coordinate attacks from the air and along the Pacific coast to overthrow the current government of Guatemala.
    In its statement, the Guatemalan government said that it had captured a group of politicians and so-called freelancers who opposed the government, and that the intercepted letters from the conspirators to Somoza were sufficient to prove the American espionage case.
    Three days after this statement was issued (January 31st), the US State Department was again trying to quibble: "The policy of the United States is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries." However, it did not mention a word about the various facts exposed by Guatemala. (Attached picture)
    Newspaper message: American and British monopoly capitalists spend money to support terrorists, provocateurs, and spies to carry out sabotage activities against peace and socialist countries. Drawing by Soviet Abramov
    Following the instructions of various "figures,"
    Billions of dollars are spent,
    To support intelligence agents,
    Equip murderers.
    Whether it's selling out or assassination,
    The bandits don't want to work for nothing.
    But the people's plans cannot be destroyed,
    Whether it's with pounds or dollars.

    美国特务在国外
    尼泊尔的不速之客
    最近，大批美国间谍分子，在所谓“传教士”和“专家”等种种不同名目的掩护下，纷纷渗入尼泊尔。美国的特务组织——美国新闻处，为了与他们建立密切联系，已在尼泊尔建立了所谓“文化”据点。这些“传教士”平日专门“访问”尼泊尔的战略地点，他们现在已活动到尼泊尔南部地区特雷了。
    据去年十一月从尼泊尔回到华盛顿的美国官员迈克尔·曼斯菲尔德说，美国政府现在正“设法帮助”尼泊尔到“自由世界”方面来。但是，尼泊尔人民却反对这种“帮助”，现在已有九个政党的领袖，对美国的这种“帮助”提出了严重的抗议。
    看样子，美国对尼泊尔真有点“‘爱’莫能‘助’”了。
    越出“援助”范围
    据塔斯社贝鲁特去年十二月二日电讯报道，在去年十二月一日召开的黎巴嫩议会会议上，许多议员揭露了美国特务在黎巴嫩的破坏阴谋。议员阿吉布·弗尔兹利说：执行所谓“第四点计划”的美国人员，已越出“援助”的范围，进行“间谍侦察活动”了。议员纳伊姆·伽特里说：“当我们知道执行‘第四点计划’的机构的不良意图以后，难道我们不应当废除根据‘第四点计划’缔结的违背我们国家利益的协定吗？”
    弗尔兹利曾发现，在黎巴嫩执行所谓杜鲁门“第四点计划”的机构，已在土尔包尔区建筑了很深的钢筋混凝土地下建筑物。他说：这些建筑物除去“毫无疑问储藏武器弹药的军需库”外，“不可能利用这些建筑物作为其他用途”。
    不管协定能不能废除，这些“好请难送”的美国人员却像克什米尔总理穆罕默德说过的：“一旦他们取得了一个据点后，便很难把他们赶走”。
    悉尼的“保险商人”
    据悉尼“论坛报”去年十一月十八日消息，美国“中央情报局”悉尼总部的特务们经常扮作保险商人、分期付款收款人和收房租的人进行特务勾当，他们不仅侦察工会活动，而且侦察球类比赛、奕棋以及工人俱乐部的各种节目。他们有时还装扮成推销员在郊区旅行，挨户询问和侦察。
    这当然是“美国生活方式”的一种，但它与其他国家人民的生活是多么不能相容！
    如此“联合水果公司”
    据合众社危地马拉城一月二十九日电讯报道，危地马拉政府在一月二十九日的声明中，揭露了一件美国特务的破坏案件。美国政府曾利用它在危地马拉的所谓“联合水果公司”，网罗了大批危地马拉的失意政客，如落选的总统候选人伊迪戈拉斯·弗恩特斯和政治流亡者卡尔洛斯·卡斯蒂略·阿拉斯上校等，利用他们进行“第五纵队”的活动，组织武装政变。另外，这家“公司”还与尼加拉瓜的总统安纳斯塔肖·索摩查勾结着。索摩查答应给这个美国特务组织训练军队，以便从空中和沿太平洋配合进攻，推翻危地马拉现政府。
    危地马拉政府在声明中说，它已捕获了一批反对政府的政客和所谓自由职业者，已截获的阴谋分子给索摩查的信件，足以证明美国的特务案件。
    当这个声明发表后的第三天（一月三十一日），美国国务院又在进行狡赖了：“美国的政策是不干涉其他国家的内政”。但是，它对被危地马拉揭露出来的种种事实，却只字不提。（附图片）

    按照各色“人物”的指示，
    花了金钱亿万，
    去豢养间谍分子，
    装备杀人犯。
    出卖也好，暗杀也好，
    匪徒们总不愿白干。
    但人民的计划破坏不了，
    不论用英镑还是美元。
