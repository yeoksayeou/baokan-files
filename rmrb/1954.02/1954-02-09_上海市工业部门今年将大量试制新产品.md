Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In 1954, Shanghai will produce more in every minute than last year: over 80 kilograms more steel, over 30 more suits' worth of cotton cloth, over 11 and a half more pairs of rubber shoes, over two more boxes of soap and scented soap, over 40 more kilograms of paper, and nearly 16 more fountain pens; every hour will see an increase of over four automobile tires and seven bicycles compared to last year; every day will see the production of one more metal cutting machine tool than last year. These are the summary figures derived from the preliminary production plans determined by Shanghai's various industrial departments.

This year, Shanghai's industrial task of supporting national construction is even more arduous than last year. Heavy industrial factories will manufacture more machinery and construction materials for the 141 projects being assisted by the Soviet Union and other basic construction projects. In the first quarter alone, Shanghai will supply Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel) with over one hundred different specifications of cables. The Shanghai branch of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company has commissioned Shanghai factories to process 400 tons more welding rods in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year.

In order to equip China's emerging industries and transportation sector, Shanghai's state-owned and joint state-private machinery, electrical machinery, and shipbuilding factories initially plan to trial-produce over 130 new products this year. Four factories are jointly manufacturing China's largest complete set of Czech-style 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine power generating equipment, the electricity generated from which is sufficient to power the lighting of a city with a population of 300,000. Shipbuilding factories, which have mainly focused on ship repair for many years, will manufacture a batch of passenger and cargo ships for river and sea navigation this year.

Currently, some factories in Shanghai are working hard to rush-produce a batch of agricultural irrigation machinery. In the first quarter of last year, the joint state-private Shanghai Machine Factory rushed to manufacture 27 water pumps for the Erling electric irrigation area in Danyang, Jiangsu Province. In the first quarter of this year, they have received orders for another 77 water pumps from the same area. The workers have decided to complete all of these orders before April 15, ensuring that the farming brothers in the Erling area, who are preparing to organize production cooperatives, can draw water for irrigation in a timely manner. Shanghai's large-scale electrical machinery factories and power machinery factories have also begun to manufacture agricultural machinery. This year, the state-owned Shanghai Electrical Machinery Factory will trial-produce ten types of small AC generators and induction motors to meet the needs of agricultural production. A portion of these will begin to be manufactured in large quantities in the second quarter. This year, the Shanghai branch of the China National Hardware and Machinery Company will organize many hardware factories to manufacture thirty to forty types of production tools for rural areas. Last year, the cotton cloth woven and dyed in Shanghai could supply over 330 million people with new clothing, and this year it can supply approximately 30 million more suits' worth of clothing material than last year.

Shanghai's light industry, which supplies the entire country with over ten thousand kinds of daily necessities, will further unleash its production potential in 1954. The output of famous fountain pens such as "Huafu," "Guanleming," "Xinhua," and "Jiefang," produced by four local state-owned and joint state-private fountain pen factories this year, will be doubled compared to last year. This year, the output of bamboo-shell thermos bottles, enamelware, scented soap, rubber shoes, towels, bed sheets, underwear, socks, and other products throughout the city will increase accordingly. The planned total output value of the state-owned and joint state-private pharmaceutical and medical equipment industries will be doubled compared to last year. The output of obstetrical surgical instruments suitable for rural areas will be doubled compared to last year. The supply of important medical equipment such as X-ray machines, shadowless lamps, sun lamps, and shortwave electrotherapy equipment to healthcare institutions in industrial and mining enterprises and basic construction units will be increased significantly.

    上海市工业部门今年将大量试制新产品
    据新华社讯：一九五四年，上海的每一分钟将要比去年多炼八十多公斤钢，多织三十多套衣服的棉布，多做十一双半胶鞋，多出两箱肥皂和香皂，多造四十多公斤的纸和将近十六支金笔；每一小时将要比去年增产四只多汽车外胎和七辆自行车；每一天将要比去年多造一台多金属切削机床。这些都是从上海各工业部门初步确定的生产计划中得来的概要数字。
    今年，上海工业支援国家建设的任务比去年更加繁重了。重工业工厂将要为苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一项工程和其他基本建设工程制造更多的机器和建筑器材。在第一季度里，上海就要供给鞍钢一百多种不同规格的电缆。中国五金机械公司上海分公司第一季度委托上海工厂加工的电焊条，比去年第四季度多四百吨。
    为了装备我国的新兴工业和运输业，今年上海国营和公私合营机械、电机、船舶工厂，初步计划试制一百三十多种新产品。有四家工厂正在联合制造我国最大的捷克式全套六千瓩汽轮发电设备，它发出的电力足供一个三十万人的城市照明用电。多年来以修船为主要业务的造船工厂，今年将制造一批供江海航行的客货轮船。
    目前，上海有一部分工厂正在紧张地赶制一批农业灌溉机器。公私合营上海机器厂去年第一季度曾为江苏省丹阳珥陵电力灌溉区赶造了二十七部水泵，今年第一季度又接到了该区七十七部水泵的定货。这批定货，工人们决定在四月十五日前全部完成，保证正在准备组织生产合作社的珥陵区农民兄弟能及时引水灌溉。上海的大型电机厂、动力机厂也开始制造农业机械了。国营上海电机厂今年要试制十种小型的交流发电机和感应电动机，供应农业生产的需要。其中一部分在第二季就要开始大量制造。中国五金机械公司上海分公司今年要组织许多五金工厂为农村制造三四十种生产工具。去年上海织染的棉布可以供给三亿三千多万人每人添做一套新衣，今年还可以比去年多供应约三千多万套的衣料。
    以上万种生活日用品供应全国的上海轻工业，一九五四年将进一步发挥它的生产潜力。四家地方国营和公私合营金笔厂今年生产的“华孚”、“关勒铭”、“新华”、“解放”等著名金笔的产量，将比去年提高一倍。今年全市竹壳热水瓶、搪瓷、香皂、胶鞋、毛巾、被单、内衣、袜子等等产品的产量，都将相应地增加。国营和公私合营医药、医疗器械工业，今年的计划生产总值比去年增加一倍。适用于农村的产科手术器械的产量，将比去年增加两倍。供应给工矿企业和基本建设单位保健机构的爱克斯光机、无影灯、太阳灯、短波电疗等重要医疗器械，都将增加很多。
