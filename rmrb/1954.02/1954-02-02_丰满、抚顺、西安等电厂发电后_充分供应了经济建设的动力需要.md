Following the commencement of power generation at the Fengman Hydroelectric Station (featuring two giant hydro-turbine generators) and the Fushun, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and Dihua power plants, all of which were newly built or renovated with Soviet assistance as part of the 141 projects, our nation's electricity production capacity has significantly increased. These power plants guarantee the power needs of industrial production in their respective regions and drive industrial construction forward.

Following the commissioning of new generators at Fengman and Fushun between April and August of last year, combined with the power from the Fuxin Power Station, which had already begun generating electricity at the end of 1952, a massive flow of electricity was created, significantly increasing the power supply of the Northeast Power Grid. The power generated by the newly installed generators at these three facilities is equivalent to the electricity needed to smelt 870,000 tons of steel, mine 56 million tons of coal, or weave 170 million bolts of cloth. If used for lighting, it could meet the electricity needs of seven cities the size of Shenyang. In 1953, this electricity was fully supplied to the Three Great Projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, as well as industrial production and residential use.

The new generator installed at the Xi'an No. 2 Power Plant officially began generating electricity in October of last year, and its power output is approximately half of the total power generation in the entire Northwest region. Together with the existing power in Xi'an, it forms a unified power grid, ensuring a sufficient supply of electricity for the state-owned Northwest No. 1 and No. 2 Cotton Textile Factories, the local state-owned Xi'an Cotton Textile Factory, and the printing and dyeing factory. The Northwest No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, a new state-owned enterprise in the Northwest region, is scheduled to go into production in the first half of this year, and several new factories will be built in the Northwest this year. These units will be able to receive a sufficient supply of electricity.

After a generator at the state-owned Zhengzhou Thermal Power Plant began generating electricity, it was connected to the old power plant, ensuring that factories in Zhengzhou could smoothly complete their production increase and thrift campaigns. In the first quarter of this year, another generator at the state-owned Zhengzhou Thermal Power Plant continued to generate electricity. Its total equipment capacity is equivalent to sixteen times that of the Zhengzhou Power Plant when it was liberated in 1948, and three times the current power of the Zhengzhou Power Plant. It can supply the production of 200,000 spindles and 10,000 looms. Soon, this power plant will also be connected to the power grids of important cities and industrial and mining areas in western and northern Henan to meet the needs of industrial development in various regions.

The Dihua Power Plant is the first automated thermal power plant in Xinjiang Province, and its power generation capacity is 1.4 times the total power of the existing power in Xinjiang. The completion of the Dihua Power Plant will reduce the cost of industrial electricity in the city by 46% and the price of residential lighting electricity by 33%. After the Dihua Power Plant generates electricity, the number of spindles and looms at the Xinjiang "July 1st" Cotton Textile Factory will increase by 87.5%. The flour industry production in the entire city of Dihua will also increase threefold. The production of the Dihua Cement Plant in 1954 can be increased by about two times compared to 1953. Many machines in factories and mines in Dihua that could not be turned on in the past due to lack of power, as well as all machines powered by human labor, are now using electricity. More than 1,000 handicraft industries in Dihua can also use electricity to develop production. Yu Suf, a Uygur handicraft worker in the city, who had long used bellows to blow iron furnaces, has now switched to using electric blowers, which not only saves a labor force but also increases output by 40%. After the private Jianxin Iron Factory received power from the Dihua Power Plant, it specially ordered an eight-foot lathe from Guan Nei (the interior of China). The Dihua Flour Mill, which is about to start production, was previously concerned about the lack of sufficient power and the project was progressing slowly. When they learned that the Dihua Power Plant could supply sufficient power, they became anxious and completed the construction of the transformer substation one and a half days ahead of schedule. Tursun, a Uygur worker at the repair shop of the state-owned Xinjiang Provincial Transportation Company, said, "After the Dihua Power Plant generates electricity, our production will definitely increase greatly. This is a great joy that Chairman Mao has brought to our ethnic minorities!" In addition to industrial needs, the Dihua Power Plant also supplies lighting electricity to the urban area. From now on, people of all ethnic groups will be able to make full use of radios and loudspeakers to listen to national events and their favorite programs.

    丰满、抚顺、西安等电厂发电后
    充分供应了经济建设的动力需要
    苏联帮助我国新建与改建的一四一项企业中的丰满水力发电站两台巨型水轮发电机和抚顺、西安、郑州、迪化等电厂，已于去年陆续开始发电，这些电厂使我国电力工业的生产能力有了很大的增长，保证了所在地区工业生产的动力需要，并带动了工业建设的前进。
    丰满、抚顺新装发电机于去年四月至八月先后发电后，和一九五二年年底即已发电的阜新发电站的电力汇合成一支巨流，使东北电力网电源大大增加。这三个单位新装发电机发电的能力，等于电炉炼八十七万吨钢的用电量；等于开采五千六百万吨煤或织布一亿七千万匹的用电量；如供给照明用电，就可以满足七个像沈阳市一样大的城市全部电灯用电。一九五三年，这些电力充足供应了鞍钢三大工程的用电及工业生产和人民生活的用电。
    西安第二发电厂新装一台发电机于去年十月份正式发电，它的发电量约等于西北全区发电量的一半。它和西安原有的电力统一为一个电力网，保证充足供应国营西北第一、二棉纺织厂、地方国营西安棉纺织厂、印染厂的用电。西北区新建国营西北第三棉纺织厂，今年上半年就要投入生产，西北今年还要新建几个工厂，这些单位，将可得到充足的电力供应。
    国营郑州火力发电厂一台发电机发电后，和老电厂并车，保证了郑州市各工厂顺利完成了增产节约计划。今年第一季度，国营郑州火力发电厂又有一台发电机继续发电。它的全部设备容量相当于一九四八年刚解放时郑州电厂的十六倍；为现在郑州电厂电力的三倍。它可供应二十万锭子、一万台布机生产。不久以后，这个电厂还要和豫西、豫北的重要城市和工矿区的电力联结起来，以适应各地工业发展的需要。
    迪化电厂是新疆省第一座自动化的火力发电厂，它的发电能力等于新疆原有电力总和的一点四倍。迪化电厂的建成，可使该市工业用电成本减低百分之四十六，市民照明用电的价格减低百分之三十三。迪化电厂发电后，新疆“七一”棉纺织厂纱锭、布机将增加百分之八十七点五。全迪化市面粉工业生产量亦将增加三倍。迪化水泥厂一九五四年的生产量，可比一九五三年提高两倍左右。迪化市工厂、矿山中许多过去因缺乏动力不能转动的机器，以及一切用人力开动的机器，现在都已经利用电力转动了。迪化市一千余家手工业，也可以利用电力发展生产。该市维吾尔族手工业工人玉素甫，长期采用风箱吹铁火炉，现在他已改用电力鼓风机吹火，不仅节省了一个劳动力，产量也增加了百分之四十。私营建新铁工厂在迪化电厂供电后，特向关内定购了一部八尺车床。即将开工生产的迪化大面粉厂，过去顾虑没有充足的动力，工程进度较慢，当他们知道迪化电厂的电力可以充足供应后，便紧张起来了，提前一天半完成了修变电所的工程。国营新疆省运输公司修理厂的维吾尔族工人吐尔逊说：“迪化电厂发电后，我们的生产一定会大大的提高，这是毛主席给我们少数民族带来的大喜事！”除工业需用外，迪化电厂还供应着市区的照明用电。从此，各族人民将能充分利用收音机、扩音器收听国家大事和他们喜爱的节目。
