Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: At the recently concluded Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the German question and the issue of guaranteeing European security were among the main agenda items. The United States originally intended to make the discussion of the German question at this conference subordinate to the goal of militarizing West Germany, in order to pave the way for continuing to promote the "European Army" plan. However, due to the comprehensive proposals put forward by the Soviet Union for resolving the German question, and especially the specific proposals for guaranteeing collective European security, which generated a significant impact among the people of Western Europe, the US calculations suffered another setback. Agence France-Presse reporter Baosheng, who was covering the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin, described the impact of the Soviet proposals by saying: "The debates in the British Parliament, the discussions in the French Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, and the news coming from all other European capitals, all confirm the impression of observers here: the great debate on European security and the reconsideration of the European security issue are only just beginning."

As everyone knows, in order to achieve its goal of promoting the "European Army" plan, the United States adopted various methods before the convening of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, attempting to shift the responsibility for obstructing the resolution of the German question onto the Soviet Union in advance. On the one hand, the United States repeatedly stated that its participation in this conference was mainly to resolve the German question. On the other hand, US propaganda insisted that the Soviet Union was unwilling to resolve the German question, even trying to create the false impression that the Soviet Union only cared about the issue of a Five-Power Conference and not about the German question.

However, US propaganda quickly went bankrupt. On the first day of the conference, the Soviet Union emphasized the close relationship between the German question and the issues of peace and European security. During the discussion, the Soviet Union took the initiative to propose suggestions for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, and suggested the withdrawal of occupation forces before elections. After the United States, Britain, and France rejected these proposals, the Soviet Union put forward proposals for guaranteeing European security and establishing a European collective security system, as well as proposals for promoting economic and cultural relations between East and West Germany. Finally, it also suggested that the four countries continue their efforts to satisfactorily resolve the German question based on the interests of consolidating European peace.

The United States and Britain and France have consistently adopted an attitude of rejection or evasion towards these Soviet proposals, and have not been able to put forward any proposals of their own, simply clinging to the "Eden Plan" which places the German elections under the supervision of the occupying powers. They also blindly defended the "European Army" plan, insisting on calling this plan to revive the Hitler Wehrmacht a plan to guarantee European security. Finally, fearing the great impact of the Soviet proposals and unable to defend their own attitudes, the United States and Britain and France vigorously promoted the idea that it was impossible to reach an agreement on the German question, saying that the only feasible way was to "not talk about the German question," and tried to divert public attention from the German question to other aspects.

However, all the efforts of the United States failed to diminish the impact of the Soviet proposals and bring itself closer to the goal of promoting the "European Army" plan. In particular, the Soviet proposal on guaranteeing European security had an even more far-reaching impact. The British "Daily Herald" called the Soviet proposal a "sensational program," and the "Times" admitted that this proposal "is very attractive to some French and Germans." The French "Le Monde" said: "As Molotov said, this plan is the only serious way to replace the European Defense Community. ... Only on such a basis can one imagine obtaining an agreement between East and West." The newspaper said: "The Western delegations have panicked." In the face of the sentiment of the German people generally supporting the Soviet proposal, even the representatives of the West German government had to express "doubt as to whether the Western foreign ministers were too hasty in saying 'no' to Molotov's proposal." West German Social Democratic Party observer Wiener, who attended the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, criticized the West, saying: "Clinging to the European Defense Community prevents a realistic discussion of the European security issue and Germany's position in the European collective security system."

This situation deeply worried the US propaganda machine. An Associated Press reporter, commenting on this proposal, which he called "a startling bomb," worried that "this proposal may be brought up long after the end of the Big Four conference," and that "Bidault will encounter new difficulties in trying to get the stubborn French parliament to approve the European Defense Community treaty."

Currently, the United States is using all its strength to reverse its politically unfavorable position in order to coerce countries such as France to quickly accept the "European Army" plan. On the one hand, the United States is spreading the idea that it "does not intend to hold any more meetings to discuss the German question" in the future, so as not to leave the European people with "a glimmer of hope" for resolving the German question. On the other hand, it is vigorously promoting that the United States will "use all its influence and moral strength to ensure that the European Defense Community is realized immediately." On February 4, before the Berlin conference had even ended, United Press International quoted "qualified sources" as threatening France, saying: "Experts at the State Department and the Defense Department have done some (research) work on the possibility of recruiting German troops outside the European Defense Community to participate in the Western defense system." Subsequently, on February 16, United Press International quoted a "senior Western figure" as reiterating Dulles' threat of "re-evaluating" US policy, and deliberately exaggerated the danger, saying: "If the European Defense Community cannot be established, it will form a 'very embarrassing situation' for the West, and will have serious consequences for the entire defense system."

### 苏联关于保障欧洲安全的建议影响巨大  美国建立“欧洲军”的阴谋遭受严重挫折

    苏联关于保障欧洲安全的建议影响巨大
    美国建立“欧洲军”的阴谋遭受严重挫折
   【新华社二十一日讯】在刚刚结束的四国外长会议上，德国问题和保障欧洲安全的问题是主要议程之一。美国原来打算使这次会议对德国问题的讨论服从于西德军国主义化的目的，以便为继续推行“欧洲军”计划铺平道路。但是，由于苏联提出的解决德国问题的全面建议，特别是保障欧洲集体安全的具体建议在西欧人民中产生了巨大的影响，美国的盘算又一次遭到了失败。在柏林采访四国外长会议消息的法新社记者鲍许在描述苏联建议的影响时说：“英国议会中的争吵、法国议会外交委员会中的辩论以及所有其他欧洲国家首都传来的消息，都肯定了这里观察家们的印象：对于欧洲安全的大辩论和对于欧洲安全问题的重新考虑，现在仅是一个开端。”
    大家知道，美国为了要达到它推进“欧洲军”计划的目的，在四国外长会议召开以前采取了种种办法，企图事先就把自己阻挠德国问题解决的责任推到苏联身上。一方面，美国口口声声说美国参加这个会议主要是要解决德国问题，另一方面，美国宣传又硬说苏联不愿意解决德国问题，甚至竭力制造错误的印象，仿佛苏联只关心五大国会议的问题，而不关心德国问题似的。
    但是，美国的宣传很快就破了产。苏联在会议开幕的第一天，就着重指出了德国问题与和平及欧洲安全问题之间的密切关系。在讨论过程中，苏联主动提出了及早缔结对德和约及在和平民主的基础上统一德国的建议，并建议在选举前撤退占领军。在美、英、法三国拒绝了这些建议之后，苏联又提出了保障欧洲安全和建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议和促进目前东西德间经济与文化关系的建议等等。最后，它还建议四国继续努力，以便根据巩固欧洲和平的利益来圆满解决德国问题。
    美国及英、法两国却一直对苏联这些建议采取拒绝或避不作答的态度，而自己又提不出什么建议来，只是死抱住一个要把德国的选举置于占领国监督之下的“艾登计划”。它们还一味替“欧洲军”计划辩护，硬把这个复活希特勒国防军的计划说成是保障欧洲安全的计划。最后，美国及英、法两国既害怕苏联建议的巨大影响，又无法为自己的态度辩解，就竭力宣传在德国问题上不可能达成协议，说唯一切实可行的办法就是“不谈德国问题”，并且竭力把公众的注意从德国问题上引到别的方面去。
    但是，美国的一切努力都没有能够缩小苏联建议的影响，而使自己更接近于推进“欧洲军”计划的目的。特别是苏联关于保障欧洲安全的建议，产生了更为深远的影响。英国“每日先驱报”把苏联的建议称为“震动人心的纲领”，“泰晤士报”承认，这个建议“很吸引一些法国人和德国人”。法国的“世界报”则说：“正如莫洛托夫说的，这个方案是代替欧洲防务集团的唯一认真的办法。……只有根据这样一个基础，才可以设想获得东西方的协议。”这个报纸说：“西方国家代表团已惊惶失措了。”在德国人民普遍拥护苏联建议的情绪面前，甚至西德政府的代表也不得不表示“怀疑西方外长对莫洛托夫的建议说‘不’是否太急了一些”。西德社会民主党列席四国外长会议的观察员维纳批评西方说：“紧抓住欧洲防务集团不放，就是妨碍对欧洲安全问题和德国在欧洲集体安全体系中的地位问题进行实事求是的讨论。”
    这种情形使美国的宣传机构深为忧虑。美联社记者在评述这个被他叫作“一颗惊人的炸弹”的建议时，担心“这个建议在四大国会议结束后很久可能还会被提起来”，并且担心“皮杜尔在争取法国固执的议会批准欧洲防务集团条约时，会遇到新的困难”。
    目前，美国正使用一切力量来挽回自己在政治上的不利地位，以便胁迫法国等国家迅速接受“欧洲军”计划。美国一方面正在散布空气说，今后美国“将不打算再举行讨论德国问题的会议”，以便不给欧洲人民留下解决德国问题的“一线希望”，另一方面，则大事宣传美国将“利用它的全部影响和道义力量来使欧洲防务集团马上实现。”在二月四日柏林会议还没有结束的时候，合众社就引用“有资格人士”的话，来恫吓法国说：“国务院和国防部的专家一级人员已对用欧洲防务集团以外的可能办法征募德国兵力使之参加西方防务体系一事，做了一些（研究）工作。”接着，合众社又在二月十六日引“西方一个高级人士”的话，重提杜勒斯关于“重新估计”美国政策的威胁，并且故作危言说：“如果不能建立欧洲防务集团，那就会对西方形成一种‘十分难堪的局势’，而对整个防务体系也会发生严重的后果。”
