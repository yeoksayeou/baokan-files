Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: Navarre, commander-in-chief of the French invading forces in Indochina, publicly rejected the US proposal to directly participate in the training of Indochinese puppet troops at a press conference in Saigon on the 19th. Navarre said, "We will not hand over the work of training the national army to the United States. It is unimaginable for anyone other than ourselves to intervene in military work." He believes that the experience the Americans gained in Korea is "completely different" from the experience the French have gained in Indochina over the past eight years, "therefore, it is absolutely unreasonable to hand over the task of building the army to our American friends..."

Despite Navarre's statement, the United States is continuing to push its plan. United Press International Washington reported on the 20th that the US Department of Defense "is continuing to push forward its plan to send O'Daniel to Indochina to be responsible for the work of the US military assistance advisory group." Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, has invited French Chief of Staff Ély to Washington for talks to "discuss the future tasks of the US military assistance advisory group stationed in Indochina in training the (Indochinese) army."

    纳瓦尔拒绝美国参加训练印度支那伪军
    【新华社二十四日讯】印度支那法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔十九日在西贡记者招待会上公开拒绝美国要求直接参加训练印度支那伪军的建议。纳瓦尔说，“我们是不会把训练国军的工作交给美国的，除了我们自己以外，任何人要在军事工作中插进来，那是不可想像的。”他认为，美国人在朝鲜获得的经验与法国在印度支那八年中得到的经验“完全不同”，“因此，把建军工作交给我们的美国朋友……是绝对不合理的”。
    尽管有纳瓦尔的这种表示，美国还是继续在推行它的计划。合众社华盛顿二十日消息说，美国国防部“正在继续推行它的派遣奥丹尼尔到印度支那负责美国军事援助顾问团的工作计划”。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福已经邀请法国总参谋长埃利到华盛顿举行会谈，以便“讨论美国驻印度支那军事援助顾问团今后训练（印度支那）军队的任务。”
