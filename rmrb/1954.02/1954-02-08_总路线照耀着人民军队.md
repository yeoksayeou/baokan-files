The General Line Illuminates the People's Army
Sentinels of National Construction
　　In the north of the motherland, it is the season of thousands of miles of ice and snow, but on Dongshan Island, which I visited, it is a scene of prosperity and spring: sugar cane spitting out white tassels, sweet potatoes blossoming with purple flowers, and late-ripening bananas exuding fragrance. The People's Liberation Army soldiers stationed on the island are enthusiastically discussing the general line for the transition period of the country. Under a lush banyan tree, I heard a conversation between two soldiers. One soldier said, "In my opinion, socialism is happiness. Aren't we guarding, patrolling, fighting, and working day and night, rain or shine, for this happy day to come sooner?" Another soldier said, "The more I think about it, the more interesting it is. The Battle of Dongshan Island left a scar on my leg. After studying the general line, I feel that this scar is even more glorious. In the future, I can stroke my beard and say to my grandson: 'Child, this is a memento left on the coastal defense front during the national transition period, in order to defend the peaceful construction of the motherland and transition to socialism as soon as possible.'"
　　As I walked on the island, I passed the famous Mount Mou, passed the martyrs' cemetery full of pine trees, and from the martyrs' cemetery, I walked south along a winding path to a mountain head protruding from the sea on the island. A soldier, holding his gun tightly in his hand, stood at the highest point of the mountain, vigilantly looking out at the white-capped ocean. Beside him was a sentry post, which, in addition to military kettles, food bags, harmonicas, and some popular reading materials, also contained pictures of national industrialization and collective farms. The sentry told me: "After studying the general line, everyone has further realized that the more beautiful the motherland is built, the more important our task is. We feel that it is really glorious to be a sentinel of socialist construction. Now, our vigilance is even higher. If the enemy dares to come, we will make sure that they only come, but never leave!" (Xu Xuezeng)
　　On a Sea Island
　　Early in the morning, a unit of the People's Liberation Army on a sea island far from the mainland began another beach landing exercise.
　　"Comrades, you have worked hard!" Instructor Wu Qiang came to Song Defu's squad, which had just finished the exercise and was resting. "We serve the people!" The soldiers stood up and shouted in unison.
　　"Okay, take a rest!" Before Wu Qiang finished speaking, everyone asked him to talk about current affairs.
　　"Okay, let me test you first!" Wu Qiang looked at everyone excitedly: "Come on, Comrade Wen Tianming, please tell us, what is the most important news in the newspaper recently?"
　　"The general line for the transition period of the country!" Wen Tianming replied very skillfully: "Our country is going to implement socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. In this way, socialism will not be far from us!" "That's right! So what is our task? Who will say?" "Instructor," a soldier spoke up enthusiastically: "Our task is to consolidate this island and defend the construction of the motherland."
　　"What he said is not entirely complete," squad leader Song Defu added: "Our most urgent task is to step up military training, improve technology, and become a modern national defense force. Only in this way can the island be consolidated and the construction of the motherland be protected!" "Yes! That's complete!" Then there was a burst of applause. The sea fog dissipated, and the sun rising from the sea poured soft golden light on the soldiers' strong faces. The soldiers looked in the usual direction and saw a faint purple shadow vaguely appearing on the undulating horizon. "We see the mainland again!" A soldier shouted and jumped up. As if echoing, the same voice came from all directions, turning into a thunderous roar. Wu Qiang felt that he had gained new strength to defend the country's transition to socialism. (Zhan Wenbao)
　　I Buy 200,000 Yuan
　　Jin Jiwu
　　Squad leader! Squad leader!
　　Write down my name,
　　Construction bonds,
　　I'll buy exactly 200,000.
　　I wanted to send the money home first,
　　So my family could have a good Spring Festival,
　　But the general line tells me:
　　Industrialization is still the most important.
　　When eliminating the enemy,
　　I charge forward,
　　Building socialism,
　　How can I lag behind?
　　Comrade, don't shout,
　　Follow behind in order,
　　Squad leader! Squad leader!
　　I'll pay all my money at once.
　　"Truly a Good Soldier of Chairman Mao"
　　After the general line was conveyed, Zhao Wenxian, the squad leader of the Fourth Squad of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces, suddenly thought of the letter his brother had sent him some time ago. The letter said: "The year before last, the government took care of us with one dou and one sheng of wheat. For your convenience in starting a family in the future, I lent it out to generate interest. Now, with the principal and interest, it is already two dou and eight sheng..." Zhao Wenxian immediately wrote a letter criticizing his brother and asking him to return the grain to the people. But he hadn't heard back, and he wasn't sure if his brother had followed his advice. So one Sunday, Zhao Wenxian asked for leave to go home.
　　As soon as he got home, his brother talked to him kindly, and finally they talked about the matter of lending out grain. His brother said: "Lending out grain to generate some interest will make it much easier for you to start a family in the future, right? Hmm, you even wrote a letter asking me to return the grain to the people. How can that be? Don't you think about the future?" Before Zhao Wenxian could let his brother finish speaking, he said excitedly, "Why haven't you returned it to the people yet? Brother, that's not right! Lending out grain to generate interest is not something we should do. It hasn't been long since we were exploited and oppressed! Today, we have turned over and our lives are better. How can we turn around and exploit others!" His brother became a little anxious: "Look at you, you talk a lot once you start. Think carefully, I'm doing this all for your own good, thinking of you!" Zhao Wenxian softened his tone a little and said, "Brother, I know you're doing it for my own good, but it's not right to do this! The revolution is to eliminate exploitation. I am a revolutionary soldier, and you are a revolutionary family member. How can we exploit people! You've probably heard of the general line for the transition period of our country, which is to gradually transform the country into a socialist society, where no one exploits anyone and everyone has a good life!" His brother originally thought the reasoning was correct, but he was unwilling to take the grain out and said irritably, "I don't care, your things are up to you!"
　　"Which family borrowed our grain?" Zhao Wenxian asked. "Yan Xiaozhuang, the Dong family!" His brother replied, still unhappy.
　　Zhao Wenxian immediately measured two dou and two sheng of grain and sent it to the Dong family. After he explained the reason, the Dong family was so grateful that they could hardly speak: "Wenxian, you are too good to us! But, I didn't give you that much!"
　　"No, it's not that I'm good to you, it's that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are good to us people, educating us to take the socialist road and not the capitalist road. Take a little extra! Consider it a government care package!"
　　The matter spread quickly, and everyone praised him, saying, "Truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao." (Yao Liangping, Wang Chunhua)

    总路线照耀着人民军队
    祖国建设的哨兵
    在祖国的北方，正是千里冰封万里雪飘的季节，但在我访问的东山岛上却是满目生意一片春色：甘蔗吐着白缨，地瓜开着紫花，晚熟的香蕉喷吐着香气。驻岛的人民解放军战士们正在热烈地谈论着国家过渡时期总路线。在一棵翠绿的大榕树下，我听到了两个战士的谈话，一个战士说：“依我看，社会主义就是幸福，我们白天黑夜，风里雨里放哨，巡逻，战斗，工作，还不是为了这幸福的日子早些到来吗？”另一个战士说：“我越想越有意思，东山岛战斗给我腿上留下了一个伤疤，总路线学习后，我感到这个疤更光荣了。将来我可摸着胡子对我的孙子说：孩子，这是在国家过渡时期，为了保卫祖国平平安安地建设，早日过渡到社会主义，在海防前线留下的纪念。”
    我在岛上走着，经过著名的某高地，经过长满松树的烈士公墓，从烈士公墓再往南，沿着一条弯曲的小路走上该岛突出在海面上的一个山头。一个战士手里紧握着枪，站在这个山头的最高处，警觉地了望着白浪滔滔的海洋。在他身旁是一个哨棚，里面除放着行军水壶、饭包、口琴和一些通俗读物而外，还有祖国工业化和集体农庄的图片。哨兵对我说：“学习了总路线以后，大家进一步认识到祖国建设得越美好，我们的任务越重大。我们感到做一个社会主义建设的哨兵，实在光荣，现在，我们的警惕性更高了，敌人如果敢来，我们要它只有来的，没有去的！”（徐学增）
      在一个海岛上
    一早，远离祖国大陆的一个海岛上的人民解放军某部又开始滩头作战演习了。
    “同志们，你们辛苦了！”指导员吴强来到宋德福班，这个班刚刚演习完毕，正在休息。“我们为人民服务！”战士们刷的一下站起来高呼着。
    “好，随便休息吧！”吴强话没落音，大家就要求他讲时事了。
    “好，我先来测验一下吧！”吴强兴奋地看着大家：“来，文天明同志先讲吧！最近报纸上最重要的消息是什么？”
    “国家过渡时期的总路线呀！”文天明很熟练地回答着：“我们国家要实行社会主义工业化，要实行对农业，手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。这一来，社会主义离咱就不远啦！”“对啦！那末咱们的任务是什么呢？谁说？”“指导员同志，”一个战士踊跃地发言了：“我们的任务就是巩固这个海岛，保卫祖国建设。”
    “他说得还不完全，”班长宋德福补充道：“我们最迫切的任务是加紧练兵，提高技术，成为现代化的国防军，只有这样，海岛才能巩固，祖国建设才能保住啊！”“是呀！这就全面啦！”接着是一阵掌声。海雾散了，浴海而出的太阳在战士们健壮的脸上倾泻着柔和的金光。战士们朝着习惯的方向看去，只见在那波涛起伏的天际，一线紫色的影子隐约出现了。“我们又看见祖国大陆了！”一个战士喊着蹦了起来，好像回声似的，从四面八方传来同一个声音，变成雷鸣一样的巨响。吴强感到自己身上增长了保卫祖国向社会主义过渡的新的力量。（詹文豹）
    我买二十万元
  　金继武
    班长！班长！
    写上我的姓名，
    建设公债，
    我买二十万整。
    先想把钱寄回家，
    让家里好好过新春，
    可是总路线告诉我：
    还是工业化要紧。
    消灭敌人时，
    我打冲锋，
    建设社会主义，
    岂能后人？
    同志你别嚷嚷，
    按次序后边跟，
    班长！班长！
    我的钱一次交清。
    “真是毛主席的好战士”
    总路线传达以后，公安部队某部四班班长赵文献一下又想到了前些时他哥的来信，信上说：“前年政府照顾了咱一斗一升麦子。为了将来你成个家方便些，我给你放出去生利了，现在连本带利已有二斗八升……”赵文献当时就写了一封信，批评了他哥哥，要他哥哥把粮食还给人家。可是一直没见回音，是不是按照他的意见处理了呢？实在放心不下。于是一个星期天，赵文献请假回家了。
    一到家，哥哥便和他亲切地谈起来，最后谈到了放粮的事上，他哥哥说：“放粮生点利，将来你成个家不是方便得多？嗯，你还来信叫我把粮食还给人家，这怎么行？你就不往后想想。”赵文献还没等他哥哥的话落地，就激动地说：“怎么还没还给人家呢？哥，这不对呀！放粮生利不是咱干的事，咱被人剥削、压迫才过去几天哪！今天，咱们翻了身，生活好了，怎能翻过来剥削别人！”他哥哥有些急了：“看你，一说一大堆，你仔细想想，我这都是为了你好，替你打算啊！”赵文献把声音放缓和了些说：“哥，我知道你是为了我好，可是这样做不对啊！革命就是为了要消灭剥削，我是革命军人，你是革命军属，怎么倒去剥削起人来啦！咱们国家的过渡时期总路线，你大概也听说过，就是要把国家一步步地变成社会主义社会，要谁也不剥削谁，人人都有好生活过嘛！”他哥哥本来觉得道理很对，但就是不愿往外拿粮食，没好气地说：“我不管，你的东西你随便！”
      “借咱粮的是那一家？”赵文献问。“阎小庄，董家！”他哥哥仍然不高兴地答。
    赵文献马上量了二斗二升粮食，送到董家去了，他说明了原因以后，董家感激地几乎说不出话来：“文献，你待我们可太好啦！可是，我给你的没有这么多呀！”
    “不，这并不是我对你好，这是共产党，毛主席对我们人民好，教育我们走社会主义的路，不要走资本主义的路。多一点你也收下好了！就算人民政府照顾的吧！”
    事情一下传开了，人人都称赞说：“真是毛主席的好战士。”（姚良平、王春华）
