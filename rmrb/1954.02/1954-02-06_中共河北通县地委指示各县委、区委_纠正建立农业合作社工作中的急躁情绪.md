The CCP Hebei Tongxian Prefectural Committee Directs County and District Committees to Correct Hasty Emotions in Establishing Agricultural Cooperatives

    Some cadres in certain counties and districts of the Tongxian Special District, Hebei Province, have developed hasty and rash emotions in the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The CCP Tongxian Prefectural Committee has instructed the county and district committees to correct this.

    After publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period, the broad masses of peasants in Tongxian Special District further raised their socialist awareness and actively demanded to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. All twelve counties in the special district had 1,347 mutual aid teams requesting to become cooperatives. By January 15th, 120 agricultural production cooperatives had been established in the special district, and 585 cooperatives were in the process of being established.

    Due to the leadership's work not keeping up with the needs of the actual movement's development, some cadre-party members, out of temporary enthusiasm, disregarded specific conditions and developed varying degrees of hasty and rash emotions in some areas, even putting forward some slogans that did not conform to policy principles. For example, in Baimiao, Dagudian, and Houyuan villages in Daxing County, where the foundation of mutual aid and leading cadres were not strong enough, they established large cooperatives with more than fifty households. Yang Huating, a cadre of Xixingzi Village, erroneously said at a mass meeting: "It is glorious to join the cooperative, and 'shameful' not to join. Not joining means taking the capitalist road." In Zhanggezhuang, there were even instances of registering households for cooperative membership door-to-door. Some areas erroneously put forward the slogan of "accepting everyone," which resulted in some landlords and counter-revolutionaries also joining the cooperatives. In addition, some areas only focused on establishing cooperatives, neglecting the work of consolidating mutual aid teams, and even drew backbone members from mutual aid teams to establish cooperatives, causing the mutual aid teams to collapse. For example, the secretary of the Qianying Village branch of the CCP Seventh District of Tongxian County drew eight backbone members from three mutual aid teams to establish a cooperative, causing all three mutual aid teams to collapse.

    Based on the above situation, the CCP Tongxian Prefectural Committee specifically instructed the county and district committees: 1. With the end of grain procurement work, county and district committees at all levels must promptly shift the focus of their leadership to mutual aid and cooperation. Party committee secretaries at all levels must take personal charge and earnestly assume responsibility. The prefectural and county committees must establish mutual aid and cooperation offices to specifically guide this work. The prefectural committee first transferred 21 strong cadres from various departments to inspect the establishment of cooperatives in Tongxian, Fangshan, Shunyi, Sanhe, Daxing, Jixian and other counties. At the same time, it called on all cadres working in rural areas to conscientiously study the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the methods of establishing cooperatives, so as to do a good job in establishing cooperatives. 2. Correctly grasp the principle of "active leadership, steady progress" in establishing cooperatives. According to specific conditions, large cooperatives should be established if possible, and small cooperatives should be established if large cooperatives are not possible. If there are no conditions for establishing cooperatives, the enthusiasm of the peasant masses should be appropriately guided to do a good job in mutual aid teams. Criticize the hasty and rash emotions of being greedy for speed and size regardless of conditions. Attention should be paid to strengthening the leadership of old cooperatives to further consolidate and improve them. 3. The absorption of cooperative members must be carried out in accordance with the regulations and must be strictly examined. 4. Mutual aid teams are the foundation for the development of agricultural production cooperatives, and the practice of only focusing on establishing cooperatives and neglecting mutual aid teams must be reversed. Help mutual aid teams do a good job in calculating work points and prices, solve existing problems, and formulate production plans to achieve further consolidation and improvement. When establishing cooperatives, it is best not to only draw the backbone of mutual aid teams, which affects the development of mutual aid teams; strive for the entire mutual aid team to transfer to a cooperative at an appropriate time. 5. The work of establishing cooperatives should be closely integrated with the current production work and should not be carried out in isolation. It should be clearly recognized that doing a good job in winter production, especially accumulating fertilizer, is an important condition for ensuring increased production in 1954. Therefore, the work of establishing cooperatives should not excessively occupy the peasants' production time, and the work that can be done in the evening should be done as much as possible in the evening. 6. In order to establish agricultural production cooperatives in a guided and planned manner, the county and district committees of each county must adopt the method of focusing on leadership to guide the general, effectively grasp the key points, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner, so as to guide the entire work of establishing cooperatives.

### 中共河北通县地委指示各县委、区委  纠正建立农业合作社工作中的急躁情绪

    中共河北通县地委指示各县委、区委
    纠正建立农业合作社工作中的急躁情绪
    河北省通县专区某些县区的少数干部在发展互助合作运动中，产生了急躁冒进情绪，中共通县地委已经指示各县、区委纠正。
    通县专区在宣传国家过渡时期的总路线以后，广大农民进一步提高了社会主义觉悟，积极要求参加互助合作组织。全专区十二个县已有一千三百四十七个互助组要求转社。到一月十五日，全专区已经建立起一百二十个农业生产合作社，有五百八十五个社正在建立。
    由于领导工作跟不上实际运动发展的需要，某些干部党员出于一时的热情，不顾具体条件，在某些地区发生了程度不同的急躁冒进情绪，甚至提出了一些不合乎政策原则的口号。如大兴县白庙、大古店、后院等三个村，原来互助基础和领导骨干都不强，条件不够，却办起五十户以上的大社来。西行子村干部杨华廷，在群众大会上错误地说：“入社光荣，不入社‘可耻’，不入社就是走资本主义道路。”张各庄还发生了挨门挨户登记入社的情况。有的地区错误地提出“来者不拒”的口号，致使有的地主和反革命分子也入了社。另外，有些地区只顾建社，忽视了巩固互助组的工作，甚至为了建社抽互助组里的骨干，把互助组弄垮。如中共通县七区前营村支部书记，从三个互助组里抽出八个骨干成立了一个社，使这三个互助组都垮了台。
    中共通县地委根据以上情况，特指示各县、区委：一、随着收购粮食工作的结束，各县县委、区委要及时把领导重心转到互助合作方面来。各级党委书记都要亲自动手，切实负起责任。地委、县委都要成立互助合作办公室，具体指导这一工作。地委首先从各部门抽调二十一名强有力的干部，分赴通县、房山、顺义、三河、大兴、蓟县等县去检查建社工作。同时号召所有在农村工作的干部，都要认真学习中共中央发布的“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”和建社方法，以便把建社工作搞好。二、正确掌握“积极领导，稳步前进”的建社方针。根据具体条件，能办大社就办大社，不能办大社就办小社，没有建社条件的，应该把农民群众的热情适当地引导到搞好互助组方面去。批判那种不看条件，贪快、贪大的急躁冒进情绪。对老社要注意加强领导，使老社进一步巩固和提高。三、吸收社员要按章程办事，要严格审查。四、互助组是发展农业生产合作社的基础，要扭转那种只顾建社而不管互助组的作法。要帮助互助组作好齐工找价的工作，解决存在的问题，订立生产计划，达到进一步巩固和提高。建社时最好不要只抽互助组的骨干，影响互助组的发展；争取整个互助组在适当时机转社。五、建社工作要和当前生产工作紧密结合起来，不能孤立地进行。应该清楚认识：搞好冬季生产特别是积肥，是保证一九五四年增产的重要条件。因此，建社工作不能过多地侵占农民的生产时间，能在晚上作的工作尽量在晚上作。六、为了有领导、有计划地建立农业生产合作社，各县县委、区委要采取重点领导指导一般的方法，切实抓住重点，发现问题，及时解决，来指导整个建社工作。
