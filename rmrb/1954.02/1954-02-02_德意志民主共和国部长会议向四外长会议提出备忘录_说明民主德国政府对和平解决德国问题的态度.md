Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 1st: The "Neues Deutschland" published on January 31st a communiqué from the Press Office of the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic regarding the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic on January 30th. At the meeting, Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl reported on the progress of the Berlin Conference and summarized the content of the memorandum from the government of the German Democratic Republic to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, which explained the attitude of the German Democratic Republic government on the peaceful resolution of the German question.

The government of the German Democratic Republic sent this memorandum, together with a letter signed by Otto Grotewohl, to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The letter stated:

“Since the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to make a positive decision on the request made by the government of the German Democratic Republic on January 24, 1954—requesting permission for representatives of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the discussions on the German question—the government of the German Democratic Republic, driven by a great sense of responsibility to the German nation and the cause of peace, believes it is its duty to the entire nation to state its views on resolving the German question in writing."

The memorandum's preamble stated:

“The government of the German Democratic Republic, together with all peace-loving people in Germany, sincerely welcomes the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the French Republic in Berlin. The German people fervently hope that the outcome of the Berlin Conference will help further ease world tensions and bring Germany closer to the conclusion of a peace treaty and reunification on a democratic and peaceful basis."

The memorandum pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic has tirelessly strived in the past and remains resolutely willing to work towards the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of a unified, democratic, peace-loving, and independent Germany.

The government of the German Democratic Republic pointed out in the memorandum that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is the legitimate right of the German people, and emphasized that the establishment of a unified Germany should be based on the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, in accordance with the wishes of the democratic forces of the German people. The memorandum stated that the Potsdam Agreement has been implemented in the German Democratic Republic, and therefore the forces of imperialism, militarism, and Nazism have been purged, and a new, democratic system has been established here. The memorandum stated that the responsibility for undermining the Potsdam Agreement and splitting Germany should be borne by the Western occupying authorities and German monopoly capitalists.

The memorandum then discussed the circumstances that led to the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, and emphasized the great historical significance of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic. In this part of the memorandum, the government of the German Democratic Republic emphasized:

The German Democratic Republic was born in the national struggle of the German people against the division of Germany and against the illegal establishment by the Western countries and West German reactionary forces of the separate West German state, which completely violated the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement.

The memorandum emphasized that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic was in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, because the Potsdam Agreement guaranteed the German people the right to rebuild their own lives on a democratic and peaceful basis and to gain a place among the free and peaceful nations of the world.

The memorandum recounted the repeated measures taken by the government of the German Democratic Republic to reach an all-German agreement, and stated that the Adenauer government, disregarding the initiatives of the German Democratic Republic, stubbornly obstructed the achievement of an agreement between East and West Germany.

The government of the German Democratic Republic further elaborated that the Bonn and Paris Treaties are incompatible with the reunification of Germany. It cited many facts to expose the aggressive nature of the "European Defence Community" war treaty, which was enthusiastically praised by the old militarists and fascist forces re-emerging in West Germany, as well as by the Bonn government.

The memorandum pointed out: "The revival of German militarism in West Germany, which will be completed with the help of the European Defence Community, particularly threatens Germany's neighbors and poses a fatal danger to the German people themselves."

The government of the German Democratic Republic emphasized: "The European Defence Community treaty restores the most dangerous center of aggression in Europe and poses the most serious threat to European security and peace, as well as to the very survival of the German people."

The memorandum also pointed out the fatal consequences that the enslaving so-called "General Treaty," which legalizes the occupation of West Germany for fifty years, would bring to the German people of West Germany.

The "European Defence Community" treaty and the "General Treaty" associated with it have become serious new obstacles hindering the reunification of Germany, because these treaties deprive the German people of the right to national self-determination, independence, and sovereignty. However, these inalienable rights must be guaranteed in the peace treaty with Germany, at the time of Germany's reunification.

The government of the German Democratic Republic emphasized that the Bonn and Paris Treaties contribute to the revival of aggressive German militarism and are the main obstacle to holding free elections in Germany. The abolition of the Bonn and Paris Treaties is a prerequisite for holding truly free elections.

The memorandum emphasized that an all-German democratic institution composed of representatives from East and West Germany must be established to prepare for and preside over free, democratic elections, and to discuss all relevant issues.

The government of the German Democratic Republic pointed out that Adenauer's so-called "free elections" are elections aimed at legitimizing the re-militarization and war preparations policies implemented by West German revanchists.

The memorandum stated that the German people do not want militaristic and revanchist elections. The German people do not want their elections to be subject to foreign supervision and interference, they do not want to conduct elections in an environment of intimidation and deception, and they do not want anyone to use their elections to restore fascist dictatorship and realize the plans of West German revanchists. The German people hope to fully exercise their national self-determination on a democratic basis to conduct free elections. They hope that the elections will be prepared by an all-German interim government.

The government of the German Democratic Republic then emphasized that the German people demand the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The memorandum said, "The government of the German Democratic Republic, being aware that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is the most important prerequisite for a peaceful and long-term solution to the German question, has strived in the past and continues to strive to achieve this goal. The government of the German Democratic Republic requested on February 13, 1952, that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet government agreed to this request and submitted to the three Western governments on March 10, 1952, a draft of the principles for a peace treaty with Germany, suggesting discussions on this draft. Unfortunately, the three Western governments have not yet expressed their views on this draft and have not put forward their own proposals for a peace treaty with Germany.

In order to ensure that a unified, peaceful, and independent Germany can achieve democratic and free development, and to meet the legitimate demands of Germany's neighbors to be free from further German aggression, thereby contributing to the consolidation of European peace, the government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the peace treaty with Germany should include the following most important principles: The reunification of Germany into a unified and autonomous state; giving Germany the opportunity to establish normal relations with other countries; guaranteeing Germany equal rights; support from the countries signing the treaty for Germany's request to join the United Nations; the withdrawal of all armed forces of the occupying countries from German territory within one year after the conclusion of the treaty; the removal of all foreign military bases in Germany within the same period; Germany should guarantee its citizens human rights and all basic democratic rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religious belief, freedom of political belief, and freedom of assembly, regardless of race, gender, language, or religion; all citizens shall be equal before the law; Germany should guarantee its citizens the right to participate in democratic parties and organizations; guarantee that these democratic parties and organizations can operate freely; organizations whose purpose is to deprive the people of their democratic rights and undermine peaceful relations with the peoples of other countries must not exist and operate in Germany; Germany should especially take all necessary measures to stop any war propaganda, to stop propaganda that provokes hostility between countries or racial hatred, and to stop propaganda that advocates the use of atomic weapons or other weapons of mass destruction such as radioactive weapons, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons; Germany has the obligation not to participate in alliances or military alliances aimed at opposing any country that participated in the war against Germany; Germany's national borders must comply with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement; the development of Germany's peaceful economy should not be subject to any restrictions; Germany should have unlimited freedom to enter the world market and the right to freedom of navigation; Germany's foreign trade should not be subject to any restrictions; since Germany has paid reparations and other payments since 1945, all claims against Germany arising from the consequences of the war should be cancelled; for the purpose of self-defense, Germany has the right to establish its necessary national armed forces and produce its necessary equipment."

The memorandum said: The government of the German Democratic Republic advocates the establishment of a unified, democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany that is not connected with any military treaty. The German people do not want the Bonn and Paris Treaties and any foreign interference, and they will establish the internal system of a unified Germany in a democratic way. In the current situation where Germany is divided, there is no other way to peacefully restore German unity except through mutual understanding between East and West Germany. The government of the German Democratic Republic pointed out that it has made earnest efforts more than once to seek this understanding, and believes that it is still necessary to seek this understanding now.

The memorandum pointed out that if an agreement is reached on the establishment of an all-German interim government, it will be the most important step towards restoring German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. If this all-German interim government is to fully consider the political, economic, and cultural aspects of all of Germany and restore Germany as a unified country, then it should be jointly composed of the parliaments of both parts of Germany with the broad participation of German democratic parties and organizations.

The memorandum mentioned the rights, functions, and responsibilities of the all-German interim government, and especially emphasized that the main task of this government is to prepare for and hold all-German universal, free, secret, and democratic elections without any foreign interference or supervision. The government of the German Democratic Republic emphasized that the all-German elections should aim to establish a democratic, peaceful, and independent Germany.

In the last part of the memorandum, the government of the German Democratic Republic put forward the following proposals to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, requesting that they be discussed and that corresponding resolutions be adopted to implement them: (1) In 1954, a conference of all countries that participated in the war against Germany should be convened to review the peace treaty with Germany. Representatives of the all-German interim government should participate in this conference. Representatives of the four major powers and representatives of the all-German interim government shall jointly draft the treaty to be submitted to this conference. The interests of Germany's national independence and peaceful democratic development require that Germany not be bound by any military treaties and that the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty be abolished. (2) The task of the all-German interim government, composed of Germans themselves, that is, composed of the parliaments of the eastern and western parts of Germany with the participation of various democratic parties and organizations, is to prepare for and preside over the universal, free, secret, and democratic elections of the National Assembly. In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the four major powers should support the all-German interim government. (3) The complete withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany should not be later than one year after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany, and foreign military bases in Germany should also be completely removed no later than one year after the conclusion of the treaty. (4) Before the peace treaty with Germany is concluded, no German armed forces shall be established, and Germany shall not be armed in any way. (5) German citizens shall not serve or cooperate with foreign military or semi-military organs in any other form within German territory. (6) No type of weapons of mass destruction, such as atomic weapons and bacteriological weapons, shall be designed, produced, or assembled within German territory. (7) The following measures should be taken to immediately improve the economic situation of the German people: (a) As in the German Democratic Republic, the occupation fees in West Germany should be reduced to 5 percent of the national budget revenue, and should not exceed the occupation fees of 1949 at most. (b) Germany's debts for foreign occupation fees after 1945 should be lifted. (c) Germany should be exempted from paying all unpaid reparations and debts owed to the four countries before, during, and after the war, with the exception of trade obligations.

The government of the German Democratic Republic hopes that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference can help eliminate the danger of war caused by the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty and the complete division of our Germany, open up the path for the German people to conclude a peace treaty and restore national unity, and open up the path to a happy life in the big family of peace-loving people of all countries in the world. This letter was signed by Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl on behalf of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    德意志民主共和国部长会议向四外长会议提出备忘录
    说明民主德国政府对和平解决德国问题的态度
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林一日电：一月三十一日，“新德意志报”刊载了德意志民主共和国总理新闻处发表的关于德意志民主共和国部长会议一月三十日会议情况的公报。在会议上，总理奥托·格罗提渥就柏林会议的进展作了报告，并概括地说明了德意志民主共和国政府给外长会议的备忘录的内容，备忘录说明了德意志民主共和国政府对和平解决德国问题的态度。
    德意志民主共和国政府把这个备忘录连同奥托·格罗提渥署名的一封信一起送交外长会议，信件中说：
    “由于柏林外长会议未能就德意志民主共和国政府一九五四年一月二十四日所提出的要求——要求准许德意志民主共和国的代表与西德代表参加会议上关于德国问题的讨论——作出正面的决定，德意志民主共和国政府为对德意志民族与和平事业的巨大责任感所驱使，认为书面陈述它对解决德国问题的意见是它对整个民族的责任。”
    备忘录的前言说：
    “德意志民主共和国政府与全德爱好和平的人民一起，真诚欢迎苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、美利坚合众国、大不列颠与北爱尔兰联合王国与法兰西共和国外交部长在柏林举行的会议。德国人民热诚地希望柏林会议的结果能有助于进一步缓和世界紧张局势，并使德国更接近于缔结和约和在民主的、和平的基础上重归统一。”
    备忘录指出，德意志民主共和国政府在过去曾不倦地努力，将来仍坚决愿意效力于争取缔结对德和约、建立一个统一、民主、爱好和平与独立的德国。
    德意志民主共和国政府在备忘录中指出，缔结对德和约是德国人民正当的权利，并着重指出，按照德国人民的民主力量的愿望，建立统一的德国应该以波茨坦协定的原则为基础。备忘录说，在德意志民主共和国内已经执行了波茨坦协定，因此，帝国主义、军国主义与纳粹的势力已经被肃清，在这里已经建立了新的、民主的制度。备忘录说，破坏波茨坦协定与使德国分裂的责任应由西方国家占领当局与德国垄断资本家担负。
    备忘录继而谈到曾促成德意志民主共和国建立的情势，并强调指出德意志民主共和国建立的巨大历史意义。德意志民主共和国政府在备忘录的这一部分中着重指出：
    德意志民主共和国是在德国人民反对分裂德国、反对西方国家和西德反动势力非法建立完全违反波茨坦协定规定的西德分立国家的民族斗争中诞生的。
    备忘录着重指出，德意志民主共和国的建立是符合波茨坦协定的规定的，因为波茨坦协定保证，德国人民有权在民主与和平的基础上重新建设他们自己的生活，并在世界上自由与和平的国家中获得地位。
    备忘录追述了德意志民主共和国政府为达成全德协议而屡次采取的措施，并且说，阿登纳政府不顾德意志民主共和国的倡议，一味阻挠东西德之间达成协议。
    德意志民主共和国政府进一步详细地论证说，波恩和巴黎条约是和德国的重新统一不相容的。它引证了许多事实，揭露“欧洲防务集团”战争条约的侵略本质，在西德重新抬头的老军国主义者和法西斯势力和波恩政府同样热烈地赞美这个条约。
    备忘录指出：“德国军国主义在西德的复活，将要在欧洲防务集团的帮助下完成，这种情况特别威胁到德国的邻国，并给德国人民自己造成了致命的危险。”
    德意志民主共和国政府着重指出：“欧洲防务集团条约恢复欧洲最危险的侵略中心，并对欧洲的安全与和平以及德国人民自己的生存造成最严重的威胁。”
    备忘录还指出了使占领西德五十年合法化的奴役性的所谓“一般性条约”会给西德的德国人民带来怎样致命的后果。
    “欧洲防务集团”条约以及与它有关的“一般性条约”已成为阻碍德国重归统一的严重的新障碍，因为这些条约剥夺了德国人民获得民族自决权、独立与主权的权利。不过，这些不可剥夺的权利在对德和约中，在德国重归统一的时候必须得到保障。
    德意志民主共和国政府着重指出，波恩与巴黎条约助长了侵略性的德国军国主义的复活，是德国举行自由选举的主要障碍。废除波恩与巴黎条约是举行真正自由的选举的先决条件。
    备忘录着重指出，必须建立一个由东西德代表组成的全德民主机构，来准备并主持自由、民主的选举，并讨论一切有关的问题。
    德意志民主共和国政府指出，阿登纳所谓的“自由选举”是一种使西德复仇主义者所执行的重新军国主义化与备战的政策合法化的选举。
    备忘录说，德国人民不要军国主义的与复仇主义的选举。德国人民不愿他们的选举受到外国的监督和干涉，他们不愿意在恫吓和欺骗的环境中进行选举，他们不愿意有人利用他们的选举来使法西斯专政复辟和实现西德复仇主义者的计划。德国人民希望在民主的基础上充分利用自己的民族自决权来进行自由选举。他们希望：由全德临时政府来筹备选举。
    德意志民主共和国政府接着着重指出，德国人民要求缔结对德和约。备忘录说，“德意志民主共和国政府，由于意识到缔结对德和约是和平地与长远地解决德国问题的最重要的先决条件，过去和现在一直为达到这个目标而努力。德意志民主共和国政府曾于一九五二年二月十三日要求苏联、美国、英国和法国政府加速缔结对德和约。苏联政府答应了这项请求，并于一九五二年三月十日向西方三国政府提出对德和约原则草案，建议就这项草案进行讨论。遗憾的是，西方三国政府直到现在还没有对这项草案提出自己的看法，而且并未提出他们自己关于对德和约的建议。
    为了保证一个统一、和平与独立的德国能得到民主和自由的发展，并满足德国的邻国关于免于再度遭受德国侵略的正义要求，从而对巩固欧洲和平作出贡献，德意志民主共和国政府认为，对德和约应包括下列最重要的原则：德国重新统一成为一个统一的、自主的国家；给德国与其他国家建立正常关系的机会；保证德国有平等权利；在和约上签字的各国支持德国要求加入联合国的请求；占领国家的一切武装部队在和约缔结后一年中撤离德国领土；在德国的一切外国军事基地在同一期间内撤除；德国应不分种族、性别、语言或宗教，保证自己的公民有人权和一切基本民主权利，例如：言论自由，出版自由，宗教信仰自由，政治信仰自由和集会自由；在法律上全体公民一律平等；德国应保证自己的公民有参加民主政党和团体的权利；保证这些民主政党和团体可以自由进行活动；凡是目的是在剥夺人民的民主权利和破坏与其他各国人民的和平关系的组织，不得在德国存在和进行活动；德国特别应采取一切必需的措施来制止任何战争宣传，制止挑拨国与国之间的敌意或是种族仇恨的宣传，制止鼓吹采用原子武器或是其他像放射性武器、化学武器、细菌武器这一类大规模毁灭性武器的宣传；德国有义务不得参加旨在反对任何一个曾参加对德作战的国家的联盟或军事同盟；德国的国界要符合波茨坦协定上的规定；德国和平经济的发展应不受任何限制；德国应有无限的自由进入世界市场和有自由航海的权利；德国的对外贸易不应受任何限制；由于德国自一九四五年以来支付了赔款和其他款项，因此，一切因战争后果而对德国提出的要求应予取消；为了自卫，德国有权建立其必要的国家武装部队并生产其必要的装备。”
    备忘录说：德意志民主共和国政府主张建立一个与任何军事条约没有关系的、统一、民主、和平、独立的德国。德国人民不要波恩和巴黎条约和任何外国干涉，他们将通过民主的方式建立一个统一的德国的内部制度。在目前德国处于分裂状态的情况下，要和平恢复德国统一，除了通过东德和西德之间的互相谅解外，便没有其他道路。德意志民主共和国政府指出，它曾不止一次地认真努力以求得这种谅解，并认为现在仍然必须求得这种谅解。
    备忘录指出，如果在成立全德临时政府上达成了协议，将是朝着在和平民主的基础上恢复德国统一这一方向迈进了最重要的一步。这个全德临时政府如果要能全盘地考虑全德国的政治、经济和文化方面的问题，并把德国恢复为一个统一的国家，那么，它就应该是在德国各民主党派和团体的广泛参加下，由德国两部分的议会共同组成。
    备忘录提到了全德临时政府的权利、职能和责任，并特别着重指出，这个政府的主要任务是在没有任何外国的干涉和监督下，筹备并举行全德的普遍、自由、秘密和民主的选举。德意志民主共和国政府着重指出，全德选举应当以建立一个民主的、和平的和独立的德国为目的。
    德意志民主共和国政府在备忘录的最后一部分向外长会议提出下列建议，要求予以讨论，并为实现这些建议通过相应的决议：（一）在一九五四年，由所有参加过对德作战的国家召开一次会议，以审理对德和约。这次会议应有全德临时政府的代表参加。四大国代表会同全德临时政府代表共同拟订提交这次会议的和约草案。德国的民族独立与和平民主的发展的利益要求德国不受任何军事条约的约束，要求废除波恩条约与巴黎条约。（二）由德国人自己组成的，即在各民主党派团体参加之下由德国东西两部分的议会组成的全德临时政府的任务在于：筹备和主持国民议会的全德普遍、自由、秘密和民主的选举。根据波茨坦协定，四大国应支持全德临时政府。（三）占领部队全部撤离德国应不得迟于对德和约缔结后的一年，外国在德国的军事基地亦不得迟于该条约缔结后的一年全部撤除。（四）对德和约尚未缔结以前，不得建立任何德国武装部队，并不得以任何方式武装德国。（五）德国公民不得以任何其他的形式在德国境内的外国军事或半军事机关中服务或与这些机关进行合作。（六）德国境内不得设计、生产或装配任何类型的大规模毁灭性武器，如原子武器和细菌武器。（七）应采取下列措施以立即改善德国人民的经济状况：（甲）和在德意志民主共和国一样，西德的占领费应减少到国家预算收入的百分之五，至多不得超过一九四九年的占领费。（乙）应解除德国一九四五年后外国占领费方面的债务。（丙）应免除德国偿付尚未付清的全部赔款和在战前、战时、战后对四国所负的债务，贸易上所承担的义务则不在此例。
    德意志民主共和国政府希望，四国外长会议能有助于消除由于波恩条约和巴黎条约以及我们德国的彻底分裂而引起的战争危险，为德国人民打开缔结和约和恢复民族统一的道路，打开通向在爱好和平的世界各国人民的大家庭中过幸福生活的道路。这封信由奥托·格罗提渥总理代表德意志民主共和国政府签字。
