Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, has established more than 1,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives, and hundreds more are being established. Currently, the area is taking a series of measures to educate cadres to further familiarize themselves with mutual aid and cooperation policies, solve specific problems existing in the new cooperatives, and lead the established cooperatives well so that they can be consolidated and improved.

In order to consolidate the established agricultural producers' cooperatives, the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) first strengthened the education of cadres leading mutual aid and cooperation. The Prefectural Committee instructed the county committees to hold expanded cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels from early to mid-February, combining the arrangements for production and the general election work, to further explain the principles and policies of mutual aid and cooperation, and how to solve specific problems in the establishment of cooperatives. The Prefectural Committee also held two meetings of cadres at the prefectural level to convey instructions from higher authorities on mutual aid and cooperation, study the current situation of mutual aid and cooperation in the prefecture, and measures to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation. The Prefectural Committee instructed county and district committees that when the general election work is basically completed, they should lead cadres to continue studying mutual aid and cooperation policies and business; in the work of leading agricultural production, they should adopt the method of apprenticeship, pairing cadres familiar with mutual aid and cooperation work with those who are not familiar; and systematically organize county and district cadres and new cooperative chairmen to visit well-run old cooperatives so that they can be educated in practical work.

The Baoding Prefectural Committee of the CCP instructed all counties that, for counties and districts that have basically completed the establishment of cooperatives, the focus of leading mutual aid and cooperation should be placed on consolidation and improvement. The first step is to mobilize cooperative members to actively carry out production movements, solve specific problems existing within the cooperatives in production, and improve the organizational system. District committees and township general branch committee members should be assigned responsibilities to help each cooperative educate its members and solve some ideological problems that have not yet been resolved in the establishment of the cooperatives.

Now, all counties in Baoding Prefecture are actively helping new cooperatives to formulate plans, arrange production and allocate labor. Some have also held discussions on bookkeeping. Laishui County, based on the old cooperatives, has organized a cooperative network according to distance, using old cooperative cadres to help solve problems in the new cooperatives and exchange experiences. After the establishment of new cooperatives in Mancheng District 1, meetings were systematically convened with representatives of banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, and agricultural producers' cooperative chairmen to discuss the supply of means of production and the sales of products within the cooperatives. In the vicinity of Zhicheng alone, chairmen of thirteen agricultural producers' cooperatives participated in the discussions, of which nine cooperatives signed integration contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, selling a total value of more than 16 million yuan and supplying a total value of more than 48 million yuan. The prefectural technical guidance station also conducted agricultural technical training for activists of cooperatives and groups, divided by district, and required them to achieve results before spring plowing and sowing. All these concrete assistance measures have promoted the preparation for spring plowing and production, and consolidated the newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives.

For areas with slower progress in establishing cooperatives, the Baoding Prefectural Committee required the implementation of a realistic spirit, continued active leadership, and completion of this work before the end of February. The Prefectural Committee also decided to convene mutual aid team representative meetings in March, based on districts, to inspect and promote the spring plowing production of mutual aid teams.

    河北省保定专区采取各种措施
    巩固新建立的农业生产合作社
    河北省保定专区已经建立起一千多个农业生产合作社，还有数百个社正在建立中。目前该区正采取一系列措施，教育干部进一步熟悉互助合作政策，解决新社中存在的具体问题，把已经建立的社领导好，使它巩固提高起来。
    中共保定地委为使建立起来的农业生产合作社都能巩固下来，首先加强了对领导互助合作干部的教育。地委责成各县委，在二月初旬到中旬召开县、区、乡扩大干部会议，结合布置生产和普选工作，进一步讲解互助合作的方针和政策，及如何解决建社中的具体问题；地委并两次召开专区一级干部会议，传达上级对互助合作工作的指示，研究专区当前互助合作的情况，和加强互助合作领导工作的措施。地委指示各县、区委，在普选工作基本结束时，要领导干部继续学习互助合作政策与业务；要在领导农业生产的工作中，采用带徒弟的办法，把熟悉互助合作工作和不熟悉互助合作工作的干部搭配在一起；有计划地组织县、区干部和新建社的社长到办得较好的老社去参观，使他们在实际工作中受到教育。
    中共保定地委指示各县，凡是基本完成建社工作的县、区，应把领导互助合作的工作重点，放在巩固提高方面来。首先是发动社员积极开展生产运动，在生产中解决社内存在的具体问题，健全组织制度。各区委和乡总支委员要分工负责，帮助各社对社员进行教育，解决社员在建社中还没有解决的一些思想问题。
    现在保定专区各县，正积极帮助新建社订立计划，安排生产和支配劳力，有的并对记账工作进行了座谈；涞水县并以老社为基础，按距离远近，组织合作社网，运用老社干部，帮助解决新社中的问题，交流经验。满城一区在新社建立起来以后，有计划地召集了银行、供销社代表和农业生产合作社社长开座谈会，讨论生产资料的供应和社内产品的推销等问题。只城关一带，参加座谈的就有十三个农业生产合作社的社长，其中有九个社和供销社订立了结合合同，推销总值达一千六百多万元，供应总值达四千八百多万元。专区技术指导站并对社、组的积极分子，分区进行农业技术训练，要求在春耕播种前作出成绩。所有这些具体帮助，都推动了春耕生产的准备工作，巩固了新建的农业生产合作社。
    保定地委对于建社进度较慢的地区，要求贯彻实事求是的精神，继续积极领导，在二月底前把这一工作结束。地委并决定在三月份以区为单位召开互助组代表会议，检查推动互助组的春耕生产。（金振甲）
