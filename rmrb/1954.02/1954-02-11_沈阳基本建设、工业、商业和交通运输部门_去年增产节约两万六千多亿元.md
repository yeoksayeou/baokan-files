By mid-December of last year, the basic construction departments in Shenyang had completed the plan for all construction projects covering 1.28 million square meters. According to the statistics of six construction companies, in ensuring the quality of the projects, the raw materials alone saved the country 35.8 billion yuan. All 154 state-owned and local state-owned factories in the city overfulfilled the annual increase production and practice economy plan by 32.2 percent. According to statistics from 66 major state-owned factories, the total value of production in 1953 exceeded the national plan by an average of 15.2 percent, increased by 27.8 percent compared with 1952, and the profits turned over to the state exceeded the plan by 40.8 percent. In terms of state-owned commerce, the national sales plan was fulfilled by 108.8 percent last year, and the profits turned over to the state exceeded the plan by 12.9 percent. In addition, the cooperative system, transportation, and finance and taxation departments also overfulfilled the 1953 plan. Among them, the value of increased production and savings in the railway and highway departments alone was more than 980 billion yuan last year.

The overfulfillment of the 1953 national plan by various factories and enterprises in Shenyang is of great significance for supporting economic construction in various regions. The more than 2 trillion yuan saved last year alone can be used to build several ordinary textile mills. Last year, more than 1,000 kinds of mechanical and electrical equipment manufactured by various machinery manufacturing plants in Shenyang supported industrial construction throughout the country. The three major projects in Anshan alone used more than 1,000 kinds of mechanical and electrical equipment manufactured by various machinery manufacturing plants in Shenyang during construction. Last year, various machinery manufacturing plants also successfully trial-produced more than 500 new products. In addition, in addition to supporting basic construction projects and supplying the local people's living needs, Shenyang's local state-owned industry also produced a large number of new-style farm tools to supply the countryside last year.

Over the past year, state-owned and local state-owned factories and enterprises in Shenyang have also made great progress in business management. For example, the production balance rate of various factories in Shenyang under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry of the Central People's Government generally increased by 10 to 20 percent in 1953 compared with 1952. This has created conditions for better completion of the 1954 national plan.

    沈阳基本建设、工业、商业和交通运输部门
    去年增产节约两万六千多亿元
    【新华社沈阳十日电】沈阳市基本建设、国营和地方国营工业、国营商业和交通运输等部门，超额完成了一九五三年的国家计划和增产节约计划，为国家多创造了两万六千五百多亿元财富。
    到去年十二月中旬，沈阳市基本建设部门完成了全部建筑工程一百二十八万平方公尺的计划。据六个建筑工程公司的统计，在保证工程质量的条件下，只是原材料一项，就为国家节约了三百五十八亿元。全市一百五十四个国营和地方国营工厂，超额百分之三十二点二完成了全年的增产节约计划。据六十六个主要国营工厂统计，一九五三年生产总值平均超过国家计划百分之十五点二，比一九五二年增长了百分之二十七点八，向国家上缴的利润超过计划百分之四十点八。国营商业方面，去年完成国家销售计划百分之一百零八点八，向国家上缴的利润超过计划百分之十二点九。此外，合作社系统、交通运输和财政税收部门，也都超额完成了一九五三年的计划。其中只是铁路和公路部门去年增产节约的价值，就有九百八十多亿元。
    沈阳市各工厂企业单位超额完成一九五三年的国家计划，对于支援各地经济建设有很大意义。只是去年增产节约下来的两万多亿元，就可以建设几个普通的纺织厂。去年，沈阳市各机械制造厂制造的一千多种机械和电气设备，支援了全国各地的工业建设。只是鞍山的三大工程，在建设中就使用了沈阳各机械制造厂制造的一千多种机械和电气设备。各机械制造厂在去年还试制成功了五百多种新产品。此外，沈阳地方国营工业去年除支援了基本建设工程，供应了当地人民生活需要以外，还生产了大批的新式农具，供应了农村。
    沈阳市各国营和地方国营的工厂企业，去年一年来在经营管理方面也有很大进步。如中央人民政府第一机械工业部在沈阳的各厂，一九五三年的生产均衡率，一般都比一九五二年提高了百分之十到二十。这就为更好地完成一九五四年的国家计划创造了条件。
