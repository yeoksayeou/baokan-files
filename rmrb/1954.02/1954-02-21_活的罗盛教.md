    A Living Luo Shengjiao
    Yuan Shaoke, Gong Jiemin

    On the morning of January 22nd, an unfamiliar guest came to the home of Auntie Park in Bongmyeong-ri, Gaechon County, South Pyongan Province, Korea – a young Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier. At first, Auntie Park couldn't guess who this guest was. After the liaison officer introduced him, Auntie Park was both surprised and delighted, and immediately called her nine-year-old child, Liu Dayuan, over. The child also stared at the guest with surprised eyes. The mother and son were speechless for a long time, using grateful looks to replace words.

    This Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier, around twenty years old, is named Zhou Rongfu and is from Nanjing City. He joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in 1951 and came to Korea. He is now a signalman in the First Battalion Headquarters of a certain unit.

    At noon on January 17th, Zhou Rongfu was on his way to the regimental headquarters on a mission when he passed a cement bridge over a river in Bongmyeong-ri. Suddenly, he heard a group of children screaming. He quickly went over to take a look and found a child's blue hat floating on a patch of unfrozen water below the bridge. Needless to say, the children had carelessly fallen into the water while skating. Without even taking off his cotton-padded coat, Zhou Rongfu instinctively jumped into the icy water and pulled the drowning child out. The child was already unconscious, and Zhou Rongfu himself was freezing, his whole body turning purple. However, Zhou Rongfu didn't care about the cold on his body and immediately had the other children lead him to take the rescued child home. This child was Auntie Park's son, Liu Dayuan. At the time, no one was home; the child's mother, Auntie Park, was out working, and the child's father, Liu Zhongran, had also gone to work at the mine. Zhou Rongfu settled Liu Dayuan on the warm floor and asked an elderly neighbor to take care of him until the child could breathe normally, and then he left Auntie Park's home.

    In the evening, Auntie Park returned home and learned that her child had fallen into the icy water and was rescued by a Chinese People's Volunteer Army comrade. She felt unspeakable gratitude in her heart. Auntie Park said to her child, "When your father comes back from the mine, we must go and see the Chinese People's Volunteer Army uncle who saved your life." The child heard his mother's words and naively asked, "Mommy, where is that Chinese People's Volunteer Army uncle?" The mother was stumped by the child's question. After a moment, the mother comforted her child, "Don't worry, we'll inquire slowly, and we'll see him sooner or later."

    After Zhou Rongfu returned to his unit, he immediately reported the incident to his superiors. However, he was very worried about the child's health. After five or six days, he obtained his superiors' consent and came with the liaison officer to visit the child. Auntie Park was overjoyed to see that this was the very benefactor she and her child had been looking for. She immediately pulled Zhou Rongfu to sit on the bed and brought apples for him to eat. Dayuan also ran over, took his hand, and leaned close to his side. Auntie Park asked Zhou Rongfu in detail about his home address and solemnly wrote it on the wall. Then, she said with immense gratitude, "What can I say? How can I express my feelings in words! If you hadn't saved Dayuan's life, how could I still see my child happily going to school now?"

    Zhou Rongfu's rescue of Liu Dayuan and his personal visit to Auntie Park's home to see the child caused a sensation in Bongmyeong-ri and moved the entire village. The villagers all exclaimed, "Another living Luo Shengjiao has emerged in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!" (Attached picture)

    活的罗盛教
    袁少柯　宫洁民
    一月二十二日上午，朝鲜平安南道介川郡凤鸣里朴大娘家里，来了一位陌生的客人——一个年青的志愿军战士。起初，朴大娘还猜不出这位客人是谁，经过联络员介绍以后，朴大娘才又惊又喜，马上把她九岁的孩子刘大元叫过来，孩子也瞪着两只惊奇的眼睛望着这位客人。母子二人半天没有说出话来，他们用感激的眼色代替了语言。
    这位二十岁左右的志愿军战士，名叫周荣福，是南京市人。他是一九五一年参加志愿军来到朝鲜的，现在是某部一营营部的通讯员。
    一月十七日中午，周荣福去团部执行任务走到凤鸣里一条河上水泥桥附近，忽然听到一群孩子的尖叫声，他连忙走过去一看，发现桥下一片还没有结冰的水面上，露出一顶小孩的蓝帽子，不用说，这又是孩子们滑冰不留神跌下水去了。这时，周荣福连棉衣都没脱，本能地扑进冰窟把落水的孩子救出来。孩子这时已失去知觉，周荣福自己也冻得全身发紫。可是，周荣福根本不顾自己身上的寒冰，马上让其他的孩子们领着他，把这个救了上来的孩子送回家里去。这个孩子就是朴大娘的儿子刘大元。当时，家里没有人，孩子的妈妈朴大娘出外劳动去了，孩子的爸爸刘中然也到矿上上班去了。周荣福就把刘大元安置在热炕上，又找来邻居的老妈妈来照顾，直到孩子能够正常地呼吸时，他才离开了朴大娘的家。
    晚上，朴大娘回来了，知道孩子跌到冰窟里被一位志愿军同志救了上来，心中真有说不出的感激。朴大娘对孩子说：“等你爸爸从矿上回来，我们一定要去看看那位救活你的志愿军叔叔。”孩子听到母亲的话，就天真地问道：“阿妈尼，那位志愿军叔叔在哪里？”母亲被孩子问住了，停了一会母亲才安慰孩子说：“别忙，慢慢打听，我们迟早会看到他的。”
      且说周荣福回到部队以后，立刻把这件事报告了首长。可是，他心里很不放心孩子的健康。过了五、六天，取得了首长的同意，就同联络员一起来看望孩子。朴大娘见到这位正是她和孩子要找的恩人，真是欣喜万分，立刻把周荣福推到床上坐下，又把苹果拿来请他吃；大元也跑过来拉着他的手，紧紧地倚在他的身边。朴大娘详细地问了周荣福家里的地址，并且郑重地把它写在墙壁上。然后万分感激地说：“叫我说什么好呢？我怎么能用话来表达我的心意！要不是你把大元救活，我现在哪还能看到孩子快快活活地去学校里读书呢？”
    周荣福救了刘大元，又亲自到朴大娘家来探望这个孩子，这件事哄动了凤鸣里，也感动了全村的人。村里的人都赞叹着：“志愿军里又出了一个活的罗盛教！”（附图片）
