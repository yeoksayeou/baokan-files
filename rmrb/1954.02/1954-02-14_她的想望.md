    Her Aspirations
　  Comrade Su Jianfan came to the fields, busy harvesting from morning till noon. She straightened her back to take a break, when she suddenly saw birds soaring in pairs. She thought of the letter she received yesterday, and her heart immediately flew to the front lines. She gazed at the horizon, lost in thought, and decided to write him back a detailed letter tonight to express her deepest feelings: "I wish I could turn into a sharp bayonet, never leaving your side for a moment; I really wish I could be a knapsack, keeping you company and shielding you from the wind; I hope I am the moon in the sky, accompanying you on sentry duty every night. These are all fantasies! I can only be your beloved girl. The General Line is a bright beacon! Illuminating everyone's heart. I will persuade my parents to join the cooperative, I will mobilize the whole village to sell surplus grain, I will take the lead in production, for you, for the motherland to add more glory. The day you return victoriously!……………………” The girl was so engrossed in her thoughts that she didn't notice the little girl sneaking up beside her, "Sister, what are you thinking about? Could it be you're thinking about the front again?" The girl startled, her face flushed red: "Bah! Don't talk nonsense, I'm thinking about that—the joke-telling Aunt Zhang from the literacy class."

    她的想望
　  苏建凡姑娘来到田野上，从早到午收割忙。她直起身子要歇一歇，忽见鸟儿双双在翱翔。她想起昨日接到的信，她的心马上飞驰到前方。她望着天边她在思量，今晚得给他回封信细细向他诉衷肠：“我恨不得变成一枝锋冲枪，时刻不离你身旁；我真想能作一个行军包，跟你作伴当风凉；我希望我是天边月，夜夜陪你上哨岗。这些都是幻想啊！我只能是你心爱的姑娘。总路线是盏明灯哟！照得人人心头亮。我要劝爹妈加入合作社，我要动员全村卖余粮，我要带头来生产，为你，为祖国多增光。那一天你要胜利回来呀！……………………”姑娘想得入了神，猛不防小丫头溜到她身旁，“大姐，你在想什么？莫不是又在想前方。”姑娘一怔涨红了脸：“呸！别瞎扯，我想的是，识字班那个——爱逗笑的张大娘。”
