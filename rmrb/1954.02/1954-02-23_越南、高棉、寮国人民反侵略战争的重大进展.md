On the arrival of the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," freedom and peace-loving people all over the world are concerned about the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian peoples in Indochina against aggression and for national independence and freedom, and rejoice in their brilliant victories.

The Vietnamese people are marching towards victory step by step in the anti-aggression war. From the beginning of the nationwide resistance in Vietnam to November 20, 1953, in less than seven years, the Vietnam People's Army has inflicted heavy blows on the French aggressor army, annihilating more than 320,000 French troops. Moreover, the losses of the French army have been increasing year by year: in the first three to four years of the war, the French army lost an average of 2,460 men per month; in the fifth year, this increased to 4,736 men; in the sixth year, it was 5,164 men; and in the seventh year, it further increased to 6,132 men. In the past winter and spring, in just two months, the French army suffered 28,000 casualties on the battlefields of Vietnam and Laos.

In the past year, despite the continuous expansion of American intervention, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance has still made great progress. In North Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army liberated Lai Chau City, an important town in Northwest Vietnam, which had been occupied by the French army for seven years, in December of last year. After the liberation of Lai Chau, the mountainous areas of northern Vietnam, with the exception of the French army's last stronghold of Dien Bien Phu, have been basically liberated. This vast area, from Cao Bang and Lang Son on the Sino-Vietnamese border and Lai Chau to Hoa Binh and Son La on the Vietnamese-Laotian border, has become the rear area of the Vietnamese resistance. This area is also connected to the liberated areas of the Red River Delta and North Central Vietnam. In the Red River Delta, guerrilla bases are also expanding rapidly. In 1951, there were only 200 small villages with guerrilla bases in this area. By 1953, many large guerrilla bases had been established, including more than 2,660 small villages with guerrilla bases. In the past year, the Vietnamese people's armed forces in the Red River Delta have become more active, seriously threatening the French army's important communication lines and isolated cities. For example, last year, important cities such as Haiphong, Kien An, Nam Dinh, and Hai Duong were attacked by the Vietnamese people's armed forces. In January of this year, in less than 20 days, the French army lost more than 20 strongholds such as Phu Luu and Hoang Dan. The French army in the Red River Delta region is in a difficult situation of being attacked from both the front and the rear, and unable to defend against all attacks. In Central Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army liberated Kon Tum Province in February of this year, with an area of 14,000 square kilometers and a population of about 200,000 in the south. This newly liberated area is also connected to the liberated areas of Quang Ngai and Quang Nam provinces. At present, the liberated areas in Central Vietnam have extended westward from the coast to the Laotian border, connecting with the newly liberated areas of the Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos. The soldiers and civilians in South Vietnam have also carried out heroic struggles, consolidating and expanding the guerrilla bases. In January of this year alone, the soldiers and civilians in My Tho, Go Cong, and other provinces in South Vietnam removed 54 French military strongholds and watchtowers. From January to November last year, the soldiers and civilians in eastern South Vietnam annihilated 7,300 French troops in the battles to defend the vast guerrilla bases of Dong Thap Muoi, Dong Nai, and Tran Moc. The Laotian and Cambodian people have also achieved many new victories in the past year. The Lao People's Liberation Army launched an offensive in April last year, liberating about 40,000 square kilometers of land in northern Laos, including Sam Neua Province, and annihilating nearly 3,000 French troops. In the past winter and spring, after more than a month of fighting, the Lao People's Liberation Army liberated the vast area of the Nam Ou River basin in northern Laos, which is more than 200 kilometers long, and the Bolaven Plateau in the south (including the capital of Attapeu Province), as well as the northern part of Savannakhet Province and most of Khammouane Province in the central part. At present, the liberated areas of Laos cover an area of about 100,000 square kilometers, with a population of about one million.

The Cambodian people have long liberated one-third of the country's land and one million people, accounting for one-quarter of the country's population. In the past year, the Cambodian People's Liberation Army has consolidated its existing achievements in battle. In the first four months of last year alone, the Cambodian People's Liberation Army conducted more than 90 victorious counter-encirclement and attack battles in the southwest and on the main communication lines, annihilating more than 500 French troops.

At present, after more than seven years of war, the liberated areas and guerrilla bases held by the people are spread all over the Indochina Peninsula, in the mountains and on the plains, and are connected to each other. The liberated areas of North Vietnam, North Central Vietnam, and Northern Laos have been connected into one piece, and the newly liberated areas of South Central Vietnam and Southern Laos have also been connected into one piece. Some isolated cities and some communication lines occupied by the French army are becoming increasingly precarious. In the past year, many towns heavily guarded by the French army, such as Na San, Gia Loc, Lai Chau, Kon Tum, Sam Neua, Tram Lap, Muang Khoua, and Attapeu, have been forced to abandon and lose one after another. Route 5, which runs between Hanoi and Haiphong, has also been frequently cut off.

The victorious development of the people's liberation war in Indochina shows that the "Navarre Plan," which is strongly supported by the United States, cannot save the failure of the French army. Navarre not only failed to gain military initiative, but was beaten everywhere. Navarre was determined to "pacify" the Red River Delta, and although he had spent a lot of effort, he had never been able to "pacify" it. On the contrary, the people's guerrilla bases were expanding more and more. In September of last year, Navarre concentrated 17 battalions to launch what he called the largest "sweep" since he took office in the area north of Loc Giang in Hung Yen Province, resulting in the loss of more than 1,700 troops and hastily withdrawing from the area. Navarre wanted to invade the liberated areas, so in October of last year, he launched what was touted as "the largest offensive in the eight-year war in Indochina" against the Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa areas. The French troops dispatched to attack Nho Quan Prefecture included five motorized infantry regiments, three inland river warships, and were covered by aircraft and armored units. However, they were driven back as soon as they reached the Nho Quan Prefecture market. As a result of this "offensive," the French army could not attack the liberated areas at all, but lost 3,800 men, including three light infantry battalions of the Bao Dai puppet army that Navarre had tried his best to expand. Navarre repeatedly struggled to "win military initiative," and in November of last year, he airdropped about four battalions of men in Dien Bien Phu. He originally planned to defend the isolated stronghold of Lai Chau in Northwest Vietnam. However, just over ten days later, the French army was forced to withdraw from Lai Chau, leaving Dien Bien Phu isolated again. In January of this year, the French army loudly touted its landing in the Tuy Hoa area of Phu Yen Province in South Central Vietnam, and has been stuck there ever since, unable to do anything. The Vietnam People's Army took advantage of the situation to liberate the neighboring province of Kon Tum in early February.

Past facts have proved that American intervention cannot stop the victory of the Indochinese people. The United States has long been involved in the local people's liberation war, using large amounts of money and weapons to "aid" the French aggressor army. After the Korean armistice, the United States more openly and blatantly participated in the Indochina War, promising to bear more military expenses and stepping up the delivery of more weapons, and recently even directly dispatched air force personnel. However, the increasingly heavy defeats of the French aggressor army show that American "aid" cannot save the colonial war's doomed fate.

The Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian peoples, tempered by a long and arduous war, are advancing triumphantly on the road to victory, and the cause of justice and peace cannot be stopped by any reactionary forces.

### 越南、高棉、寮国人民反侵略战争的重大进展

    越南、高棉、寮国人民反侵略战争的重大进展
    在“反对殖民制度斗争日”到来的时候，全世界爱好自由与和平的人民都在关怀着印度支那半岛上的越南、高棉、寮国人民反抗侵略、争取民族独立和自由的英勇斗争，并为他们的光辉胜利欢欣鼓舞。
    越南人民在反侵略战争中步步走向胜利。从越南全国抗战开始到一九五三年十一月二十日为止的不到七年间，越南人民军已给法国侵略军沉重的打击，歼灭法军共三十二万多名，而且法军的损失是在逐年增加：战争最初的三、四年间，法军每月平均损失二千四百六十名，第五年增加到四千七百三十六名，第六年为五千一百六十四名，第七年再增加到六千一百三十二名。法军在去冬今春的两个月间，在越南和寮国战场上又伤亡二万八千人。
    过去的一年，尽管美国不断扩大干涉，越南人民的抗战事业依然有了很大发展。在北越，越南人民军在去年十二月解放了为法军盘据七年之久的越南西北重镇莱州城。莱州解放以后，越南北部山区除法军最后据点奠边府外，已基本上获得解放。从越、中边界的高平、谅山和莱州直到越、寮边界的和平、山萝这片广阔的地区，已变成越南抗战的后方。这块地区还与红河三角洲和中越北部的解放区接连一起。在红河三角洲，游击基地也在迅速扩大。一九五一年，在这个地区建立了游击基地的小村庄只有二百个，到一九五三年，已建立了许多大块的游击基地，其中包括二千六百六十多个建立了游击基地的小村庄。过去一年来在红河三角洲的越南人民武装更加活跃，使得法军的重要交通线和孤立的城市，常常受到严重威胁。如在去年，海防、建安、南定、海阳等重要城市都曾遭到越南人民武装的袭击；在今年一月不到二十天的时间，法军就失去如府流、黄丹等二十多个据点。红河三角洲地区的法军已处在腹背受敌、防不胜防的窘境。在中越，越南人民军在今年二月解放了在南部的面积有一万四千平方公里、人口约二十多万的昆嵩省，这个新解放的地区也与广义、广南两省的解放区连成一片。目前，中越的解放区已从海岸向西伸展至寮国边界，与寮国南部波罗芬高原新解放的地区连成一片。南越的军民也同样进行了英勇斗争，巩固和扩大了游击基地。仅在今年一月份，南越军民在美萩、鹅贡等省即拔除法军据点和了望塔五十四处。去年一月到十一月，南越东部军民在保卫同塔梅、同耐、川木等广大游击基地战斗中，歼灭法军七千三百名。寮国和高棉人民在过去一年也取得许多新的胜利。寮国人民解放军在去年四月间发动攻势，解放了寮国北部包括桑怒省在内的约四万平方公里土地，歼灭法军近三千名。在去冬今春，寮国人民解放军经过一个多月作战，解放了北部南乌江流域长达二百多公里的广大地区和南部的波罗芬高原（包括阿速坡省省会）以及中部的沙湾拿吉省北部和甘蒙省大部地区。目前，寮国的解放区面积共约十万平方公里，人口共约一百万。
    高棉人民早已解放了面积占全国三分之一的土地，以及占全国人口四分之一的一百万人口。过去一年，高棉人民解放军在战斗中巩固了已有的成果。仅在去年头四个月，高棉人民解放军在西南部和主要交通线上进行了九十多次胜利的反扫荡战和袭击战，共歼灭法军五百多名。
    目前，经过了历时七年多的战争掌握在人民手中的解放区和游击基地已遍布在印度支那半岛上，遍布在山区和平原上，并且互相连结起来。北越、中越北部和寮国北部的解放区已连成一片，中越南部和寮国南部的新解放区也已连成一片。法军占据的一些孤立城市和一些交通线，已经愈来愈感到岌岌可危。在过去的一年，已有许多法军派重兵扼守的如那产、嘉禄、莱州、昆嵩、桑怒、三罗、芒苛和阿速坡等城镇接连被迫放弃和失守，贯通河内至海防间的第五号公路，也常常被截断。
    印度支那人民解放战争的胜利发展，说明了在美国大力支持下的“纳瓦尔计划”是不能挽救法军的失败的。纳瓦尔不但没有取得军事主动权，并且处处挨打。纳瓦尔一心要想“平定”红河三角洲，虽然曾经费了不少气力，但是一直没有“平定”得了，反而是人民游击基地愈来愈扩大。在去年九月纳瓦尔曾集中十七个营向兴安省禄江以北地区发动一次说是他到任后最大的“扫荡”，结果损兵一千七百多名，匆忙撤出这个地区。纳瓦尔要进犯解放区，于是在去年十月向宁平、清化地区发动了吹嘘是“印度支那八年战争中最大的一次攻势”，派遣进攻儒关府的法军就有五个机动步兵团、三队内河战舰，并有飞机和装甲部队掩护。但刚进到儒关府市场时就被打退回去。这一“攻势”的结果，法军对解放区一点也攻不动，而自己却损失三千八百名，其中包括被纳瓦尔竭力扩充起来的保大伪军三个轻装营。纳瓦尔一再挣扎地要“赢得军事主动权”，在去年十一月又空投约四营人于奠边府。他原来是打算防守在越南西北部孤立的据点莱州。但刚过十多天，法军却被迫撤出了莱州，使奠边府又陷于孤立。今年一月，法军又大吹大擂地在中越南部富安省绥和地区登陆，迄今陷在那里一筹莫展；而越南人民军已在二月初乘势解放邻省——崑嵩省。
    过去的事实证明，美国的干涉也不能阻止印度支那人民的胜利。很早以前，美国就已插手干涉当地人民的解放战争，用大批的金钱和武器“援助”法国侵略军。朝鲜停战以后，美国更加公开露骨地参与印度支那战争，答应负担更多的军费，加紧运送更多的武器，最近甚至直接派遣了空军人员。但是，法国侵略军的日益惨重的败绩，说明美“援”是挽救不了殖民战争的注定了要失败的命运的。
    经过长期的艰苦战争锻炼的越南、高棉、寮国人民正在胜利的大道上大步向前迈进，正义与和平的事业是任何反动势力阻挡不住的。（新华社）
