In 1953, Czechoslovakia signed trade agreements with France, the Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Denmark, and Switzerland, respectively, with trade volumes exceeding the levels of 1952.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: According to TASS, Sofia: Along with the continuous upsurge of the national economy, Bulgaria's foreign trade is continuously developing. Currently, Bulgaria has signed trade agreements with twenty-two countries and conducts trade with thirty-nine countries. Bulgaria not only actively participates in trade in the democratic world market but also develops and consolidates trade relations with capitalist countries. In 1953 alone, Bulgaria signed trade agreements with India, Italy, Austria, Finland, and Greece. Before liberation, Bulgaria mainly exported agricultural products, light industrial products, and food industrial products. However, after liberation, due to the successful implementation of socialist industrialization, Bulgaria is increasingly exporting machinery, chemicals, building materials, coal, mineral ores, and other products from the machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, and timber industry. Bulgarian-made lathes, coal mining equipment, air compressors, electric locomotives, internal combustion engines, electric motors, transformers, and many other machines are popular in the international market.

    捷保两国不断扩大对资本主义国家的贸易
    【新华社布拉格六日电】捷克斯洛伐克一九五三年在平等互利的基础上扩大了和资本主义国家的贸易。在一九五三年的头九个月中，捷克斯洛伐克对芬兰的贸易比一九五二年同期约增加了百分之七十，对英国的出口增加了百分之十六，对冰岛的贸易种类也增加了。在一九五三年，捷克斯洛伐克已和法国、荷兰、奥地利、挪威、丹麦及瑞士等国分别签订了贸易协定，贸易额超过了一九五二年的水平。捷克斯洛伐克还和印度、玻利维亚、巴西、巴拉圭、乌拉圭以及近中东国家签订了贸易协定。在捷克斯洛伐克对外贸易总额中，对经济不发达国家的贸易额所占的比重也增长了。在和这些国家贸易时，捷克斯洛伐克主要是输入工业原料和其他有助于国民经济进一步发展的物资，以及有助于提高人民生活水平的物品；出口货主要是机器和机械设备。
      【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社索非亚讯：和国民经济不断高涨的同时，保加利亚的对外贸易正在不断发展。现在，保加利亚已和二十二个国家签订了贸易协定，和三十九个国家进行贸易。保加利亚不仅积极地参加民主世界市场的贸易，而且还和资本主义国家发展和巩固贸易关系。单在一九五三年，保加利亚就和印度、意大利、奥地利、芬兰及希腊签订了贸易协定。解放以前，保加利亚主要输出农产品，轻工业和食品工业的产品，但在解放以后，由于胜利地实行着社会主义工业化，保加利亚正在越来越多地输出机器、化学品、建筑材料、煤炭、矿砂、以及机器制造业、化学工业和木材业的其他产品。保加利亚制造的车床、采煤设备、空气压缩机、电气机车、内燃机、电动机、变压器和其他许多机器，在国际市场上都很受欢迎。保加利亚输出的上等谷物蔬菜、鸡蛋、家禽、烟草、玫瑰油、葡萄酒和纺织品的数量也增加了。
