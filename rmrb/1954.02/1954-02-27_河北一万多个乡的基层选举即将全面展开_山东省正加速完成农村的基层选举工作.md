Hebei Province's basic-level elections in more than 11,000 townships are about to begin in full swing. Last year, 86 counties across the province trained election cadres, and pilot elections were conducted in 128 townships. Currently, most counties in Hebei Province are holding meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township levels to deploy the full-scale launch of basic-level elections in rural areas. As of February 20, 86 counties had concluded meetings of cadres at the county, district, and township levels, and a large number of general election cadres had arrived at basic-level election units. In the Baoding area, more than 4,000 cadres have been投入[thrown into] the general election campaign. More than 500,000 propagandists in rural areas throughout the province will conduct extensive and in-depth general election propaganda activities among the masses through civil schools, blackboards, rooftop broadcasting, and other forms.

At the county, district, and township cadre meetings held in various counties of Hebei Province, unified arrangements were made for general election work and spring plowing production. In order to ensure that the general election work does not interfere with spring plowing production, production and election offices have been established in various districts and counties. Various localities have also proposed many methods to simplify work procedures and compress meetings so that the masses have more time for production. After careful planning at the meetings, all counties are preparing to complete the elections quickly before spring plowing so that after the representatives are elected, township people's congresses can be convened to discuss and formulate plans for agricultural production and the organization of mutual aid and cooperation.

In Shandong Province, 4,261 townships (towns) have convened people's congresses and completed basic-level elections, and the election work in more than 3,500 townships is also nearing completion. The election work in the remaining 8,600-plus townships has been fully launched in mid-February. It is expected that the basic-level elections throughout the province will be completed before the end of March.

In order to accelerate the completion of basic-level elections, party and government leading organs at all levels have strengthened their leadership over the basic-level election work. In early February, local Party committees generally convened meetings of key cadres at the county and district levels to make specific arrangements for spring production, consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and fully launching basic-level elections, so as to not affect the current central tasks such as spring production, while also completing basic-level elections in a timely manner. Based on the situation that the general line has been widely and deeply publicized in the vast rural areas, and the socialist consciousness and sense of ownership of the country of the broad masses of peasants have been greatly improved, the five areas of Heze, Laiyang, Liaocheng, Zibo, and Jining have all requested to basically complete basic-level elections by the end of February. Various districts have trained sufficient guiding cadres and technical personnel. In January alone, the six districts of Dezhou, Tai'an, Jining, Jiaozhou, Heze, and Liaocheng trained more than 13,000 guiding cadres and technical personnel, who have now been assigned to basic-level units to conduct election work.

    河北一万多个乡的基层选举即将全面展开
    山东省正加速完成农村的基层选举工作
    河北省一万一千多个乡的基层选举即将全面展开。去年全省有八十六个县训练了选举干部，并先后在一百二十八个乡进行了普选的试办工作。目前河北省大部分县正在召开县、区、乡三级干部会议，布置全面展开农村的基层选举工作。截至二月二十日，已有八十六个县结束了县、区、乡三级干部会议，大批普选干部已先后到达基层普选单位。保定专区已有四千多名干部投入了普选运动。全省农村的五十多万宣传员，将通过民校、黑板报、屋顶广播等形式向群众展开广泛深入的普选宣传活动。
    河北省各县所召开的县、区、乡三级干部会上，对普选工作与春耕生产作了统一的安排。为了使普选工作不误春耕生产，各专区、县都成立了生产普选办公室。各地还提出了许多简化工作手续和紧缩会议的办法，以便群众有更多的时间进行生产。经过会议上的周密部署，各县都准备在春耕以前迅速地完成选举，以便在代表选出后，就可召开乡人民代表大会，讨论制订农业生产和组织互助合作的计划。（新华社）
    山东省已有四千二百六十一个乡（镇）召开了人民代表大会，结束了基层选举，还有三千五百多个乡的选举工作亦将近完成。其余八千六百多个乡的选举工作，已在二月中旬全面展开。预计在三月底以前，全省的基层选举就可全部完成。
    为了加速完成基层选举，各级党、政领导机关都加强了对基层选举工作的领导。在二月上旬，中共各地委普遍召开了县、区主要干部会议，把春季生产、整理发展互助合作组织以及全面展开基层选举做了具体的部署和安排，以便既不影响当前春季生产等中心工作，同时又及时完成基层选举。根据在广大农村中已普遍深入地宣传了总路线，广大农民群众的社会主义觉悟和国家主人翁的观念已大大提高的情况，菏泽、莱阳、聊城、淄博、济宁等五个专区都要求在二月底基本完成基层选举。各专区都训练了足够的指导干部和技术人员，仅德州、泰安、济宁、胶州、菏泽、聊城六个专区在一月份就训练了一万三千多名指导干部和技术人员，现在都已分配到基层单位进行选举工作。（新华社）
