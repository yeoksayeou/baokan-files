Lhasa and Labrang Tibetan People Celebrate the Butter Lamp Festival

　　February 17th (the fifteenth day of the first month of the Tibetan calendar) is the Tibetan people’s Butter Lamp Festival. On this night, Lhasa was filled with festive revelry. The lights on the streets and the moonlight reflected each other. The connected tall decorative arches decorated the Barkhor Street surrounding the Jokhang Temple like a beautiful garden. These arches were magnificent and beautiful, demonstrating the artistic talents of the Tibetan people. They used brightly colored yak butter to sculpt blooming peonies and flying white cranes, longevity gods and immortal fruits symbolizing auspiciousness, as well as carefully drawn peacocks and blooming peach blossoms. Many families set up colorful flower tents in front of their doors. Crowds of people watching the lights filled the windows along the street and the rooftops. A bright torch was lit in the center of the street. Thousands of citizens and farmers and herdsmen who came from all over to celebrate the festival crowded the brightly lit streets. The revelry continued until late at night.
　　The Tibetan people of Labrang, the capital of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province, happily celebrated this year's Butter Lamp Festival. More people watched the lights this year than in previous years. The market showed an unprecedented scene of prosperity in the three days before the festival. The newly built business department of the state-owned trading company opened for business, and the Tibetan people were excited to visit this building. The fronts of various state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private stores were crowded with people all day long. The vast number of farmers and herdsmen purchased a large number of agricultural tools, draught animals, saddles, Tibetan boots, sickles, etc., with a total transaction value of more than 7 billion yuan.
　　While celebrating the festival, the Tibetan people organized song and dance troupes and took rich gifts to comfort the Chinese People's Liberation Army. They also performed Tibetan operas to entertain the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. The film team of the autonomous region continuously screened films of Soviet and Chinese industrial construction to entertain the People's Liberation Army and the masses. Jamyang Living Buddha of Labrang Monastery also hosted a banquet to entertain the leaders of various troops and the autonomous region and Xiahe County organs.
　　On the night of the Butter Lamp Festival, the area around the Grand Sutra Hall of Labrang Monastery was filled with tall decorative arches, decorated with yak butter sculptures of birds, animals, flowers, plants, palaces, and Buddha statues. Layers of yak butter lamps were lit in front of the arches. The crowds coming and going to watch the lights were very crowded. (Xinhua News Agency)

    拉萨、拉卜楞藏族人民欢度灯节
      二月十七日（藏历正月十五日）是藏族人民的灯节。这天夜晚，拉萨市充满了节日的狂欢。大街上的灯火和月光互相辉映。一座座相连的高大彩牌，把环绕大昭寺的八角街装饰得像一座美丽的花园。这些彩牌华丽美观，表现出藏族人民的艺术才能。他们用颜色鲜艳的酥油塑造盛开的牡丹和飞翔的白鹤，象征吉祥的寿星老人和仙果，还有精心绘制的孔雀和盛开的桃花。许多人家在门前搭起各色的花帐篷。沿街窗口和屋顶平台上都挤满了观灯的群众。街中心燃起明亮的火把。成千上万的市民和各地赶来过灯节的农、牧民，拥挤在灯火辉煌的大街上。狂欢一直继续到深夜。
    甘肃省甘南藏族自治区首府拉卜楞的藏族人民，愉快地度过了今年的灯节。今年观灯的人比往年更多。灯节前三天，市场上便呈现了空前的繁荣景象。国营贸易公司新修建的门市部开张营业，藏族人民都兴奋地参观了这座大楼。各国营贸易公司、合作社及私营商店的门前，整天挤满了人群。广大农、牧民购买了大批农具、耕畜和鞍具、藏靴、镰刀等，成交总值达七十亿元以上。
    在欢度佳节中，藏族人民组织了歌舞队，带着丰盛的礼品去慰问中国人民解放军，还演出藏戏招待解放军指战员。自治区的电影队连续放映了苏联和我国工业建设的影片，招待解放军和群众。拉卜楞寺嘉木样活佛还设宴招待各部队和自治区及夏河县机关的首长。
    灯节夜晚，拉卜楞寺大经堂四周竖满了高大的彩牌，牌上有酥油塑造的鸟兽、花草、宫殿、佛像。牌前点起一层层的酥油灯。往来观灯的群众十分拥挤。　（新华社）
