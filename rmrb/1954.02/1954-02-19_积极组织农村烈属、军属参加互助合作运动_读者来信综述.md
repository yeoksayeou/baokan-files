    Actively Organize Rural Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel to Participate in the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    The families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary military personnel have dedicated their loved ones to the glorious cause of defending the security of the motherland and the happiness of the people, and have received the heartfelt love and care of the broad masses of people. In some areas where the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement is relatively developed, the method of combining substitute farming with the mutual aid and cooperation movement, or absorbing families of martyrs and military personnel into mutual aid teams or cooperatives, has not only improved the political awareness and labor enthusiasm of the families of martyrs and military personnel, and further improved their lives; but also effectively reduced the amount of land needing substitute farming, alleviating the burden of substitute farming on the masses. As reflected in readers' letters: Zhang Yulin, a military family member in Qi County, Shanxi Province, is over fifty years old. He joined a mutual aid team in 1952, and his income increased greatly. He paid off his past debts, which further improved his confidence and enthusiasm in self-sufficiency in production. In 1953, he transferred to an agricultural production cooperative with the team and specialized in feeding livestock. His daily labor remuneration ranked second in the cooperative, and his life became more prosperous. Tan Jinzai, a martyr's family member in Chaling County, Hunan Province, actively worked to increase production after joining the mutual aid team, and the tea mountains were well-maintained. He also became the leader of the mutual aid team. She Renxiang, a military family member in Shimen County, Hunan Province, learned to farm after joining the mutual aid team and was elected as the deputy leader of the mutual aid team and a model military family member of the first rank. Li Lanying, a military family member in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, Bai Renshi, a military family member in the suburbs of Baotou, and Wang Guiying, a military family member in Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, automatically declined substitute farming by the masses because their incomes increased after joining the mutual aid team. According to a survey of three districts in Xishui County, Hubei Province, the area of land for substitute farming was reduced by 20 percent due to the active organization of families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in production, which alleviated the burden on the masses.
    In the process of organizing families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, attention should be paid to ideological education. Because most of the families of martyrs and military personnel in need of care are women, children, the elderly, and the infirm, some mutual aid teams or cooperatives may be afraid of being burdened and unwilling to absorb them; individual families of martyrs and military personnel may also have a sense of complacency and be unwilling to participate in labor. Therefore, it is necessary to educate the cadres and members of the mutual aid teams and cooperatives to remember where their happiness comes from, so that they regard taking care of the families of martyrs and military personnel as their glorious responsibility; and to educate the families of martyrs and military personnel to actively work and strive for greater glory, encouraging them to engage in production, participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and walk to socialism together with everyone in collective labor. Secondly, we must do a good job in specific organizational work so that the families of martyrs and military personnel with weaker labor power have appropriate work to do. For example, Li Fa's mutual aid team in Changli County absorbed the wife of military family member Li Shuncheng to look after the children and absorbed his daughter-in-law to participate in appropriate field labor, which greatly increased the income of Li Shuncheng's family. After Beizhao Bazhuang in Shenze County, Hebei Province, organized families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in mutual aid teams, the families of martyrs and military personnel generally believed that this method was good, as they could do what they could, which was both glorious and rewarding. At present, in Handan, Jize, Longguan, Shunyi, and other counties in Hebei, the families of martyrs and military personnel participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations account for more than 70 percent of the total number of families of martyrs and military personnel, and in general villages in She County, it reaches more than 90 percent. In Yi County, many mutual aid teams actively strive to have families of martyrs and military personnel join the team, believing that it is a great honor to have families of martyrs and military personnel participate in the team.
    The spring plowing season is approaching. Under the shining of the general line, the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement is booming. In the process of leading the peasants to organize themselves, the Party organizations and people's governments at all levels should pay attention to mobilizing the masses and the families of martyrs and military personnel to combine substitute farming with the mutual aid and cooperation movement, making it the development direction and basic form of preferential treatment and substitute farming work in the rural areas in the future.

    积极组织农村烈属、军属参加互助合作运动
    ——读者来信综述
    革命烈士家属和革命军人家属把自己的亲人献给保卫祖国安全和人民幸福的光荣事业，得到了广大人民群众的衷心爱戴和亲切照顾。在农村互助合作运动比较发展的某些地区，采取了代耕工作和互助合作运动相结合，或者吸收烈属、军属参加互助组或合作社的办法，不但提高了烈属、军属的政治觉悟和劳动热情，使他们的生活得到进一步的改善；并且有效地缩小了需要代耕的土地数量，减轻了群众的代耕负担。如读者来信反映：山西省祁县军属张玉林已经五十多岁了，一九五二年参加互助组，收入大为增加，把过去的债务都还清了，这就使他进一步提高了生产自给的信心和积极性；一九五三年他随组转入农业生产合作社，专门做喂牲口的工作，所得劳动日报酬居社内第二位，生活更加富裕了。湖南省茶陵县烈属谭金仔参加互助组后积极劳动增产，茶山也修得光光的，还当了互助组长。湖南省石门县军属佘任香参加互助组后，学会了种田，被选为互助组副组长和甲等军属模范。陕西省长安县军属李兰英、包头市郊区军属白任氏、四川省昭化县军属王桂英参加互助组后，因为收入增加了，自动不要群众代耕。据湖北省浠水县三个区的调查，由于积极组织了烈属、军属参加生产，使代耕土地面积缩小了百分之二十，减轻了群众负担。
    在组织烈属、军属参加互助合作的过程中，要注意思想教育工作。因为需要照顾的烈属、军属多系妇孺老弱，有些互助组或合作社可能会怕累赘而不愿吸收他们；个别烈属、军属也可能有居功骄傲情绪，不愿参加劳动。因此，必须对互助组和合作社的干部和成员进行饮水思源的教育，使他们把照顾烈属、军属看做是自己光荣的责任；并对烈属、军属进行积极劳动、争取更大光荣的教育，鼓励他们从事生产，参加互助合作运动，在集体劳动中和大家一道走到社会主义。其次，要做好具体的组织工作，使劳力较弱的烈属、军属有适当的工作可做。如昌黎县李发互助组吸收军属李顺成的妻子看小孩，吸收他的儿媳参加适当的田间劳动，使李顺成家大大增加了收入。河北省深泽县北赵八庄组织烈属、军属参加互助组后，烈属、军属普遍认为这个办法好，自己干能够干的活，既光荣又有报酬。目前河北的邯郸、鸡泽、龙关、顺义等县参加互助合作组织的烈属、军属，占烈属、军属总户数百分之七十以上，涉县一般村庄达百分之九十以上；易县很多互助组都主动争取烈属、军属入组，认为组内有烈属、军属参加是很大的光荣。
    春耕季节即将到来，在总路线光辉的照耀下，农村的互助合作运动正在蓬勃发展。各地党的组织和人民政府在领导农民组织起来的过程中，应当注意动员群众和烈属、军属，把代耕工作和互助合作运动结合起来，使其成为今后农村中优抚代耕工作的发展方向和基本形式。
