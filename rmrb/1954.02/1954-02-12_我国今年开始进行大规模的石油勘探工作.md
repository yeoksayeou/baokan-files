    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: China is set to embark on even more extensive oil exploration efforts this year. Across the Northwest, Southwest, and Northeastern regions, over 230 geological, geophysical, surveying, and drilling teams will be dispatched to explore for oil, covering a total area of more than 120,000 square kilometers. The total drilling footage will exceed the combined footage of the past four years. This year's efforts will primarily focus on the Northwest region. In the Jiuquan Basin of the Northwest, a significant amount of geological surveying, drilling, and comprehensive research will be conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of the basin's geological conditions. Simultaneously, the work will aim to purposefully and strategically confirm new oil-bearing structures and further determine the exploitable value of already verified oil fields. In the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province, surveying and mapping work will also be carried out this year. In the Southwest region, dozens of exploration teams will be dispatched to continue investigating oil and natural gas resources. The Northeast region will further explore oil shale resources for potential use in synthetic petroleum production.
    This year's oil exploration work will extensively employ advanced methods such as gravity prospecting, magnetic prospecting, and seismic prospecting, conducting comprehensive research. These methods will play a significant role in accelerating exploration progress and improving exploration quality. In terms of drilling engineering, new Soviet and Romanian-made drilling rigs will be added this year for drilling deep wells exceeding 2,000 meters. The number of deep exploration wells this year will be eight times greater than last year, presenting significant technical challenges. Therefore, in addition to Soviet oil experts regularly providing on-site guidance, the government of the Romanian People's Republic will also send a drilling team to assist China in drilling deep wells, while also assisting China in training technical personnel in this field. To determine the oil-bearing strata of exploration wells and clarify oil production conditions, oil testing work will also be strengthened this year.
    Preparations for this larger-scale oil exploration effort are currently underway. Based on geological data collected in the field last year, geological personnel have expedited the creation of geological maps and reports, laying a solid foundation for the preparation of this year's exploration designs. The locations for exploration wells in the first quarter of this year have been arranged, and drilling teams will begin drilling operations in succession. In addition to advance orders placed abroad last year for essential equipment needed for this year's exploration work, other materials have been ordered or purchased domestically, with some already transported to the work sites. A large number of new personnel needed for geological and drilling work this year, having undergone training in various aspects, will formally participate in exploration work. Geological and drilling departments will establish political work organizations this year to strengthen political leadership in exploration work.

    我国今年开始进行大规模的石油勘探工作
   【新华社十一日讯】我国更大规模的石油勘探工作就要在今年内展开。在西北、西南和东北三个地区，今年将有二百三十多个地质队、地球物理队、测量队和钻探队出发勘探石油，调查的面积共达十二万多平方公里，钻探的总进尺比过去四年的进尺总和还要多。这些工作今年主要集中在西北区。西北的酒泉盆地，今年将进行大量的地质普查、钻探和综合研究工作，求得对整个盆地的地质情况有一个全面了解；同时有目的有重点地证实一些新的储油构造和进一步确定已证实的油田的开采价值。在青海省的柴达木盆地上，今年也将展开普查和测量工作。西南区今年将派出几十个勘探队继续调查石油和天然气的资源。东北区也将进一步寻找可供人造石油应用的油母页岩。
    今年石油勘探工作将大量地采用先进的重力探矿、磁力探矿、地震探矿等方法，进行综合研究工作。这些方法对加快勘探进度、提高勘探质量都将起很大作用。在钻探工程方面，今年将增添苏联和罗马尼亚制造的新式钻机，以便用来钻探二千公尺以上的深探井。今年深探井的数目要比去年多八倍，技术问题相当复杂，因此除了苏联石油专家将经常到现场指导外，罗马尼亚人民共和国政府也将派一个钻井队来帮助我国钻探深井，同时协助我国培养这方面的技术人才。为了确定探井的储油层位，搞清产油情况，今年还要加强试油工作。
    这一规模更大的石油勘探工作目前正在积极准备。地质人员们根据去年在野外搜集的地质资料，已经赶制成地质图和地质报告，为编制今年的勘探设计打好了基础。今年第一季度的探井井位已经布置就绪，各钻井队都将陆续开钻。今年勘探工作需用的重要器材，除在去年已向国外提前订货外，其他材料已分别在国内订货或已购置，部分已运到工地。今年地质和钻探工作需用的大批新人员，经过各方面的培养，也都将正式参加勘探工作。地质和钻探部门今年将要成立政治工作机构，以加强勘探工作的政治领导。
