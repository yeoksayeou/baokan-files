Shanghai Studies Issues such as Convening District People's Congresses

After the completion of the basic-level election work in Shanghai, the Shanghai Election Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Committee held meetings separately to summarize this work and study issues related to convening district people's congresses.

At the expanded meeting of the Shanghai Election Committee, Liu Jiping, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai and Secretary-General of the Shanghai Election Committee, reported on the progress of the basic-level election work in Shanghai at each stage, the election results, and the main experiences and lessons learned. In his report, he pointed out that according to the provisions of the Electoral Law, representatives to the Municipal People's Congress should be elected at the District People's Congresses. Now that the District People's Congresses are about to be convened, he suggested that the meeting discuss and make provisions on the number of representatives to the Municipal People's Congress and the method of nomination and consultation. The meeting agreed to Liu Jiping's report on the basic-level election work and instructed the office of the Municipal Election Committee to use this as a basis to prepare a summary report on the basic-level election in Shanghai and submit it to the Municipal People's Government for review. Regarding the number of representatives to the Municipal People's Congress and the method of nomination and consultation, the meeting also principally approved it after repeated discussions.

The twentieth plenary meeting of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Committee approved the report of the Municipal Election Committee on the basic-level election work and discussed the draft plan for the tentative number of members of the Shanghai District People's Government Committees and the method of nominating candidates. Deputy Mayor Jin Zhonghua gave a report on this issue at the meeting. The entire committee discussed this draft in detail, and finally unanimously passed the "Resolution on the Tentative Number of Members of the Shanghai District People's Government Committees and the Method of Nominating Candidates."

Jiangxi Launches the Third Phase of Basic-Level Election Work

The third phase of basic-level election work in Jiangxi Province has been fully launched in two-thirds of the province's regions. Before the start of this universal suffrage work, the Jiangxi Provincial Election Committee convened a provincial universal suffrage work conference to summarize the second phase of basic-level election work and deploy the third phase of basic-level election work. The participants at the meeting focused on discussing how to combine the publicity of the general line of the national transition period with the universal suffrage movement, so that the people would truly recognize that consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship is the guarantee for realizing the general line. Fang Zhichun, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Election Committee, and Huang Zhizhen, Secretary-General, also gave instructions at the meeting on how the work of the political power should serve the general line. The third phase of basic-level elections is being launched in the season when the mutual aid and cooperation movement is being carried out in the countryside and spring plowing is being prepared. The meeting emphasized that all localities must absorb the experience of the first and second phases of basic-level elections, closely combine the election work with the mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production, so that the enthusiasm of the people to participate in the universal suffrage and political power construction work will become a force to promote the current socialist transformation of agriculture.

More than 6,000 townships and towns in Jiangxi Province are conducting the third phase of basic-level elections, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of townships and towns in the province. The other more than 3,000 townships and towns were completed before the end of last year. After the completion of the third phase of basic-level election work, a basic-level political power of the People's Congress system will be fully established in the province.

Wuhan's Floating Population Voting District Enthusiastically Conducts Elections

Since January 25, the electoral districts of the floating population district of Wuhan City have successively carried out the election of representatives to the District People's Congress. The election work in the electoral districts of Baojia Lane, Quanlong Lane, Aijia Zui, Nianyu Tao, and Siguan Dian has mostly been completed, and voters in the electoral districts of various agencies in the floating population district have also participated in the election activities in batches. During this period, due to the combination of the publicity of the general line and the in-depth and meticulous deliberation and nomination of representative candidates, the voters' thinking has been generally improved. The voters who participated in the election were in high spirits, and the candidates who were jointly nominated received the enthusiastic support of the vast number of voters. In order to celebrate the election, many boats were decorated with national flags and various colored flags, and many voters came by small boats to participate in the election meeting. On the days of the election, a wave of enthusiasm for purchasing national economic construction bonds was also set off in the floating population district. Boatman Hu Jinlin said: "Universal suffrage elects our own representatives to participate in the management of national affairs and lead us to socialism. We must also support socialist construction with practical actions." He took the initiative to organize a group to publicize the significance of the state issuing construction bonds to the surrounding masses and called on everyone to actively purchase bonds. Boatmen Chen Qixi and Peng Yuancai spent all their savings of three million yuan on purchasing bonds.

More Active Work After Being Elected as a Representative

Xu Xiulan is a people's representative of Juren Village, Datong, Huainan City, Anhui Province. In the past, she was a member of the trade union family committee and a security committee member. Since becoming a people's representative, she has been even more active in her work. She often thinks: Since the people have elected me, I cannot fail the people's expectations of me and must be a representative who truly works for the people. Therefore, Xu Xiulan works very hard in all aspects and can humbly accept the opinions of the masses and improve her work. On snowy days, she still checks the lights and fire at night, sometimes falling in the muddy snow. She is also an active propagandist of the national general line. Once, she publicized the country's socialist industrialization to the masses and talked about our country's methods of accumulating funds. She used vivid examples to inspire the audience's patriotic enthusiasm, causing a woman named Lü Suzhen to take out her savings of twenty silver dollars that she had accumulated for many years and deposit them in the bank. Xu Xiulan usually cares very much about the difficulties of the masses and tries her best to help solve them. Once, a woman named Zhang Ailan suddenly fell ill and no one took care of her. Xu Xiulan mobilized the masses to carry her to the hospital for treatment. In order to take care of the health and safety of others, she is sometimes so busy that she cannot even eat her meals on time. Because of this, the masses support her even more.

A Glorious Flower Presented to the People's Representative

Before the opening of the election meeting in the fourth electoral district of Jiayi Township, Yutian County, Xinjiang Province, voter Yusufu Hareti walked into the venue with his voter registration card in one hand and a large paper red flower in the other. Three days ago, when Yusufu Hareti went to the market, he saved the thousand yuan he would have spent on eating "steamed buns," bought two sheets of red and green paper at the cooperative, and spent half the night at home making this large red flower with leaves, petals, and stamens. He wanted to dedicate this red flower to his beloved representative.

At the election meeting, Yusufu Hareti kept his eyes fixed on a small people's representative on the rostrum – the former Deputy Township Head of the township, Communist Party member Aimair Lawayi. When electing Aimair Lawayi, Yusufu Hareti stood up tall, raised his hand, and felt very excited. Aimair Lawayi used to work as a long-term laborer for seven years and endured all kinds of hardships. He was allocated a house and land during the land reform and became the Deputy Township Head. In June 1953, the local main canal flooded, and the embankment was breached. Hundreds of acres of corn were about to be washed away. At this time, he ran over, jumped into the water without even taking off his clothes, used his body to block the breach, and then let everyone dig soil and hug grass, quickly blocking the breach. In 1953, he publicized to the masses the new methods of planting corn, and the grain yield of the entire township increased a lot. Yusufu Hareti's three acres of cornfield yielded one hundred and twenty "chengzi" (one "chengzi" is seventeen market catties). Aimair Lawayi was therefore enthusiastically supported by the voters and was honorably elected in this election. When he walked onto the rostrum amidst the enthusiastic applause of the voters, Yusufu Hareti also walked onto the rostrum from the crowd with the flower in his hand, hung the flower on Aimair Lawayi's chest, and said: "You are the most beloved representative. This glorious flower is for you."

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    上海市研究召开区人民代表大会等问题
    上海市基层选举工作完成之后，为了总结这一工作，并研究召开各区人民代表大会等有关问题，上海市选举委员会和上海市人民政府委员会分别举行了会议。
    在上海市选举委员会扩大会议上，上海市人民政府副市长、上海市选举委员会秘书长刘季平报告了上海市基层选举各阶段工作的情况、选举结果以及主要经验教训。他在报告中指出：根据选举法规定，市人民代表大会代表应在区人民代表大会上选举产生，现各区区人民代表大会即将召开，因此，建议会议讨论作出关于市人民代表大会代表名额及提名协商办法的规定。会议同意刘季平关于基层选举工作的报告，并责成市选举委员会办公室以此为基础，作出上海市基层选举总结报告，提请市人民政府审查。关于市人民代表大会代表名额及提名协商办法问题，会议经反复讨论后也原则通过。
    上海市人民政府委员会第二十次全体委员会议同意了市选举委员会关于基层选举工作的报告，并讨论了上海市各区区人民政府委员会暂定名额与候选人提名办法草案。金仲华副市长在会上作了关于这一问题的报告。全体委员会详细地讨论了这一草案，最后经一致通过，作出了“关于上海市各区人民政府委员会暂定名额与候选人提名办法的决议”。
    江西展开第三期基层选举工作
    江西省第三期基层选举工作已在全省三分之二的地区全面展开。这次普选工作开始以前，江西省选举委员会召开了全省普选工作会议，总结第二期基层选举工作，布置第三期基层选举工作。参加会议的人员着重讨论了如何结合国家过渡时期总路线的宣传展开普选运动，使人民群众真正认识到巩固人民民主专政是实现总路线的保证。江西省选举委员会主席方志纯、秘书长黄知真并在会上对政权工作如何为总路线服务作了指示。第三期基层选举是在农村中正在开展互助合作运动和准备春耕的季节中展开的，会议强调各地必须吸收第一、二期基层选举的经验，把选举工作和互助合作运动与农业生产密切结合起来，使人民群众踊跃参加普选和政权建设工作的热情，成为推动当前农业的社会主义改造的力量。
    江西省进行第三期基层选举的单位有六千多个乡、镇，占全省乡、镇总数的三分之二。另外的三千多个乡、镇已在去年年底以前完成。第三期基层选举工作完成后，就在全省完全建立起人民代表大会制的基层政权。
    武汉市水上选区热烈进行选举
    武汉市水上区各选区自一月二十五日起先后进行了区人民代表大会代表的选举工作。鲍家巷、泉隆巷、艾家咀、鲇鱼套、四官殿等选区的选举工作，多数已经完毕，水上区各机关选区的选民也分批参加了选举活动。在这一时期中，由于结合总路线宣传，深入细致地进行了代表候选人的酝酿提名工作，所以选民思想普遍提高。参加选举的选民情绪非常高涨，被联合提名的候选人受到了广大选民的热烈拥护。为了庆祝选举，许多船上都高高挂起国旗和各种彩旗，许多选民都撑着小船赶来参加选举大会。在选举的日子里，水上区还掀起了认购国家经济建设公债的热潮。船民胡金林说：“普选选出我们自己的代表来参加管理国家大事，领导我们走向社会主义，我们也要以实际行动支持社会主义建设。”他主动组织了一个小组向周围群众宣传国家发行建设公债的意义，号召大家踊跃购买公债。船工陈其喜、彭元才二人将节余下来的三百万元全部买了公债。
    当选代表后工作更加积极
    徐秀兰是安徽省淮南市大通居仁村的人民代表。过去她是工会工人家属委员会的委员和治安委员，自从当了人民代表以后，工作更加积极了。她时常想：既然人民选了我，就不能辜负人民对我的期望，要做个真正为人民办事的代表。因此，在各项工作中，徐秀兰都很努力，并能虚心接受群众意见，改进工作。大雪天，她在深夜也照常查灯查火，有时摔倒在泥泞的雪地里。她又是国家总路线的积极宣传者。有一次，她向群众宣传国家的社会主义工业化，谈到了我们国家积累资金的办法，她用生动的事例鼓舞了听众的爱国热情，使妇女吕素珍把自己积存了多年的二十块银元拿出来存到银行里去。徐秀兰平时非常关心群众的疾苦，并尽力帮助解决。妇女张爱兰有一回得了急病，没人照顾，徐秀兰就动员群众把她抬到医院去医治。为了照顾别人的健康与安全，她有时忙得自己连饭也不能按时吃。正因为这样，群众更加拥护她。
    光荣花献给人民代表
    新疆省于阗县一区加衣乡第四选区的选举大会开会前，选民玉素甫哈热提一手拿着选民证，一手拿着一朵纸做的大红花走进了会场。三天以前，玉素甫哈热提去赶集的时候，节省下了吃“烧包子”的一千块钱，到合作社买了两张红绿纸，回家后整整弄了半夜，做出了这朵有叶、有瓣、有蕊的大红花。他要把这朵红花献给自己心爱的代表。
    在选举大会上，玉素甫哈热提两眼不离地望着主席台上一位小个子的人民代表——该乡原副乡长、共产党员艾买尔拉哇衣。在选举艾买尔拉哇衣的时候，玉素甫哈热提挺着胸脯、举起手，心里非常兴奋。艾买尔拉哇衣过去扛了七年长工，什么苦都受过。他在土地改革中分得了房子和土地，当了副乡长。一九五三年六月当地大渠涨水，水堤被冲破，眼看着几百亩玉米就要被水连根冲走。这时，他跑了来，连衣服也顾不得脱就跳下水去，用自己的身子堵住冲破的缺口，然后让大家挖土、抱草，很快地堵住了缺口。一九五三年他向群众宣传用新方法种玉米，全乡粮食的产量增加了很多。玉素甫哈热提的三亩玉米地就打了一百二十秤子（一秤子有十七市斤）。艾买尔拉哇衣因此受到选民的热烈拥护，在这次选举中光荣当选。当他在选民的热烈掌声中走上主席台时，玉素甫哈热提拿着花也从人群中走上主席台，把花挂在艾买尔拉哇衣的胸前，并说：“你是最可爱的代表，这朵光荣花献给你”。
