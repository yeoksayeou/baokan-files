　　Extensive Activities to Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Servicemen Unfold Across the Country Before and After the Spring Festival

　　This year, before and after the Spring Festival, cities and villages across the country universally launched activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen.

　　The comfort teams organized by people from all walks of life in various regions have visited the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the sick and wounded of the Chinese People's Volunteers. At the army-government-civilian Spring Festival gatherings held in various districts of Beijing, the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, garrison personnel, government cadres, and people from all walks of life gathered to congratulate each other on the Spring Festival. Various districts also held celebration meetings to celebrate the merits of the families of several hundred Volunteer Army and PLA heroes who performed meritorious service in 1953. Shanghai organized thousands of comfort teams to visit the families of martyrs and servicemen door-to-door. At the same time, more than 300,000 workers, peasants, and students directly held joint celebrations with the troops, families of martyrs, and families of servicemen. In Shenyang, thousands of comfort groups also extended New Year greetings to the families of martyrs and servicemen, and Mayor Jiao Ruoyu personally went to the home of Guo Jinsheng, a special-class hero of the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteers, to extend New Year greetings. Chen Shiyu, Deputy Mayor of Xi'an, and others visited the "Glory Village," where more than 80 families of martyrs and servicemen lived, door to door. Yao Shijie, the father of Yao Xianru, a mine-clearing hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers who recently returned from a comfort visit to Korea, and Cai Youlu, the father of Cai Jintong, a second-class combat hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, also held a discussion with more than 800 families of martyrs and servicemen in Xi'an before the Spring Festival to report on the heroic deeds and living conditions of the Volunteers, greatly inspiring the families of servicemen. The eight Spring Festival comfort groups composed of representatives from all walks of life in Jiangsu Province, carrying film projection teams and comfort items, went to Suzhou, Wuxi, Taizhou, Gaoyou, Huai'an, and other places before the Spring Festival to comfort the wounded and sick soldiers, recuperating soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army, and wish them a happy Spring Festival. Xiamen organized eleven comfort teams to visit and pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army guarding the islands on the front line of the motherland's coastal defense.

　　In the Spring Festival activities to support the families of servicemen, special attention was paid to comforting the families of revolutionary martyrs. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government sent representatives to comfort the family of Yang Lian'di, a first-class hero and special-class meritorious worker of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The "Yang Lian'di Company" of the Volunteer Army also sent people to present the family of the martyr with a brocade banner with the words "We will always maintain the glory of Martyr Yang Lian'di." Before the Spring Festival, the Henan Provincial People's Government and the Luoyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office sent letters of condolence, condolences, and brocade banners to the family of Zhang Minglu, a special-class meritorious worker and second-class people-loving model of the Volunteer Army. The local people also braved the heavy snow to rebuild the gate for the martyr's family, and the town government specially bought a pair of large gauze lanterns from Luoyang to hang at the door of the martyr's house. On the first day of the Spring Festival, more than 500 cadres, peasants, and students continuously paid New Year's greetings to the father of Martyr Zhang Minglu.

　　In order to enable the families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and soldiers of the garrison troops to spend a happy Spring Festival, various places performed movies, Peking operas, operas, and dramas for them, and held grand garden parties. Sixteen larger cinemas in Beijing provided free movie tickets for the families of martyrs and servicemen. Famous Peking opera actors Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Fuying, Zhang Junqiu, Wu Suqiu, and others also performed many wonderful programs for the families of martyrs and servicemen. On February 14, the Capital Laboring People's Cultural Palace held a Spring Festival army-supporting and family-supporting garden party for more than 45,000 people. Wang Ziyi, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, also strolled through the garden with the families of martyrs and servicemen. In the Shanghai literary and art circles' army-supporting and family-supporting performance, the famous 67-year-old actor Gai Jiaotian also participated in the performance. During the Spring Festival, people from all walks of life in Chongqing held a military-civilian joint celebration garden party for more than 20,000 people in the Laboring People's Cultural Palace, and the cultural troupes, cinemas, and theaters under the Chongqing Municipal People's Government's Cultural Bureau separately entertained the families of martyrs, servicemen, and troops. Guangzhou also held an army-supporting and family-supporting garden party at the Lingnan Cultural Relics Palace on February 6.

　　In carrying out the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, various localities have paid attention to specifically helping the families of martyrs and servicemen solve some life problems. The people of the capital launched a movement to do one thing for the families of martyrs and servicemen. On January 29, all the primary school students in Dongdan District went in groups to the homes of each family of martyrs and servicemen to help with a major cleaning. In Chongqing, many Young Pioneers helped the families of martyrs and servicemen with sweeping the floor, wiping windows, carrying water, and taking care of children when they visited them. Wuhan gave special care to the poor families of martyrs and servicemen. The poor families of martyrs and servicemen in Wuchang District received material subsidies before the Spring Festival, and those who lacked cotton clothes received new cotton clothes early. Qiaokou District also issued them February living allowances and discretionary Spring Festival allowances in advance. The people of Xi'an and Hangzhou also automatically donated a large amount of cash or materials to comfort the poor families of martyrs and servicemen.
