Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 9th: Our special correspondent reports: The US side received the suggestion from the Korean-Chinese side to resume the Panmunjom talks on February 1st two weeks ago but deliberately did not reply. Now, it even openly tries to use deceptive tactics to shift the responsibility for delaying the talks to the Korean-Chinese side. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 6th, US Secretary of State Dulles, who is attending the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, said that he "has decided to ask Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to use his influence on the Chinese Communists to break the stalemate at Panmunjom regarding the Korean peace conference." This shameless behavior of the US side exposes the appalling degeneration of the US side in politics.

On December 12, 1953, US representative Dean, in order to cooperate with the US plan to forcibly detain Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, deliberately threatened and abused our representatives and fabricated unreasonable excuses to rudely interrupt the talks. In early January of this year, the governments of China and North Korea successively issued statements advocating the immediate resumption of talks to arrange for the convening of a political conference. At the same time, due to the suggestion of our negotiating representatives, the liaison secretaries of both sides began to hold meetings on January 14 to determine the date for the resumption of the talks. Our side proposed the date for the resumption of the meeting three times in succession, but the US side deliberately insisted on the unreasonable request to revise the meeting records as a condition for resuming the talks between the two sides, and used this as an excuse to repeatedly refuse to agree on a date for the resumption of the meeting. Now, our side has proposed a date for the resumption of the meeting for the fourth time, and the US side has delayed its response. Judging from these facts, who is creating the stalemate in Panmunjom, and who is stubbornly refusing to break this stalemate? Isn't it exceptionally clear? While the US side is resisting the efforts of the Korean-Chinese side to seek the resumption of talks in this way, it is also engaging in behind-the-scenes maneuvers. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York, the United States has told its allies that it is prepared to "agree" to resume the Panmunjom talks, but first requires Britain and other countries to follow the United States in opposing the proposal for the resumption of the UN General Assembly to discuss the Korean issue as a "quid pro quo." After the proposal for the resumption of the UN General Assembly was blocked, the United States turned around and obstructed the resumption of talks between the two sides.

From recent signs, the US authorities still have no intention of resuming the talks. The US State Department on the 8th still stubbornly stated that whether the negotiations will resume depends on whether the Korean-Chinese side agrees to the unreasonable conditions proposed by Dean, that is, the Korean-Chinese side must withdraw its accusations against the US side for perfidiously condoning Syngman Rhee's "release" of prisoners of war. Even the US side knows that the Korean-Chinese side will never withdraw such accusations. The reason why the US State Department reiterated this condition is that it shows that the US side still has no sincerity in resuming the talks.

Now, the situation is very clear. The responsibility for breaking the stalemate in Panmunjom lies with the US authorities who created this stalemate with their own hands. As long as the US side abandons its policy of delay and obstruction and returns to Panmunjom to resume talks between the two sides, the stalemate can be broken immediately, and the convening of a political conference can be realized at an early date. The record of the US side's behavior in Panmunjom and the responsibility it should bear for delaying the talks cannot be distorted by any despicable tricks.

### 美方继续玩弄花样拖延双方会谈的复会

    美方继续玩弄花样拖延双方会谈的复会
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者报道：美方接到朝中方面提出的在二月一日恢复板门店会谈的建议已经两个星期而故意不予答复，现在还公然想用欺骗手法把拖延会谈的责任推到朝中方面。据美联社六日消息，正在参加柏林四国外长会议的美国国务卿杜勒斯说什么“已决定要求苏联外交部长莫洛托夫使用他对中国共产党的影响来打破板门店的关于朝鲜和平会议的僵局”。美方这种无耻的行为，暴露了美方在政治上的可惊的堕落。
     一九五三年十二月十二日，美国代表迪安为了配合美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的计划，故意威胁谩骂我方代表，并制造无理的借口粗暴地中断了会谈。今年一月上旬，中朝两国政府先后发表声明，主张立即恢复会谈以安排政治会议的召开。同时，由于我方会谈代表的建议，双方才在一月十四日开始举行联络秘书会议，来确定恢复双方会谈的日期。我方在会上先后三次提出复会日期，但美方故意坚持修改会议记录的无理要求，作为什么恢复双方会谈的条件，并以此为借口，再三拒绝商定复会日期。现在，我方第四次提出复会日期，美方竟拖延不作答复。从这些事实看，究竟是谁在制造板门店僵局，是谁蛮横地拒绝打破这个僵局，难道不是异常清楚的吗？美方一面这样来抵制朝中方面寻求恢复双方会谈的努力，一面则在幕后大耍手腕。据路透社纽约消息，美国曾向它的盟国表示准备“同意”恢复板门店会谈，但是首先要英国及其他国家跟在美国后面反对联合国大会复会讨论朝鲜问题的建议，作为
  “交换条件”。等到联大复会的建议被挡住了以后，美国又反过来阻挠双方会谈的恢复。
    从最近的迹象看来，美国当局仍无意恢复双方会谈。美国国务院八日仍固执地表示谈判是否恢复要看朝中方面是否同意迪安所提的无理条件，也就是说要朝中方面撤回对美方背信弃义地纵容李承晚“释放”战俘的指责。连美方也知道朝中方面是决不会撤回这种指责的。美国国务院之所以重提这个条件，说明美方对恢复双方会谈仍无诚意。
    现在，情势是很明显的，打破板门店僵局的责任，就在亲手制造出这一僵局的美国当局身上。只要美方收拾起它的拖延阻挠政策，回到板门店来恢复双方会谈，僵局就可以马上打破，政治会议的召开就有早日实现的可能。美方在板门店的行为的纪录和他应负的拖延会谈的责任，不是凭借任何卑鄙的花招可以歪曲的。
