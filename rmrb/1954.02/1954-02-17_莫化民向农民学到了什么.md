What Mo Huamin Learned from the Farmers
		Fu Dong

The product quality in the trial workshop of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory has recently improved significantly, but the number of rejected products on the inspection room's shelves has actually increased. What exactly is going on? The inspector, Mo Huamin, picked up a cross joint (a part from a harvester) from the reject shelf and, pointing to a sand hole in the keyway, said to me: "In the past, I would have considered a cross joint like this合格 (qualified/up to standard), but now it won't be able to leave the factory gate so easily." This is the reason why there are more rejected products than before.

Mo Huamin had worked in the factory for nearly twenty years, and in the old society, he had picked up many bad habits. Although he had improved after liberation, he always paid more attention to his personal life than to production. He would always inquire if someone bought a radio, and he wouldn't miss a new pen hanging on someone's pocket. However, he didn't pay attention to the slogan at the factory gate, "Strive to manufacture high-quality and low-priced new agricultural implements for our farmer brothers," even though each character was as tall as a person. At that time, he felt that he was just a craftsman, and as long as he did the work assigned by his superiors reasonably well, he didn't care about the farmers! In this way, many unqualified parts slipped through his hands and out of the factory gate.

At the end of May last year, the factory sent him and several other comrades to the northwest to assemble harvesters for several newly established farms and to collect farmers' opinions on the new agricultural implements. He set off with the mindset of going on a trip. When he arrived at a farm in Datong County, Qinghai, he stayed for many days without having the opportunity to speak to the local farmers. Every day, the farmers went to the fields when the stars were still in the sky and didn't come back until it was pitch dark. One day, there was a hailstorm. They saw the farmers at home and went to chat with them. The old couple were anxiously looking at the hail outside the door, sighing. When they saw them come in, they quickly offered them a seat and said, "Farmers still depend on the weather. A hailstorm like this will reduce the harvest by several percent." In the middle of their conversation, it was time to eat. The old man opened the pot, and inside was a ball of mush. The host said, "Although things are getting better year by year, we still have to plan for the future. We save money to buy fertilizer and agricultural implements to produce more grain. Since we're not working in the fields today, we'll eat this mush; we'll save the solid food to eat in the fields." Mo Huamin felt his face flush when he heard the old man's words, and he couldn't speak for a long time. That night, he felt very uncomfortable and couldn't sleep. He thought that at home, he complained that the "August 1st" flour was too dark and always wanted to eat top-quality machine flour. In the factory, housing and tap water were paid for by the public, and if he got sick, the public would also pay for treatment, yet he complained all day long. Looking at the old farmers, they were busy all day long, and their production wasn't guaranteed. A hailstorm could ruin their crops. How difficult it was to produce grain!

During the wheat harvest, Mo Huamin went to the old man's field several times. He tried the old man's sickle. The handle was short and the blade was long. After cutting for less than two hours, he was so tired that his back and legs ached, and he couldn't straighten up. The old man said that with this kind of sickle, they could only cut a maximum of one mu of land per day. From this, Mo Huamin understood the importance of his work. Therefore, he was extremely happy when the farm decided to use harvesters to cut the wheat. He wanted the old man to see the benefits of machine production with his own eyes. The news that harvesters would be used to cut wheat spread like wildfire. That day, as soon as the sun rose, the farm's fields were filled with people. Many people traveled dozens of miles over mountains to get there. When the people from the farm sat on the harvester's seat, driving the horses, and cut a large field of wheat in the blink of an eye, the spectators clamored: "This thing is like a barber's 'clipper,' cutting the wheat so neatly and in such quantity!" During the break, people crowded around the harvester, touching this and looking at that, asking how much grain it could harvest in a day. The machine started for the second time, but after a few steps, it suddenly stopped. Upon inspection, it turned out that the cross joint was broken. They replaced it, but it broke again before long. This dampened the enthusiasm of the visitors, and some old farmers said, "This thing can harvest a lot of grain, we understand that, but this thing is too fragile." Mo Huamin was so ashamed that he couldn't even lift his head.

After returning from the northwest, he realized for the first time that there was a village not far from his dormitory. He used to ride his bicycle past it every day, but he had never paid attention to it. One evening after dinner, he went to visit. The old man's name was Yang Guichun. His family was busy in the house, some twisting hemp ropes and others sewing soles. When the Yang family saw someone from the factory, they quickly invited him to sit on the kang, and then offered him cigarettes and tea, treating him very warmly. When they talked about farming, Yang Guichun happily said, "The harvests are getting better year by year. Every year we hand in public grain, but we always feel like we can't repay the country's kindness. Now that the country has planned construction, we have to sell our grain to the country. We figured that after eating and using, our family still has eight hundred catties of surplus grain, so we'll sell it all to the cooperative." He asked the old man if he used new agricultural implements and what opinions he had about the agricultural implements made by the factory, but the old man didn't say anything for a long time. He understood what the old man's cold attitude meant. In this old man's home, Mo Huamin learned another lesson.

From then on, Mo Huamin changed. In the past, when he inspected products, he would just take a look and that was it. Now, when inspecting, he would use precision micrometers to measure anything he couldn't see with his eyes, or compare it to the blueprints. He would have found it troublesome before! He also often went to the workshop to watch the workers work, helping them avoid mistakes and reduce the number of rejects.

Last December, wages were adjusted, but because Mo Huamin had already been evaluated the previous year, he didn't get an adjustment this time. Mo Huamin recalled his feelings at the time and said to me: "To be honest, this time, my thinking wasn't affected at all. I feel a little ashamed to take so much salary! I haven't done much work, but I'm getting paid a lot of money. Now, when I'm working, I often think about the lives of those farmers in Datong County, Qinghai. How can we make their lives richer day by day? I feel a heavy burden on my shoulders. If we don't manufacture cheap and durable agricultural implements for the old farmers, allowing them to produce more grain, how can we be worthy of being the working class!"

    莫化民向农民学到了什么
    傅冬
    华北农业机械总厂试制工场里的产品质量，最近有了很大的提高，可是，检验室架子上的废品却反而增多了。这究竟是怎么回事呢？检验员莫化民从废品架上拿起一个十字接头（收割机上的零件），指着键槽里的砂眼对我说：“以前像这样的十字接头，我就算它合格，现在它想随便出工厂的大门，可就办不到了。”这，就是废品较过去增多的原因。
    莫化民在工厂干了近二十年，在旧社会里沾染了不少坏习气。解放后虽有改进，但总是关心生活问题的时候多，注意生产问题的时候少。谁买了个收音机，他总要去打听打听，谁的口袋上挂了支新钢笔也瞒不过他的眼。可是工厂大门口的“为农民弟兄制造物美价廉的新式农具而奋斗”的标语，虽然每个字都有一人高却不在他眼里，那个时候他觉得自己是个耍手艺的人，上级交给他的活，作得差不离就行了，管他什么农民不农民！就这样，许多不合格的机件，经过他手混出了工厂的大门。
    去年五月底，工厂派他和其他几个同志到西北给几个新开办的农场装配收割机，同时收集农民对新农具的意见。他抱着到外面旅行一趟的心情出发了。到了青海大通县的农场，住了好些天，都没有机会和当地农民说句话。每天还是满天星星的时候，农民就上地里去了，夜里黑洞洞才摸回来。一天，下了场大雹子雨。他们看见农民在家，就跑去聊天。老乡一家人正焦急地瞅着门外的雹子唉声叹气，看见他们进来，忙让了坐说：“现在庄稼人还是靠天吃饭，一场雹子，就要减少几成收成。”说话中间，到了吃饭的时候，老乡打开锅，里面煮的一团糊糊。主人说：“光景虽然一年比一年好啦，可是人总得为将来打算。我们省吃俭用，想攒些钱买肥料、农具，多打粮食。今天不下地，我们就吃这糊糊，硬的留着到地里吃。”莫化民听了老乡的话，脸上有些发热，半天说不出话来。那一天晚上，他心里很别扭，翻来覆去睡不着。他想在家里吃八一粉还嫌黑，总想吃头等机器面；在厂里住房、用自来水都是公家花钱，有了个病痛，也是公家给治，还整天说这说那。看看老乡整天忙得不停气，生产还没个保险，一场雹子庄稼就毁了。粮食来得多么不容易呀！
    收麦子的时候，莫化民到老乡地里去看过几趟。他拿老乡的镰刀试了试，镰刀柄短刀长，割了还不到两个钟头，他就累得背痛腿酸直不起腰来了。老乡说用这种镰刀一天最多只能割一亩地。莫化民从这里懂得了自己工作的重要。所以当农场决定用收割机割麦子的时候，他高兴极了。他想让老乡亲眼看一下机器生产的好处。用机器割麦子的消息，像风一样传出去了，那一天，太阳一露头，农场的地里就站满了人，许多人翻山越岭跑了几十里路赶来。当农场里的人坐在收割机的机座上驱着马，眨眼间割出一大片麦子时，看的人就喧嚷开了：“这家伙像理发的‘推子’一样，割的麦子又多又齐！”休息的时候，人们都拥到收割机旁，摸摸这，瞅瞅那，问一天能打多少粮食。机器第二次开动了，但走了几步忽然不动了，一检查，原来十字接头断了。换了一个，没走多久，又坏了。给参观的人泼了盆冷水，有的老乡说：“好家伙能多打庄稼，这道理我们懂了，可就是这家伙太不经用。”莫化民听了这话，羞得连头也抬不起来。
    从西北回来后，他头一次发现在他宿舍外面不远的地方有个村庄，以前他天天骑自行车打那儿经过，可就从没注意过。一天吃过晚饭，他去串门。那家老乡叫杨贵春，一家子正在屋里忙着，有的搓麻绳，有的纳鞋底。杨家人看见工厂的人来了，忙往炕里让，接着又是烟又是茶，招待得挺热火。谈到庄稼的事，杨贵春高兴得说：“年景一年比一年好。年年缴公粮，总觉报不完国家的恩。国家有计划建设了，我们就要把粮食卖给国家。大伙算了算，一家人除吃、用外，还有八百斤余粮，就统统卖给合作社了。”他问老乡使新农具没有，对厂里造的农具有啥意见，老乡半天没说话。他明白老乡的冷淡态度是什么意思。在这个老乡家里，莫化民又上了一课。
    从此以后，莫化民变了。以前，他检验产品的时候，随便看看就算了；现在检验的时候，凡是眼看不出的，他就拿精密的千分卡尺量，或拿图纸对。要在以前他还嫌它麻烦呢！他还常常到车间看工人作活，帮助工人避免了错误，少出了许多废品。
    去年十二月调整工资，因莫化民前年已评过了，这次没给他调整。莫化民回忆起当时的心情对我说：“说心里话，这次，我思想上可一点也没波动，我觉得拿这么多工资，还有点害臊呢！我工作没做多少，钱可拿的不少。现在我在工作的时候，常常想起青海大通县那些农民的生活。怎么能让他们日子一天比一天富起来呢？我感到自己肩上有很重的担子。不给老乡制造便宜、结实的农具，让他们多打粮食，怎么配当工人阶级呢！”
