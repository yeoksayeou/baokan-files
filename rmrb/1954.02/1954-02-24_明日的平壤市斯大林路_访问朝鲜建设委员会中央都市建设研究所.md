    Tomorrow's Stalin Road in Pyongyang
    ——Visiting the Central Urban Construction Research Institute of the Korean Construction Committee
    Lin Yuan
    West of the Taedong River Iron Bridge in Pyongyang, there was a prosperous street before the war; during the war, like other parts of Pyongyang, it became a wasteland. On this wasteland, there is an arc-shaped building, still stubbornly standing, although the roof was blown off, and the walls on the back and both sides were destroyed, but the front wall is intact, and the light yellow tiles inlaid on the wall reflect a golden light in the morning sun. When we arrived here in mid-November last year, a group of young construction workers were busy repairing the destroyed areas, using plywood to partition the rooms; when we returned here in late November, each room was filled with blueprints for the construction of Pyongyang, and this group of young construction workers were busy with triangles and slide rules on their desks.
    In this stubbornly standing building, the Central Urban Construction Research Institute of the Korean Construction Committee is planning the reconstruction of Pyongyang and is meticulously planning the center of tomorrow's Pyongyang - the beautiful Stalin Road.
    "The people of Pyongyang, in order to commemorate the great liberator Comrade Stalin, are making the construction of the most prosperous Stalin Road in the city center the first step in the plan to rebuild Pyongyang," Kang Chul?, the 31-year-old architectural engineer and director of the institute, told us. "The construction of Stalin Road began on a large scale less than a month after the armistice."
    After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Korean Workers' Party and the government launched a voluntary labor movement to clear the ruins of Stalin Road. 33,000 people, including the Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet, cadres, and citizens, participated in this movement. From August 20th to September 18th last year, a total of 47,400 cubic meters of earth were excavated; countless cement blocks, bricks, tiles, and rebars were cleared. In a short period of time, the enthusiastic working masses transformed a wasteland of crater after crater into a wide and tidy road.
    "Now we will start from this road and build a Pyongyang that is even more beautiful than before the war," Kang Chul? said, and then invited us to the bombed-out roof. With one hand pointing to a huge map of Pyongyang's construction, and the other pointing to the Stalin Road under construction, parallel to the Taedong River and close to its bank, he vividly told us the outline of tomorrow's Stalin Road in poetic language.
                  ＊　＊
    The railway station – the gateway to Pyongyang. When an unfamiliar traveler enters Pyongyang through this gateway, the first thing he steps onto is International Road. Here, he will see the flags of fraternal countries in the peace and democracy camp that he is familiar with. Walking east along International Road, at the far end of the road, a huge bronze statue will stand tall – the bronze statue of the great liberator Stalin. People passing by the statue will look up at the kind and wise smile of this giant with affection and respect. From the location of the statue, it is the Stalin Road that travelers yearn for. At the intersection of Stalin Road and International Road, there will be a large building with rich Korean national characteristics – the Grand Opera House. This opera house can accommodate 2,000 people and is a palace of art. Around the opera house, there is a large garden. Travelers can rest here, wash away the fatigue of the journey, and then step onto Stalin Road.
    Stalin Road is 45 to 60 meters wide and 2.5 kilometers long. The entire road will be paved and completed in 1954. On both sides of the road, there will be tall buildings, four to five stories high, with a strong Korean national style; stretches of 5.5-meter-wide green lawns will cover the wide sidewalks. Walking on this road, people will admire the heroic and indomitable spirit of the Korean people, who not only defeated the arrogant American imperialism in the cruel years of war, but also quickly rebuilt such a beautiful city in peacetime. Of course, people will not forget the people's heroes in the portraits beside the green lawns – it was they who sacrificed their blood and lives in the Fatherland Liberation War, in exchange for peace and prosperity for the people.
    On both sides of Stalin Road, the first large buildings that travelers will see will be the Revolutionary Martyrs' School and the International Hotel. The Revolutionary Martyrs' School has already started construction. The state cares for the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the people, and their children can live a happy life of study. The International Hotel is a five-story building, which will be completed in 1954. This is a luxuriously decorated building to receive international friends. In the near future, this building will open its arms to welcome many friends from different countries, with different clothes, different skin colors, and different languages, but as close as brothers.
    Walking forward from the International Hotel, on the right is the Taedong River Iron Bridge that connects eastern and western Pyongyang. The American bandits damaged this iron bridge during the war, but in the land of Korea, bridges cannot be destroyed. The 150,000 workdays of the People's Volunteer Army soldiers have foreshadowed that the restoration date of the Taedong River Iron Bridge is approaching. When the Korean people walk across this bridge, they will never forget the noble friendship of the Chinese People's Volunteers: during the war, they shared life and death with the Korean people, fought side by side to defeat the enemy; after the war, they used their hands that once held guns to help the Korean people rebuild their homes.
    Continuing forward from here is a large square with an area of 3.6 hectares that can accommodate 100,000 people. This is the heart of Pyongyang – Central Square. This square is planned to be completed in 1954. During festivals, the Korean people, wearing brightly colored national costumes, gather here to celebrate their victory and sing about their free and beautiful lives. In the square, there is a bronze statue of Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader loved by the Korean people. Every Korean person who passes by here will remember how their leader led them to drive away the Japanese invaders, defeat American imperialism, and bring them today's happiness. On the west side of the square is the Korean Cabinet Building, on the south side is the Central Committee Headquarters of the Workers' Party, and on the north side is the Standing Committee Building of the Supreme People's Assembly. These three magnificent buildings form a horseshoe shape and are planned to be partially started in 1954. On top of the large building on the north side, there will be a towering central tower, a tower symbolizing victory. The tower will emit loud chimes from time to time, encouraging the Korean people to move from victory to victory. Opposite the Cabinet Building, there will be two buildings with unique styles: one is the Art Museum, exhibiting the excellent and rich cultural heritage of the Korean people; the other is the Liberation Struggle Museum, exhibiting the relics of the Korean people's heroes. These two museums are the best places for the Korean people to conduct patriotic education.
    Walking past Central Square is the State-owned Department Store. Here, there will be various abundant goods. Not far from the department store, on the right-hand side, is the famous Taedong Gate, which has a history of 600 years. This gate has been ravaged by Japanese imperialism and trampled by American imperialism in 1950, but like the indomitable and steadfast spirit of the Korean people, it still stands complete, strong, and proud. In front of the Taedong Gate, there will be a riverside garden stretching for several kilometers. If the people playing here are Koreans over the age of twenty, they will clearly remember that this used to be a place filled with imperialist goods, and even the water of the Taedong River was turbid; but today the river water is green, and the riverside will become a beautiful garden. Looking southeast from Taedong Gate, in a place with a forest of chimneys, is the light industrial area of Pyongyang. There is the largest textile factory in Korea, which turned 13,200 spindles three months after the armistice. By June 1955, 60,000 spindles will be put into production. In the plan to build Pyongyang, the riverbed of the Taedong River will be deepened so that 400-ton ships can sail straight into the river without hindrance. At that time, standing on Taedong Gate, you will see ships loading and unloading goods with cranes in the lower reaches of the Taedong River. Looking east from Taedong Gate, you will see rows of brand-new workers' dormitories. During the war, the Korean people raised flowers in air-raid shelters and basements, but today they are raised on sunny windowsills or sun decks. Looking northeast from Taedong Gate is the beautiful Rungra Island emerging from the river. Korean women like to wear brightly colored silk fabrics, and the name and splendor of this island are just like the skirts worn by Korean women. There will be a large stadium on Rungra Island, one of the four major stadiums in Pyongyang. On holidays, if the wind is favorable, you will hear cheers coming from the stadium from Taedong Gate. The area between Rungra Island and Moranbong is planned to be connected by a bridge decorated with granite. Every Sunday, you will see countless young men and women workers rowing small boats, passing through the bridge openings, and passing through the weeping willows gently brushing the water on the edge of the island - enjoying the fruits of happiness protected by their own blood and lives.
    West of Taedong Gate, on the left side of Stalin Road, there is a low hillside, on which are majestic Korean Academy of Sciences buildings. Walking forward along Stalin Road from the Academy of Sciences, near the end of Stalin Road is the world-famous Moranbong, which is closely related to the spiritual life of the Korean people. Moranbong is the cultural district of Pyongyang and has many historical and cultural relics. Whether in difficult or happy days, it has always given the Korean people great spiritual encouragement; although the enemy has poured thousands of tons of steel onto its head countless times, the underground theater hidden in its belly has always quietly played music or dramas full of fighting power. The Korean people love art, and now they are building a palatial drama theater on Moranbong with wide marble steps. In April 1954, this theater will open its artistic doors to the Korean people who love drama.
    In the northeast corner of the drama theater, at the top of Moranbong, facing Stalin Road, there is a towering Soviet Army Liberation Memorial Tower. During the war years, the enemy fired countless bullets at it and poured countless tons of steel, but it always proudly stood on the peak of Moranbong. The red star on the top of the tower always emitted the victorious light of Stalin. It is its light that illuminates every corner of Pyongyang and every Korean's heart, so that the Korean people feel endless power in any difficult situation; it encourages the Korean people to move forward, forward, and forward again.
                  ＊＊＊
    For a full five hours, I seemed to be wandering through tomorrow's Stalin Road in Pyongyang, and also wandering through a garden-like city in a myth. However, is this a myth? Blueprints for the construction of Pyongyang are displayed before our eyes; the young chief architectural engineer, who bears the heavy responsibility of building Pyongyang, is standing firmly in front of us; the tense rustling sound of construction workers drawing blueprints in the hall downstairs constantly reaches our ears; ...When we walked out of the gate of the Central Urban Construction Research Institute, I saw many soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers picking up large stones and cement blocks in the ruins, carrying or lifting them to the head of the Taedong River bridge on the right side of the institute. The stones on the bridge head had piled up like a small mountain; on Stalin Road, which was under construction on the left side of the institute, teams of Korean female workers were bending over and nervously paving the road surface with stones. They were to pave 10,000 square meters of stone in 1954; on Moranbong in the distance, a towering crane, like a giant arm, was taking bags of cement to the construction site of the drama theater; the labor songs of building Pyongyang and building Stalin Road sounded in all directions; ...This is not a myth, this is a beautiful plan that is underway and will inevitably be realized! The American imperialists bombed Pyongyang into a wasteland, but the strong Korean people are using their own heroic labor to gradually turn the wasteland into a beautiful garden.
    "Three or ten years later, when you come to Pyongyang again, I will personally take you on a week-long tour of Stalin Road. At that time, you will feel that Stalin Road is even more beautiful than what I said today," Kang Chul? said with firm confidence as he saw us off.
    Yes, in the land of heroes, reality must be more beautiful than myth.

    明日的平壤市斯大林路
    ——访问朝鲜建设委员会中央都市建设研究所
    林元
    平壤市大同江铁桥的西面，战前是一片繁荣的街道；在战争中，它也如平壤市的其他地方一样，变成一片废墟了。在这片废墟上，有一座弧形的大楼，还顽强地屹立着，虽然楼顶被炸毁了，后面和左右两面的墙也被炸毁了，可是正面的墙，却完整如故，镶在墙上的淡黄色的磁砖，在朝阳中反射出一片金光。去年十一月中旬我们到这里时，一群年青的建筑工作者正在忙着修理被炸毁的地方，用三合板间隔房间；下旬我们再到这里时，每一个房间里已经堆满着建设平壤市的各种蓝图，而这群年青的建筑工作者又在忙着桌面上的三角板和计算尺了。
    在这座顽强屹立着的楼房里，朝鲜建设委员会中央都市建设研究所正在规划着重建平壤的工作，正在详细地计划着明日平壤的中心——美丽的斯大林路。
    “平壤市人民为了纪念伟大的解放者斯大林同志，在重建平壤市的计划中，第一步就是建设市中心区最繁荣的斯大林路。”研究所的主任、三十一岁的建筑工程师康处?对我们说，“建设斯大林路的工程，在停战后不到一个月便大规模地开始了。”
    朝鲜停战协定签订后，朝鲜劳动党和政府就发动了清理斯大林路废墟的义务劳动运动。包括内阁副首相、干部和市民的三万三千人参加了这个运动。自去年八月二十日至九月十八日止，共挖出了四万七千四百公方的土；清理了无数的水泥块、砖块、瓦片和钢筋。在短短的时间内，热情劳动的群众就把一片弹坑连着弹坑的废墟变成了一条宽阔整齐的马路。
    “现在我们就要从这条马路开始，建设一个比战前更漂亮的平壤。”康处?说完，就请我们到炸毁的楼顶上。他一只手指着一幅巨大的建设平壤市的地图，一只手指着那条正在修建的、紧靠大同江边的、跟大同江平行的斯大林路，用诗一般的语言，把明日的斯大林路的轮廓形象地告诉了我们。
                  ＊　＊
    火车站——平壤市的大门。当一个陌生的旅客从这个大门走进平壤市时，他首先踏上的是国际路。在这里，他将看见他所熟识的和平民主阵营各兄弟国家的国旗。从国际路朝东一直走去，在远远的路尽头的地方，将矗立起一座巨大的铜像——伟大的解放者斯大林的铜像。人们走过铜像跟前，都会亲切而崇敬地瞻望着这位巨人慈祥的、智慧的笑容。由铜像的所在地起，便是旅客所向往的斯大林路了。斯大林路和国际路的交叉点，将有一座富有朝鲜民族色彩的大建筑——大歌剧院，这个歌剧院能容纳两千人，是一座艺术的宫殿。在歌剧院场四周，有一片大花园。旅客可以在这里休息，洗涤旅途上的疲劳，然后踏上斯大林路。
    斯大林路宽四十五至六十公尺，长两公里半。全路将于一九五四年内铺砌完成。路的两旁将有一幢幢四五层高的具有浓厚的朝鲜民族风格的大厦；一片片宽五点五公尺的绿色草地将铺满在宽阔的行人道上。走在这条路上，这时人们都会钦佩朝鲜人民的英勇和刚毅的精神，他们不仅能在残酷的战争年代中战胜了妄自尊大的美帝国主义，而且能在和平时期迅速地重建起这么一座美丽的城市。当然，人们不会忘记在绿色草地旁的画像上的人民英雄们——就是他们，在祖国解放战争中献出了自己的鲜血和生命，给人们换来了和平和繁荣。
    在斯大林路的两旁，旅客首先看到的大建筑，将是革命遗属学校和国际饭店。革命遗属学校已经开始动工建筑了。国家关怀着那些为人民献出了生命的烈士，他们的子女可以过着幸福的学习生活了。国际饭店是一座五层的大厦，将在一九五四年内建设完成。这是一座招待国际友人的装饰华丽的大厦。不久的将来，这座大楼就将张开双手欢迎许多服装不同、肤色不同、语言不同，但却如同兄弟一样亲近的各国朋友们。
    由国际饭店向前走去，右面是那条连贯东西平壤的大同江铁桥。美国强盗在战争期间炸坏了这座铁桥，但是在朝鲜的土地上，桥是炸不断的。中国人民志愿军战士的共达十五万工的顽强劳动已经预示着大同江铁桥的修复日期快到了。朝鲜人民走过这座桥时，永远不会忘记中国人民志愿军的高贵的友情：战时他们和朝鲜人民同生死、共患难，并肩打败了敌人；战后，他们又以自己握枪杆的双手协助朝鲜人民重建家园。
    从这里继续向前走去，是一片可容纳十万人的、面积有三点六公顷的大广场。这就是平壤市的心脏——中央广场。这个广场计划在一九五四年内修建完成。节日，朝鲜人民穿着颜色鲜艳的民族服装，集合在这里庆祝他们的胜利，歌唱他们自由美好的生活。广场上有一座朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的铜像，每一个朝鲜人民走过这里，都会想起他们的领袖怎样领导他们赶走了日本侵略者，击败了美帝国主义，给他们带来了今天的幸福。广场的西面是朝鲜内阁大厦，南面是劳动党中央党部大厦，北面是最高人民会议常任委员会大厦。这三座宏伟的建筑，构成一个马蹄的形状，计划在一九五四年动工一部分。在北面那座大建筑的顶上，将有一座高耸的中央高塔，那是象征胜利的高塔，塔上会不时发出宏亮的钟声，鼓舞朝鲜人民从胜利走向胜利。内阁大厦的对面，将有两座风格特殊的建筑：一座是美术博物馆，展览着朝鲜人民优秀的、丰富的文化遗产；一座是解放斗争博物馆，展览着朝鲜人民英雄的遗物。这两座博物馆都是给朝鲜人民进行爱国主义教育的最好场所。
    走过中央广场，是国营百货商店。这里将有各种充足的货物。离百货商店不远的右手边，是著名的有六百年历史的大同门。这座门曾遭过日本帝国主义的摧残，一九五○年又受到美帝国主义的蹂躏，可是他就像朝鲜人民的不屈不挠的坚毅精神一样，至今完整地、坚强地、骄傲地屹立着。在大同门的跟前，将有一条绵延数公里的江边花园，假如在这里游玩的是二十岁以上的朝鲜人，他们会清楚地记得过去这里是一块堆满着帝国主义商品的地方，那时连大同江的水也是污浊的；可是今天江水碧绿，江边将要变成一片美丽的花园。从大同门向东南望去，在一片烟囱林立的地方，就是平壤市的轻工业区。那里有朝鲜最大的纺织厂，这个厂在停战后三个月就转动了一万三千二百个纱锭，到一九五五年六月，将有六万个纱锭投入生产。在建设平壤市的计划中，要加深大同江的河床，使四百吨的轮船，可以毫无阻挡地一直驶入江内。那时，站在大同门上，将看见大同江的下游，有一艘艘的轮船在用起重机装卸货物。从大同门向东望去，将见一幢幢崭新的工人宿舍。在战争时期，朝鲜人民把鲜花养在防空洞、地下室里，今天却养在充满着阳光的窗台或晒台上了。从大同门向东北望去，是浮出江心的秀丽的绫罗岛。朝鲜妇女喜欢穿着鲜艳的绫罗绸缎，这个岛的名字和它的瑰丽，就正像朝鲜妇女所穿的衣裙。绫罗岛上将有一个大运动场，这是平壤市四大运动场之一。假日，如果是顺风，在大同门上将听到从运动场那边传过来的欢呼声。绫罗岛和牡丹峰的中间，计划用一座花岗石装饰的桥梁连接起来，每逢星期日，将看见无数年青的男女工人，驾着一叶叶的小船，穿过桥洞，穿过岛边的轻轻拂着水面的垂柳——享受着用自己的鲜血与生命所保卫的幸福的果实。
    大同门的西面，斯大林路的左边，有一座不高的山坡，上面是一座座巍峨的朝鲜人民的科学院。从科学院沿着斯大林路一直向前走去，靠近斯大林路终点的地方，便是那座跟朝鲜人民的精神生活有密切关联的闻名世界的牡丹峰。牡丹峰是平壤市的文化区，有很多历史悠久的文化古迹。不管是在艰难或幸福的日子里，它一直给朝鲜人民以精神上的极大鼓舞；敌人虽然无数次地在它的头上倾泻了成千成万吨的钢铁，而隐蔽在它肚子里的那个地下剧场，却始终安静地演奏着充满了战斗力量的音乐或戏剧。朝鲜人民是热爱艺术的，现在他们正在牡丹峰上建筑一座有宽阔大理石石阶的、宫殿式的话剧场。一九五四年四月，这座剧场就要为爱好戏剧的朝鲜人民打开它的艺术的大门。
    在话剧场的东北角，牡丹峰的顶端，正对着斯大林路，有一座高耸入云的苏军解放纪念塔。在战争的岁月里，敌人对它扫射了无数的子弹，倒泻了无数的钢铁，可是它始终骄傲地耸立在牡丹峰的峰端上，塔尖上的那颗红星，始终发射出斯大林的胜利的光芒。就是它的光芒，照亮了平壤市的每一个角落，照亮了每一颗朝鲜人民的心，使朝鲜人民在任何困难的情形下，都感到有无穷无尽的力量；它鼓舞着朝鲜人民前进，前进，再前进。
                  ＊＊＊
    在整整的五个钟头里，我仿佛漫游了明日的平壤市斯大林路，又仿佛漫游了神话里的花园似的城市。然而，这是神话么？一幅幅的建设平壤市的蓝图陈设在我们的眼前；肩负着建设平壤市重大责任的年青的主任建筑工程师，是那么坚定地站在我们的面前；楼下大厅里建筑工作者们绘制蓝图时所发出的紧张的沙沙声，不断传到我们的耳朵里；……当我们走出中央都市建设研究所的大门时，我看见许多中国人民志愿军的战士，正在废墟里拣着大石块和水泥块，背着或抬着送到研究所右面的大同江桥头上，桥头上的石块已堆积得像小山一般高了；在研究所左面的正在修建的斯大林路，一队队的朝鲜女工，弯着腰紧张地用石块铺砌着路面，她们要在一九五四年内铺砌一万平方公尺石头；对面远远的牡丹峰上，高耸天际的起重机，像一只巨臂似地把一包包的水泥拿到建筑话剧场的现场上；建设平壤市、建设斯大林路的劳动歌声，在四面八方响起来；……这不是神话，这是一个正在进行的、必然实现的美丽的计划！美帝国主义者把平壤市炸成了一片废墟，但是坚强的朝鲜人民用自己的英勇的劳动一步步地要把废墟变为一座美丽的大花园。
    “三年或十年以后，你们再来平壤时，我一定亲自带你们漫游一周斯大林路，那时你们会觉得斯大林路比我今天讲的更美。”康处?送我们出门时，充满着坚定的信心说。
    是的，在英雄的国度里，现实一定比神话更美丽。
