Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th – The Indian Custodial Forces today illegally handed over seventeen Chiang Kai-shek and Li special agent murderers, who murdered Korean and Chinese POWs, to the U.S. side that instigated their killings. According to reports from American news agencies, the U.S. side, after receiving these murderous criminals, decided to immediately send them back to the Chiang Kai-shek and Li clique.

These seventeen murderous criminals, with their hands stained with the blood of prisoners of war, murdered seven Korean and Chinese POWs who requested repatriation in four compounds of the Tongchang-ri POW camp. Their bloody crimes were not only exposed by dozens of repatriated Korean and Chinese POWs but also confirmed by investigations conducted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces. Among these seventeen murderers, seven were the criminals who brutally murdered Volunteer Army POW Zhang Zilong on October 3rd last year in the 28th compound by disemboweling, heart-digging, flesh-cutting, and burning; eight were the criminals who brutally murdered four Korean People's Army POWs in the 38th compound on December 12th last year by strangling, beating, and trampling; and the other two criminals murdered Korean People's Army POWs Bo Jiecan and Wu Changhuan in the “hospital” compound and the 53rd compound, respectively.

In order to cover up its crime of instigating special agent elements to commit murder, the U.S. side has tried every means to obstruct and disrupt the interrogation of these criminals since the Indian Custodial Forces began the interrogation, making it impossible for the interrogation to proceed. Now, the U.S. side has forced the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to hand over these murderers with conclusive evidence of their crimes to the U.S. side, and disregarding the warning of Chairman Thimayya of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, hand them over to the Chiang Kai-shek and Li clique. In a recent letter to the U.S. side, Thimayya affirmed that these seventeen criminals were the murderers of Korean and Chinese POWs. This sinful act of the U.S. side proves that the U.S. side is the direct instigator and abettor of these murderous criminals. The U.S. side can never escape the punishment of justice and fairness.

    美方要把印度部队非法移交的特务凶手交给蒋李匪帮
    证明美方是这些杀人凶犯的直接指使者
    【新华社开城十八日电】印度看管部队已在今天把十七名谋杀朝中战俘的蒋、李特务凶手，非法地移交给指使他们杀人行凶的美方。据美国通讯社透露，美方在接收这些杀人凶犯以后，就决定立即把他们送还给蒋、李匪帮。
    这十七名双手染满战俘鲜血的杀人罪犯曾在东场里战俘营的四个营场中，谋杀了七名要求遣返的朝中战俘。他们的血腥罪行不仅被数十名遣返归来的朝中战俘所揭露，而且为中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队所调查证实。这十七名凶手中，有七名是在去年十月三日在第二十八号营场中用破腹挖心、割肉火烧的野蛮手段杀害志愿军战俘张子龙的凶犯；八名是在去年十二月十二日在第三十八号营场中用绞勒、毒打和践踏等野蛮手段杀害四个朝鲜人民军战俘的凶犯；另外两名凶犯曾分别在“医院”营场和第五十三号营场杀害了朝鲜人民军战俘钵介灿和吴昌焕。
    美方为了掩饰其指使特务分子杀人行凶的罪行，自印度看管部队开始对这些凶犯审讯以来，就想尽办法进行阻挠和破坏，使得审讯无法进行。现在，美方又强逼中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队把这些罪证确凿的杀人凶犯移交给美方，并且不顾中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅的警告，把他们交还给蒋、李匪帮。蒂迈雅在最近写给美方的信中肯定这十七名罪犯是谋杀朝中战俘的凶手。美方的这种罪恶行动证明：美方是这些杀人凶犯的直接指使者和教唆者。美方决不能逃脱正义和公理的惩罚。
