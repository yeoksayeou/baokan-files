(Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th) The four foreign ministers held their tenth meeting on February 4th, continuing to discuss the second item on the agenda, with Eden as chairman.

    Bidault spoke first. He said he wanted to answer Molotov's accusations against the Bonn and Paris treaties. Bidault once again groundlessly asserted that a unified Germany could freely decide whether to participate in the "European Defence Community," although, as Molotov explained, the obligations imposed on West Germany by the Bonn and Paris treaties refuted this claim. Bidault attempted to obscure the true meaning of Article 7 of the Bonn Treaty, according to which the Western powers and West Germany undertook the obligation to "cooperate" in order to ensure that a unified Germany joined the "European Defence Community," i.e., the Western powers' military bloc against the Soviet Union.

    Bidault attempted to reiterate his argument that the Bonn Treaty did not pre-bind a unified Germany for fifty years and that the Paris Treaty could only be implemented after the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. As for Article 128 of the Paris Treaty, which stipulates that the treaty would be valid for fifty years from the date of its implementation, Bidault made it seem as if this article merely reflected the Western powers' "desire" for the Paris Treaty to be implemented for a long period.

    Bidault said that the Soviet delegation's criticism of the Bonn and Paris treaties and their impact on the future freedom of action of an all-German government was aimed at evading the issue of holding free all-German elections. Equally unfounded was his attempt to suggest that the Soviet proposal to hold an all-German referendum to ascertain whether the German people supported the Bonn and Paris treaties or a peace treaty was also aimed at "obstructing free elections."

    Eden then spoke, merely stating that he fully agreed with Bidault's remarks. He hoped that the meeting would proceed to discuss the issue of holding free all-German elections.

    Molotov then spoke about the road to a unified Germany.

    After Molotov's speech, the Soviet delegation submitted its proposal for the establishment of an all-German provisional government and the holding of free all-German elections to the foreign ministers of France, Britain, and the United States.

    Dulles then spoke, feigning surprise at Molotov's statement that the Soviet government could not accept Eden's plan. Dulles defended Eden's plan, particularly the suggestion that elections in Germany should be held under the supervision of four foreign powers with occupation forces. To this end, Dulles presented the following strange argument: he said that if the occupying countries did not control the conduct of the elections, the Soviet delegation's demands for measures to deal with active anti-democratic organizations and to prevent them from using pressure during the preparation and holding of elections could not be met. In fact, only the Germans themselves, only the democratic forces of Germany, could guarantee the true freedom of German elections, a point Dulles completely ignored. Dulles continued to insist that Eden's plan did not force Germany to join the military blocs of Western European countries, although this claim had been refuted in previous meetings. Finally, Dulles said that he would carefully study the Soviet delegation's proposal.

    Bidault and Eden both said that they wished to speak at the next meeting and would also carefully study Molotov's proposal.

    Molotov then spoke, once again emphasizing the importance of the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation.

    The meeting was then adjourned.

### 四外长会议继续讨论第二项议程

    四外长会议继续讨论第二项议程
   【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社柏林五日讯：四国外长会议于二月四日举行第十次会议，继续讨论第二项议程，由艾登担任主席。
    皮杜尔首先发言。他说，他要回答莫洛托夫对波恩和巴黎条约的责难。皮杜尔再一次毫无根据地断言，一个统一的德国可以自由决定是否参加“欧洲防务集团”的问题，虽然如莫洛托夫所说明的，波恩条约和巴黎条约强加于西德的义务已驳倒了这种说法。皮杜尔企图把波恩条约第七条的真实含义掩盖起来。根据这一条，西方国家和西德承担了“合作”的义务，以便保证使统一的德国加入“欧洲防务集团”，也就是加入西方国家反对苏联的军事集团。
    皮杜尔试图再一次肯定他的论点：波恩条约并不预先把一个统一的德国束缚五十年，而且巴黎条约只能在缔结对德和约之后才能实施。至于巴黎条约第一二八条规定该条约从实施之日起有效期限为五十年一点，皮杜尔把事情说得好像这一条不过反映了西方国家“愿望”巴黎条约实施一个长时期而已。
    皮杜尔说，苏联代表团抨击波恩和巴黎条约及其对于未来的全德政府行动自由的影响，目的是为了规避举行全德自由选举问题。同样毫无根据的是：他还企图说明，苏联建议举行全德公民投票以便弄清德国人民究竟是拥护波恩和巴黎条约还是拥护和约，也是为了“阻挠自由选举”。
    艾登接着发言。他仅仅表示，他完全同意皮杜尔的发言。他希望会议应进而讨论举行全德自由选举的问题。
    莫洛托夫接着发言，谈到统一德国的道路。
    莫洛托夫发言后，将苏联代表团关于成立全德临时政府和举行全德自由选举的建议交给法国、英国、美国的外交部长。
    杜勒斯接着发言。他对于莫洛托夫所说苏联政府不能接受艾登提出的计划一点假装惊奇。杜勒斯为艾登计划中提出的一点建议——德国的选举应在四个派有占领军的外国的监督下举行——辩护。为此，杜勒斯提出了下面奇怪的论点：他说，如果占领国家不控制选举的进行，苏联代表团的关于采取措施来对付积极的反民主组织并制止它们在筹备和举行选举期间使用压力的要求，就无法予以满足。事实上，只有德国人自己，只有德国的民主力量才能保障德国选举的真正自由，杜勒斯对这却只字不提。杜勒斯仍然坚持说，艾登的计划并未强迫德国参加西欧国家的军事集团，虽然这种说法在前几次会议的讨论中已被驳倒。最后，杜勒斯说，他将仔细地研究苏联代表团的建议。
    皮杜尔和艾登都说，他们希望延至下次会议再发言，并且也将仔细地研究莫洛托夫提出的建议。
    莫洛托夫接着发言，再一次着重指出苏联代表团所提出的建议的重要性。
    会议至此休会。
