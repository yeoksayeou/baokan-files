    People's Representative Zhao Songqiu
    Zhao Chuan, Xiao Su
    Zhao Songqiu will never forget that happy day. On August 8th of last year, after an election meeting was held in a voting district on Hengyang Street in Heping District, Shenyang City, Zhao Songqiu walked home from the meeting hall, holding flowers and her certificate of election. As soon as she entered the courtyard, her eldest daughter, Jingyan, shouted:
    "People's Representative Mom is back!"
    Three-year-old Jingyang also jumped and shouted:
      "Welcome, welcome!"
    Neighbors in the same courtyard came to congratulate her one after another; her home was as lively as a festival. The children scrambled to see the fountain pen their father had given their mother. A child named Jingping said, "Dad, when I grow up and become a People's Representative, will you buy me a doll with eyes that move?" This made the whole family laugh.
    That evening, after her husband and children had gone to sleep, Zhao Songqiu opened the diary her husband had given her and wrote the following diary entry for her first day as a People's Representative: "Today is the most glorious and exciting day of my life. In the election meeting, the voters enthusiastically elected me as their People's Representative. At that moment, my heart was pounding with excitement. Everyone trusts me, and I can't let them down! If it weren't for the Communist Party's education, I wouldn't be where I am today! Serving the people is not just a slogan, and I expressed my determination to everyone. ..."

    Zhao Songqiu, the wife of a technician and mother of six children, encountered difficulties as soon as she became a People's Representative. The many affairs of the family were not so important, because she had already resolved to serve the masses first and find time to handle her own family matters; the difficulty was the work. How exactly should she fulfill the glorious duty of a People's Representative? She pondered this question countless times. Finally, she came up with some ideas, but she wasn't sure, so she went to the police station to consult with the household registration officer. The household registration officer gave her an idea: visit the voters. Zhao Songqiu said, "This is indeed a good way. People's Representatives can only discover problems and serve the people by getting close to the masses. But I'm not familiar with many people, so how can I visit them?" The household registration officer told her, "Everyone elected you, so they will definitely support you. You'll be unfamiliar the first time, but familiar the second. As time goes on, even if you don't go looking for them, they'll surely come looking for you." With the help of the household registration officer, Zhao Songqiu made a plan to visit the voters: which residents' groups to visit, which factories to visit, how to understand the issues, and so on.
    And so began this People's Representative's work of visiting the voters.
    Zhao Songqiu recalled with pleasure the warm welcome she received from the workers when she first visited the Yun Jihao Iron Factory:
    "As soon as I entered, the workers said, 'The People's Representative is here!' They moved chairs, poured tea, and made me feel so overwhelmed that I didn't know what to say. But when we started talking, it felt like we were family. I thought of my unnecessary concerns from before and felt a little ridiculous."
    Visiting the voters became her main daily task. When the children were awake, she would hold them and visit places further away. When the children were sleeping at home, she would visit voters closer to home.
    On August 19th of last year, Zhao Songqiu visited the 18th Residents' Group. The women in the courtyard at 45 North Sixth Road reported that the chimney of the Yichang Iron Factory was too low, and black smoke poured into the windows of nearby residents all day long. The residents of the 45th courtyard couldn't open their windows. The masses had raised this issue with the factory, but the problem had not been resolved. Zhao Songqiu, in her capacity as People's Representative, raised the issue with the Yichang Iron Factory. In less than a week, the factory chimney was raised. The women near the factory were very satisfied with their representative.
    One day, a voter from the 16th Residents' Group brought a housewife named Jia Xiuping to Zhao Songqiu. Jia Xiuping tearfully recounted her suffering from her husband's abuse: Jia Xiuping's husband was a businessman who had been punished by the court in the past for abusing his wife, but he had never repented. Recently, when Jia Xiuping appealed to the court, a judge listened only to the businessman's lies, without listening to the opinions of the masses, and therefore the matter was not handled properly. After learning the truth, Zhao Songqiu comforted Jia Xiuping, saying, "The new society does not allow such phenomena to exist. Don't be sad, I will definitely help you solve this." She wrote down the results of her investigation that night and sent them to the relevant leading authorities the next day. The leading cadres of the court examined the work based on her materials, re-examined and reasonably handled Jia Xiuping's case, and criticized the judge who had a bureaucratic work style.
    The voters reported their opinions on the Hengyang Street Consumer Cooperative to Zhao Songqiu: the sanitation in the non-staple food section was not good, and sometimes the vegetables sold were partially rotten. After Zhao Songqiu visited the director of the Hengyang Street Consumer Cooperative, the cooperative accepted the opinions of the masses and improved its sanitation work.
    Zhao Songqiu's diary frequently recorded various problems and things to be done for the masses: the issue of Grandma Song's military family certificate, the issue of treating the disaster victims who came to Aunt Meng's house, as well as Jia Xiuping's abuse by her husband and Yang Baolan's employment problem... There were many things to do, some of which had been completed, and some of which were being processed. Since being elected, Zhao Songqiu had visited more than 550 households, accounting for four-fifths of the households in the entire voting district. She collected more than 180 proposals and things to do for the masses. For the problems that the masses requested to be solved, she solved them immediately if she could; if she could not solve them herself, she organized them one by one and transferred them to the relevant authorities for handling. Some problems were reflected in letters to the Shenyang Daily; some general problems she organized into proposals in preparation for submitting them to the district People's Congress for handling. In order to reflect the opinions and demands of the masses, Zhao Songqiu visited many agencies such as the Shenyang Municipal People's Procuratorate, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Housing Administration Bureau, and the Heping District People's Government.
    Zhao Songqiu's enthusiastic service won the love and trust of the voters. The voters in the second voting district said, "With a People's Representative, we don't hold back any of our innermost thoughts." People affectionately called Zhao Songqiu "Representative Zhao." In the past, she had to rely on visiting every unfamiliar family to learn about the situation; now, people automatically come to "Representative Zhao" when they have something to say, to tell her their wishes and difficulties, and to ask her for ideas.
    The trust of the people and the support of various government agencies strengthened Zhao Songqiu's sense of responsibility and glory, and she felt more energetic and reliable in her work.

    Last winter, the Shenyang Municipal Election Committee and the Shenyang Daily invited Zhao Songqiu to give a report to more than 250 People's Representatives from various districts, introducing her work experience. People's Representatives from the Zhishu Street in the Beishi District took the initiative to visit her, learning from her how to contact voters and serve the masses. After holding a discussion with all the People's Representatives in the Beiguan District, they understood how to proactively solve problems for the masses and organize proposals. When Zhao Songqiu introduced her working methods and experiences to people, she often summarized her experiences in this way: "The most important thing for a People's Representative is to have determination and ideals. What is determination? It is to serve the people wholeheartedly. What is an ideal? It is the industrialization and socialism of our country, which is also the long-term vision, which is also happiness! Every time I think of these, I feel that I have done too little for the country and the people."
    It is such a beautiful ideal and strong determination that inspires her to move forward continuously.
    "My work still has shortcomings," Zhao Songqiu said. "I am not very good at relying on the strength of the organization. Recently, the nine People's Representatives in our street have formed a group, and I have been elected as the deputy group leader. Everyone discussed and decided to divide the work according to the voting districts to carry out activities to contact voters, and to hold regular meetings to exchange work situations and experiences. In the future, I will also contact street cadres more. In order to complete the task well, I must study harder!"

    人民代表赵松秋
    赵川、萧溯
    赵松秋永远忘不了那个幸福的日子。去年八月八日，沈阳市和平区衡阳街的一个选区开过了选举大会以后，赵松秋拿着鲜花和当选证从会场走回家来。一进院，她的大女儿敬盐就喊：
    “人民代表妈妈回来啦！”
    三岁的小敬阳也连蹦带跳地喊：
      “欢迎，欢迎！”
    同院的邻居不断地来道贺；她家热闹得像过节一样。孩子们争着看爸爸送给妈妈的钢笔，名叫敬平的孩子说：“爸爸，等我长大当上人民代表，你给我买个眼睛会动的洋囡囡行不？”说得全家都笑了。
    那天晚间，在丈夫和孩子们睡了之后，赵松秋翻开丈夫送给她的日记本，写下了当选人民代表第一天的日记：“今天，是我有生以来最光荣、最兴奋的日子。在选举大会上，选民们热情地把我选为人民代表。当时我激动得心里怦怦直跳，大家信任我，我可不能辜负大家的期望！要不是共产党的教育，我哪能有今天！为人民服务不只是一句口号，我向大家表示了决心。……”
            ×　×　×
    赵松秋，这个技术人员的妻子、六个孩子的妈妈，刚刚当上人民代表，困难就来了。家里的事情多还不要紧，因为她已下决心要先为群众办事，抽时间处理自己家庭的事务；困难的是工作。究竟怎样来完成人民代表的光荣职责呢？为了这个问题，她不知翻来覆去想过多少遍。最后她想出了一些办法，可是没有把握，就去派出所找户籍员商量。户籍员帮她出了个主意：访问选民。赵松秋说：“这的确是个好办法，人民代表和群众接近才能发现问题，给群众办事。可是许多人我都不熟识，怎么访问呢？”户籍员告诉她：“大家选了你，就一定会支持你。一回生、两回熟，日子一长，你不去找，大伙也准来找你。”赵松秋在户籍员的帮助下订了一个访问选民的计划：访问哪个居民组、哪个工厂，如何了解问题，等等。
    这位人民代表访问选民的工作就这样开始了。
    赵松秋用愉快的心情来回忆她第一次访问云记号铁工厂时受到工人们热情欢迎的情形：
    “我一进门，工人们就说，人民代表来了！他们搬椅子，倒茶，弄得我不知说啥好，可是，谈起来却像一家人似的。我想起以前那种不必要的顾虑，真有点可笑。”
    访问选民成了她每天主要的工作。孩子醒的时候，她就抱着孩子到较远的地方去访问，孩子在家睡觉的时候，她就去访问离家较近的选民。
    去年八月十九日，赵松秋到十八居民组去访问。北六马路四十五号院里的妇女们反映：怡昌铁工厂的烟囱太低，冒出的黑烟一天到晚往附近居民的窗子里灌，四十五号院里的住户，谁家也不能开窗户。群众向厂方提过意见，但是问题一直没有得到解决。赵松秋便以人民代表的身分向怡昌铁工厂提出了意见，这以后不到一星期，工厂烟囱就接高了。工厂附近的妇女们对自己的代表非常满意。
    有一天，十六居民组的选民领着一个名叫贾秀萍的家庭妇女去找赵松秋。贾秀萍向她哭诉受丈夫虐待的悲苦遭遇：贾秀萍的丈夫是个商人，过去曾因虐待妻子受到法院惩罚，但他一直毫无悔改。最近贾秀萍向法院申诉时，某审判员却片面听信那个商人的谎言，不倾听群众的意见，因此处理得不够妥善。赵松秋了解了真实情况之后，安慰贾秀萍说：“新社会不允许这种现象存在，你不要难过，我一定帮你解决。”她连夜把自己调查的情况写成书面材料，第二天就送到有关领导机关。法院领导干部根据她的材料检查了工作，重新合理地处理了贾秀萍的案件，并批评了那个有官僚主义作风的审判员。
    选民们向赵松秋反映了对衡阳街消费合作社的意见：副食品部卫生状况不好，有时卖的蔬菜已部分腐烂。在赵松秋访问衡阳街消费合作社主任之后，合作社接受了群众的意见，改进了卫生工作。
    赵松秋的日记里，经常记载着各种各样的问题和要为群众办的事情：什么松大娘的军属证问题，什么孟大嫂家来的灾民治病问题，以及贾秀萍受丈夫虐待问题和杨宝兰就业问题……事情多得很，有的已经办完，有的正在办理。从当选以后，赵松秋访问过五百五十多户选民，占全选区住户的五分之四。她搜集的提案和为群众办的事共有一百八十多件。对于群众要求解决的问题，凡是能够解决的，她就立时给解决；自己不能解决的，就逐条加以整理，转送有关机关处理，有的问题则写信反映给沈阳日报社；有些带普遍性的问题她就整理成提案，准备提交区人民代表大会处理。为了反映群众的意见和要求，赵松秋曾访问过沈阳市人民检察署、沈阳市人民政府房产局、和平区人民政府等许多机关。
    赵松秋热情的服务赢得了选民们的爱戴和信任。第二选区的选民们说：“有了人民代表，咱们的心里话一点也不留了。”人们亲切地称呼赵松秋为“赵代表”。过去她要靠访问每一个陌生的家庭，才能了解到情况；现在人们有事就自动来找“赵代表”，向她述说自己的心愿和困难，请她帮助出主意。
    人民群众的信任和各个政府机关的支持，更加强了赵松秋的责任心和光荣感，她觉得工作起来更有劲，更有依靠了。

    去年冬天，沈阳市选举委员会和沈阳日报社邀请赵松秋给各区的二百五十多名人民代表作报告，介绍她的工作经验；北市区直属街的人民代表主动来访问她，向她学习如何联系选民，为群众办事；北关区全体人民代表同她举行座谈以后，懂得了如何主动给群众解决问题和整理提案。赵松秋在向人们介绍自己的工作方法和经验时，常常这样来概括自己的体会：“做人民代表最重要的是要有决心，有理想。什么是决心？就是全心全意为人民服务。什么是理想？就是我们国家的工业化和社会主义，这也就是远景，也就是幸福啊！每当想到这些，我就感到我为国家和人民做的事情太少了。”
    就是这样美好的理想和坚强的决心在鼓舞着她不断地前进。
    “我的工作还有缺点，”赵松秋说，“我还不大会依靠组织的力量。最近我们街道的九位人民代表已经组成一个小组，我被选为副小组长。大家商量决定，按选区分工进行联系选民的活动，定期开碰头会，交流工作情况和经验；今后我还要多和街道干部联系。为了很好地完成任务，我更要努力学习！”
