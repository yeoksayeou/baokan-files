    One Hundred and Five Factories in Shenyang City
    Comprehensively Overfulfilled January Production Plans
    One hundred and five state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang City comprehensively overfulfilled their January production plans. Among them, more than ten factories, such as Shenyang Textile Factory, Shenyang Paper Mill, and Shenyang No. 7 Rubber Factory, completed their monthly plans two or four days ahead of schedule. The factories in Shenyang City that comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan achieved higher output value, variety plans, and quality indicators in January than the actual figures completed in December of last year. For example, the total production value actually completed by Shenyang Water Pump Factory in January of this year increased by more than 26% compared with December of last year. All 675 water pumps produced in January of this year were first-class products. The completion of plans by various factories in Shenyang City in January of this year was better than in the same period last year. According to statistics from 34 state-owned factories, the number of factories that comprehensively completed their plans increased by more than 25% compared with the same period last year.
    The reason why state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang City were able to comprehensively complete the January plan is that, in addition to the full preparations made by each factory last year, the main reason is that the broad masses of workers, after studying the general line, clearly recognized the relationship between completing the state plan and increasing socialist economic components, and therefore displayed a high degree of initiative in production. In January of this year, many departments and office personnel in some factories also went deep into the workshops to help workers solve key problems in production in a timely manner. For example, after the technical personnel and workers of Shenyang Smelting Plant jointly solved long-standing technical problems, 19 of the 33 quotas of the plant in January were higher than the quotas in December of last year. Han Shuwen's group at Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory learned from Soviet casting experience in the competition, which doubled the casting efficiency and completed the January plan 16 days ahead of schedule. Employees of Shenyang No. 7 Rubber Factory researched a simplified method of vulcanizing tires, which greatly shortened the tire production process. In January, the factory produced more than 9,000 additional tires.

    沈阳市一百零五个工厂
    全面超额完成一月份生产计划
    【新华社沈阳九日电】沈阳市有一百零五个国营和地方国营工厂全面超额完成了一月份的生产计划。其中沈阳纺织厂、沈阳造纸厂、沈阳第七橡胶厂等十多个工厂都提前两天或四天完成了全月计划。沈阳市全面超额完成国家计划的工厂，一月份完成的产值、品种计划及质量指标，都比去年十二月份实际完成的高。如沈阳水泵厂今年一月份实际完成的生产总值，比去年十二月份提高了百分之二十六以上。今年一月份生产的六百七十五台水泵全部是一级品。今年一月份，沈阳市各工厂完成计划的情况比去年同时期较好。据三十四个国营工厂的统计，全面完成计划的工厂，比去年同一时期上升了百分之二十五以上。
    沈阳市国营和地方国营工厂能够全面地完成一月份计划，除各厂去年进行了充分准备外，主要是广大职工经过总路线的学习，明确地认识到完成国家计划和增长社会主义经济成分的关系，所以在生产上发挥了高度的积极性。今年一月份，有不少工厂的科、室人员，还深入车间，帮助工人及时地解决了生产中的关键问题。如沈阳冶炼厂技术人员和工人共同解决了长期不能解决的技术问题以后，该厂一月份三十三种定额中，有十九种比去年十二月份的定额提高了。沈阳低压开关厂韩述文小组，在竞赛中学习苏联铸造经验，使铸造效率提高一倍，提前十六天完成了一月份计划。沈阳第七橡胶厂职工们研究出硫化轮胎简化法，使轮胎生产过程大大缩短。一月份，该厂多生产了九千多条轮胎。
