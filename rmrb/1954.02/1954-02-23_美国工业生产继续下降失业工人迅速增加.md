Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd, New York dispatch: Recent facts demonstrate that the economic crisis in the United States is deepening and developing.

    The Federal Reserve Board announced on the 15th that US industrial production continued to decline by approximately 1.6% in January of this year. This is the sixth consecutive month of production declines. The Board published an industrial production index of 125 for January (1947-49 = 100), which is 9% lower than in July of last year. Federal Reserve Board economist Leffler admitted on the 16th that the recent economic downturn was "more drastic" than Eisenhower had stated in his economic message. He said that the decline in industrial production in the six and a half months since last July "equaled" the "entire decline" of the 1948-1949 crisis. According to press reports, the enterprises currently experiencing production declines include not only a large number of important industrial sectors that manufacture means of production, but also many important industrial sectors that produce means of subsistence. The heavy machinery manufacturing industry, the steel industry, the non-ferrous metals industry, the automobile industry, the coal mining industry, the textile industry, the household appliance industry, and even the chemical industry are all in "recession." It is particularly noteworthy that the decline in durable goods production is continuing to develop in January and February. According to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, automobile production for the week ending February 6 was 13% lower than in the first week of January.

    The number of unemployed workers is rapidly increasing. The Department of Commerce announced on the 16th that, according to the department's survey of approximately 450 counties in 230 areas, the unemployment figure for early January of this year was more than 720,000 higher than the department's original unemployment figure, bringing the total to over three million. In mid-January, hundreds of thousands more industrial workers lost their jobs. The severity of unemployment in the United States today can be seen in the fact that the U.S. President has felt compelled to personally step forward to reassure the public. At a press conference on the 17th, Eisenhower assured that if the employment situation continues to worsen next month, the U.S. government will take emergency measures to deal with the extraordinary situation. And in March, due to the needs of agriculture and other seasonal work, the number of employed people will usually increase somewhat.

    Today, the U.S. economy is declining not only in terms of production but also in terms of sales. In January of this year, the total sales of the U.S. retail industry decreased by 3% compared to January of last year, and by 1% compared to December of last year. According to the U.S. press, in December of last year, the sales of furniture and other household goods had already decreased by 6% compared to the same period in 1952, and the sales of ready-made clothing had even decreased by 12%.

    U.S. official spokesmen and propagandists of monopoly capital are trying their best to convince the American public that there is no economic crisis. But the deceptive propaganda they are making for this purpose has not achieved the desired effect. The "Wall Street Journal" recently wrote that farmers are uneasy about their reduced income, workers are increasingly alarmed by unemployment and reduced working hours, and at the same time, huge unsold inventories are causing industrialists to react sadly. In this situation, consumers are becoming more reluctant to spend their purchasing power, and industrialists and businessmen are more eager to clear their inventories, which makes the sales market situation even worse.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd, New York dispatch: The New York stock market has recently deteriorated again.

    According to the Associated Press, on the 16th, stock prices "plummeted sharply" on the market, with prices falling to their lowest level since the beginning of the year. All types of stocks on the market fell in price, and even many "red stocks" that had recently risen in price also fell. In total, the average price of the sixty stocks tracked by the agency fell by one dollar and twenty cents, the largest drop since mid-September of last year.

    In summarizing the situation of the stock market over the past week, an Associated Press dispatch on the 21st pointed out that the stock market was unfavorable, and that the stock market had not "recovered from the shock" after the 16th, with stock prices falling for the first time in 1954. The agency asked:

   "Will the current downward trend continue?" It answered itself: "Yes."

### 美国工业生产继续下降失业工人迅速增加

    美国工业生产继续下降失业工人迅速增加
   【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：最近许多事实说明，美国经济危机在加深发展中。
    联邦储备局十五日宣布，今年一月份美国工业生产继续下降约百分之一点六。这是生产连续下降的第六个月发表的了。该局发表的一月份工业生产指数为一百二十五（一九四七—四九年为一百），比去年七月份低百分之九。联邦储备局经济学家雷夫勒十六日承认：最近经济的下跌比艾森豪威尔在经济咨文中所说的“更为剧烈”。他说，工业生产在从去年七月以来的六个半月中的下降“等于”一九四八—一九四九年危机的“全部下降”。据报刊消息说，目前生产下降的企业不但包括大批制造生产资料的重要工业部门，而且还包括许多生产生活资料的重要工业部门。重型机器制造工业、钢铁工业、非铁金属工业、汽车工业、煤矿工业，纺织工业、家庭用具工业以至化学工业等等都在“衰退”，特别值得注意的是，耐用品生产方面的下降，一月和二月份在继续发展中。据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说，到二月六日为止一周中汽车的生产比一月第一周减少百分之十三。
    失业工人正在迅速增加。商务部十六日宣布，根据该部对二百三十个地区约四百五十个县的调查，今年一月初的失业数字比该部原先的失业数字多出七十二万多人，总数已超过三百万。在一月份中间，又有几十万产业工人失去了工作。美国今日失业情况的严重，可以从美国总统已感到必须亲自出面来安定人心的行动中看出来。艾森豪威尔在十七日的记者招待会上保证说，如果就业情况在下月继续恶化，美国政府将采取应付非常时期的紧急措施。而三月份因为农业和其他季节性工作的需要，就业人数照例会有些增加的。
    今日美国经济不仅在生产方面而且在销售方面都在走下坡路。今年一月份，美国零售业的售货总额比去年一月下降了百分之三，比去年十二月下降了百分之一。据美国报刊说，在去年十二月，家具与其他家庭用品的推销量已经比一九五二年同期减少了百分之六，现成衣服的推销量甚至减少百分之十二。
    美国官方发言人和垄断资本的宣传家竭力想使美国公众相信并没有发生经济危机的问题。但他们为此目的而作的欺骗宣传并没有收到预期的效果。“华尔街日报”最近写道：农民对于他们收入减少感到不安，工人对于失业以及工作时间减少越来越感到惊慌，同时，卖不出去的庞大存货也引起工业家们悲哀的反应。在这种情况下，消费者更加吝惜他们的购买力，而工商业者更急于出清存货，就使得销售市场情况更加恶化。
    【新华社二十二日讯】纽约消息：纽约股票市场最近再度恶化。
    据美联社的消息说，在十六日的市场上，股票价格“急转直下”，行情跌落至今年以来的最低水平。市场上所有各类股票都有下跌，甚至许多最近曾经涨价的“红股票”也都跌价。总计该社统计的六十种股票平均价格一共下跌了一元二角，成为去年九月中旬以来最大的一次大跌价。
    美联社二十一日消息在总结过去一周股票市场的情况时指出：股票行市是不利的，十六日以后股票市场并没有“从震动中恢复过来”，股票价格出现了一九五四年以来第一次的下跌。该社问道：
  “目前下跌的趋势是不是会继续下去呢？”它自己回答说：“会的”。
