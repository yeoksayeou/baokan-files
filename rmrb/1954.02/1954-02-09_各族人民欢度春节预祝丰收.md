People of All Ethnic Groups Celebrate the Spring Festival and Wish for a Bountiful Harvest

    The Joy of the Military and Civilians in Lhasa
    The Tibetan people of Lhasa and the Chinese People's Liberation Army joyfully celebrated their third Tibetan New Year since liberation. Residents, with the help of the Lhasa Municipal Sanitation Team, cleaned the streets thoroughly. Every household whitewashed their houses. Many families made rich pastries with ghee and wheat flour, brewed highland barley sweet wine, and, according to their national customs, displayed dyed wheat ears and tender green highland barley seedlings in their scripture halls to wish for a bountiful harvest this year.
    On the Tibetan New Year (February 4th), before dawn, Tibetans carried "auspicious water" from the Lhasa River and congratulated each other with ghee tsampa and highland barley. Groups of young men and women, and children, sang and played in the streets with colorful balloons. At night, firecrackers echoed throughout the city.
    On New Year's Eve, the Dalai Lama specially sent a representative to offer New Year's greetings to General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni also wrote inscriptions on the Tibetan-language News Bulletin published during the Spring Festival, wishing for the further consolidation of the unity of the Tibetan and Han nationalities. During the Spring Festival, the agencies and troops of the PLA Tibet Military Region stationed in Lhasa and the Tibetan people carried out activities of mutual gift-giving and New Year greetings, and held joint military-civilian gatherings or forums to celebrate the Spring Festival.
    Before the Spring Festival, the Lhasa market was filled with a festive atmosphere. Farmers and herdsmen from various regions transported ghee, dried beef and mutton, and fat pigs. Pulun, embroidered Tibetan boots, flower cushions, and gold-inlaid flower hats were all available in large quantities. Silk fabrics, porcelain, noodles, vermicelli, and red dates from the interior were also brought in by merchants in a timely manner. Many stores were piled high with newly transported tea. In the past two months, 30,000 to 40,000 packages of tea have been transported from Xikang, Yunnan, and other places. Due to the bumper harvests in major agricultural and pastoral areas of Tibet last year, and the increasingly frequent commercial exchanges between Tibet and the motherland, the prices of daily necessities and general merchandise such as grain, ghee, tea, and cloth in the market have generally decreased by about 10% to 20% compared with December last year.

    The People of All Ethnic Groups in Labrang Happily Celebrate the Spring Festival
    The people of all ethnic groups in Labrang, the capital of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region, happily celebrated the first Spring Festival since the establishment of the autonomous region.
    On New Year's Eve, the streets and alleys were cleaned spotlessly, and people were busy purchasing and making Spring Festival supplies and food. Spring Festival couplets in Tibetan and Chinese were posted at the entrances of government offices and residences. In the evening, the entrances of various scripture halls and Buddha halls in Labrang Monastery were sprinkled with various patterns symbolizing auspiciousness with white lime. Monks went to the Jamyang Buddha Hall to "pay homage to the Buddha" and "bid farewell to the old year." In front of every house, juniper branches were burned in mani stoves, and the city was lit up with lights. The sounds of firecrackers and cheers continued all night.
    Early in the morning on the first day of the Spring Festival, leading comrades of the autonomous region and Xiahe County went to congratulate the Jamyang Living Buddha on the Spring Festival. The Jamyang Living Buddha and the various Nangqian and academies of the monastery also sent representatives to present "Hada" to the heads of various agencies. Cadres and soldiers of various agencies and troops, and people of all ethnic groups, congratulated each other. The Hui people respected the customs of the Tibetan and Han people, sending gifts and paying New Year's greetings to the Tibetan and Han people. The Tibetan people used their best festive foods to entertain the Han and Hui people. In recent days, whenever the sun shone on the Xiahe River, groups of Tibetan people, dressed in bright festive costumes, danced and sang in the square. The broadcaster constantly played pleasant ethnic songs. Workers of all ethnic groups building the Lanlang Highway and soldiers of a certain army unit also performed Yangko dances and short plays in the streets. As usual, the Tibetan people near Labrang held a folk-style horse racing meeting on the third day of the lunar new year, with an audience of over 10,000 people.

    New Atmosphere of Happy Labor in Zhuang Villages
    In the Yongning County area in the southern part of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the weather is now warm and sunny, and people have put on lined or single-layer clothing. The tall eucalyptus trees, umbrella-shaped banyan trees, banana trees, and bamboo fences are all lush green. We visited Niutoupo here. The village is very clean, and the door of the supply and marketing cooperative is crowded with people all day long. On average, each household bought four or five catties of pork, and many people bought cloth to make new clothes for the New Year. Most of the Zhuang farmers live in small tile-roofed houses, and many new houses have been built at the entrance of the village. Almost every household raises fat pigs and geese and ducks. The rice fields outside the village have all been plowed, the winter-sown "buckwheat" is blooming with white flowers, the winter wheat has also produced details, and the sugarcane is being harvested. Young men and women are busy digging pond mud for fertilizer, and some are building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects.
    On the Spring Festival day, the village became active before dawn. Firecrackers went off continuously, and people went to the well to fetch water, and casually broke off bunches of flowers, grass, and bamboo branches to bring back. Drawing water on the Spring Festival morning means that this year will be a bountiful harvest. The lion dance team is comforting the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, the young and middle-aged people are playing ball at the village basketball court, and many people are watching the newly released wall newspaper. Before liberation, few people worked and produced after the autumn harvest. For one or two months before and after the New Year, gambling and playing "romance houses" (i.e., improper relationships between men and women) were prevalent, and even fighting occurred, forming disunity between villages or households. Now a new atmosphere of happy labor is everywhere.
    Niutoupo is an ordinary mountain village in the autonomous region with seventy-six households. All the children are in school, and people who could not afford to marry in the past are now married and have children. The land reform was implemented in 1951, and forty-one poor farmers rose to become middle peasants. Later, the village expanded the cultivated area by more than 130 mu and also built three water conservancy projects, turning 600 mu of dry land into paddy fields. With the support of the people's government, the farmers of Niutoupo have continuously improved their farming techniques. Every family has bought plows, and many production tools have been added. The amount of fertilizer applied has greatly increased compared to before. The whole village has organized three perennial mutual aid teams and some temporary mutual aid teams. Although Niutoupo encountered a severe drought last year, it still increased grain production. After the development of production, many families who used to starve for half a year can now eat four meals a day. Ninety percent of the farmers have surplus grain. Before the Spring Festival, the village sold more than 70,000 catties of surplus grain to support national construction, and about half of the money from the sale of grain was sent to the bank for savings.

    各族人民欢度春节预祝丰收
    拉萨军民的喜悦
    西藏拉萨市藏族人民和中国人民解放军一道欢乐地度过了解放后的第三个藏历春节。居民们在拉萨市清洁卫生队的帮助下，把大小街道打扫得干干净净。家家户户都用白土粉刷了房屋。许多人家用酥油和麦面制成丰美的点心，酿好了青稞甜酒，还按照本民族的风俗在经堂里陈列起染色的麦穗和嫩绿的青稞苗，来预祝今年丰收。
    藏历春节（二月四日）这天，天还没亮，藏胞们就从拉萨河里背回了“吉祥水”，捧着酥油糌粑和青稞互相贺年道喜。成群的男女青年和儿童，举着各色气球在街头歌唱游玩。入夜，市区到处响起了鞭炮声。
    除夕，达赖喇嘛特地派出代表向中央人民政府代表张经武将军贺年，并和班禅额尔德尼在春节出版的藏文新闻简讯上题词，祝贺藏汉民族的团结更加巩固。春节期间，人民解放军西藏军区驻拉萨的机关、部队和藏族人民，开展了互相送礼贺年的活动，并举行军民联欢会或军民座谈会，欢度春节。
    春节前，拉萨市场便充满了节日的景象。各地的农牧民运来了酥油、干牛羊肉、肥猪等。氆氇、绣花藏靴、花垫和镶金花帽都大量上市。内地的绸缎、瓷器及挂面、粉条、红枣也由商家及时运到。许多商店都堆满了新运来的茶叶。近两个月来，有三四万包茶叶从西康、云南等地运来。由于去年西藏各主要农、牧地区获得了丰收，西藏和祖国内地的商业往来又日益频繁，市场上粮食、酥油、茶叶、布匹等生活必需品和百货的价格比去年十二月份普遍下降了百分之十到百分之二十左右。
    拉卜楞各族人民愉快地度过春节
    甘南藏族自治区首府——拉卜楞各族人民愉快地度过了自治区成立后第一个春节。
    除夕，大街小巷都打扫得干干净净，人们忙着购置、赶制春节用品和食品，机关、住宅门口都张贴了藏、汉文的春节对联。晚上，拉卜楞寺各经堂、佛殿门口，都用白石灰撒上了象征吉祥的各种图案，僧众到嘉木样佛殿“朝佛”“辞岁”。每家门前嘛呢炉里，燃烧起柏枝，市区一片灯火，爆竹声和欢呼声通宵不绝。
    春节早上天刚亮，自治区和夏河县各机关负责同志向嘉木样活佛祝贺春节，嘉木样活佛及寺院各囊谦、学院也推派代表向各机关首长献“哈达”。各机关、部队的干部、战士和各族人民相互祝贺，回民尊重藏、汉民的风俗习惯，给藏、汉民送礼拜节，藏族人民用他们最好的节日食品，招待汉、回族人民。连日来，每当太阳照耀到大夏河的时候，成群结队的藏族人民，穿着艳丽的节日盛装，在广场上歌舞。播音器不断地播送着悦耳的民族歌曲。修筑兰郎公路各族工人和驻军某部战士，也在街头演出了秧歌和短剧。拉卜楞附近藏民，照例在旧历初三日举行了具有民族形式的赛马大会，观众达万人以上。
    僮族农村欢乐劳动的新气象
    在桂西僮族自治区南部的邕宁县一带，现在正是风和日暖的时候，人们已穿上了裌衣或单衣。高高的桉树、伞形的榕树以及香蕉树、篱笆般的竹子，一片葱绿。我们访问了这儿的牛头坡。村子里打扫得很整洁，供销合作社的门前，一天到晚拥挤着人群，平均每户买了四、五斤猪肉，很多人买布缝制了新衣过年。僮族农民大都住着小小的瓦房，村头上新盖起不少房屋。几乎每家都养着肥猪和鹅、鸭。村外的稻田已全部翻耕，冬种的“三角麦”开放着白色的花朵，冬小麦也抽出了细节，甘蔗已在收割了。青年男女们正忙着挖塘坭做肥料，有的修建小型农田水利工程。
    春节那天，天不明村子里就活跃起来了。鞭炮连响，人们都到井边挑水，随手还折了一束束花草、竹枝带回去。春节早晨汲水是表示今年能丰收的意思。舞狮队在慰问革命军人家属烈士家属，青壮年在村头篮球场赛球，还有许多人围着看新出的墙报。解放前，这里秋收后就很少有人劳动生产，过年前后的一两个月，盛行赌钱、玩“风流馆”（即不正当的男女关系），甚至发生械斗，形成村与村或户与户的不团结。现在到处呈现了欢乐劳动的新气象。
    牛头坡是自治区一个普通的山村，有七十六户人家。孩子们都进了学校，过去娶不起妻子的人现在也结婚有了孩子。一九五一年实行了土地改革，有四十一户贫苦农民上升为中农。后来全村扩大耕地面积一百三十多亩，还修建了三处水利工程，使六百亩旱地变为水田。在人民政府的扶助下，牛头坡的农民不断改进耕作技术，家家买了耕牛，生产工具也添购很多，施肥量比以前大大增加了，全村已组织了三个常年互助组和一些临时互助组。去年虽然遇到严重的旱灾，牛头坡还增产了粮食。生产发展以后，许多过去一年挨着半年饿的人家，现在能一日四餐，百分之九十的农户有了余粮，春节前村里卖了七万多斤余粮支援国家建设，卖粮的钱约有一半被送到银行去储蓄了。（新华社）
