To ensure the supply of means of production for spring plowing by cooperatives at all levels throughout the Nanchong Special District, Sichuan Province, the Nanchong Special District Cooperative Office organized three work teams to conduct inspections in eight counties and cities, including Xichong, Nanbu, Yingshan, and Nanchong City. According to incomplete statistics, the eight counties and cities have prepared 8.8 million jin of various oil cakes and more than 50,000 pieces of iron, bamboo, and wooden farm tools.

The Xichong County United Cooperative held several meetings to ensure the supply of means of production and formulated a specific supply plan: preparing 1.2 million jin of spring plowing fertilizer, strengthening the procurement of various oil crops, planning to solve 1 million jin of oil cakes, and in addition, ordered 100,000 jin of bone meal from the Nanchong Bone Meal Factory, preparing to supply 200 head of draft cattle. The Xiaoqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yingshan County increased its original farm tool supply plan to 37,330 pieces, and more than 19,000 pieces have been contracted with producers. Various places have successively formed organizations for the supply of means of production to specifically lead this work. Li Huixian, director of the Xichong County United Cooperative, personally helped the Fourth District Cooperative, handicraft workers, and mutual aid groups to sign combined contracts, and also held a meeting of handicraft representatives to understand the production and sales of various products.

In terms of organizing sources of goods, the United Cooperatives of various cities and counties rely on organized production institutions and utilize public-private related production departments to process and order goods in large quantities, rushing to produce various farm tools. The three production cooperatives of the Nanbu County United Cooperative can solve 55% of the county's spring plowing iron farm tools; the Nanchong City United Cooperative has ordered 18,120 pieces of bamboo and wooden farm tools.

In addition, some county cooperatives have not paid enough attention to the instructions from higher levels, relying only on general appeals and issuing instructions from the office, or not checking after deployment, and some emphasizing objective reasons such as "busy with central work, the time has not yet come, lack of funds, and no source of goods." The Nanchong Special District Cooperative Office is currently inspecting and handling these situations.

    四川省南充专区各级合作社
    检查生产资料供应工作
    四川省南充专区合作办事处，为做好全区各级合作社春耕生产资料的供应工作，组织了三个工作组，分赴西充、南部、营山县和南充市等八个县市进行检查工作。据不完全统计，八个县市已准备好各种饼肥八百八十万斤、铁竹木农具五万多件。
    西充县联社为做好生产资料供应工作召开数次会议，订出了具体供应计划：准备了春耕肥料一百二十万斤，加强各种油料的收购工作，计划解决一百万斤饼肥，此外，还和南充骨粉厂订购了十万斤骨粉，准备供应二百头耕牛。营山县小桥供销合作社将原来的农具供应计划增大到三万七千三百三十件，已向生产者签订合同的就有一万九千多件。各地都先后组成了生产资料供应组织，专门领导这一工作。西充县联合社主任李恢先亲自帮助四区社和手工业者、互助组订立结合合同，又开了手工业代表会议，了解各种产品的产销情况。
    在组织货源上，各市、县联社依靠组织起来的生产机构和利用公私有关生产部门大量加工订货，多方赶办各种农具。南部县联社的三个生产社即可解决全县春耕铁器农具百分之五十五；南充市联社已经订购竹木农具一万八千一百二十件。
      此外，还有个别县社对上级指示没有引起足够重视，只凭一般号召和坐在办公室里发指示，或者布置了不检查，有的强调“中心工作忙、时候未到、资金少、无货源”等客观原因。这些情况南充专区合作办事处正检查处理中。
