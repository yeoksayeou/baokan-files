The first phase of the expansion project at the state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill has officially begun. The entire expansion project will involve the construction of over 60,000 square meters of factory buildings, which, combined with the existing mill area, will cover approximately 1,000 mu (about 165 acres). The mill will install the largest paper machine and wood grinder in the country. Once completed, the entire production process, from peeling and cutting raw wood to producing wood pulp and finally producing newsprint, will be automated and semi-automated. It is estimated that after the entire expansion project is completed in 1956, the production capacity will be four times higher than the current output, and the product quality will also be greatly improved. It will be the newsprint mill with the best equipment and the largest scale in China.

　　The first phase of the expansion project includes the renovation of the mechanical wood pulp workshop, the installation of a giant wood grinder, and the bricklaying of chemical wood pulp digesters. Construction has been underway successively since the end of last year. The bricklaying of the first chemical wood pulp digester underwent a long period of testing before construction, and various materials were strictly examined. The operating methods were carefully studied to ensure the quality of the project. Due to the lack of detailed drawings for the wood grinder installation project, the installation workers and technicians conducted pre-installation work before October of last year. Currently, the renovation project of the grinder room is being carried out intensively using a method of overlapping installation and civil engineering. It is expected that the entire project will be completed by the end of March. Thanks to the active efforts of the bricklaying workers and technicians, the bricklaying of the first chemical wood pulp digester was completed three days ahead of schedule and will soon be test-boiled and officially put into production in February. After the first phase of the expansion project is completed in May of this year according to the scheduled plan, it can be combined with the restored installation of a large paper machine and a boiler for production. In this way, the efficiency of the original production equipment can be fully utilized, the output of newsprint will be doubled compared with last year, and the quality can also be greatly improved. The cost will also be reduced by about 20% compared to the past.

    国营广州造纸厂第一期扩建工程正式开工
    国营广州造纸厂第一期扩建工程已经正式开工。该厂全部扩建工程，将新建六万多平方公尺面积的厂房，连同老厂面积大约有一千市亩。该厂要安装全国最大型的造纸机和磨木机，建成后，从原木去皮、截断，到制成木浆、最后出产新闻纸，全部生产过程，都是自动化和半自动化的。预计一九五六年全部扩建工程完成后，生产能力将比现在产量提高四倍，产品质量也要大大提高，将是我国设备最好、规模最大的新闻纸厂。
    第一期的扩建工程，包括有机械木浆车间改建工程、巨型磨木机的安装工程和化学木浆蒸煮锅砌砖工程。从去年年底就开始陆续施工。第一台化学木浆蒸煮锅砌砖工程，在施工前曾经进行了长期的试验，并严格审定了各种材料，仔细研究了操作方法，使工程质量有了保证。磨木机安装工程因为缺少详图，在去年十月以前，安装工人和技术人员先进行了预安装工作。现在，磨木房的改建工程，正采用安装、土建交叉法紧张地进行施工。预计全部工程到三月底可以完工。第一台化学木浆蒸煮锅砌砖工程，由于砌砖工人和技术人员的积极努力，已经提前三天完成，就要进行空煮，二月份可正式生产。第一期扩建工程，按照预定计划在今年五月全部完成后，就可配合恢复安装的一部大型造纸机和一个锅炉进行生产。这样，原有生产设备效能便可充分发挥，新闻纸产量将比去年增加一倍，质量也可以得到大大改进。成本也将比过去降低百分之二十左右。
