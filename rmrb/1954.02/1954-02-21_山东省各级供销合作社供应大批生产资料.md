Shandong Province Supply and Marketing Cooperatives at all levels supply large quantities of production materials
To support farmers in spring plowing and sowing, the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province have prepared a large number of agricultural tools, pesticides, fertilizers and other means of production, and have begun to supply them.

In light of the increased purchasing power of farmers after selling a large amount of surplus grain, the cooperative system in Shandong Province has increased the supply of spring plowing production materials this year. The total value of production materials planned for supply in the first quarter of this year is 296.6 percent of the actual sales figure for the same period last year. Among them, oilseed cake fertilizer increased by 63 percent compared with the same period last year, chemical fertilizer increased by 179.4 percent, walking plows increased by 141 percent, waterwheels increased by 343.6 percent, and small agricultural tools were about 60 times the actual sales volume in the same period last year. At present, the first quarter procurement plan has been basically completed.

In the process of preparing production materials, the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province have generally attached importance to the work of organizing local sources of goods, and implemented the principle of "obtaining materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally." When cooperatives in Changle, Yidu and other counties entrusted local handicraftsmen for processing and ordering, they first took samples and widely solicited farmers' opinions on quality and price. While preparing agricultural tools and fertilizers, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places also actively organized people's funds to purchase livestock from other provinces to supply to farmers. In the fourth quarter of last year, the province purchased more than 15,000 cattle, donkeys, mules, horses, etc. from other provinces.

In the fourth quarter of last year, supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong Province began to supply spring plowing production materials in conjunction with grain purchase work. Since January of this year, it has entered a stage of large-scale sales. In the last week of January, Ju County Cooperative sold 1,474 pieces of various small agricultural tools and 111 catties of arsenic; in January, Fushan County Cooperative sold more than 27,600 catties of miscellaneous fertilizer, more than 218,300 catties of chemical fertilizer, and 350 catties of pesticides.

    山东省各级供销合作社供应大批生产资料
    山东省各级供销合作社为了支持农民进行春耕春种，现已备妥大量的农具、农药和肥料等生产资料，并开始供应。
    根据农民大量出售余粮后购买力提高的情况，山东省合作社系统今年增加了春耕生产资料的供应数量。今年第一季度计划供应生产资料的总值，为去年同期实销数字的百分之二百九十六点六。其中饼肥比去年同期增加百分之六十三，化学肥料增加百分之一百七十九点四，步犁增加百分之一百四十一，水车增加百分之三百四十三点六，小农具约为去年同期实销数的六十倍。目前，第一季度采购计划业已基本完成。
    山东省各级供销合作社在准备生产资料的过程中，比较普遍地重视了组织地方货源的工作，贯彻了“就地取材，就地加工，就地供应”的原则。昌乐、益都等县的合作社向当地手工业委托加工、订货时，还先拿样品广泛征求农民对质量、价格的意见。在准备农具、肥料的同时，各地供销合作社还积极组织群众的资金到外省采购牲畜供应给农民。全省在去年第四季度已到外省购进牛、驴、骡、马等约一万五千余头。
    去年第四季度，山东省各地供销合作社即结合购粮工作开始供应春耕生产资料。从今年一月份起，已进入大量销售阶段。莒县合作社一月下旬一周内即销售各种小农具一千四百七十四件，信石一百十一斤；福山县合作社一月份销售杂肥二万七千六百多斤，化学肥料二十一万八千三百多斤，农药三百五十斤。　（卢健民）
