Three Old People
    Miao Deyu
    In the Aiguo Village Lü Hongbin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ju County, Shandong Province, there are three old people. They often say this: "Since joining the cooperative, we've forgotten our white hair."

    These three old people are Lü Anzhi, Du Xu, and Lü Fa. Lü Anzhi is almost fifty, Du Xu is almost sixty, and Lü Fa is almost seventy, but they are energetic, spirited, and dare to compete with any young man or strong fellow.

    They don't feel old at all. Lü Anzhi often dislikes his full beard, saying, "If it weren't for my son getting married soon, I'd shave it off!" Du Xu often hums a tune while working, using his feet or tools as drumbeats, humming something like, "The cooperative, busy with production, the members, working hard, even Huang Zhong at eighty went to battle, I'm eating twenty years less rice than him!" Lü Fa often says to himself, "Little devils, don't come calling yet!—I'm still young."

    The three of them joined the cooperative last early autumn. Before joining the cooperative, they had different situations. Lü Anzhi had already made up his mind long ago and had been waiting for many days. When the cooperative was first being formed, he wanted to join, but at that time he was the head of a mutual aid team and a household with abundant family resources and complete farm tools. The cooperative's chairman, Lü Hongbin, advised him not to join yet, as it would ruin the team. Lü Anzhi listened to Lü Hongbin's words and waited and waited. Every night, he asked his son, Xiao Cang'er, to read the newspaper to understand about agricultural production cooperatives. In order to create the conditions for joining the cooperative, he saved twenty more cartloads of manure beyond the plan. In the fall, when the news that the cooperative was going to expand reached his ears, he was the first to sign up.

    Lü Anzhi is the most hardworking person. When he pushes a very heavy cart and encounters a cliff on the road, he never goes around it: "With this beard of mine, am I afraid of you?" He gets over it with a burst of energy. Before liberation, after using this energy, he would feel sad, "My stomach feels like it's being ripped apart with big clamps, why bother?" Sometimes, after crossing the cliff, he would stubbornly stop for a meal's worth of rest. But now? Taking advantage of the energy of "attacking" the cliff, he's already gone far away like the wind. Others ask him, "How can you still be so energetic after crossing the cliff?" He says, "Hey! Who knows!"

    One autumn, while harrowing the land, he accidentally cut his foot, more than an inch long. He didn't say a word, tore a piece of clothing and wrapped it up. After harrowing, he went home to apply medicine. The person in charge of the cooperative came to see him, and he said with a smile, "It's okay, just broke the skin!" Everyone advised him to rest, but he couldn't, so he had to be idle for two days. On the third day, he couldn't stay idle and limped off to plow the fields. At this time, the wound had not yet closed, and the surrounding area was swollen like a toad, so it became inflamed, and he had to be idle for another day. The next day, he went down the slope again, and the wound became inflamed again, and he was so angry that he no longer tended to the injury. He said, "As soon as I hear the sound of the ox whip in the fields, I can't stay still." That's right, in this vigorous autumn plowing and sowing campaign, how could someone who enjoys hearing the work like a child playing with lanterns possibly rest?

    Du Xu was originally from another village. Before liberation, he was helpless and had no land or house. He suffered and endured until the Communist Party came, and then he got eighteen mu of land. In the years of poverty, he never showed a smile, always sullenly smoking. Sometimes when he was extremely worried, he would sing incoherently. Sometimes he would squat in the crowds on the streets and alleys and tell stories, indirectly scolding the landlords. After joining the cooperative, he felt like he had entered a warm family. He said, "I am like a child, lying on the kang heated by my own mother!" He was originally not named Du, but Zhang. He was picked up by a Du family landlord and only then took the name Du. Others asked him if he wanted to change it back. He said, "It's awkward to change it now, it doesn't matter what the surname is. I am worried about where my old father and mother have wandered off to, they are probably long dead." He felt cold in his heart when he mentioned the past. However, when he thought that he had already turned over and was working with Lü Hongbin, he felt warm inside. He was extremely happy and would compose a clapper rhyme to sing.

    The high-yield wheat field and the "experimental zone" were planted jointly by experts recommended by each production team in the cooperative. Who were these people? Yang Huachun held the plow to open the furrows, this was the "expert" selected by the entire cooperative, plowing straight, walking straight, at a uniform pace; following behind was Yang Taisheng and Yang Zuofu spreading "three-in-one fertilizer" (manure, soybean cake, superphosphate), these were the diligent and quick-legged people selected by the entire cooperative, spreading just the right amount and at a fast speed; after that, Lü Fengwen pulled a "two-purpose harrow" made with two harrow teeth (in order to separate the fertilizer and seeds, and also to widen the sowing width); after that, Du Xu himself sowed the seeds, he was the most skilled hand at sowing seeds selected by the entire cooperative; after that, Lü Chunlan spread dry ash, she was the most meticulous hand at spreading ash selected by the entire cooperative; after that, Lü Jing and Lü Anji used harrows to level the soil, these were the strongest people in the entire cooperative. Du Xu watched and watched, and found it interesting, so he composed a song:

    Yang Huachun holds the plow and waves the whip,
    Yang Taisheng and Yang Zuofu spread fertilizer behind,
    Lü Fengwen, covers the furrow,
    Old Du Xu sows seeds and stumbles along,
    Lü Anji and Lü Jing pull the harrow,
    Lü Chunlan is the one spreading the ash.
    Our group is like a big machine,
    Once it's started, everything moves!

    The high-yield wheat was all from the seeds he sowed. His skill was the best in the entire cooperative. His skill was not very good at first; it was further improved after joining the cooperative. His skill improved, and the cooperative's production also improved, and he felt particularly happy.

    Lü Fa was an "old hand" at farming in the village. When the cooperative was first established, he thought that putting everyone together would "cause chaos," and that farming on his own was more "orderly." He said to people, "I'm old, I'll be in the ground in the blink of an eye, why join the cooperative?" Actually, he just didn't believe in the cooperative. Later, watching and watching, the cooperative got better and better, greatly surpassing his own "old hand" skills, so he joined the cooperative and said, "I'm old, I'll rely on you young people too!" After joining the cooperative, the collective labor and precise division of labor in the cooperative aroused his interest. He felt that the atmosphere here was different from the mutual aid team, and even more different from working alone; this atmosphere was fresh. He also often listened to Lü Hongbin talk about the happy life in the Soviet Union. A beautiful picture appeared in this old man's mind, and he felt that he had been working as a farmer all his life, muddleheadedly, and only now had he found a "goal." He said to people, "The lid pressed on my heart has been lifted!" He thought of October 9th and smiled with narrowed eyes: "That day was really interesting! More than twenty carts rang out together, and a large piece of land was covered with manure piles in the blink of an eye. If it were just one person doing it, it would take several days! Just worrying would exhaust all your energy. Everyone was working to complete the plan. Even Yang Zuozhu, who looks like a skinny monkey, pushed more than thirty carts a day. If he pushed twenty carts in the past, his mother would happily kowtow! That day, there was a strong wind with light rain, but no one mentioned it!" The old man saw such a scene for the first time in his own familiar land, how could he not be happy?

    In the past, when he heard someone say that the cooperative was not good, he would always follow along and say "It's not good"; now, if anyone said that the cooperative was not good, he would roll his eyes: "Where is my cooperative not good?" After work at night, he carefully put away the farm tools and checked to see if anything was broken or missing, making sure everything was in order for tomorrow. Some people didn't care about the cooperative's farm tools, so he criticized them on the spot. When he had time, he liked to stroll around the cooperative's yard, tidying up here and fixing up there. Once, he saw that the pigs had broken through the pigpen wall, and he hurriedly found a stone to block it. When the cow rope broke, he took his own hemp rope to make a new one. No one had assigned him to do it, and he wasn't used to telling people that he had done it. When plowing the land, he held the plow very carefully, not allowing it to be even a little crooked. He also stepped on the clumps of soil at any time—he knew that the land would still need harrowing after plowing, but he felt that if he didn't crush them, his feet wouldn't be able to move forward. When the sown wheat came out, he came to see it and said to himself, "This piece was plowed by me, look, the seedlings are so tender!"

    After joining the cooperative, Lü Fa cherished every item in the cooperative and cared about every matter in the cooperative. Every bit and every drop of the cooperative was like a thread, hanging in his heart. During the autumn threshing, he picked up every bean that fell on the threshing ground, not feeling at ease if even one was left. He said, "The cooperative is our home, if we don't worry about it, who will!" The old people, after entering the cooperative, broadened their horizons, their hearts were warmed, their "old strength" was used for everyone, allowing them to enter a true youth in spirit. This is the reason why "since joining the cooperative, we've forgotten our white hair."

    三个老年人
    苗得雨
    山东省莒县爱国村吕鸿宾农业生产合作社里，有三个老年人。他们常说这样一句话：“入了合作社，忘了头发白”。
    这三个老年人，一个是吕安志，一个是杜绪，一个是吕发。吕安志快五十岁了，杜绪快六十岁了，吕发快七十岁了，可是他们劲头大，精神足，敢和任何一个小伙子或大壮汉比。
    他们并不感到老。吕安志经常讨厌他那满嘴上的胡子，说：“要不是儿子快要娶媳妇了，我非剃掉不可！”杜绪经常哼着小曲，干起活儿来，用脚步或家具当鼓板，哼什么“合作社，忙生产，社员们，用劲干，老黄忠八十都上阵，俺比他还少吃二十年饭哪！”吕发经常自言自语的说：“小鬼，先别来叫啊！——我现在正年轻。”
    他们三人，都是去年初秋才入社的。入社前，各有不同的情况。吕安志早就打了谱，已经等了很多日子了。开始组社时，他就要加入，当时他在互助组里当组长，又是家底厚农具齐全的户，社长吕鸿宾劝他先不入，入了的话，会把小组弄垮了。吕安志就听了吕鸿宾的话，等了又等。天天晚上，叫儿子小仓儿念报，了解关于农业生产合作社的事情。为了创造入社的条件，在计划以外多攒了二十车子粪。秋上，合作社要扩大的消息，一传到他耳朵里，他第一个报了名。
    吕安志是最爱干活的人。他推着很重的车子，在路上遇着崖头，向来不绕路走的：“就凭我这嘴胡子，怕了你？”一用劲就过去了。解放前，他把这股子劲用过去以后，也感到伤心，“肚子里扯着大锔，这是何苦？”有时候，在过了崖头以后，就执拗地歇上吃顿饭的功夫。如今呢？趁着“攻”崖头的那股子劲，早就一溜风似的走远了。别人问他：“过了崖头怎么还那么来劲？”他说：“嘿！谁知道！”
    秋天耙地，不小心，他把脚戮了一道口子，一寸多长。他一声不响，撕了块衣服角包了包。耙完了以后，才回家上药。社里负责人来看望他，他笑着说：“不要紧，只破了皮！”大家劝他休息，他没法，只得闲了两天。到了第三天，闲不住了，他一瘸一拐的去耕地了。这时候，伤口还没合缝，四周肿的像气蛤蟆一样，结果发了，只得又闲了一天。第二天，又下了坡，伤口又发了，他气的再也不养伤了。他说：“我一听见坡里牛鞭响，就待不住了。”是嘛，在这轰轰烈烈的秋耕秋种运动中，一个听着干活就像小孩玩花灯一样高兴的人，怎能养得住伤呢？
    杜绪本是外乡人，解放前无依无靠，无地无房，受苦受罪，熬到了共产党来，才有了十八亩地。在受穷的年月里，没有一天舒展开脸，白黑都闷着头子抽烟。有时愁极了，就乱唱一通。有时候就蹲在街头巷尾的人群里讲故事，拐弯抹角的骂地主。入了社，觉得就像进了温暖的家庭一样，他说：“我是一个小孩子，躺到了亲娘烧热的炕上！”他原来不姓杜，姓张，被杜家地主拾去以后才姓杜的。别人问他是不是要改过来，他说：“现在改过来别口了，管姓什么都一样。我挂心我的老爹老娘不知流落到哪里去了，可能早死了。”他提起过去的事情，心里害冷。可是，想起自己已经翻身了，又和吕鸿宾在一块劳动，心里就暖起来。高兴极了，就编段快板唱唱。
    丰产麦地和“试验区”，由社内各生产队推出内行的人共同种。那是些谁呢？杨华春扶犁开沟，这是全社拔出的“上手”，扶的正，走的直，快慢均匀；随在后边，是杨太升和杨作福溜“三合肥”
  （粪、豆饼、过磷酸钙），这是全社拔出的手勤、腿快的人，溜的不多不少，速度又快；随后，吕凤文拉着用两个耙齿造的“两用?”（为了使粪、种隔离，又搂宽播幅）；随后，杜绪自己溜种，他是全社拔出的最会溜种的手；随后，吕春蓝溜干灰，这是全社拔出的溜灰最精心的手；随后，吕敬、吕安吉用?盖平，这是全社最有力气的人。杜绪看着看着，觉得有意思，编出了一段歌：
    杨华春扶犁挥着鞭，
    杨太升、杨作福扒肥在后边，
    吕凤文，把沟掩，
    老杜绪溜种跟着颠，
    吕安吉、吕敬把?拉，
    撒灰的本是吕春蓝。
    咱这伙像盘大机器，
    一拨弄到处都动弹！
    丰产麦子，全是他溜的种籽。他的本领在全社里拔了顶子。他的本领并不是早先就很好的，是入了社以后又进一步提高了的。他的本领提高了，社的生产也提高了，他感到特别愉快。
    吕发是庄上过日子的“老把手”。合作社刚成立的时候，他认为弄在一块要“出乱子”，不如自己耕种“有条理”。他对人说：“我老了，转眼就入土了，还入社哪？”其实他是不相信合作社罢了。后来，看着看着，合作社越搞越好，大大比过了自己的“老把手”，就进合作社来，说：“我老了，也跟你们青年人靠靠！”入了合作社，合作社里集体劳动，精密分工，使他发生了兴趣。他觉得这里边的气味，和互助组不一样，和单干更不一样，这个气味是新鲜气味。又经常听吕鸿宾讲苏联的幸福生活，在这个老年人的脑子里出现了一幅美丽的图景，觉得干了一辈子庄稼活，糊里糊涂，如今才摸着了“奔头”。他对人说：“我压在心上的盖，揭开了！”他想起十月九号那一天，就眯溜着眼笑：“那天真有意思！二十多辆车子一齐响，一块很大的地，转眼就压满了粪堆，若是单人独手，得几天哪？光愁也把劲愁尽了。大伙子都为了完成计划，身子最赖的也比往年大汉子推的多。杨作柱长得就像瘦猴一样，一天推了三十多车子，往年要是推二十车子，他娘就高兴的磕响头啦！这天刮大风，夹着小雨点，还没听见谁提一提呢！”老人在自己家乡熟悉的土地上，头一次见到了这样的景象，哪能不欢喜？
    过去他听见谁说合作社不好，他总是随从着说“是不好”；如今谁要是说合作社不好，他把白眼珠子一翻：“俺的社，哪处不好？”晚上活儿结束后，他很细心的把家具收拾起来，检查检查那处坏了，或者丢了，弄得停停当当，准备明天用。有些人，不关心社的家具，他就当场提出批评。有空的时候，总爱在合作社的院里串游，这里整整，那里弄弄。有一次，看见猪把圈墙攻破了，他急忙找块石头堵死。牛绳断了，他把自己家的?拿来就搓。别人并没有分配他去做，他做了也不习惯对人叙说。耕地时，他扶着一把犁，扶得特别细心，不兴有一点弯弯。两只脚还随时踩着土块——明看，耕完了还要耙，可是他觉着不踩碎它，两只脚没法往前迈。种上的麦子出来了，他来看，自语的说：“这一片是我耕的，看，麦苗多嫩生！”
    吕发入了社，爱惜社里每一件东西，关心社里每一件事情。社里的每一点每一滴，都像带着一条线一样，挂在他的心上。秋天打场，场边上的豆粒，他都一粒一粒的拾干净，剩一粒心里也不实落。他说：“社是家，咱不操心谁操心！”老人们，进了合作社，眼界开阔了，他们的心得到了温暖，他们的“老力”为大家使出来了，使他们在精神上进入了真正的青年时代。这便是“入了合作社，忘了头发白”的因由。
