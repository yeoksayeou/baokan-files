    Zhejiang Province Hangzhou, Huzhou and other silk factories
    This year will vigorously increase the production of silk fabrics
    The thousands of silk factories in Hangzhou, Huzhou and other silk-producing cities in Zhejiang Province will produce more brightly colored and larger quantities of silk this year to supply the needs of domestic and foreign markets. So far, in addition to silks for export, Zhejiang's silk industry has accepted orders from relevant units in twenty-eight provinces for silks for domestic sale. According to the needs of customers, the silk factories have now begun to produce various colored silks for summer use, including "Snowy Lattice" and "Rainbow Lattice" suitable for urban women to make shirts and skirts, as well as inexpensive and good-quality plain silk and Hangzhou gauze specially for farmers to make summer clothes. In addition, there are georgette and various satin fabrics specially for women in the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to make headscarves and dresses.
    Based on the sales of silk fabrics in domestic and foreign markets, the thousands of silk factories in Zhejiang Province will give full play to the potential of existing equipment to vigorously increase production this year. The planned production of pure silk fabrics this year will increase by more than 34% compared with last year, blended silk fabrics will more than double, and silk quilt covers will increase more than threefold.
    In order to better meet the needs of the people at home and abroad, the silk factories will carry out three important reform tasks this year to increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. The first is to gradually promote new silk weaving methods, strengthen the cooperative system of production teams, and improve workers' loom tending ability and quality. The second is to organize the most experienced silk weaving technicians and art workers to form a pattern and variety research team to improve varieties and colors according to the needs of the people. The third is to improve refining and dyeing technology. In the past, Hangzhou's refining and dyeing technology was not high, and there were many defective products, so a large amount of silk had to be transported to Shanghai for dyeing. This year, Zhejiang Refining and Dyeing Factory will organize employees to learn advanced refining and dyeing technology from Shanghai, so as to gradually achieve that silk produced in Zhejiang can be refined and dyed in Zhejiang, to reduce the cost of products.

    浙江省杭州湖州等地绸厂
    今年将大力增产丝织品
    浙江省出产丝绸的城市杭州和湖州等地的几千家绸厂，今年将生产比去年花样更鲜艳、数量更多的绸缎，供应国内外市场的需要。到目前为止，除了外销绸外，内销绸方面，浙江省的丝绸业已接受了二十八个省的有关单位的订货。各绸厂依照订户的需要，现在已开始生产夏季用的各色绸缎，其中有适宜于城市妇女做衬衫和裙子用的雪映格、彩虹格，有价廉物美的专供农民做夏衣的素大绸、杭罗等。此外，还有专为苏联和各人民民主国家的妇女做头巾、礼服用的乔其纱和各种绫缎。
    根据国内外市场上丝织品销售的情况，今年浙江省几千家绸厂将发挥现有设备的潜力来大力进行增产。今年计划生产的纯丝织品比去年增加百分之三十四以上，交织绸缎增加一倍以上，绸缎被面增加三倍以上。
    为了更好地满足国内外人民的需要，今年各绸厂将进行三项重要的改革工作，以增加产量，提高质量，降低成本。第一是逐步推广新织绸法，加强生产小组的协作制，提高工人的看台能力和质量。第二是组织最有经验的织绸技术人员和美术工作者成立花色品种研究小组，根据人民需要改进品种和花色。第三是改进炼染技术。过去杭州炼染绸缎技术不高，次货多，因此大量的绸缎要运到上海去染色。今年浙江炼染厂将组织职工学习上海先进的炼染技术，以便逐步做到浙江出的绸能在浙江炼染，以降低产品的成本。（新华社）
