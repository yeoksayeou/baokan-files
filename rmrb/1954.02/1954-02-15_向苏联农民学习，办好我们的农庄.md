    Learn from Soviet Peasants, Manage Our Farms Well
    Liu Yuanqing, Chairman of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province
    February 14th is the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. On behalf of all farm members, I extend my respect to the great Soviet people who guide and inspire us forward.
    "Learn from Soviet peasants, follow the path of Soviet peasants" is the heartfelt desire of all Chinese peasants liberated under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. For many years, through movies, newspapers, picture exhibitions, and especially after Comrade Li Shunda, a labor model from the Chinese Peasants' Delegation to the Soviet Union, returned from his visit and gave us a report, we have gained a deeper understanding of the production and life of Soviet peasants. The path of Soviet agricultural collectivization is like a radiant lighthouse illuminating us; the happy life of Soviet peasants is like a powerful magnet attracting us.
    November 7, 1952, is an unforgettable day for us. The seeds of collective agricultural labor, created by the great Lenin and Stalin and practiced by Soviet peasants, sprouted, grew, blossomed, and bore fruit in Wangcun, Guancun, Nanchui, Zhuoma, and other four villages in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province. On this day, 918 peasant households, learning from the example of Soviet peasants, under the principles of collective labor and "distribution according to work," plowed away the boundaries of more than 14,500 mu of small, privately owned plots of land, connected them into a large, collectively owned field, and organized a collective farm. Because it was established on the 35th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution and during the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement of the Chinese people, all farm members honored it by naming it "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm" to express our sincere admiration for the Soviet people and our determination to learn from Soviet peasants.
    In the first year of establishing the farm, we encountered many difficulties, but under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, we finally overcame various difficulties and achieved the first year's victory. In management, we learned from the experience of Soviet collective farms, implemented a production responsibility system of dividing farm members into teams and land into sections; implemented planned production, quota management, and bonus-for-exceeding-quota methods; implemented a work-day system, launched labor competitions, and fully mobilized the labor enthusiasm of male and female farm members. In farming techniques, we learned from the advanced experience of Soviet farms in selecting good seeds, appropriately close planting, and rational fertilization. In particular, we used modern machine tractors manufactured by our Soviet worker brothers. More than 90 percent of the farm's land was deep-plowed to a depth of more than 22 centimeters using compound plows, more than twice as deep as our manual and animal-powered plowing. This not only saved us manpower and animal power, reduced the labor of farm members, and increased our sideline production of pig raising, transportation, and oil pressing, but also improved the soil and exploited the potential of the land, enabling us to achieve a bumper harvest in the first year of establishment despite many difficulties and attacks from drought and pests. The production volume exceeded the past years by 13.35 percent. The income of farm members generally increased, with many households distributing more than 11,000 jin of grain, several times more than in previous years. When the People's Government called on farmers to sell surplus grain to the state, all 918 farm households voluntarily sold 1,020,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, averaging more than 1,100 jin per household, more than twice that of local farmers. We used the proceeds from the sale of grain to invest in expanding production, deposit some in the bank for savings, and purchase daily necessities such as flashlights, rubber shoes, pens, and bicycles that we had never enjoyed before. Life also began to change. The farm members all said, "This is only the first year; wait and see what happens later."
    The facts of our farm's first year prove that socialist agricultural collectivization is incomparably superior. Each of our farm members has seen from their own experience over the past year that collective farms are more powerful and have more benefits than mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives with land shares and collective management. Our farm increased more than 300 mu of land simply by merging the land. There are all kinds of talents among the farm members. There are 45 rubber-tired carts transporting goods outside every day, more than 200 male and female farm members burning lime in the lime factory, and dozens of people raising pigs and pressing oil, while the farm work in the fields is still done ahead of others in every aspect. Therefore, everyone says, "In the collective farm, as long as you work hard, you no longer have to worry about having too little land, too many people, and not enough food. You no longer have to beg landlords and rich peasants like in the past, and you are no longer afraid of being forced to sell your house and land and ruin your family due to high rent, usurious loans, and natural disasters." More than 360 peasant households around us saw the benefits of the farm and requested to join. Among them, 146 households were approved by the farm members' representative assembly to be admitted as farm members. Now, under the glorious illumination of the general line of the state's transition period and inspired by the victory of the first year of establishment, all farm members are actively preparing for spring plowing in order to achieve the plan of producing 4,890,000 jin of grain in 1954 (of which 1,500,000 jin are planned to be sold to the state). Although the severe winter months are snowy and icy, more than 700 male and female farm members are still accumulating fertilizer in the fields, having already accumulated more than 600,000 dan. "For the industrialization of the motherland, for our own happy life, learn from Soviet experience, cherish our farm" has become the motto of all our farm members. I believe that under the leadership and care of the Party and the government, and with the help of the great Soviet people, as long as all our farm members work together and continue to learn from the advanced agricultural experience of the Soviet Union, the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm will definitely create greater achievements in 1954, and in the near future, the lives of all our farm members will gradually become as happy as those of Soviet peasants today.
    Finally, on behalf of all the farm members of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm, I extend my highest respect to our great friends, the Soviet people!

### 向苏联农民学习，办好我们的农庄

    向苏联农民学习，办好我们的农庄
    山西省长治县中苏友好集体农庄主席　刘元庆
    二月十四日是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订四周年纪念，我代表全体庄员向指引和鼓舞我们前进的伟大苏联人民，致以敬意。
    “向苏联农民学习，走苏联农民的道路”，这是在中国共产党与毛泽东主席领导下，解放了的全中国农民的一条心愿。多年以来我们通过电影、书报、图片展览，特别是中国农民赴苏参观团代表劳动模范李顺达同志从苏联参观回来给我们作了报告以后，使我们对苏联农民的生产和生活有了更深刻的了解。苏联农业集体化的道路，就像一座光芒万丈的灯塔在照耀着我们；苏联农民的幸福生活，好像一块大磁石在吸引着我们。
    一九五二年十一月七日是我们难忘的日子。伟大的列宁和斯大林所创造的、苏联农民所实践的农业集体劳动的种籽，在我们山西省长治县王村、关村、南垂、捉马等四个村，发芽、生长、开花、结果了。就在这一天，我们九百一十八户农民，学习着苏联农民的榜样，在集体劳动和“按劳取酬”的原则下，把各家私有的一万四千五百余亩小块土地，刨了地界，连成一片集体公有的大地，组织了集体农庄。因为它成立在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十五周年，又当全中国人民开展“中苏友好月”运动的时候，所以全体庄员把它荣幸的命名为“中苏友好集体农庄”，来表示我们对苏联人民的衷心钦敬，表示我们向苏联农民学习的决心。
    建庄第一年，我们碰到了不少困难，但由于在中国共产党与人民政府的领导下，终于战胜了各种困难，取得了第一年的胜利。在管理上学习了苏联集体农庄的经验，实行了庄员分队，土地分段的生产责任制；实施了计划生产，定额管理和超额奖励办法；实行了劳动日制度，开展了劳动竞赛，充分发挥了男女庄员的劳动积极性。在耕作技术上学习了苏联农庄选择良种，适当密植，合理施肥等先进经验。特别是使用了苏联工人老大哥制造的现代化的机器拖拉机，全庄百分之九十以上的土地用复式犁进行了二十二公分以上的深耕，比我们用人工、畜力耕地深一倍多。这不但节省了我们的人力和畜力，减轻了庄员的劳动，因而增加了我们养猪、运输、榨油等副业生产，而且改良了土壤，发挥了土地的潜力，使我们建庄第一年在困难多端和旱灾、虫害的袭击下获得了丰收，生产量超过往年百分之十三点三五。庄员收入普遍增加，多的每户分粮一万一千余斤，超过往年好几倍。在人民政府号召农民把余粮卖给国家时，全庄九百一十八户庄员都自动把自己一百零二万斤余粮卖给了国家，每户平均一千一百多斤，超过当地农民一倍多。我们把卖粮款除一部分投资扩大生产外，有的存入银行储蓄起来，有的购买自己从未享受过的手电灯、胶鞋、钢笔、自行车等日用品。生活也开始有了变化，庄员们都说：“这才是第一年呢，望后瞧吧”。
    从我们农庄的第一年事实证明，社会主义农业集体化是无比优越的。我们每个庄员都从自己一年来的亲身经历中，看到集体农庄比互助组和土地入股、集体经营的农业生产合作社的力量更大，好处更多，我们农庄仅仅由于合并土地就增加了三百多亩土地，庄员中什么人材也有，每天有四十五辆胶皮车在外运输，二百多男女庄员在灰厂烧灰，几十人在养猪、榨油，而地里的庄稼活还要样样做在别人前头，所以大家说：“在集体农庄里，只要好好劳动，再不用发愁土地少、人口多、粮食不够吃了，再不像过去那样去央求地主、富农了，更不怕因高租、高利贷、天灾疾病逼得卖房卖地家破人亡了”。周围三百六十多户农民看到农庄的好处，都纷纷请求入庄，其中一百四十六户经庄员代表大会批准，吸收为庄员了。现在全体庄员正在国家过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下和建庄一年胜利的鼓舞下，为实现一九五四年生产四百八十九万斤粮食（其中计划卖给国家一百五十万斤）的计划，积极进行春耕准备工作，虽然严冬腊月冰雪在地，仍有七百多男女庄员在野外积肥，已积下六十余万担。“为了祖国工业化，为了自己的幸福生活，学习苏联经验，爱护自己的农庄”已成为我们全体庄员的行动口号。我相信在党与政府领导和关怀下，在伟大的苏联人民的帮助下，只要我们全体庄员一致努力，继续学习苏联的农业先进经验，中苏友好集体农庄在一九五四年一定会创造更大的成绩，在不久的将来我们全体庄员的生活，也将逐步像今天的苏联农民那样幸福。
    最后让我代表中苏友好集体农庄全体庄员，向我们伟大的朋友苏联人民致以崇高的敬礼！
