    Victory Indexed Bonds Principal Repayment Lottery Held in Beijing
    The fourth principal repayment lottery for the first phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds was held in Beijing on the afternoon of the 1st. The lottery was presided over by Wu Bo, Vice Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government, and Li Dengfeng, Minister of the Finance Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Huang Jieran, Deputy Secretary-General of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, were invited to conduct the lottery. Pan Zhenya, Deputy Director of the Supervisory Committee of the Central People's Government, and representatives of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government supervised the lottery.
    Vice Minister Wu Bo delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that this was the last lottery for principal repayment of the first phase of the 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds. After this lottery repayment, 70 percent of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds will have been repaid, and the remaining 30 percent will be fully repaid next year. In the past three years, three lottery repayments have been held, repaying 45 percent of the principal, totaling more than 1 trillion yuan, and paying nearly 300 billion yuan in interest.
    Wu Bo said: The 1950 People's Victory Indexed Bonds played a positive role in the recovery and development of the national economy. Therefore, everyone who purchased the bonds made a contribution to the country, and this spirit of patriotism is worth promoting.
    Wu Bo said: This year, the state has issued the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. It has a more positive significance than the People's Victory Indexed Bonds issued in 1950, because it raises funds for the country's industrialization construction. Everyone who purchases economic construction bonds directly supports the country's industrialization construction. It is expected that the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds will surely receive enthusiastic support from the people of the whole country.
    Fu Huating, Le Songsheng, Xiang Shuxiang and other people from industrial and commercial circles also spoke at the meeting. They all expressed satisfaction with the timely repayment of the People's Victory Indexed Bonds and expressed their support for the issuance of the National Economic Construction Bonds.

    胜利折实公债还本抽签大会在京举行
    一九五零年第一期人民胜利折实公债第四次还本抽签大会一日下午在北京举行。大会由中央人民政府财政部副部长吴波主持，并邀请中华全国总工会财务部部长李登丰、中华全国工商业联合会副秘书长黄玠然执行抽签，中央人民政府监察委员会副主任潘震亚和中央人民政府财政经济委员会的代表监督抽签。
    吴波副部长在会上致词。他说这次是一九五零年第一期人民胜利折实公债最后一次的抽签还本。经过这次抽签还本，人民胜利折实公债就已经还本百分之七十，其余百分之三十将在明年全部还清。过去三年，曾经举行过三次抽签还本，已经还本百分之四十五，共一万多亿元，付利息将近三千亿元。
    吴波说：一九五零年人民胜利折实公债对于国家经济的恢复和发展起了一定的积极作用，因此每一个购买公债的人都对国家有所贡献，这种爱国主义的精神是值得发扬的。
    吴波说：今年，国家又发行了一九五四年国家经济建设公债。它比一九五零年发行的人民胜利折实公债有更积极的意义，因为它是为国家工业化建设筹集资金。每个人购买经济建设公债，就是对于国家工业化建设的直接支援。可以预计，一九五四年国家经济建设公债一定能获得全国人民的热烈支持。
    在大会上发言的还有工商界人士傅华亭、乐松生、项叔翔等，他们都对人民胜利折实公债的按期还本表示满意，并对国家经济建设公债的发行表示拥护。　（新华社）
