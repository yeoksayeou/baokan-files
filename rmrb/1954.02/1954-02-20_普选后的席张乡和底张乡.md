	The Seat of Zhang Township and Di Zhang Township After Universal Suffrage
	Zhang Jincai
	After universal suffrage in Seat of Zhang and Di Zhang Townships in Jie County, Shanxi Province, a vibrant new atmosphere has emerged in their work.

	The cadres of the people's governments of these two townships, being elected by the people's representatives, are supported and loved by the masses. They not only feel exceptionally honored but also deeply realize that they are servants of the people and must listen to the people's opinions, unite, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Yan Wucheng, the Party branch secretary of Seat of Zhang Township, Yan Xinkai, the township head, and Zhang Zhenhua, the secretary—three cadres who are detached from production—regularly reside in the township people's government to be able to study work promptly and take turns going to the villages to inspect work. After universal suffrage, they actively led the masses in production, mobilized and organized them to overcome the drought and insect plagues at that time, increasing the township's total production harvest last year by 24% compared to 1952. To ensure this year's bumper harvest, they again led the masses in improving 200 mu of soil using sand spreading methods in the winter and planned to solve problems such as winter livestock feed and base fertilizer for wheat fields throughout the township. In addition, they plan to build a drainage canal eight feet wide and more than 1,300 zhang long this spring. Once this canal is built, it can save more than 600 mu of land throughout the township from flooding. After universal suffrage in Di Zhang Township, the sense of responsibility of the cadres of each committee was strengthened, and they all worked hard under the leadership of the township people's government to do departmental work well. The Civil Affairs Committee rectified the substitute cultivation system and resolved the imbalances and unreasonable phenomena in substitute cultivation work in various villages. The Mediation Committee mediated a total of 42 disputes for the masses in two months, and the masses generally no longer needed to go to the district or county to resolve matters, thus saving the masses' time. Because the division of labor of each committee became clear after universal suffrage, the masses understood who was responsible for what, and they directly approached the committee members to handle matters when something happened. This basically overcame the phenomenon of the masses only looking for the township head when something happened and the phenomenon of mutual evasion among cadres in the past. The completion of various work tasks has also been much smoother than in the past. When comparing the current work situation with the past, the cadres of Seat of Zhang Township said: "In the past, most cadres didn't move, and a few cadres were chaotically busy, the work had no direction, and the effect was not great; now the cadres have a clear division of labor, are united, and are all actively responsible, the work is both thorough and practical, and everything can be effective."

	After universal suffrage, both townships were able to convene people's congresses on schedule and were able to seriously discuss and decide on major work throughout the township at the meetings. Seat of Zhang Township has already convened two people's congresses. At the first meeting, in addition to studying the "Three Autumns" work according to the instructions of the county people's government, it was also decided to build a stone bridge over the canal west of the village according to the requirements of the masses to facilitate transportation and production. After the meeting, the representatives led the masses to quickly complete the construction. At the second meeting, in addition to discussing the call for "increasing production and practicing economy" and making a resolution, it also discussed and decided on three prohibitions according to the requirements of the masses, namely: 1. No one is allowed to pick cotton in the fields at will before the cotton seedlings are completely pulled out, abolishing the old rule that anyone could pick cotton in the fields after October 1st in the past, protecting the interests of cotton farmers; 2. It is forbidden for anyone to graze livestock in the fields before the crops are harvested to avoid damaging the crops; 3. It is forbidden to walk diagonally in wheat fields to protect wheat seedlings. These three decisions were supported by the people throughout the township and were successfully implemented. Because the people's congress truly played its role, it greatly improved the people's sense of being masters of the country, and they were more concerned about the major affairs of the township and the country, and the supervision of cadres was also strengthened. For example, the first people's congress of Di Zhang Township resolved to repair a canal west of the village, but later, due to the tension of the autumn harvest, the people's congress again decided to postpone it. Later, the township people's government mobilized the masses to carry out repairs without the approval of the people's congress, and the masses questioned the representatives one after another: "Why don't the cadres implement the resolutions of the people's congress?" The representatives also criticized the township head, saying: "It is inappropriate to handle the major affairs of the people of the whole township without going through the people's congress!" The township head humbly accepted the representatives' opinions and made a self-criticism in public.

	After universal suffrage, the township people's government established a simple and easy-to-implement system, strengthened the collective leadership of the township people's government committee, overcame the past chaotic phenomena, and ensured the smooth progress of work. The "five excesses" phenomenon in the two townships after universal suffrage has been greatly reduced. Not only can mass meetings not be convened at will, but even general cadre meetings and various working committees of the township people's government can only be convened when it is really necessary, in addition to regular meetings. Cadres and the masses are satisfied because there are fewer meetings and less waste of work. At the same time, because various tasks can be conveyed to the masses through representatives and arranged by cadres going deep into the masses or household by household by resident group leaders, and supervised and inspected upon expiration, work efficiency has also been greatly improved. The township people's government committee holds a meeting once a month. In addition to carefully studying the resolutions of the people's congress and organizing forces to implement them, the meeting also checks and studies the work of various departments through the work reports of various committees. This enables the township people's government to realize collective leadership on the basis of democratic centralism and improve the work efficiency of the township regime. On the first, second, and third days of each month, the committees of Di Zhang Township hold meetings to summarize the work of the previous month and arrange the work for the current month. The township head and deputy township head participate in the meetings of each committee, and sometimes the chairmen of each committee report to the township head. On the fourth day, the township people's government committee is convened, and the township head makes a work summary report and proposes the work plan for the month. The chairmen of each committee briefly and selectively report their work to the township people's government committee. Each meeting is discussed and resolutions are made. On the fifth day, the township people's congress is convened. In addition to inspecting the township people's government's work report for the previous month, the people's congress also discusses the work for the current month or makes resolutions on matters that should be promoted or reformed throughout the township according to the requirements of the masses. After the meeting, the representatives convey the resolutions to the masses and lead them to implement them. According to the experience of the two townships in the past few months, the above system is not only necessary but also simple and easy to implement, and it has a great effect on promoting work. The masses in Di Zhang Township reflect: "The township government now handles affairs in an orderly manner, and the clues are not chaotic. It clearly explains to the masses what to do each month and how to do it." The cadres of Seat of Zhang Township unanimously believe that in the past, work was done by holding meetings, and after the meetings, it was like "autumn wind blowing past the ears," and everything was over. Now, meetings are held on time according to the system, and everyone reports on their work, inspects each other, and carries out criticism, so they push each other forward.

	Seat of Zhang and Di Zhang are second- and third-class townships in Jie County. One of the reasons for the backwardness of their work in the past was that the cadres were tired of work, and many cadres had a coercive style of command and could not well implement the mass line, mobilize the masses, and rely on the masses to complete their work. After universal suffrage, the cadres' mass viewpoint was strengthened, their thinking of serving the people was improved, their work became active, and the masses' ideological awareness was also greatly improved, making them more loving of the regime and supporting the cadres. Now, the work of the two townships is advancing by leaps and bounds.

    普选后的席张乡和底张乡
    张进才
    山西省解县席张、底张两乡经过普选，工作上出现了生气勃勃的新气象。
    这两个乡的人民政府的干部，由于是人民代表选举产生，为群众所拥护爱戴，他们自己不但感到异常光荣，而且也深刻地体会到自己是人民的勤务员，必须倾听人民的意见，团结一致，全心全意为人民服务。席张乡党支部书记阎武成、乡长阎忻开、秘书张振华三个脱离生产的干部，为了能够及时研究工作，都经常住在乡人民政府，并轮流下乡到各村检查工作。普选之后，他们曾积极领导群众生产，发动和组织群众战胜了当时的旱灾、虫灾，使去年全乡的生产收获量比一九五二年增加了百分之二十四。为了保证今年的丰收，他们又在冬天领导群众用铺沙办法改良土壤二百亩，并筹划解决全乡冬季牲畜的饲草饲料和麦地底肥等问题。此外，还计划在今年春天修一条宽八尺、长一千三百余丈的退水渠。这条渠修好后，可使全乡六百余亩土地免受水灾。底张乡普选后，各委员会的干部责任感加强了，都在乡人民政府的领导下努力做好部门工作。民政委员会整顿了代耕，解决了各村在代耕工作上的不平衡不合理现象。调解委员会在两个月内共给群众调解了四十二件纠纷，群众有事一般不再需要到区、县解决，这样就节省了群众的时间。由于普选后各委员会的分工明确了，群众都了解了谁负什么责任，有事就直接找委员去办，这样就基本上克服了以往群众有事只找乡长的现象和干部之间互相推诿的现象。各项工作任务的完成，也都较过去顺利得多了。席张乡干部把现在和过去的工作情况做对比时说：“过去的工作是多数干部不动，少数干部乱忙，工作没有头绪，效果不大；现在是干部分工明确，团结一致，都积极负责，工作既深入又实际，事事都能见效。”
    这两个乡在普选以后，都能够按期召开人民代表大会，且能在会上认真讨论和决定全乡的重大工作。席张乡已召开了两次人民代表大会。第一次会议，除按照县人民政府的指示研究了“三秋”工作以外，又根据群众的要求，决定在村西水渠上修一座石桥，以便利交通和生产。会后，代表带动群众很快就修筑完成。第二次会议，除讨论了“增产节约”的号召并做出决议外，又根据群众要求讨论决定了三项禁令，即：一、在棉花苗未拔完前不准随意下地拾花，废除了以往十月一日之后任何人都可以下地拾花的旧规，保障了棉农的利益；二、在庄稼收完前禁止任何人到地里放牲口，以免毁坏田禾；三、禁止在麦田里走斜道，以保护麦苗。这三项决定受到了全乡人民的拥护，都顺利实现了。由于人民代表大会真正发挥了作用，就大大地提高了人民群众的国家主人翁思想，更加关怀全乡和国家的大事，对干部的监督也加强了。如底张乡第一次人民代表大会议决整修村西的一条渠道，后因秋收紧张，代表大会又议定缓期进行。以后乡人民政府未经人民代表大会通过即动员群众进行整修，群众就纷纷向代表提出质问：“为什么干部不执行代表大会决议？”代表也向乡长提出批评说：“不经过人民代表大会就办全乡人民的大事是不妥当的！”乡长虚心接受了代表的意见，当众进行了检讨。
    普选之后，乡人民政府建立了简便易行的制度，加强了乡人民政府委员会的集体领导，克服了过去的混乱现象，保证了工作的顺利进行。普选后两乡的“五多”现象已大大减少，不仅群众会不得随意召开，就是一般干部会和乡人民政府各种工作委员会，除例会外，只是在确有必要时才得召开。干部和群众都因开会少、误工少而感到满意。同时，又由于各项工作能够通过代表向群众传达，和经过干部深入群众或居民小组长逐户交代安排，到期督促检查，工作效率也大大提高了。乡人民政府委员会每月召开一次，会议除认真研究人民代表大会的决议、组织力量贯彻执行外，并通过各委员会的工作汇报来检查研究各部门的工作，这就使乡人民政府在民主集中制的基础上实现了集体领导，提高了乡政权的工作效能。底张乡每月一、二、三日各委员会分别召开会议，总结上月的工作，布置当月的工作；乡长和副乡长分别参加各委员会的会议，有时则由各委员会的主任委员向乡长汇报。四日召开乡人民政府委员会，由乡长作工作总结报告，提出本月工作计划，并由各委员会主任简要地有重点地向乡人民政府委员会报告工作，每次会议都经过讨论并做出决议。五日召开乡人民代表大会，代表大会除对乡人民政府上月工作报告进行检查外，并对本月工作进行讨论，或根据群众要求，对全乡应兴应革事项做出决议，会后由代表向群众传达，带动群众贯彻执行。根据两乡数月的经验证明，上述制度不仅必要，而且简便易行，对推行工作有很大的作用。底张乡群众反映：“乡政府现在办事有了秩序，头绪不乱了，每月要做些什么事，怎么做，都给群众交代得清清楚楚。”席张乡干部一致认为过去做工作就凭开会，会后如“秋风过耳”，一切都完事；现在按制度到时开会，各人汇报各人的工作，互相检查，开展批评，这样就互相推动起来。
    席张、底张是解县的二、三类乡，过去工作落后的原因之一，是由于干部工作疲沓，不少干部又有强迫命令作风，不能很好地贯彻群众路线，发动群众和依靠群众完成工作。普选之后，干部的群众观点加强了，为人民服务的思想提高了，工作积极起来，群众的思想觉悟也大大提高了，更加热爱政权和拥护干部。现在两个乡的工作正大踏步前进。
