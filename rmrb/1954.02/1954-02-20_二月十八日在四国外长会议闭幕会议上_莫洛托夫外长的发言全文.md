The four foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, at this meeting in Berlin, studied the issues on the agenda concerning the international situation. The exchange of views at the meeting contributed to a more accurate understanding of the positions of the participating countries.

The differences in the positions of our governments were clearly manifested at the meeting. At the same time, as long as the parties concerned truly show a desire to reduce these differences, the ways to reduce these differences have become increasingly apparent.

The Soviet government adheres to a consistent policy of peace and believes, both in the past and now, that the extent to which the Berlin Conference can benefit the people of all countries depends on how much it promotes the consolidation of peace and the security of all countries.

As everyone knows, there is a force in certain major countries that obstructs the improvement of international relations. What this force is concerned about is maintaining, and even intensifying, international tensions. For example, the Korean armistice alarmed them. This is because this force is concerned about large-scale military orders and the arms race. Indeed, this allows them to fill their pockets and increase their profits and super-profits.

However, all this is only the concern of a narrow privileged group in these countries, which seeks to accumulate wealth at the expense of others. As for the concerns of the masses, it can be said that the concerns of countries large and small are completely different. The people are concerned about easing international tensions and consolidating peace, and the entire foreign policy of the Soviet government proceeds from this concern.

This meeting has reached an agreement: The governments of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union will take measures to smoothly resolve the issue of disarmament, or at least the issue of substantial reduction of armaments. This places a clear obligation on the four governments.

In addition, a consensus was reached at the meeting to convene a meeting in Geneva of representatives from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and countries directly related to certain corresponding issues. This meeting will promote the final resolution of the Korean issue. This agreement is conducive to consolidating peace and resolving the issue of national reunification in Korea. The meeting will also discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina. The efforts of the Indochinese people to strive for peace and national freedom will receive the due support of all freedom-loving people.

In the process of discussing the German question, we all expressed that the solution of this question is inseparable from guaranteeing European security. This means that Germany should be unified on a democratic and peaceful basis, and German militarism should not be allowed to revive.

The differences in the positions of the four countries on the German question are now very clear. This Berlin Conference particularly clearly demonstrated that the solution of the German question is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves. The governments of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have the responsibility to resolve the German question. But they must not forget that the mission of foreign occupation forces in Germany is limited, and they should not prevent the Germans from participating in the solution of the German unification issue, that is, the restoration of German unification on a democratic and peaceful basis.

Unfortunately, we were unable to reach an agreement at this meeting on a simple question: to listen to the opinions of the Germans here and understand their own thoughts on the urgent task of unifying Germany and the participation of the German people in guaranteeing peace and European security. The Soviet representatives are convinced that if we listened to the opinions of the Germans, listened to the opinions of representatives from East Germany and West Germany, it would greatly help resolve the urgent issues of concern to the entire German people.

All Germans are focusing their attention on the issue of restoring German unification. In order to achieve German unification, we must promote the early holding of free all-German elections. If we truly hope that Germany will hold free elections, then such elections should be carried out by the Germans themselves, not by foreign occupation authorities.

In order to ensure that the all-German elections can be truly free, the Soviet government has proposed that foreign occupation forces withdraw from the entire territory of Germany, leaving only a limited number of troops. This is the only way to avoid foreign interference and pressure on the free election of members of the all-German National Assembly, which is purely an internal affair of the German people.

The issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany is urgent. Advocating the early conclusion of a peace treaty means advocating the early restoration of German unification. We have not yet been able to reach an agreement even to begin preparing for a peace treaty with Germany. However, this issue must be resolved. The Soviet government hopes that the four governments will continue their efforts to strive for a satisfactory solution to the German question in accordance with the interests of consolidating European peace.

The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union were able to reach agreements during the war. Then, in a peaceful environment, they should be even more capable of finding ways to coordinate their actions, especially in preventing the threat of new wars.

The Soviet government has never concealed its opposition to the formation of military blocs by certain countries to confront other countries. This kind of development in international relations can only intensify the danger of war and runs counter to the goal of establishing lasting world peace.

The Soviet government cannot but point out the particular danger of military blocs like the European Defense Community, because the formation of this bloc means the revival of German militarism. This plan is not in line with the interests of peace and European security.

Therefore, the Soviet government has put forward the proposals contained in the draft All-European Treaty for guaranteeing European collective security. Germany can participate in this treaty on an equal footing, now by East Germany and West Germany, and after reunification by a unified Germany. Non-European countries can also contribute to the realization of the European collective security system. It would be wrong to forget that Europe is the source of the First and Second World Wars. For this reason, the Soviet proposal on concluding an All-European Treaty to guarantee European collective security has special significance.

The Austrian peace treaty could have been resolved at this meeting, but the aforementioned plans that aggravate the danger of the revival of German militarism prevented this goal from being achieved. However, the Soviet government believes that the possibility of resolving this issue in the near future still exists. The Austrian government must take this into account, and the Austrian people must correctly understand this.

The convening of the Berlin Conference and the restoration of direct contact between the four foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have a positive significance in the current situation. This meeting studied some urgent international issues, and the resolution of these issues is necessary for further easing the international situation.

The issues that were not resolved at this meeting have not been removed from the agenda. We must continue our efforts and strive more firmly for the resolution of these issues.

We hope that the Berlin Conference will promote cooperation among countries in international affairs, which is conducive to consolidating peace.

    二月十八日在四国外长会议闭幕会议上
    莫洛托夫外长的发言全文
    苏联、法国、英国和美国四国外长这次在柏林举行的会议，研究了议程上的国际局势问题。会上交换意见的结果有助于更正确地了解与会各国的立场。
    我们这几个国家的政府在立场上的分歧已在会上明显地表现出来。同时，只要有关各方都真正表现出减少这种分歧的愿望，减少这种分歧的途径已愈加明显了。
    苏联政府坚持始终一贯的和平政策，过去和现在都认为：柏林会议能给各国人民带来多少好处，要看它对巩固和平与各国安全起多少促进作用。
    大家知道，在某些大国中有一种阻挠改善国际关系的势力。这种势力所关心的是保持，以至于加剧国际紧张局势。例如，朝鲜停战就使它们着慌了。因为这种势力关心的是大批军事订货和军备竞赛。的确，这样就可以装满他们的口袋，增加他们的利润和超额利润。
    然而，这一切只不过是这些国家中狭隘的特权集团的关心所在，它们力求以牺牲别人为代价来积累财富。至于群众所关心的，也可以说是大大小小国家所关心的，都是完全不同的东西。人民关心的是缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平，苏联政府的整个外交政策就是从这种关心出发的。
    这次会议已达成协议：美国、法国、英国和苏联政府将采取措施，以顺利解决裁军问题，或至少解决大量缩减军备的问题。这就使四国政府负担起明确的义务。
    此外，会上一致同意，在日内瓦召开美国、法国、英国、苏联、中华人民共和国以及与某些相应的问题直接有关的各国代表的会议。这个会议将促进朝鲜问题的最后解决。这个协议有利于巩固和平和解决朝鲜全国统一的问题。会上还将讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。印度支那人民争取和平与民族自由的努力将会得到一切爱好自由的人民的应有的支持。
    在讨论德国问题的过程中，我们大家都表示，这个问题的解决是和保障欧洲安全密不可分的。这就是说，应在民主与和平的基础上统一德国，不让德国军国主义复活。
    四国在德国问题上立场的分歧所在，现在已十分清楚了。这次柏林会议特别明显地说明了，解决德国问题首先是德国人自己的事情。法国、英国、美国和苏联政府负有解决德国问题的责任。但它们一定不能忘记：外国驻德占领军的任务是有限的，它们不应当不让德国人参与解决德国统一的问题，即在民主、和平的基础上恢复德国统一的问题。
    遗憾的是，我们在这次会议上没有能就一个简单的问题取得一致意见：在这里听一听德国人的意见，了解一下他们自己对统一德国的迫切任务和德国人民参与保障和平与欧洲安全的问题有怎样的想法。苏联代表确信，如果我们听取了德国人的意见，听取了东德和西德代表的意见，那末就会大大有助于解决整个德国人民所关心的迫切问题。
    所有的德国人都把注意力集中在恢复德国统一的问题上。为了达成德国的统一，我们必须促成全德自由选举的及早举行。如果我们真正希望德国进行自由选举，那末这种选举应当由德国人自己，而不是由外国占领当局来实行。
    为了保证全德选举能真正自由地进行，苏联政府曾建议外国占领军撤离德国全境，只留下数量有限的部队。这样才能避免外国对于这种纯属德国人民内部事务的全德国民议会议员的自由选举，进行干涉和施加压力。
    缔结对德和约的问题是刻不容缓的。主张必须尽早缔结和约，就是主张尽早恢复德国统一。我们至今连开始准备对德和约这一点也没有能达成协议。然而这个问题是必须解决的。苏联政府希望：四国政府继续努力，争取依照巩固欧洲和平的利益圆满解决德国问题。
    美国、英国、法国和苏联政府在战争期间曾经能够达成协议。那末在和平环境中，它们更应当能够设法使它们的行动协调，特别是在防止新战争威胁这方面。
    苏联政府从来不隐瞒它反对某些国家结成军事集团来对付其他的国家。国际关系的这种发展只能使战争危险加剧，这是和建立世界持久和平的目标背道而驰的。
    苏联政府不能不指出像欧洲防务集团这样一类军事集团的特别危险性，因为这个集团的组成就意味着德国军国主义的复活。这种计划是不符合和平与欧洲安全的利益的。
    因此，苏联政府提出了保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案中所包含的建议。德国可以平等地参加这个条约，现在由东德和西德来参加，恢复统一以后则由统一的德国参加。非欧洲国家也可以有助于欧洲集体安全体系的实现。如果忘记了欧洲是第一次和第二次世界大战的策源地，那就不对了。正因为如此，苏联关于缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议有着特别的意义。
    对奥和约的问题本来是可在这次会上解决的，但是上述加剧德国军国主义复活危险的计划妨碍了达到这个目的。不过，苏联政府相信，在最近解决这个问题的可能性仍然是存在的。奥地利政府必须考虑到这一点，奥地利人民必须正确地理解这一点。
    柏林会议的召开以及法国、英国、美国、苏联四国外长直接接触的恢复，在目前情势之下，具有肯定的意义。这次会议研究了一些迫切的国际问题，而这些问题的解决是为进一步缓和国际局势所必需的。
    这次会议没有解决的问题并没有从日程上除掉。我们必须继续努力，更加坚定不移地争取这些问题的解决。
    我们希望，柏林会议将促进各国在国际事务上的合作，而这是有利于巩固和平的。
