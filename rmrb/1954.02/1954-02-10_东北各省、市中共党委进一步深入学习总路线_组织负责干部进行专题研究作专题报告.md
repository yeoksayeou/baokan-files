The Northeast Provinces and Municipalities' CCP Committees are currently adopting various measures to further deepen the study and propaganda of the General Line. According to the instructions of the CCP Central Committee Northeast Bureau, each province and municipality is organizing principal responsible cadres to conduct thematic research in conjunction with the actual work of their region and department and the ideological situation of the cadres, and to make thematic reports to the cadres. The main contents of these thematic studies and reports are formulated based on the basic content of the General Line, how various business departments should implement the General Line, and the main problems existing in the past implementation of the General Line. Various localities have also stipulated methods for thematic research and reporting, that is, first the relevant business departments discuss, then the senior group study meeting or core group discusses, and then reports are made to all cadres or cadres of relevant departments at various professional meetings, or articles are written and published in newspapers and periodicals. In addition to designating eleven principal leading cadres to serve as lecturers for senior, intermediate, and junior groups in the provincial and municipal organs, the CCP Rehe Provincial Committee also designated twenty-five leading cadres to form a lecture group and go to various counties and districts to report on the General Line to cadres. These thematic studies and reports are generally required to be completed successively before mid-February in various localities. Up to now, some areas have made one to three thematic reports to cadres. Yang Yichen, Secretary of the CCP Liaoxi Provincial Committee, and Li Huang, Second Deputy Secretary, successively made two thematic reports on January 16 and 23. The core group of the CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee is organizing discussions on various major thematic reports. Huang Oudong, Secretary of the Municipal Committee, personally leads this work, and each topic must be reviewed by the core group. Several major thematic reports must also be discussed in the core group, and the Secretary of the Municipal Committee will make a summary of the discussion. (Xinhua News Agency)

    东北各省、市中共党委进一步深入学习总路线
    组织负责干部进行专题研究作专题报告
    东北各省、市中共党委目前正采取各项措施，以使总路线的学习和宣传进一步深入。根据中共中央东北局的指示，各省、市正在组织主要负责干部结合本地区、本部门实际工作和干部思想情况，进行专题研究，并向干部作专题报告。这些专题研究和报告的主要内容，是根据总路线的基本内容，各业务部门如何贯彻总路线，以及过去实行总路线中存在的主要问题而制定的。各地并规定了专题研究和报告的办法，即先由有关的业务部门讨论，再经高级组学习会或核心组讨论，然后再在各种专业会议上向全体干部或有关部门的干部作报告，或写成文章在报刊上发表。中共热河省委除指定十一名主要领导干部担任省、市机关高级、中级、初级组的讲师外，并指定二十五名领导干部组成讲师团，分赴各县、区向干部作关于总路线的报告。这些专题的研究和报告，各地一般要求在二月中旬以前陆续作完。到目前为止，有的地区已向干部作了一个到三个题目的专题报告。中共辽西省委书记杨易辰、第二副书记李荒于一月十六、二十三日先后作了两个专题报告。中共沈阳市委核心组正在组织各主要专题报告的讨论。市委书记黄欧东亲自领导这一工作，各个专题都要经过核心组审查，其中几个主要专题报告还要在核心组讨论，并由市委书记做出讨论的总结。　（新华社）
