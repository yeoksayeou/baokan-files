    Design Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Actively Compiles Work Plans
    The Design Company of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry is actively compiling work plans, and the design of some projects has already begun. In order to strengthen plan management, the company organized a plan management work research group in November 1953, sent people to Anshan to learn from the design plan management experience of Anshan Iron and Steel, and later, according to the instructions of the State Planning Commission, formulated fourteen types of design plan forms and established a relatively complete design plan management system. Subsequently, the company's employees launched a wave of learning and strengthening plan management. The company's annual plan for this year was completed in January. During the compilation of the plan, employees enthusiastically learned from advanced experiences, looked for shortcuts, and tapped potential strengths. For example, when estimating workload, the general architectural design section used the "drawing cutting and pasting method" to shorten a design project from the original plan of 550 working days to 350 working days. Currently, the company is compiling work plans and signing liaison contracts between various professional design sections. Important projects entrusted by Anshan Iron and Steel, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and other units have begun to be designed. In order to ensure the completion of the 1954 design tasks, the general architectural design section is about to launch a patriotic production competition, and some professional design sections are learning from advanced Soviet experience, such as Soviet hollow wall design, standard components, and various design calculation tables.

    重工业部设计公司
    积极编制作业计划
    中央重工业部设计公司正积极编制作业计划，部分工程已开始进行设计。该公司为了加强计划管理，自一九五三年十一月组织了计划管理工作研究小组，派人去鞍山学习了鞍钢的设计计划管理经验，以后又根据国家计划委员会的指示，制订了十四种设计计划表格，并订出一套比较完整的设计计划管理制度。接着，该公司职工掀起了学习与加强计划管理的热潮。该公司今年年度计划已在一月编制完了。在编制计划中，职工们热烈学习先进经验，找窍门，挖掘潜在力量。如在估计工作量时，一般建筑设计科利用“图纸剪贴法”将某设计工程由原计划五百五十个工作日缩短到三百五十个工作日。目前该公司正编制作业计划，签订各专业设计科之间的联系合同。鞍钢、本溪钢铁公司、北京钢铁工业学院等单位所委托的重要工程，已开始进行设计。为保证一九五四年设计任务的完成，一般建筑设计科即将开展爱国主义生产竞赛，有些专业设计科正在学习苏联先进经验，如苏联的空心墙设计、标准构件以及各种设计计算表等。
