Miner Zhang Guofu Returns to the Right Path
Ma Liang, Sui Yang

As soon as the whistle blew for the first time, the workers of the Datong Coal Mine rushed to the pit entrance like a tide. People talked and laughed, discussing the production achievements of the previous day and planning their work after going down the pit that day. In the crowd, a tall man strode forward. Behind him, people were discussing: Zhang Guofu is indeed different from his previous sluggishness since he settled that muddled account.

(I)

Zhang Guofu is in his forties this year. Before liberation, he worked as a "shepherd boy" and "pig herder" for landlords, going out under the stars and returning under the moon. In the dead of winter, he wore a tattered and dirty half-length jacket and shoes with exposed toes, and had to go to the fields to herd sheep every day. In 1938, Zhang Guofu, who was wandering around Tianjin, was driven to the Datong Coal Mine to carry coal by a feudal foreman. He originally thought that being a worker might be better than being a long-term laborer, but he and his wife worked from morning till night and still couldn't get enough to eat.

After liberation, with the development of production, the lives of the workers continued to improve. Zhang Guofu and his wife not only ate better, but also put on brand-new fur coats. Zhang Guofu thanked the Communist Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart, and he was particularly diligent in production.

(II)

However, as he got older, Zhang Guofu gradually became uneasy. He thought: The current society is good, but individuals should also plan for the long term. Young people are learning culture and technology. When the technology becomes complicated and new people come in, wouldn't I, an illiterate, be in trouble? With this in mind, he made a decision: let his wife first raise a couple of piglets, and when the piglets grow up, add some money to buy a few big sheep. He calculated that the big sheep would give birth to small sheep, and in a few years he would become the owner of a small flock of sheep, and he wouldn't have to worry about anything in the future.

Sure enough, Zhang Guofu's "ideal" began to be realized in the spring of 1953; a sheep pen was built in the yard, and he raised his nine most beloved sheep. From then on, he became busy: he produced underground at night and grazed sheep on the hillside during the day; if it was his turn to go down the pit during the day, he also had to buy grass and fodder in nearby villages and towns at night. To take care of the sheep, he had to give up studying. As time went on, his work attitude also changed. He had to be urged to move, and he was always worried about the sheep at home whether he was walking or standing.

Once, a two-layer roof should have been removed, but Zhang Guofu was again thinking about the sheep's grass, fodder, diseases, and wolves. He just casually put up a very unreliable support. As a result, when the coal cutting machine driver moved the machine, he accidentally knocked down the support, and the roof fell, almost causing a serious accident. For this matter, Zhang Guofu was criticized by the workers and received a little punishment.

(III)

Zhang Guofu's abnormal behavior gradually attracted the attention of his comrades. In order to find out the truth, the secretary of the pit entrance party branch, the chairman of the trade union, and the workers in the group specially visited the remote place where Zhang Guofu lived - Hougou. After clarifying the situation, the group held a meeting. The comrades praised his past merits and pointed out his current mistakes. After this, the leading comrades at the pit entrance also educated him twice. But every time he was asked about raising sheep, he always said that it was for milking his eight-month-old child and he had no other intentions.

Recently, party branch secretary Li Lifu and trade union chairman Yang Laicheng took the time to talk to him again.

Li Lifu spoke first, and then chatted casually with a series of questions and answers:

"Old Zhang, are you doing well?"

"Yes! Since the Communist Party liberated us, we've been eating white flour and rice, and sometimes we can even eat a pound of meat."

"Life is getting better and better! In 1950 you only earned 200,000 yuan a month, and last year you could earn more than 600,000 yuan."

"It's all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership that our production has increased and the country has become rich."

"That's right. We can live well, firstly because of the leadership of the Communist Party, and secondly because of everyone's joint efforts to develop production. But some people don't understand this truth, and they are still developing towards individual small-scale production, buying camels and hitching carts, which affects large-scale production. If this continues, how can the country be built well? Do you think that's right?"

Zhang Guofu lowered his head and did not answer. Seeing that Zhang Guofu did not speak, the chairman of the trade union said:

"Let's not talk about that for now. Old Zhang, what do you think of the development of our mine?"

"It's fast!" Zhang Guofu raised his head and said, "When we were first liberated, the mine was still digging grooves and drilling holes manually, and carrying coal manually. Now we have not only ventilators, electric drills, coal cutting machines, and loading machines, but also 'combines'. That thing is really useful, one person can operate it and produce hundreds of tons of coal a day."

"Our mine has developed, do you see anyone unemployed?"

"No. There are more workers than before."

"That's right! The better we build the country, the more guaranteed everyone's life will be. Fearing that there will be no way out in socialism is a muddled idea. If we only care about developing ourselves, we cannot industrialize, we cannot build socialism. Go back and think carefully, is it better for us to go to socialism or to take the capitalist road?"

Zhang Guofu was walking on the road, and the dark and gloomy days of the past flooded into his mind. When he recalled the little girl who was starved to death, he simply couldn't bear to think about it anymore. At this time, he suddenly raised his head and rebuked himself:

"How muddled I am! What kind of master am I!"

(IV)

In the past, Zhang Guofu always found those sheep very cute. This day, when he saw this group of "stupid things," he didn't feel anything at all. As soon as he entered the door, he said to his wife, "Sell those sheep, we don't need them anymore!" "Why?" His wife was confused. Zhang Guofu told his wife what the comrades had said and what he had thought on the road. A few days later, their yard became as quiet as it used to be.

Zhang Guofu had fewer sheep, as if he had unloaded a heavy burden, and his mind was much clearer. When he went down the pit, without being told, he looked around, and if he found even a small piece of loose skin or top stone, he would always try to get it down if he felt it was suspicious. He always attended all kinds of meetings held by the mine on time, as long as he was allowed to participate. A few days ago, he said at the group meeting, "Our security work is a big responsibility. If we are not careful and an accident occurs, the mine's task will not be completed, which will affect the major affairs of the country."

The workers' comment on him is: Zhang Guofu has returned to the right path.

    矿工张国富又回到正路上来了
    马良　随阳
    汽笛刚刚响过头遍，大同煤矿的工人们就像潮水似的奔向井口去了。人们说着，笑着，谈论着前一天的生产成绩，计划着当天下井后的工作。人丛中，一个高个子直冲冲地大步前进。他的背后有人议论着：张国富自从算清了那笔糊涂账，确实和以前那股疲沓劲儿不一样了。
    （一）
    张国富今年四十来岁，解放前给地主当过“羊倌”和“猪僮”，每天披着星星出去，戴着月亮回来。十冬腊月天，他穿着一件又烂、又脏的半截小袄，拖着露脚指头的鞋，每天还要到野地里去放羊。一九三八年，流浪在天津一带的张国富，又被封建把头赶到大同煤矿来背炭。他原来估计着当工人或许比扛长工强一些，那知他和妻子从早忙到黑，还是吃不上一顿饱饭。
    解放后，随着生产的发展，工人们的生活不断得到改善。张国富和他的妻子不但吃食好了，还穿上了新崭崭的大皮袄。张国富从心底里感谢共产党，感谢毛主席，在生产上表现得特别努力。
    （二）
    但是，随着年龄的增长，张国富逐渐地不安起来了，他想：如今的社会好是好，可是个人也应往长远打算。人家年轻的都在学文化、学技术，将来技术一复杂，新人手一上来，咱这瞎汉还不得受困吗？想到这里，他拿了一个主意：让老婆先喂两口小猪，等小猪长大了，添几个钱再买几只大羊。他盘算着：大羊生小羊，过不了几年自己就变成了有一小群羊的主人，以后再用不着发什么愁了。
    果然，张国富的“理想”在一九五三年春天开始实现了；院子里垒起了一个羊圈，养上了他最心爱的九只绵羊。从这时起他就忙起来了：晚上到井下生产，白天到山坡上放羊；如果是轮到白天下井，晚上还得到附近村镇买草打料。要照顾羊，他不得不放弃学习。日子久了，工作态度也发生了变化，催一催，动一动，走着站着都在挂念着家里的羊。
    有一次，一块二层顶本来应该挑掉，但张国富又在盘算着羊的草、料、病和狼的问题，他只马马虎虎地打了一个很不牢靠的支柱。结果，割煤机的司机在移动机器时，随手一带就将支柱撞倒，顶板落下来，险些造成严重事故。为了这事，张国富被工人们批评了一顿，还受了一点处分。
    （三）
    张国富的反常现象慢慢地引起了同志们的注意。为了摸清底细，井口党支部书记、工会主席和组里的工人们，特意访问了张国富住的那个偏僻的地方——后沟。事情弄明白以后，小组里便召开了会议。同志们表扬了他过去的优点，也指出了现在的错误。在这以后，井口的领导同志又对他进行了两次教育。但是每次问到他养羊的事，他总是说为了给八个月的孩子挤奶吃，没别的心思。
    最近，党支部书记李力夫和工会主席杨来成又抽空和他谈了一次。
    李力夫先发言，接着就一问一答地漫谈起来：
    “老张，光景过得好吧？”
    “好啊！自从共产党解放了咱，吃上白面、大米了，有时候还能吃斤肉呢。”
    “光景越过越好啊！一九五○年每月你才拿二十来万元，去年你就能开六十多万啦。”
    “都是毛主席领导的好，咱们生产提高了，国家富裕了。”
    “对啦。咱们生活能过好，第一是有共产党的领导，第二是大家共同努力发展生产。但是有些人还不明白这个道理，他们还向个人小生产方面发展，买骆驼呀，拴车呀，影响了大生产。照这样下去，国家怎能建设好。你说对不对？”
    张国富低下头没有回答。工会主席见张国富不发言，就说：
    “这个先不谈它。老张，你看咱矿上发展得怎样？”
     “快呀！”张国富抬起头来说：“刚解放时，矿上还是人工掏槽打眼，人工背炭。现在不光有风机、电钻、割煤机、装车机，还有了‘康拜因’。那个家伙真顶事，一个人开，一天能出好几百吨煤。”
     “我们矿上发展了，你看有没有失业的？”
     “没有。工人比以前更多了。”
     “对！我们把国家建设得越好，大家的生活越有保证。怕到了社会主义没办法是糊涂的想法。如果我们只顾发展个人，就不能工业化，就不能建设社会主义。你回去好好想想，咱们到社会主义好，还是走资本主义的路好？”
    张国富走在路上，过去昏天黑日的生活涌上了心头，当他回忆起活活被饿死的小女孩时，简直不敢再想下去了。这时，他猛然抬头，责备自己说：
    “真糊涂，咱这算啥主人翁！”
    （四）
    往日，张国富见了那几只羊，总觉得很可爱。这一天，他看到这群“笨物”，再没有一点什么味道。一进门就对老伴说：“把那些羊卖了吧，不用要啦！”“为什么？”妻子听了摸不着头脑。张国富就把同志们的话和路上所想的事情，向妻子说了一遍。没过几天，他们的院子里又和从前一样的安静起来。
    张国富少了几只羊，好像卸掉一个沉重的包袱，头脑清醒得多了。到了井下，不用人吩咐，他就东瞧瞧，西看看，那怕是一小块零皮、顶石，觉得可疑时总要想法把它搞下来。矿上召开的各种会议，只要允许他参加，他总是按时到场。前些天他在小组会上说：“咱这保安工作责任可大啦，如果不细心，出了事故，矿上任务完不成，就要影响国家大事。”
    工人们对他的评论是：张国富又回到正路上来了。
