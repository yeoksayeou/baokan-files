Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 23rd: According to TASS, the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany held a meeting in Berlin on the 21st to discuss the results of the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The Executive Bureau of the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front gave a detailed report at the meeting on the powerful national movement launched by the patriotic forces of the German people throughout the country during the Berlin Conference. Eleven million seven hundred thousand people signed in support of the constructive proposals made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Berlin Conference. Professor Correns, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Committee, pointed out at the meeting that the Bonn government and its newspapers are now creating rumors and engaging in slander in an attempt to confuse the West German people about Molotov's proposals.

Jo. Diekmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, made a report at the meeting on the results of the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference and the current tasks of the National Front.

The National Committee meeting passed an appeal to the German people. The appeal stated: The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference opened a new stage in the struggle to ease international tensions and to fight for the independence and security of all peoples. The appeal condemned the Western countries for disregarding the German people's will to peacefully restore German unity and conclude a peace treaty on a democratic basis. It welcomed Molotov's proposals and his view that the solution of the German question is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves. The appeal pointed out that the demand for the establishment of a provisional all-German government has become a national demand. Only this government can guarantee truly free and democratic all-German elections, free from foreign supervision, the influence of monopoly capitalists, and the threat of fascist military organizations. The German people demand the conclusion of a peace treaty that is in the interests of the German nation. Therefore, every patriotic German advocates a democratic national referendum throughout Germany: "For or against the Bonn and Paris Treaties, or for a peace treaty?"

The appeal stated: The Foreign Ministers' Conference has ended, but the important task of maintaining and consolidating peace has not been removed from the agenda. The struggle for the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany will be more intense. In this struggle, our people constantly receive the extensive friendly support of the powerful Soviet Union and all other countries in the world peace camp. Standing on our side in this struggle are also the masses of people in Western European countries, especially France and Italy. The appeal called on all patriots in both East and West Germany to widely publicize the national demands expressed by the government and People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, as well as the Soviet government's constructive proposals for a peaceful solution to the German question, to convince every honest German of the need to actively participate in the great national movement. The appeal also called on all members and supporters of the National Front to fully promote initiative in the preparatory stage of the Second National Congress and to mobilize the entire German people to fight for the peaceful and happy future of Germany. The appeal concluded by calling on all German patriots to jointly fight for the establishment of a unified, peaceful, democratic, and independent Germany, for the withdrawal of occupying forces from all of Germany, for the establishment of a provisional all-German government, and for the conclusion of a peace treaty.

    民主德国全国阵线发表告德国人民书
    号召全德人民为和平解决德国问题而斗争
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：民主德国全国阵线全国委员会于二十一日在柏林举行会议，讨论有关柏林外长会议的结果的问题。
    全国阵线全国委员会主席团执行局在会上详细地报告了在柏林会议期间德国人民的爱国力量在全国展开的强大的民族运动的情况。一千一百七十万人签名支持苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫在柏林会议上提出的建设性建议。全国委员会主席团主席柯伦斯教授在会上指出，波恩政府和它的报纸现在正在制造谣言和进行污蔑，企图混淆西德人民对莫洛托夫所提出的建议的注意。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席约·狄克曼在会上作了关于柏林外长会议的结果和全国阵线当前的任务的报告。
    全国委员会会议通过了告德国人民书。告人民书说：柏林四国外长会议为争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取各国人民独立和安全的斗争开辟了一个新阶段。告人民书斥责西方国家无视德国人民要求在民主基础上和平恢复德国统一与缔结对德和约的意志，而欢迎莫洛托夫的各项建议以及他认为解决德国问题首先是德国人自己的事情的意见。告人民书指出，建立临时的全德政府的要求已成为全国的要求。只有这个政府才能保证举行真正自由、民主的全德选举，不受外国的监督，不受垄断资本家的影响和不受法西斯军事组织的威胁。德国人民要求缔结符合于德国民族利益的和约。因此，每一个爱国的德国人都主张在全德进行民主的全民投票：“赞成波恩和巴黎条约还是赞成和约？”
    告人民书说：外长会议结束了，然而维护及巩固和平的重大任务还没有从议事日程上除掉。争取和平民主地重新统一德国的斗争将更加激烈，在这个斗争中，我们的人民不断地得到强大的苏联和世界和平阵营所有其他国家广泛的友谊支持。在这个斗争中，站在我们这一边的还有西欧各国的，特别是法国和意大利的人民群众。告人民书号召德国东西两部分的全体爱国人士广泛地宣传德意志民主共和国政府和人民议院表示的民族要求，以及苏联政府关于和平解决德国问题的建设性的建议，使每个正直的德国人相信必须积极参加巨大的民族运动。告人民书并号召全国阵线的全体成员和拥护者，在第二次全国代表大会的筹备阶段中，充分发扬主动精神，动员全体德国人民来为德国的和平与幸福的未来而斗争。告人民书最后号召德国全体爱国分子，为建立一个统一、和平、民主、独立的德国，为使占领军撤离全德国，为建立一个临时的全德政府、为缔结和约而共同斗争。
