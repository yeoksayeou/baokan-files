Lantian County Emphasizes Grain Storage Work
Four Years Without Grain Spoilage

    The Lantian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the government, and leading cadres of the grain department in Shaanxi Province have emphasized grain storage work. Over the past four years, no spoilage has occurred in the stored grain, and the average loss rate has only reached 0.0108%.

    Most of the grain warehouses in Lantian County are charity warehouses, temples, or rented private houses, some of which are not ventilated and some of which cannot be sealed tightly. In addition, most of the county is mountainous, grain-delivering households are scattered, and the grain quality is also poor. Therefore, there are many difficulties in grain storage work. However, thanks to the leadership's emphasis on this work and the active efforts of all cadres, great achievements have finally been made.

    Over the past four years, the county's grain department has held a symposium for all grain storage personnel in the county every year in March and April (before the public grain enters the warehouse) and July and August (after the public grain enters the warehouse). In addition to studying technical issues related to warehouse environmental sanitation, empty warehouse disinfection, and warehouse padding, the meeting focused on conducting political and ideological education for staff members on cherishing people's property. Through these symposiums, the responsibility of staff members has been enhanced, and a series of practical work systems and business learning systems have been established throughout the county.

    Since 1951, in addition to cooperating with the province and prefecture in inspecting grain storage work, the county has also dispatched cadres to conduct regular inspections every year, and the head of the grain section also frequently goes to the countryside for spot checks. Problems are found, and timely notifications are made, along with criticism and commendation.

    Over the past four years, the principle of "prevention is more important than cure" has been implemented in the county's grain storage work. Grain depots in various places conduct overturning and trenching work at any time so that grain temperature and moisture can be dissipated in time, and moisture-proof work is carried out patiently. Grain depots throughout the county do a good job of repairing and padding the warehouses for the summer grain harvest of the following year around December each year, which avoids the phenomenon of damp warehouse walls soaking the grain.

    Responsibility systems and scientific and easy-to-implement work systems have been established in grain depots throughout the county. Cadres in each grain depot have clear divisions of labor and are responsible for the storage and inspection of separate warehouses. During the period from July to October each year when grain is prone to spoilage, they insist on working in the warehouse, capturing grain pests and checking grain temperature changes at any time. If there is a phenomenon of grain fever, they immediately carry out overturning, drying, and other work. In addition, the staff of each grain depot implement a strict handover system and a ten-day duty system, and conscientiously implement the three-day spot check and five-day general check system. Each grain depot also pays attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of each staff member, so that working methods are continuously improved, thereby effectively preventing the phenomena of grain fever and mold.

    蓝田县重视粮食保管工作
    四年来没有发生粮食霉坏现象
    陕西省蓝田县中共党委、政府及粮食部门领导干部重视粮食保管工作，四年来保管的粮食没有发生过霉坏现象，平均损耗率仅达千分之零点一零八。
    蓝田县粮食仓库绝大部分是义仓、庙宇或租赁的民房，有的不通风，有的不能密闭，加以该县大部地区是山区，交粮户分散，粮质也较差，因此，粮食保管工作中有不少困难。但是由于领导部门重视这一工作，全体干部积极努力，终于作出很大成绩。
    四年来，该县粮食部门每到三、四月（公粮入仓前）和七、八月（公粮入仓后）都要召开一次全县粮食保管人员座谈会，会上除研究仓库环境卫生、空仓消毒、仓库铺垫等有关技术问题以外，着重对工作人员进行爱护人民财产的政治思想教育。通过这些座谈会，提高了工作人员的责任心，并在全县普遍建立了一系列切实可行的工作制度和业务学习制度。
    该县从一九五一年起，除配合省、专区检查粮食保管工作外，还抽调干部每年定期进行检查，粮食科科长也经常下乡抽查。发现问题，及时通报，进行批评、表扬。
    四年来，该县粮食保管工作中贯彻了“防重于治”的原则。各地粮库随时进行倒翻、开沟工作，使粮食温度、水分及时得到发散，并耐心进行了防潮的工作。全县各地粮库在每年十二月左右就做好下一年夏季收粮仓库的修补、铺垫等工作，这样就避免了仓库墙壁不干浸湿粮食的现象。
    该县各地粮库都建立了责任制和科学易行的各种工作制度。各粮库干部都明确分工，分仓负责保管、检查。每年七月到十月粮食容易霉坏的期间，坚持仓内办公，随时捕捉粮食害虫和检查粮温变化情况，遇有粮食发热现象，立即进行翻、晒等工作。另外，各粮库工作人员实行了严格的交接制度和十日值班制度，认真执行了三日抽查、五日普查制度。各粮库并注意发挥了每个工作人员的积极性，使工作方法不断改进，从而有效地防止了粮食的发热、发霉等现象。
