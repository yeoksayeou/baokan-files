The Northwest Region will vigorously conduct geological exploration.

In accordance with the requirements of the state's First Five-Year Plan, the capital construction tasks of state-owned and local state-owned industries in the Northwest Region this year will have a significant increase. According to preliminary statistics, the total investment will increase by 44% compared to last year. Among these, geological exploration and drilling will see the largest increase, accounting for approximately 36% of the region's total investment. The completion of these tasks will prepare the conditions for the future industrial development of the Northwest.

Petroleum geological exploration is the focus of capital construction in the Northwest Region this year. To determine the distribution and reserves of petroleum, the Northwest Region has done a great deal of work since liberation, proving that the vast areas of the Northwest have abundant reserves. This year, the state's investment in petroleum geological exploration has more than doubled compared to last year, the exploration area has increased by more than 20,000 square kilometers compared to last year, and the drilling depth has increased by 73% compared to last year. The investment in expanding the capacity of existing oil extraction and refining equipment has also increased by more than half compared to last year. After the completion of these tasks, oil production will be greatly improved. In addition, the completion of the region's geological exploration tasks this year will provide a better understanding and grasp of the reserves of coal, ferrous metals, and non-ferrous metals in the Northwest region, providing conditions for the development of the coal industry and other heavy industries. There has also been an increase compared to last year in basic construction tasks such as coal mines, electricity, and the machinery industry. While concentrating major efforts on preparing conditions for the development of heavy industry, light industry will also be developed accordingly this year. The newly built state-owned Third Cotton Textile Mill can be fully completed and put into production this year.

In order to complete this year's capital construction tasks, relevant departments in the Northwest Region have used great efforts to carry out a series of preparatory work. The Geological Bureau of the Petroleum Administration Bureau, the Northwest Geological Bureau, and the Coal Mine Administration Bureau began to increase and adjust organizational structures, allocate cadres, and organize field geological work teams for study at the end of last year based on this year's tasks. At present, the winter training work of the field work team of the Petroleum Geological Bureau has ended, and the overall design of this year's exploration work and the exploration design of each field team are being carried out. The design quality has been greatly improved compared to last year. The Northwest Geological Bureau has added four new teams this year, and drilling rigs and other important materials are being transported to the construction site. The Petroleum Drilling Bureau has also made arrangements for the allocation of drilling rigs and equipment. Preparatory organizations have generally been established for the construction and installation projects of factories and mines under the jurisdiction of each bureau, and most units have carried out design and construction preparations. The basic construction projects of each province and city have generally been determined, and a lot of preparation work has been carried out.

    西北区将大力进行地质勘探
    根据国家第一个五年计划的要求，今年西北区国营和地方国营工业基本建设任务有很大的增长，据初步统计，总投资额比去年增加百分之四十四。其中地质勘查、钻探增长最大，约占全区总投资额的百分之三十六，这些任务的完成，将为今后西北工业的发展准备条件。
    石油地质勘探是今年西北区基本建设的重点。为了摸清石油分布情况和蕴藏量，解放以来西北区曾做了不少工作，证明西北广大地区都有丰富的蕴藏。今年国家在石油地质勘探方面的投资比去年增加了一倍多，勘查面积较去年增加两万多平方公里，钻井深度比去年增加百分之七十三。扩充现有采油、炼油设备能力的投资，也较去年增加一半多。这些任务完成以后，石油产量将有很大的提高。此外，今年全区地质勘探任务的完成，将对西北地区的煤、黑色金属及有色金属等资源的蕴藏情况，有更进一步的了解和掌握，为发展煤业和其他重工业提供条件。在煤矿、电业、机械工业等基本建设任务方面，也比去年有了增加。在集中主要力量为发展重工业准备条件的同时，今年还相应地发展轻工业。新建的国营第三棉纺织厂，今年可以全部完工，投入生产。
    为了完成今年的基本建设任务，西北区各有关部门，都用了很大力量进行了一系列的准备工作。石油管理总局地质局、西北地质局和煤矿管理局在去年年底就开始根据今年的任务，增设与调整了组织机构，配备干部，并组织野外地质工作队进行学习。目前，石油地质局野外工作队冬训工作已经结束，正在进行今年勘探工作的总体设计和各个野外队的勘探设计，设计质量比去年提高了很多。西北地质局今年新增加了四个队，钻机和其他重要的物资正在往工地运输。石油钻探局也作了钻机、器材的调配工作。各局所属厂矿的建筑安装工程，一般都建立了筹备机构，大多数单位已进行了设计和施工的准备工作。各省市的基本建设项目一般都已确定，并进行了很多准备工作。
