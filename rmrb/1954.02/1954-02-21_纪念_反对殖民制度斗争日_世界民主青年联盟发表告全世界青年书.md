Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 20th: The World Federation of Democratic Youth, in anticipation of February 21st – "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism and Solidarity with Colonial Youth," has issued an appeal to the youth of the world, the text of which follows:

    Young men and women of the world! February 21st – the International Day of Struggle Against Colonialism and Solidarity with Colonial Youth – is approaching.

    You must be concerned about the young men and women of Vietnam and Malaya who are trapped in colonial wars. The enemies of peace are trying to expand the war in Vietnam! May the wave of protests against the dirty war in Vietnam and demanding an end to all ongoing wars crush this conspiracy!

    Do not forget the massacres in Kenya, British Guiana, and Uganda, and do not forget the trampling of national sovereignty. Stand with all those who defend justice, prosperity, progress, civilization, and freedom, and protest these atrocities!

    Pay close attention to all actions that threaten the national independence of all peoples. To maintain international tension, military bases are being established on foreign territories, and aggressive military pacts are being signed. The direct aim of these actions is to deprive young people of their economic, cultural, and civil rights, and to threaten world peace.

    Remember that all over the world, millions of your brothers and sisters are heroically struggling against the barbarity of colonialism.

    The united struggle of youth against colonialism and in defense of national independence is a great contribution to the movement demanding the settlement of international disputes through negotiation, striving for the relaxation of international tensions, and defending peace.

    Young friends who are engaged in a heroic struggle for complete liberation from national enslavement, reaffirm your solemn oath to fight for freedom and the complete independence of your countries, and strengthen your struggle. Always be aware that the hearts of millions of honest young people around the world are with you, and the era when colonialists could do as they pleased is gone forever. Victory is yours.

    The World Federation of Democratic Youth, as in the past, will fully support the just struggle of youth around the world to defend peace, national independence, and oppose colonialism!

    On February 21st, please accept the friendly greetings of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which unites 83 million young people from 92 countries around the world.

    Young friends around the world! Extend a helping hand to all young brothers and sisters in colonial and oppressed countries! Support them with practical actions! Unite to ease international tensions, to stop all ongoing wars, and to prevent violations of the national independence of all peoples!

    纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”
    世界民主青年联盟发表告全世界青年书
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】世界民主青年联盟为迎接二月二十一日——“反对殖民制度斗争日”，发表告全世界青年书，原文如下：
    全世界的男女青年们！二月二十一日——国际反对殖民制度斗争与声援殖民地青年日就要来到了。
    你们要关怀陷在殖民战争中的越南和马来亚的男女青年们。和平的敌人正设法扩大越南战争！愿反对越南的肮脏战争并要求结束所有现正进行的战争的抗议浪潮粉碎这个阴谋！
    不要忘记怯尼亚、英属圭亚那和乌干达的大屠杀，不要忘记国家主权的受践踏。和所有保卫正义、繁荣、进步、文明与自由的人在一起，抗议这些暴行！
    密切注意威胁各国人民民族独立的一切行动。为了保持国际紧张局势，军事基地在外国领土上建立起来了，侵略性的军事公约签订了。这些行动的直接的目的是想剥夺青年的经济、文化权利和公权，并威胁世界和平。
    你们要记住，在世界各地，正有千百万你们的兄弟姊妹在英勇地进行斗争，反对野蛮的殖民制度。
    青年们反对殖民制度和保卫民族独立的团结一致的斗争，对于要求通过协商解决国际分歧、争取缓和国际局势和保卫和平的运动是一个很大的贡献。
    为争取从民族奴役下完全解放而进行英勇斗争的青年朋友们，重申你们为自由、为你们国家的完全独立而斗争的庄严誓言，加强你们的斗争。经常要认识到世界各地千百万正直青年人的心是与你们在一起的，殖民主义者能够畅所欲为的时代就要一去不复返了。胜利是你们的。
    世界民主青年联盟像过去一样，将以全力支持世界各地青年保卫和平、民族独立与反对殖民制度的正义斗争！
    在二月二十一日的时候，请接受团结了世界上九十二个国家的八千三百万青年的世界民主青年联盟的友好敬意。
    全世界的青年朋友们！向所有殖民地与被压迫国家的青年兄弟姊妹伸出援手！以实际行动支持他们！团结起来，争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取停止现正进行的一切战争，制止对各国人民民族独立的侵犯！
