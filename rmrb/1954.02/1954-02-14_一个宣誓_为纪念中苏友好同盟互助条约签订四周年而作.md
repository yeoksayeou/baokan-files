The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is unbreakable. It is, in fact, closer than that between any brothers. We, the Chinese people, cherish this noble friendship with even more care than we cherish our own eyes.

This feeling has its deep source in the hearts of the Chinese people. It was in our most difficult, most distressed, and most humiliated times that we grasped the warm and powerful hand extended to us by the great Soviet people. The gratitude of the recipient is beyond description.

When we were subjected to the tyrannical trampling of the imperialist bloc, bound by all kinds of unequal treaties that suffocated us, it was the Soviet government that first automatically declared the abolition of the unequal treaties concluded between Tsarist Russia and old China.

When we suffered large-scale military aggression by Japanese imperialism, and all the imperialist countries stood by indifferently, even secretly supporting Japanese imperialism – as the United States regularly sold large quantities of cotton, scrap iron, steel, and machinery to Japan as tools for its war of aggression – the great Soviet people supported us with unparalleled spiritual and material strength. And in the end, it was mainly thanks to the Soviet military power defeating Japanese imperialism, forcing it to surrender unconditionally, that our eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan came to a victorious end.

Following the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, we then had four years of domestic war, in which the Chinese people defeated the Kuomintang reactionary government, which was fully supported by US imperialism, and established our own people's motherland. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize us, on the second day after the founding of the People's Republic of China. That was October 2, 1949, a day that is truly second only to our National Day and one that we will never forget. That day was also the "International Day of Struggle for Peace" and the day on which the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace was officially established. The Soviet Union sent a delegation of literary and artistic workers, headed by Comrade Fadeyev, to participate in our founding ceremony and the inaugural meeting of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. These days and the circumstances surrounding them will forever remain as vivid as yesterday for us.

The People's Republic of China has been founded. We want to recover from the wounds of war, we want to develop the national economy, and we want to take the Soviet Union as an example to build our own motherland into a socialist country. But we lack experience, our modern industrial base is weak, and in particular, the scientific foundation that is extremely necessary for production and construction is very weak. We face great difficulties in completing the great, glorious, and new historical task before us. At this time, at the invitation of the Chinese government, the great Soviet people and the Soviet government have sent many outstanding experts to help us. In terms of financial and economic construction and in terms of cultural and educational construction, they have provided us with extremely rich knowledge, and even taken care of the health of our cadre comrades. This has enabled us to quickly complete the recovery phase and embark on the stage of planned construction.

This year is already the second year of our first Five-Year Plan. With the great and selfless assistance of the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and Soviet experts, everything in our construction cause is progressing rapidly. Our priority is to first concentrate our efforts on developing heavy industry, but our heavy industry construction has no foundation. With the help of the Soviet Union, our 141 heavy industrial construction projects are already under development or being established. In a few years, our industrial base will be consolidated. This is the true foundation of our socialist construction. When we anticipate our bright and splendid future, which is the situation that the Soviet Union has already achieved today, who would not rejoice from the bottom of their hearts? Who would not sincerely express tearful gratitude to the Soviet people?

Since the success of the great socialist October Revolution, the help given to us by the Soviet people is truly endless. There is an old Chinese saying that goes, "You could use up all the paper and brushes, and still not finish writing about it." What I have mentioned above is mainly assistance in terms of material strength. In terms of spiritual strength, the greatest gift that the Soviet people have given us is Marxism-Leninism, and the experience of more than 30 years of building socialism under the leadership of the great Lenin and Stalin. We relied on the flexible application of Marxism-Leninism to achieve victory in our people's revolution, and we are learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to embark on the victorious path of our socialist construction. It is the Soviet people who are guiding us, it is the great human teachers Lenin and Stalin who are guiding us, to jointly move towards communism, so that all mankind can achieve true and lasting peace.

Our friendship was forged in hardship and difficulty, and it is developing towards such a bright and upright goal, therefore it is forever unbreakable. It is the bond of common welfare between the two peoples, and the most solid fortress for defending world peace.

This friendship, this friendship that is more precious than our own eyes, has been fixed by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which was personally drafted by Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong. The historical mission and spiritual significance of this treaty are therefore incomparably great and incomparably sublime. The task stipulated by the treaty is to jointly defend peace in the Far East, prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism, and prevent any country from colluding with Japanese imperialism to re-launch aggression. The task stipulated by the treaty also requires the development of economic and cultural relations between the two peoples on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Our treaty is a peace treaty, a constructive treaty, and a truly genuine treaty of friendship and mutual assistance that lives up to its name. For four years, we have faithfully practiced the provisions of the treaty, and have made very significant achievements in both defending peace and developing economic and cultural relations between the two countries. In particular, the Soviet people have exerted more effort than us, and played a greater role than us. The Soviet people's help to us in this regard is also truly great.

However, we can understand. What the great and selfless spirit of the Soviet people hopes of us is that we quickly build up our country and quickly complete the task of socialist construction. Because if China's socialist industrialization is successful, then the peace camp will become even stronger. Not only can peace in the Far East be ensured, but world peace can also be consolidated as a result. This is the goal that the Soviet people with communist moral qualities are trying to achieve. It is precisely because of this that they are great. It is precisely because of this that they are selfless. We can appreciate this noble quality and spirit, and it is a very good model for us. We must continue to learn in order to be able to possess this same quality and spirit.

Therefore, we also embrace this understanding. As long as we can concentrate on learning from the Soviet Union, concentrate on building our country, and gradually realize the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, then we can improve the level of our economic construction and cultural construction, and thus be able to more effectively engage in the cause of defending peace in the Far East and world peace, and promote economic and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and even make this exchange as widespread as possible throughout the world. For us, this is the best practice of the treaty, and at the same time, it is the best way to repay the Soviet people. The teacher hopes that his disciples will learn better, and is happy when his disciples learn well. The Soviet people are our teachers, and we can appreciate the teacher's love and earnest hope for us, wishing they could pass on all their skills to us, wishing we could build our country into the strongest fortress of peace like the Soviet Union as soon as possible. We are determined not to disappoint the teacher's hope, and determined to make the teacher receive more and more joy.

Dear teacher and comrades! Please rest assured! We Chinese literary and art workers, scientific workers, and all social activists can swear on this day commemorating the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: We will learn from you even better, to practice our treaty, to complete and overfulfill our own tasks and common tasks, to commemorate our great teachers Lenin and Stalin!

### 一个宣誓——为纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约签订四周年而作

    一个宣誓
    ——为纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约签订四周年而作
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席
    中苏友好协会总会副会长  郭沫若
    中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。它在事实上比任何兄弟还要亲密。我们中国人民爱护这项高贵的友谊比爱护自己的眼睛珠还要细心。
    这种感情在我们中国人民的心中是有它的深在的泉源的。我们中国人民是在最艰难、最困苦、最受着屈辱的时候，握着了伟大的苏联人民向我们所伸出的温暖的有力的手。这身受者的感激是无法用言语来形容的。
    当我们受着帝国主义集团的横暴的蹂躏，用种种不平等条约捆扎在我们身上，使我们喘不过气来的时候，是苏联政府首先自动地宣布废除帝俄时代和旧中国之间所缔结的不平等条约。
    当我们受到日本帝国主义的大规模的军事侵略，一切的帝国主义国家都在冷眼旁观，并在暗中支持日本帝国主义，如像美国正经常以大量的棉花、废铁、钢材、机器等卖给日本作为侵略战争工具的时候，伟大的苏联人民以无比的精神力量和物质力量支援了我们。而在最后主要是由于苏联的军事力量把日本帝国主义打败了，使它无条件投降了，我们的绵亘了八年的抗日战争才得到了胜利的终结。
    当我们在八年的抗日战争之后又继之四年的国内战争，中国人民打败了美帝国主义所全力支持的蒋介石的反动政府而建立了人民自己的祖国，而在中华人民共和国成立的第二天首先承认了我们的便是苏联。那是一九四九年十月二日，真真是仅次于我们的国庆日，在我们是同样不能忘记的一天。那天是“国际和平斗争日”，也是我们中国人民保卫世界和平委员会正式成立的日子。苏联曾派遣了以法捷耶夫同志为首的文艺工作者代表团来参加了我们的开国典礼，并参加了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的成立大会。这些日子的光景，在我们是永远会和昨天的情况一样的。
    中华人民共和国成立了，我们要恢复战争创伤，我们要发展国民经济，我们要以苏联为榜样把自己的祖国建设成为社会主义的国家，但我们的经验缺乏，近代产业的基础薄弱，尤其是在生产建设上极端需要的科学的基础十分薄弱，我们要完成当前的伟大的光荣的新的历史任务是有很大的困难的。在这时，伟大的苏联人民和苏联政府应我们中国政府的邀请，派遣了不少的优秀的专家来帮助我们，在财经建设方面，在文教建设方面，都把极丰富的智识提供给我们，甚至还照顾到我们的干部同志们的身体健康。这样使我们很快地完成了恢复阶段的任务，而走上了计划建设的阶段。
    今年已经是我们的第一个五年计划的第二年了。我们的建设事业，在苏联政府、苏联人民和苏联专家的伟大无私的帮助之下，一切都在迅速地进展中。我们的重点是要首先集中力量发展重工业，而我们重工业建设是毫无基础的，在苏联的帮助之下，我们的一百四十一项的重工业建设已经在发展中或创建中，在几年之后，我们的工业基础便会巩固起来了。这是我们的社会主义建设的真正基础。我们预想到我们的光辉灿烂的前途，那就是苏联的今天已经达到的景况，谁个不会由衷地欢欣鼓舞？谁个不会由衷地向苏联人民表示热诚的含泪的感谢呢？
    伟大的社会主义十月革命成功以来，苏联人民所给予我们的帮助，那真是说不尽的。中国有句古话，叫作“把所有的纸笔用尽了，都写不完。”我在上面所说到的，主要还是物质力量上的帮助。在精神力量方面，苏联人民所赠给我们的最大的礼品便是马克思列宁主义，便是在伟大的列宁、斯大林领导下的三十多年的建设社会主义的经验。我们是依靠着马克思列宁主义的灵活运用使我们的人民革命胜利了，我们是学习着苏联的先进经验而又使我们的社会主义建设开始走上了胜利的途径。是苏联人民引导着我们，是伟大的人类导师列宁、斯大林引导着我们，共同走向共产主义，而使全人类得到真正的持久和平。
    我们的友谊是在艰难困苦中缔结的，是向着这样光明正大的目标发展的，因而它是永远牢不可破的，它是两国人民共同福利的韧带，是保卫世界和平的最坚固的堡垒。
    这友谊，这比我们自己的眼睛珠还要高贵的友谊，已经由斯大林和毛泽东同志所亲手拟定的中苏友好同盟互助条约所固定下来了。这条约的历史任务和精神意义，因而也就是无比伟大的，无比崇高的。条约所规定的任务是共同保卫远东和平，防止日本帝国主义的再起，防止任何国家勾结日本帝国主义重新进行侵略。条约所规定的任务同时还要在平等互利的基础上发展两国人民之间的经济关系与文化关系。我们的条约是和平条约，是建设性的条约，是真真正正地名实相符的友好互助条约。四年来我们对于条约的规定有了忠实的实践，无论在保卫和平事业上，在发展两国之间的经济关系与文化关系上，都有了非常显著的成就。特别是苏联人民所尽的力量比我们更多，所发挥的作用比我们更大，苏联人民在这方面对我们帮助也是真正伟大的。
    但是，我们是能够了解的。苏联人民伟大无私的精神所希望于我们的就是要我们赶快把国家建设好，赶快把社会主义建设的任务完成。因为中国的社会主义工业化如果成功了，那么和平阵营也就更加壮大了。不仅远东和平可以确保，世界和平也可以因而巩固。这就是具有共产主义道德品质的苏联人民所企图达到的目标。正因为这样，所以成其为伟大。正因为这样，所以成其为无私。这种高贵的品质和精神，我们是能够体会的，这正是我们的很好的模范。我们要不断地学习，以求达到能够具有这同样的品质和精神。
    因此，我们也怀抱着这样的了解。只要我们能够专心地学习苏联，专心地建设我们的国家，逐步实现国家在过渡时期中的总路线和总任务，那就可以提高我们的经济建设和文化建设的水平，因而也就能够更有效地从事于保卫远东和平与世界和平的事业，促进中苏两国人民之间的经济交流与文化交流，更使这交流尽可能地遍及于全世界。这在我们便是对于条约的最好的实践，而同时也就是对于苏联人民的最好的报答。老师是希望自己的弟子学得更好的，是以弟子学得好而为快乐的。苏联人民是我们的老师，我们能够体会到老师对于我们的热爱和殷切的希望，盼不得把自己所有的一切本领都传授给我们，盼不得我们能够早一天把自己的国家建设像苏联一样的最坚强的和平堡垒。我们决心不辜负老师的希望，决心要使老师能够得到更多更多的快乐。
    老师同志！你们请放心吧！我们中国的文艺工作者、科学工作者、一切社会活动工作者，在纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约缔订四周年这一天可以宣誓：我们要以更好地向你们学习，来实践我们的条约，来完成和超额完成我们自己的任务和共同的任务，来纪念我们的伟大导师列宁和斯大林！
