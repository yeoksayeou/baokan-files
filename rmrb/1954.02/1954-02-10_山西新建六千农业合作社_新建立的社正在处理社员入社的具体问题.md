Shanxi Establishes Six Thousand New Agricultural Cooperatives
Newly Established Cooperatives are Addressing Specific Issues Regarding Membership

[This Newspaper reports] By January 30th, Shanxi Province had established 6,657 new agricultural production cooperatives, including 13 vegetable production cooperatives. The number of new cooperatives is 297 percent of the 2,242 old cooperatives in the province. According to estimates by the Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, more than 250,000 peasant households in the province will participate in agricultural production cooperatives in 1954, accounting for more than 8 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. In counties with more developed mutual aid and cooperation movements, such as Pingshun, Wuxiang, and Licheng, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 20 to 40 percent of the total number of peasant households. On average, there are one to three cooperatives per township in the province. In more than 40 counties, every township has agricultural production cooperatives.

The characteristics of the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province during this period are: large scale, steady approach, correct implementation of policies, thorough ideological mobilization, and rapid progress, generally without any deviations. This is primarily because Shanxi Province has systematically publicized the general line of the state's transition period from top to bottom since November of last year. Cadres engaged in rural work and Party members and activists in rural areas first studied the general line of the state's transition period and formed a powerful team to publicize the general line. Through their propaganda, more than 90 percent of the peasants in the province have been educated on the general line, clarifying the boundaries between the two paths of socialism and capitalism, and clearly recognizing that only by taking the socialist road can they forever get rid of poverty and embark on the road of common prosperity, which has greatly promoted the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. In old liberated areas such as Pingshun County, after the propaganda of the general line, more than 20,000 peasant households in the county requested to establish cooperatives, and together with the peasant households that had already joined agricultural production cooperatives, they accounted for more than 42 percent of the total number of peasant households in the county. The members who joined the cooperatives this year include not only a large number of middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, but also many peasant households without labor power and families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres. For example, among the 1,095 members who joined agricultural production cooperatives in Shenchi County, households with more and better means of production accounted for 70 percent, and there were 309 households of military dependents, families of martyrs, and families of cadres.

The work of developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province is closely integrated with the grain purchase work. In implementing the grain purchase work, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party strictly required Party committees at all levels throughout the province to closely integrate the work of developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives with the grain purchase work. Over the past two months, Party committees at all levels, by consistently adhering to this policy, have successfully completed the planning and organization of more than 6,600 newly established agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province, as well as the rectification, consolidation, and expansion of all old cooperatives, while fulfilling and overfulfilling the grain purchase tasks.

Before establishing cooperatives, Shanxi Province systematically and purposefully trained the leading backbone for establishing cooperatives. In late December of last year and the first half of January of this year, all the leading backbone for establishing cooperatives, including the heads and deputy heads of cooperatives, production team leaders, technicians, accountants, and Party branch secretaries of townships and villages where cooperatives were established, participated in centralized training hosted by the prefectural and county Party committees. The content of the training first continued to implement the general line and the resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and on the basis of this ideological education, combined with the experience of establishing cooperatives in various places, the "Cooperative Charter" was studied and discussed, and cooperative heads with rich experience in establishing cooperatives were invited to give typical reports. This enabled everyone to clearly understand the specific policies and methods for establishing cooperatives. In the process of establishing cooperatives, Party secretaries at all levels throughout the province personally led the work of establishing cooperatives. The province, prefectures, and counties, in conjunction with the grain purchase work, sent more than 25,000 cadres to go deep into various townships and villages to mobilize the establishment of cooperatives. The Party branches in the villages also attached great importance to the leadership of this work. Therefore, the shortcomings of relying solely on the "County Party Committee Office" and cooperative establishment cadres to establish cooperatives in some counties in the past were overcome, and it was truly achieved that the whole Party was involved in establishing cooperatives. In the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives on a large scale throughout the province, production was combined to prevent the tendency of setting up large stalls and blind management at the beginning. In general, agricultural production cooperatives mostly adopted the form of hiring or renting the livestock and farm tools of the members; only a few cooperatives adopted the method of valuing and transferring them to the cooperative according to the needs of production and the voluntariness of the members.

At present, the newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province are combining the spring plowing preparation work to systematically handle the specific issues of the members after joining the cooperatives. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed Party committees at all levels to continue to strengthen political and ideological education work, and continue to send strong cadres to the countryside to help Party branches do a good job in the specific organizational work of establishing cooperatives.

### 山西新建六千农业合作社  新建立的社正在处理社员入社的具体问题

    山西新建六千农业合作社
    新建立的社正在处理社员入社的具体问题
    【本报讯】山西省新建立的农业生产合作社，到一月三十日止，已达六千六百五十七个，其中有十三个蔬菜生产合作社。全省有老社二千二百四十二个，新建的社为老社百分之二百九十七。据中共山西省委农村工作部估计：一九五四年全省参加农业生产合作社的农户可发展到二十五万户以上，占全省农户总数的百分之八。互助合作运动较发展的平顺、武乡、黎城等县，参加农业生产合作社的农户占农户总数的百分之二十至四十。全省平均每个乡有社一至三个。有四十多个县，乡乡都有了农业生产合作社。
    山西省在这一段时期中建立农业生产合作社工作的特点是：规模较大，作法稳当，政策执行得正确，思想发动深入，工作进展迅速，一般没有出什么偏差。这首先是因为山西全省从去年十一月份以来，从上而下有系统地宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线。全省从事农村工作的干部和农村中的党员、积极分子，首先学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，组成了宣传总路线的强大队伍。经过他们的宣传，全省百分之九十以上的农民都受到了总路线的教育，划清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的界限，明确认识到只有走社会主义的道路，才能永远摆脱贫困走上大家共同富裕的道路，这就大大地推动了农村互助合作运动的发展。老解放区如平顺县，经过总路线的宣传后，全县有两万多农户要求办社，加上原来已参加农业生产合作社的农户，已达全县总农户百分之四十二以上。今年参加合作社的社员，不仅有大批中农和富裕中农，也有许多无劳力的农户和烈属、军属和干部家属。如神池县参加农业生产合作社的一千零九十五个社员中，生产资料多和好的农户占百分之七十，并有三百零九户军属、烈属和干部家属。
    山西省发展和巩固农业生产合作社的工作是和购粮工作紧紧结合进行的。在贯彻购粮工作时，中共山西省委严格要求全省各级党委，将发展和巩固农业生产合作社的工作和购粮工作紧紧结合进行。两个多月来，各级党委由于始终坚持了这样的方针，在完成和超额完成购粮任务的同时，也胜利地完成了全省六千六百多个新建农业生产合作社的酝酿和组织工作，以及全部旧社的整顿、巩固和扩大工作。
    山西省在办社之前，曾有计划有准备地集中训练了办社的领导骨干。在去年十二月底和今年一月份的上半月，全省所有办社的领导骨干，包括正副社长、生产队长、技术员、会计和建社乡、村的党支部书记，都分别参加了由地委、县委主持的集中训练。训练的内容首先是继续贯彻了总路线和中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议，并在这一思想教育基础上，联系各地办社的经验，对“社章”进行了学习和讨论，还请办社经验丰富的社长作了典型报告。这样使大家明确认识了办社的各项具体政策和方法。在建社过程中，全省各级党委书记亲自领导了建社工作，省、专区和县结合购粮工作，派了二万五千多名干部深入各乡、村发动建社，乡村中党的支部也十分地重视对这一工作的领导，因此，克服了过去某些县专靠“县委办公室”和办社干部办社的缺点，真正做到了全党办社。全省各地在大规模建立农业生产合作社的工作中，都结合了生产，防止了一开始摆大摊子和盲目经营的偏向。一般农业生产合作社，对社员的牲畜和农具大都采取雇用或租用形式；只有少数社根据生产的需要和社员的自愿，采取了作价归社的办法。
    目前，山西省新建的农业生产合作社正在结合春耕准备工作有计划地处理社员入社后的各项具体问题。中共山西省委已指示各级党委继续加强政治思想教育工作，继续派出坚强干部下乡帮助党支部做好办社的具体组织工作。
