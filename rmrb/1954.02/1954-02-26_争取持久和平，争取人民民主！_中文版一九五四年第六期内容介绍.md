An introduction to the content of the Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties’ newspaper, “Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!” Issue 6, 1954.

This issue publishes in full the communiqué on the results of the implementation of the 1953 Soviet Union's national economic development plan and reports on the implementation of the 1953 national economic development plans of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Rapid Economic Development of the Socialist Camp." The editorial points out: The communiqué on the results of the implementation of the 1953 Soviet Union's national economic development plan once again brilliantly demonstrates the prosperity of the Soviet socialist peaceful economy, the strong surge in all sectors of the Soviet economy, and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people; it proves that the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are being successfully implemented, and Soviet society has taken another big step towards the lofty goal of communism. At the same time, the economies of other countries in the socialist camp are also developing steadily. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have completed the restoration of the national economy and started the first Five-Year Plan in 1953. The industrial output of the East European People's Democratic countries at the end of 1953 was twice as high as before the war. The working people of these countries are victoriously implementing the important tasks set by the Communist and Workers' Parties, eliminating or reducing the imbalance in the development of the national economy, and rapidly developing agriculture and industries producing mass consumer goods. The new and great achievements of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries inspire the working people of capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries to fight for a free and happy life.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Continuously Improving the Living Standards of the Hungarian People" by I. Nagy, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, and "The Third Congress of the Communist Party of India" by A. Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India.

Nagy pointed out: The resolutions of the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held in June last year and the government's subsequent policy program announced in July marked a new stage in our country's economic construction. The measures taken by the government in the policy program aimed at improving the living standards of the working people and strengthening the ties between urban and rural areas have consolidated our country's worker-peasant alliance – the unshakable foundation of our system. After the implementation of the policy program began in the second half of 1953, the output of the daily necessities industry and the food industry increased, the retail sales of the socialist commercial network increased, and the social insurance, health care, and living conditions of the working people were further improved. In order to eliminate the disconnect between the growth of industrial production and agricultural production, the government has taken forward-looking measures to stimulate farmers' production.

Nagy continued: This year we are faced with the great creative task of developing our national economy, which is to move forward along the correct path we have taken in the past six months. Our primary task is to further meet the material and cultural needs of the people based on a sober assessment of our country's resources and in accordance with the development level of our national economy and the production capacity of various sectors. Our focus is on people. The task of our economic plan is to have a correct ratio between accumulation and consumption and to ensure that they are mutually adapted. We must solve some special tasks in the mining, steel, and electric power industries so that they can keep up with the pace of our country's industrialization.

Ghosh analyzed the domestic and international environment at the time of the Third Congress of the Communist Party of India, and summarized the proceedings and gains of the Party Congress. Ghosh said: Based on a correct analysis of the current situation, the Party has made the whole Party clearly see its future and laid a solid foundation for formulating detailed strategic routes in all aspects and regions. The Congress took several major measures to improve the work of the Central Committee of the Party as the first step in fundamentally improving the work of the Party and building a mass party. Most importantly, the Congress also made our party realize its responsibilities in the current situation. There is no doubt that the resolutions of the Congress will greatly help the Party to effectively accomplish these tasks. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第六期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第六期已经出版。
    本期全文刊载了关于一九五三年苏联发展国民经济国家计划执行结果的公报，报道了捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和保加利亚一九五三年发展国民经济计划的执行情况。
    本期以“社会主义阵营各国的经济突飞猛进”为题发表社论。社论指出：苏联一九五三年发展国民经济国家计划执行结果的公报，再一次辉煌地证明了苏联社会主义和平经济的繁荣，苏联经济各部门的强大高涨，和苏联人民物质和文化生活水平的不断提高；证明了苏联共产党第十九次代表大会的各项决议正在顺利实现，苏维埃社会又朝着共产主义的崇高目标迈进了一大步。同时，社会主义阵营其他国家的经济也在稳步发展。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下已完成了国民经济的恢复工作，并在一九五三年开始了第一个五年计划。东欧各人民民主国家的工业产量在一九五三年年底已比战前提高了两倍。这些国家的劳动人民正在胜利地执行共产党和工人党所规定的各项重要任务，消灭或减少国民经济发展的不平衡现象，迅速发展农业和生产大众消费品的工业部门。苏联和人民民主国家的新的巨大成就，鼓舞着资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国的劳动人民为争取自由幸福的生活而斗争。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：匈牙利人民共和国部长会议主席伊·纳吉的“不断提高匈牙利人民的生活水平”，印度共产党总书记阿·高士的“印度共产党第三次代表大会”。
    纳吉指出：去年六月间举行的匈牙利劳动人民党中央全体会议的决议和政府随后在七月间宣布的施政纲领，标志了我国经济建设的新阶段。政府在以提高劳动人民生活水平和加强城乡联系为目的的施政纲领中所采取的措施，巩固了我国的工农联盟——我们的制度的不可动摇的基础。一九五三年下半年施政纲领开始实施后，日用品工业和食品工业的产量增加了，社会主义商业网的零售额增加了，劳动人民的社会保险、保健事业以及居住条件得到进一步改善了。为了消除工业生产和农业生产的增长之间的脱节现象，政府采取了目光远大的措施来刺激农民的生产。
    纳吉接着说：今年我们面临着发展我国国民经济的巨大的创造性任务，这就是要沿着过去半年来所走的正确道路前进。我们首要的任务是要在清醒地估计我国资源的基础上，依照我国国民经济的发展程度及各部门的生产能力来进一步满足人民的物质和文化需要。我们的注意中心是人。我们经济计划的任务就是要在积累和消费之间有正确的比例，而且要保证它们相互适应。我们必须在采矿、钢铁和电力工业中解决一些特殊的任务，使它们跟上我国工业化的速度。
    高士分析了印度共产党第三次代表大会召开时的国内外环境，综述了党代表大会进行的情形和收获。高士说：党根据对目前形势的正确分析，使全党清楚地看到了自己的前途，并为在各方面和各地区详细地制订策略路线奠定了坚固的基础。代表大会采取了若干重大措施来改进党中央的工作，作为根本改进党的工作和建立一个群众性政党的第一步。最主要的是，代表大会还使我们党认识到自己在目前局势中的责任。毫无疑问，代表大会的决议对于党有效地去完成这些任务将有很大的帮助。（新华社）
