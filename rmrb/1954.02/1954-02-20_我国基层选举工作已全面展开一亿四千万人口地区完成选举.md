Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Currently, basic-level election work in our country has fully unfolded in the vast majority of provinces and cities. According to materials from the Central Election Committee, as of the end of January this year, 79,304 basic-level units nationwide, encompassing regions with a population of 222,208,000, have completed or are in the process of conducting basic-level elections. Among them, over 50,000 basic-level units, encompassing regions with a population of 140 million, have already completed their elections. The people in these areas have exercised their civic rights and elected their most trusted people's representatives. The regions that completed basic-level elections before the end of January include Jilin, Rehe, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Benxi, Fushun, Harbin, Changchun, Shanghai, Chongqing, Xi'an, Qinghai, and 12 other provinces and cities. Xikang Province, with the exception of Ya'an City, has also completed its elections. Starting in February, a large number of basic-level units across the country have successively launched basic-level election work.

Since the nationwide election movement began in May of last year, all regions have planned this work in an organized manner, mobilizing hundreds of thousands of cadres, conscientiously creating typical experiences, closely integrating with production, and unfolding basic-level elections in batches and steps. Especially after the large-scale publicity of the general line of the state's transition period last winter, the people's awareness has been further enhanced, and they have more enthusiastically participated in the nationwide election movement, creating more favorable conditions for the victorious completion of the election of representatives to people's congresses at all levels in the future. Since January and February of this year, various regions have convened meetings to discuss and deploy election work. Shanxi and Hebei provinces successively held provincial civil affairs conferences, focusing on discussing the important significance of strengthening political power construction during the transition period, and specifically arranged the election work. In order to fully unfold the election work, Anhui Province universally convened county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings in various counties, mobilizing enormous forces to invest in the election movement. The Central-South Region recently convened a special election work conference to inspect and arrange the election work in the entire region. In order to mobilize the people of the city to participate in basic-level elections, Guangzhou held a joint meeting at the end of January, including people's representatives, mass activists, and election cadres from the city and district levels, totaling more than 6,000 people, to conduct in-depth mobilization. After the meeting, these activists and cadres led the people of the city to enthusiastically launch the election movement.

Through the publicity of the general line, the broad masses of the people have further understood the bright future of our country gradually transitioning to a socialist society, and they are happily participating in the election movement. Whether in cities or villages, a solemn and enthusiastic festive scene is presented. Voters unanimously proposed: to elect "leaders on the road to socialism" to lead them to create a better life.

While completing the election work, all regions also conducted the first large-scale population census work in our country's history. After the people understood the great significance of conducting population census work in the period of planned economic construction in our country, they automatically assisted in carrying out the census work to ensure no duplication, no omissions, and comprehensiveness and accuracy. All regions that have completed basic-level elections have also completed the population census work. The survey materials in various districts of Tianjin show that among the more than 2.2 million people, more than 1.1 million are young and middle-aged people; more than 360,000 children were born after liberation, among whom the most were under one year old, totaling more than 86,000; and there are also 106-year-old "centenarians." According to the survey in Rehe Province, the province's population has increased by 4.3% compared with the statistics in 1952. The population increase in industrial cities, as seen from the survey figures of the five industrial cities of Anshan, Fushun, Lushun-Dalian, Changchun, and Harbin, has increased by an average of 18% compared with 1952. All these population growth situations symbolize the increasingly prosperous, flourishing, and thriving scene of our great motherland, and foreshadow that the great socialist construction cause will receive unparalleled abundant strength.

    我国基层选举工作已全面展开一亿四千万人口地区完成选举
     【新华社十九日讯】目前我国基层选举工作已在全国绝大部分省、市范围内全面展开。根据中央选举委员会的材料，到今年一月底的统计，全国已有七万九千三百零四个基层单位，包括二亿二千二百零八万人口的地区完成和正在进行基层选举工作。其中已经完成的有五万多个基层单位，包括一亿四千万人口的地区，这里的人民已经履行了自己的公民权利，选出了他们最信任的人民代表。一月底前已完成基层选举的地区包括吉林、热河、鞍山、旅大、本溪、抚顺、哈尔滨、长春、上海、重庆、西安、青海等十二个省、市。西康省除雅安市以外也全部完成了选举。从二月份开始，全国又有大批基层单位陆续展开基层选举工作。
    我国普选运动从去年五月开始以后，各地都有计划地安排了这一工作，调集数十万干部，认真地创造典型经验，紧密地结合生产有步骤地分批展开基层选举。特别是在去年冬季各地大张旗鼓地宣传国家过渡时期总路线以后，人民觉悟有了进一步提高，更踊跃地参加普选运动，为今后各地胜利完成各级人民代表大会代表的选举，创造了更加有利的条件。从今年一、二月份以来，各地又纷纷召开会议，讨论和部署普选工作。山西和河北两省先后召开了全省民政会议，着重讨论在过渡时期加强政权建设的重要意义，同时具体安排了普选工作。安徽省为了全面展开普选工作，各县普遍召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议，动员巨大的力量投入普选运动。中南区最近专门召开了普选工作会议，检查和布置了全区的普选工作。广州市为动员全市人民参加基层选举，在一月底召开了一次包括市、区两级人民代表、群众积极分子和普选干部等六千多人的联席会议，进行深入动员，会后便由这些积极分子和干部带领全市人民热烈展开了普选运动。
    广大人民经过总路线的宣传，进一步了解了我们国家正在逐步过渡到社会主义社会的光明前途，他们兴高采烈地参加普选运动。无论在城市或乡村，都呈现出庄严热烈的节日景象。选民们一致提出：要选出“社会主义的带路人”，带领他们创造更加美好的生活。
    各地在完成普选工作的同时，还进行了我国有史以来第一次规模巨大的人口调查工作。当人民了解了我国进入有计划经济建设时期进行人口调查工作的重大意义以后，他们都自动协助进行调查工作，以做到不重复、不遗漏和全面、确实。凡已经完成基层选举的地区，都同时完成了人口调查工作。天津市在市内各区的调查材料说明：在二百二十多万人口中，有一百一十多万是青壮年人口；解放后出生的儿童有三十六万多人，其中不满一岁的最多，共八万六千多人；还有一百零六岁的“长命百岁”的老人。据热河省调查，全省人口比一九五二年的统计增加了百分之四点三。工业城市人口增加的情况，从鞍山、抚顺、旅大、长春、哈尔滨五个工业城市的调查数字来看，和一九五二年相比，人口平均增加了百分之十八。所有这些人口增长的情形，都象征着我们伟大祖国日益强盛、繁荣和兴旺的景象，预示着伟大的社会主义建设事业将得到无比充沛的力量。
