　　National Coal Mines Expand Capital Construction
　　This Year's Construction Workload Increases by More Than One-Quarter Compared to Last Year
　　[Report from this newspaper] The scale of capital construction in national coal mines this year is even greater than in 1953.

　　With the gradual development of the national construction and the rapid increase of the urban population, the demand for coal will increase year by year. According to preliminary calculations by the Central Fuel Industry Department, by 1957, the national coal demand will increase by more than 80% compared to 1953. The supply of this coal, in addition to fully utilizing the potential of existing production mines to bear a portion, must be borne by newly built mines with a supply of tens of millions of tons. Therefore, this year, the state's investment in coal mine capital construction has increased by 21% compared to 1953; the capital construction workload has increased even more, by 27% compared to last year.

　　This year, the scale of newly built, rebuilt, continued, and restored mines nationwide is larger than in 1953. Calculated according to design capacity, the coal produced in the future will reach more than 80% of the output of state-owned mines this year. Among them, the design capacity of newly built and continued mines accounts for about 60% of the total design capacity. In order to cooperate with the establishment of new industrial bases and the expansion of existing industrial bases, the proportion of newly built mines in Central South and Northwest regions has also increased.

　　This year, national coal mines will not only concentrate their efforts to ensure that the five newly built vertical shafts, four inclined shafts, and one restored shaft will participate in production on time, but also ensure that more new shafts will participate in production in 1955, and prepare for the construction of new shafts in the future. The vast majority of the above nine new shafts and one restored shaft produce coking coal or general industrial coal, and will also produce a small portion of civilian anthracite. The completion and participation in production of these ten pairs of shafts will provide a strong guarantee for the needs of industry, transportation, and handicraft workshops, and will appropriately take care of civilian use. The scale of the five pairs of vertical shaft projects planned to be completed this year is very large. For example, the design capacity of the new Cai Tun shaft in Benxi is even greater than the total output of all production shafts in Benxi this year. Two of them are key projects with huge scale aided by the Soviet Union.

### 全国煤矿扩大基本建设  今年建设工作量比去年增加四分之一以上

    全国煤矿扩大基本建设
    今年建设工作量比去年增加四分之一以上
    【本报讯】全国煤矿今年基本建设的规模比一九五三年更加巨大。
    随着国家建设事业的逐步开展和城市人口的迅速增加，煤的需要量将逐年增加了。据中央燃料工业部初步计算，到一九五七年全国需煤量将比一九五三年增加百分之八十以上。这些煤的供应，除了充分发挥现有生产矿井的潜在能力来担负一部分外，必须由新建矿井担负几千万吨的供应数量。因此今年国家对煤矿基本建设的投资比一九五三年又增加了百分之二十一；基本建设工作量增加更多，比去年增加百分之二十七。
    今年全国新建、改建、续建和恢复的矿井比一九五三年的规模更大，按照设计能力计算，将来生产的煤达今年国营各矿产量的百分之八十以上，其中新建、续建矿井的设计能力达全部设计能力的百分之六十左右。为了配合新的工业基地的建立和原有工业基地的扩大，中南、西北等地区新建的矿井比重也增加。
    今年全国煤矿不仅将集中力量保证新建的五对立井、四对斜井与一对恢复井按时参加生产，还将保证一九五五年有更多的新井参加生产，并为今后新井建设做好各项准备工作。上述九对新井和一对恢复井绝大部分是生产炼焦煤或一般工业用煤的，同时也将生产一小部分民用无烟煤。这十对井完工后参加生产，对工业、交通运输业和手工业作坊发展的需要，将提出有力的保证，并可适当地照顾民用。计划在今年建设完成的五对立井工程规模都很大，例如本溪彩屯新井设计能力，就比本溪所有生产井口今年生产量的总和还要大。其中两对是苏联帮助我们建设的规模巨大的重点工程。
