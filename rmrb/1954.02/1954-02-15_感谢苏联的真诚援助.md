    Gratitude for the Sincere Assistance of the Soviet Union
    Zhong Zhenqing, Model Worker of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel
    Anshan Iron and Steel—China's first giant integrated iron and steel enterprise—is rapidly growing. The three newly built projects of Anshan Iron and Steel—the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the Large Rolling Mill, and the No. 7 Blast Furnace—have been completed and put into production successively in the first year of China's First Five-Year Plan. This marks a major victory in the process of China's socialist industrialization. This great achievement has been achieved entirely with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union! As the people of the whole country warmly celebrate the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we deeply thank the Soviet Union for its sincere assistance to our country!
    The three projects of Anshan Iron and Steel are part of the 141 projects that the Soviet Union is helping China to build and renovate. The people of our country are clearly aware of the importance of building Anshan Iron and Steel. In order to accelerate the socialist industrialization of the motherland and develop heavy industry first, we must build Anshan Iron and Steel into a base for the industrialization of the motherland. This task is arduous, but also very glorious. In the construction of the three projects, we encountered serious technical difficulties. For example, at the beginning, we not only did not understand the technology, but we did not even know how to prepare for the work. However, we were not defeated by the difficulties, because we had the assistance of such a great friendly helper as the Soviet Union. With the comprehensive, selfless, and systematic economic and technical assistance provided by the Soviet Union, the three projects of Anshan Iron and Steel were finally completed ahead of schedule. This is the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship.
    The sincere assistance of the Soviet Union is an important guarantee for us to accelerate the realization of the country's socialist industrialization. This is what we have particularly deeply realized in participating in the construction of the three projects. Before the construction, I participated in a technical training class personally instructed by Soviet experts. The experts explained everything from the design of each machine, the structure of the machine, its performance, and the installation process, all the way to what problems might occur during future use and how to repair them. Soviet experts wished they could teach us all their science and technology at once. This made us more deeply appreciate the great political significance of "taking the path of the Russians" and "learning from the Soviet Union" as consistently taught by Chairman Mao. Therefore, during the construction, I led my team to implement 100% of every suggestion made by Soviet experts, thus ensuring that the entire team's installation work—from cleaning, installation to trial operation—never had any accidents, all achieved the required excellent quality, and completed the installation plan ahead of schedule. In order to cultivate our ability to work independently, Soviet experts also taught us how to operate, hand in hand, like a mother teaching her child to walk. In the construction of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, Wang Xibo, the "Chinese Tilting Machine Installation Expert," emerged. All of the plant's more than 20 tilting machines and feeders were successfully installed under the guidance of this "Chinese Tilting Machine Installation Expert." Our country's technical strength has also grown and strengthened under the cultivation of experts like this.
    We not only thank the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people for their great and selfless assistance to our country's construction cause, and thank the Soviet experts for their outstanding contributions to the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, but also the experts' serious and rigorous work style will always be a model for us to learn from. I remember that last January, when the intensive installation work of the main electrical room equipment of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant began, unfortunately, the electrical installation expert fell ill at this time. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the project, the expert initially insisted on not resting, working as usual every day. Later, when he could no longer hold on, he went to Shenyang for recuperation. During the treatment, the expert did not forget the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel. When the translator went to see him, he could no longer write with a pen. So he dictated the things that needed attention for installing the main electrical room distribution panel and regulator, and had the translator write them down and send them to the construction site. Before the expert had fully recovered from his illness, he requested to be discharged from the hospital. On the day he returned to Anshan, he went straight to the construction site after getting off the train to check the installation situation of the past few days and guide us in carrying out more arduous and complex projects. In order to help us complete the task on schedule, Soviet experts sometimes worked continuously for eighteen hours, and even did not rest on holidays. The driving force of this work is precisely the internationalist spirit indicated by the great Comrade Stalin for "helping each other and seeking common economic upsurge."
    Following the path of the Soviet Union's successful socialist construction, the people of our country, under the leadership of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party, are doing everything possible to develop socialist industry. The number of new factories and new mines is increasing, and new hydroelectric power stations, cities, and railways are being built. These constructions will make our country's appearance more beautiful and gradually improve the material welfare of our working people. We are not satisfied with our existing learning achievements. We deeply know that every achievement in our construction cause will strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The achievements of the Soviet people in building communism constantly encourage us to move forward. We will follow the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong and, in the long-term construction in the future, we will work even harder to learn from the advanced experience and latest technology of the Soviet Union, and strive to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of our country, and to further strengthen the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    May our friendship be increasingly consolidated and developed!

    感谢苏联的真诚援助
    建设鞍钢无缝钢管厂劳动模范　锺振庆
    鞍钢——我国第一个巨大的黑色冶金联合企业，正在迅速地成长起来。鞍钢新建的三项工程——无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉，在我国实行第一个五年计划的第一年，已先后竣工投入了生产。这标志着我国社会主义工业化建设进程中的重大胜利。这一巨大成就完全是在伟大的苏联大公无私的援助下取得的。当全国人民热烈庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订四周年的时候，我们深深感谢苏联对我国的真诚援助！
    鞍钢三项工程是苏联帮助我国新建和改建的一百四十一项工程中的一部分。我国人民都清楚地知道建设鞍钢的重要意义。为了加速祖国社会主义工业化、首先发展重工业，我们要把鞍钢建设成为祖国工业化的基地。这个任务是艰巨的，也是很光荣的。在建设三项工程中，我们曾碰到了技术上的严重困难。譬如开始时，我们不但不懂得技术，连如何进行准备工作都不会。但是，我们没有被困难所击退，因为我们有了苏联这样一个伟大友帮的援助。在苏联给予我们全面的、无私的、系统的经济上和技术上的援助之下，鞍钢三项工程终于胜利地提前完成了。这是中苏友谊的结晶。
    苏联的真诚援助，是我们加速实现国家社会主义工业化的重要保证。这是在我们参加三项工程的建设中所特别深刻地体会到的。我在施工前曾参加了苏联专家亲自指导的技术训练班学习，专家从每一台机器的设计、机器的构造、性能和安装的过程，一直讲到将来使用时可能发生什么故障和怎样检修。苏联专家恨不得一下子把他们的科学技术全部教给我们。这使我们更加深切地体会到毛主席所一贯教导我们的“走俄国人的路”、“向苏联学习”的重大的政治意义。因此，在施工中，我领导我的小组百分之百地贯彻了苏联专家的每一项建议，因而保证了全组的安装工程——从清洗、安装到试运转，从未发生过事故，都达到了所要求的优等质量，提前完成了安装计划。苏联专家为了培养我们独立工作的能力，还像母亲教孩子走路一样，手把手地教我们操作。在无缝钢管厂的建设中，就出现了“中国的翻料机安装专家”王锡波。全厂的二十多台翻料机、给料机都是在这位“中国的翻料机安装专家”的指导下安装成功的。我国的技术力量也就是在专家这样的培养下成长壮大起来了。
    我们不但感谢苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民对我国建设事业伟大的、无私的援助，感谢苏联专家帮助鞍钢建设事业的卓越贡献，而且专家们的认真严肃的工作作风，也永远是我们学习的典范。记得去年一月，无缝钢管厂开始主电室设备的紧张的安装工程时，不幸电气安装专家正在这时生病了。为了保证工程顺利进行，这位专家起先坚持不肯休息，每天照常工作，后来实在坚持不下去了，才到沈阳疗养。在治疗中，这位专家还不忘鞍钢的建设。当翻译去看他时，他已不能拿笔写字了。于是他就把安装主电室配电盘、调整器需要注意的事项，都口述出来让翻译记下，送到工地去。专家的病还没完全好，就要求出了院；回到鞍山那天，下了火车就赶到了工地，检查我们几天来的安装情况，指导我们进行更艰巨更复杂的工程。为了帮助我们按期完成任务，苏联专家有时连续地工作十八个小时，甚至连假日都不休息。这种工作的动力，正是伟大的斯大林同志所指示的为了“互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨”的国际主义精神。
    沿着苏联建设社会主义成功的道路，我国人民在久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，正在尽一切力量发展社会主义工业，新工厂、新矿井的数目在增加，新的水电站、城市和铁路正在建设起来，这些建设将使我们国家的面貌变得更加美丽，并使我国劳动人民的物质福利逐步提高。我们并不满足于已有的学习成绩，我们深知，我们建设事业的每一成就，都将增强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。苏联人民建设共产主义的成就，时时鼓舞我们前进。我们遵照毛泽东主席的教导，在今后的长期建设中，还要更加倍地努力学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术，为逐步实现我国的社会主义工业化，为更加壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量而奋斗。
    愿我们的友谊日益巩固与发展！
