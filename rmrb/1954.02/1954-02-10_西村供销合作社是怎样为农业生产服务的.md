    How Xicun Supply and Marketing Cooperative Serves Agricultural Production
    Wang Hanxing
    When cooperative members in several townships near Xicun, Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, mention the production department of the Xicun Supply and Marketing Cooperative, they all say: The cooperative has done so many good things for us, and the supply of farm tools is the most important.
    Before the establishment of the farm tool production department, there were only four private blacksmith shops in Xicun Street, Yichun County, producing farm tools, which were not only in short supply but also very expensive. Farmers often said: Blacksmith shops work with gold and silver, they are terribly expensive. Especially during the busy farming season, blacksmith shops cut corners and made flimsy farm tools, but the masses had to buy them for production.
    After the establishment of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative's farm tool production department, this situation gradually changed. Over the past few years, it has supplied a large number of high-quality, low-priced ironware and farm tools. 社員from nearby five or six townships come to buy goods and place orders.
    With the development of production, the original three furnaces in the production department could no longer meet the needs of the peasant members. In July last year, another furnace and two workers were added. In order not to delay the farmers' production and to meet the needs of the members as much as possible, the production department decided to make farm tools first and then furniture; and a furnace was selected to carry burdens to the remote villages in turn to start work, to meet the needs of the members of the peripheral villages. However, after the burdens were sent to the countryside, they were often held back by the members of one village and not allowed to leave, while other villages came to urge them. The farm tool production department came up with a solution: before going to a village, they would agree with the township government on the date and the required quantity, and produce according to the agreed time, accelerating the speed of rotation and meeting the requirements of each village.
    According to the habits of farmers in Xicun, Yichun County, farm tools are added according to the seasons. Therefore, the production department is always too busy every year in the third and fourth months and the seventh and eighth months of the lunar calendar, but very idle in the fifth and sixth months. In order to overcome the abnormal phenomenon of slack and peak season production, the cooperative advanced a sum of money to enable the production department to start work as usual during the slack farming season and store farm tools. This not only solved the difficulty of supply falling short of demand during the peak season, but also changed the phenomenon of having nothing to do and low income during the slack months. Previously, a furnace could only make three large round hoes a day. After the workers' research and improvement, it can now make seven large round hoes a day, and the net profit rate of products has been reduced from two percent to one percent.
    The more important reason why the Xicun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yichun County can be run well is that it has fully promoted democracy. Every time the cooperative holds a cadre meeting or studies work, it absorbs workers from the production department to participate and listen to their opinions. For example, before the furnaces went to the countryside, some workers were afraid of hardship and unwilling to go. The leading cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative convened a meeting of workers and talked about the relationship between the cooperative and agricultural production and the members' love for the cooperative. After the workers' discussion, they realized: The peasants love the cooperative so much, if we don't go to the countryside, what are we talking about serving the members! In addition to strengthening ideological leadership over the workers, the leading cadres of the cooperative can also help solve their life problems in a timely manner, which has inspired the workers' enthusiasm for production.
    The Xicun Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yichun County was rated as a model supply and marketing cooperative in Yichun County in 1953 and won the county's mobile red flag.

    西村供销合作社是怎样为农业生产服务的
    王汉兴
    江西省宜春县西村附近几个乡的合作社社员，一提起西村供销社的生产部时，都说：合作社替我们办的好事真不少，供应农具要算是头一桩。
    在农具生产部没有成立的时候，宜春县西村街上只有四家私营铁匠铺生产农具，不仅供不应求，而且价钱很贵。农民常说：铁匠铺里打金打银，贵得厉害。尤其是到了农忙时节，铁匠铺偷工减料，制造些不结实的农具，群众为了生产，也只好购买。
    供销合作社农具生产部成立后，逐渐转变了这种情况。几年来，供应了很多质量好、价钱低的铁器和农具。附近五、六个乡的社员都来买货和订货。
    随着生产的发展，生产部原来的三个炉子已经不能满足农民社员的需要，去年七月又增加了一个炉子和两名工人。为了不误农民的生产和尽可能的满足社员的需要，生产部决定先打农具后打家具；并且抽出一个炉子挑着担子到远乡轮流开工，供应边沿乡的社员的需要。但是，担子下乡以后往往被一个乡的社员拖住不让走，别的乡又来催。农具生产部想出了一个办法：凡是要到那个乡，事先和乡政府约定好日期和需要的数量，依照约定的时间进行生产，加速了轮回的速度，满足了各村的要求。
    根据宜春县西村一带农民的习惯，添制农具都按节气。因此，每年到农历三、四月和七、八月的时候生产部总是忙不过来，等到五、六月的时候却很清闲。为了克服淡、旺季生产的不正常现象，合作社垫出一笔资金，使生产部在农闲的时候照样开工，储备农具。这样不但解决了旺季中供不应求的困难，而且改变了淡月中没事做和收入少的现象。以前，一个炉子一天只能打三把大圆锄，经过工人研究改进后，一天能打七把大圆锄，产品纯利率由百分之二降低到百分之一。
    宜春县西村供销合作社能够办得好的更重要的原因是充分的发扬了民主。每次合作社召开干部会议或研究工作的时候，都吸收生产部的工人来参加，听取他们的意见。如在炉子下乡前，有个别工人怕吃苦不愿意去，供销合作社的领导干部就召集工人开会，讲了合作社和农业生产的关系、社员热爱合作社的情形。经过工人们的讨论以后，他们认识到：农民这样热爱合作社，我们再不下乡，还说什么为社员服务呢！合作社的领导干部，除了加强对工人的思想领导以外，并能及时帮助解决生活问题，鼓舞了工人们的生产热情。
    宜春县西村供销合作社在一九五三年被评为宜春县的模范供销合作社，并夺得了全县的流动红旗。
