Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 13th: According to TASS, Moscow, February 12th, Moscow newspapers published commentaries on the Four Foreign Ministers Conference's discussion of the second item on the agenda.

    "Pravda" published an editorial titled "For Consolidating Peace and Security in Europe," stating that the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference has now been discussing the tasks of the German question and ensuring European security for two weeks. During the discussions, the Soviet delegation put forward extensive and concrete proposals for resolving the German question and ensuring European security. These proposals were all permeated with a desire to help the German people reunify Germany into a democratic, peace-loving, and independent country based on the principles of the Potsdam Agreement.

    "Pravda" emphasized that the tasks of resolving the German question and ensuring European security are inseparable. Therefore, the attention of the world public is now naturally focused on the Soviet Union's proposal of February 10th to establish European collective security. The Soviet government's proposal on ensuring European security proceeds from the actual situation, which has arisen due to the Western countries' unwillingness to resolve the German question and eliminate the division of Germany.

    The broad masses of people in European countries recognize that this proposal points to a reliable shortcut to consolidating peace in Europe and the world, and cooperation in Europe and the world. At the same time, every European sees that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France have rejected the Soviet proposal one after another, and they themselves have not put forward any proposals. In addition, it can be seen during the conference that American diplomats are concentrating all their efforts on trying to prolong the reunification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    "Pravda" pointed out that in recent days, in the face of the Soviet proposal, which is welcomed by all peace-loving people, the representatives of Western countries have had to try their best to end the discussion of the German question. This proves that they are unwilling to solve the most important international issues. News from American and Western European newspapers shows that the American delegation did not intend to seriously resolve outstanding issues when attending the Berlin Conference. The attitude of US Secretary of State Dulles confirmed the news from these newspapers.

    Some Americans originally thought that they could use the Berlin Conference to accelerate the realization of their "European Army" plan, but their wishful thinking did not materialize. The people of European countries are more clearly aware than ever that the American-style "Little Europe" will only be a breeding ground for new conflicts and a factor in exacerbating international tensions.

    "Pravda" concluded by saying that the Soviet people warmly support and support their government's proposals on resolving the German question and ensuring European security. These proposals have also received the support of the broad public in countries around the world.

    "Izvestia," in an editorial entitled "Striving for the Establishment of a Unified, Peace-Loving Germany, Striving for European Peace," pointed out that the Soviet draft "All-European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe" was welcomed by Germany and millions of people outside Germany. They regard this as the Soviet Union's tireless concern for the future of peace in Europe and the world and an effort to strengthen international cooperation.

    "Izvestia" said that, as Molotov pointed out, Western countries describe the establishment of the "European Defense Community" as a guarantee of Soviet security, and call on German militarists to play the role of security guarantors, while the revival of German militarism is the main threat to European security.

    "Izvestia" finally pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system has been particularly warmly welcomed by the people of countries on the European continent, because this system will certainly be able to create the conditions necessary to prevent Europe from becoming a battlefield for devastating wars again.

    "Labor News" special correspondent in Berlin, Monin, also expressed similar opinions. Monin said that the Soviet proposal to ensure European security has attracted the attention of the German working people. On the afternoon of February 10th, mass rallies were held in major enterprises in the democratic districts of Berlin. At the meeting, the workers expressed full support for the Soviet delegation's proposal on ensuring European security. The resolutions passed by the workers pointed out that the new Soviet proposal is the most effective way to quickly resolve the German question and ensure European peace.

    苏联真理报等就四国外长会议发表评论
    指出苏联的建议成为世界人民注意中心
    西方国家代表们企图长期阻挠德国的重新统一
   【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：莫斯科各报就四国外长会议关于第二项议程的讨论发表评论。
    “真理报”以“为了巩固欧洲的和平与安全”为题发表社论说，到现在为止，柏林四国外长会议讨论德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务已经有两个星期了。在讨论过程中，苏联代表团提出了解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的广泛而具体的建议。这些建议都贯串着一个愿望：根据波茨坦协定的原则来帮助德国人民把德国重新统一成为一个民主的、爱好和平的、独立的国家。
    “真理报”着重指出，解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务是不可分割的。因此，现在，世界公众的注意力自然都集中在苏联二月十日所提出的建立欧洲集体安全的建议上。苏联政府提出关于保障欧洲安全的建议，是从实际形势出发的，这种形势是由于西方国家不愿意解决德国问题、不愿意消除德国分裂状态而产生的。
    欧洲各国广大人民都认识到，这个建议指出了一条通向巩固欧洲和全世界和平和欧洲及全世界合作的可靠的捷径。同时每一个欧洲人都看到，美国、英国和法国的外长们一个接一个地拒绝了苏联的建议，而他们自己又提不出任何建议。此外，在会议过程中可以看出，美国外交官集中一切力量企图长期拖延德国的重新统一和对德和约的缔结。
    “真理报”指出：在最近几天中，西方国家的代表们在一切爱好和平的人民都欢迎的苏联建议面前，只好竭力设法终止德国问题的讨论。这证明他们不愿意解决最重要的国际问题，从美国和西欧报纸的消息可以知道，美国代表团出席柏林会议时，并不想认真解决悬而未决的问题。美国国务卿杜勒斯的态度证实了这些报纸的消息。
    某些美国人士原来以为他们可以利用柏林会议来加速实现他们的“欧洲军”计划，但是，他们的如意算盘没有实现。欧洲各国人民比以往更清楚地认识到，美式“小欧洲”只会是新冲突的温床和加剧国际紧张局势的因素。
      “真理报”最后说，苏联人民热烈拥护和支持他们的政府关于解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的建议。这些建议也得到了世界各国广大公众的支持。
      “消息报”在题为“争取建立一个统一的、爱好和平的德国，争取欧洲和平”的社论中指出，德国和德国以外的千百万人民欢迎苏联关于
  “保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案。他们认为这是苏联对欧洲和全世界和平的前途的不倦关怀和加强国际合作的一种努力。
    “消息报”说，正如莫洛托夫指出的，西方国家把建立“欧洲防务集团”说成是对苏联安全的保障，叫德国军国主义者来扮演安全保障者的角色，而德国军国主义的复活却是对欧洲安全的主要威胁。
    “消息报”最后指出，苏联关于建立一个欧洲集体安全体系的建议受到了欧洲大陆各国人民的特别热烈的欢迎，因为这个体系一定能够创造防止欧洲再度成为毁灭性战争的战场所必需的条件。
    “劳动报”驻柏林特派记者莫宁也表示了类似的意见。莫宁说，苏联的保障欧洲安全的建议引起了德国劳动人民的注意。在二月十日下午，柏林民主区各大企业都举行了群众大会。工人们在会上表示充分支持苏联代表团关于保障欧洲安全的建议。工人们通过的决议指出，苏联的新建议是最快地解决德国问题和保障欧洲和平的有效办法。
