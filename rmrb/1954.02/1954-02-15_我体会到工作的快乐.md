    I Experience the Joy of Work
    Xie Chengren

    I started teaching in 1949.

    Looking back to when I first arrived at Beijing No. 1 Middle School four years ago, I didn't even know how to write a lesson plan, let alone what teaching methods or principles were. However, I was not discouraged, because I knew that difficulties can be overcome; only by overcoming difficulties can one taste the joy of work. Therefore, I worked hard to learn teaching experience from veteran teachers to enrich myself. Slowly, I figured out some of the tricks from the work, and transformed from a novice into a skilled hand. I understood that education is an important part of national construction, and established a professional ideology.

    In order to teach well, I put in a lot of effort. For example, during the summer vacation the year before last, there was a question I didn't understand about modern history, so I went to the Beijing Library thirteen times, read more than forty kinds of reference books, and wrote more than 30,000 words of notes. One day, when I was going home, it rained heavily, and there were no cars on the road, so I walked barefoot in the rain. I kept the copied notes close to my chest, pressing them tightly with my hand, fearing they would get wet in the rain. I knew that teaching materials were very important, and only by being familiar with the teaching materials could I determine the teaching objectives, find the key points, and write good lesson plans.

    I have never dared to be sloppy when writing lesson plans. After writing them, I always modified them again and again; before lecturing, I previewed them again to see if there were any inappropriate places. One reaps what one sows. Every semester I was able to complete my plans with ease.

    I teach history. This is a science full of ideology. When lecturing, I paid special attention to the characteristics of this subject. Even when giving an example, I considered it again and again. Usually, I not only teach students some historical knowledge, but I also pay attention to improving their enthusiasm for learning and cultivating their ability to observe and analyze problems. For example, once I asked a student: "What kind of regime was the Paris Commune?" He replied, "It was a proletarian dictatorship." Then I asked another student to stand up and supplement his answer. He said, "His answer is not complete. It should be said that it was the world's first proletarian dictatorship." As soon as he finished speaking, another student stood up to correct him, saying, "I agree with his supplement, but he also said something wrong. It should be said that it destroyed the old state apparatus, because the Paris Commune did not eliminate the state." When I saw the students gaining new knowledge from their studies, I felt extremely happy!

    In order to enable the students to acquire richer knowledge, I often introduced them to various books, helped them set up a history research group, and often invited comrades from outside the school to give them reports. On various anniversaries, I also helped them produce wall newspapers or hold exhibitions. The school lacked wall charts, so I used the holidays to lead the students to draw more than thirty charts of various sizes for the school.

    I love my students and I like to be with them often. I treat them like my own younger brothers, always caring for them and taking full responsibility for them. When it's cold and some students don't have clothes to wear, I take off my own woolen sweater and give it to them; when students are sick, I take care of them in every possible way and let them eat my own milk. On Sundays, I go to the Temple of Heaven and Beihai Park with my students. During the winter vacation, some students couldn't go home because of the distance, so I invited them to spend the New Year with me. Sitting around the stove, I told them the historical story of the people of Jiangyin defending the city, and told them about the spring in the south of our motherland, and the scenery of the Three Gorges... There was no separation between us, everyone laughed and played to their heart's content, with only one common feeling: our motherland is so great! It is so wonderful to be born in such a great country and a great era!

    I am strict with my students and never let them off lightly for any mistakes. When students make mistakes, I don't easily scold them in front of everyone with a stern face; I call them to my room, explain the reasons to them, and let them recognize and admit their mistakes. I also often encourage students to learn from those who are good at their studies and have a good style.

    The students are also willing to get close to me and regard me as their closest brother. They often talk to me about their aspirations, their families... I will never forget the students' concern for me. Once, I suddenly felt a stomach ache like a knife was twisting inside while I was lecturing. When the students saw that my face looked bad, knowing that I was sick, they quickly handed me a note advising me to rest. As soon as class was over, a student brought me a cup of boiling water and a package of medicine, handed them to me and said, "Teacher, please take some medicine. We got it from the school clinic." After I was admitted to the hospital, students came to see me every day. One day, I opened my eyes dimly and saw a student standing in front of me.

    Chekhov said: "How wonderful life would be if each person did all he could on his own piece of land!" For the great motherland, for the cause of socialist construction, I am willing to keep the glorious title of "People's Teacher" for life and dedicate everything I have to it!

    我体会到工作的快乐
  　谢承仁
    我开始教书是在一九四九年。
    回想四年多前我刚到北京第一中学时，连教案也不会写，更不知什么教学法、教学原则。但是，我并不灰心，我知道，困难是可以克服的；只有克服了困难，才会尝到工作的快乐。因此，我努力向老教师学习教学经验，来充实自己。慢慢地我从工作中摸到了一点门路，从一个生手变成一个熟手。我明白了教育事业是国家建设的重要部分，树立了专业思想。
    为了把书教好，我曾下过很大的功夫。例如，前年暑期，在近代史方面有个问题不明白，我前后到北京图书馆去了十三次，看了四十多种参考书，写了三万多字的笔记。有一天回家的时候，因天下大雨，路上没有车，我打着赤脚，冒着雨走。我把抄好的笔记贴身放在胸前，用手紧紧扪住，生怕被雨淋湿了。我知道教材非常重要，只有熟悉了教材，才能确定教学目的，找出重点，写好教案。
    从来，我对写教案不敢有一点马虎，写好以后，总是一遍又一遍地加以修改；讲课前再预习一遍，看看还有哪些地方不妥。有一分耕耘，就会有一分收获。每一学期我都能从容按照计划完成。
    我担任的是历史课。这是一门富于思想性的科学。我在讲课时，特别注意这门课的特点，那怕是举一个例子，都要经过再三考虑。平常我不仅给学生讲授一些历史知识，我还时刻注意提高同学们的学习积极性，培养他们观察问题和分析问题的能力。例如，有一次我问一个同学：“巴黎公社是一个什么性质的政权？”他回答道：“是无产阶级专政的政权。”接着我叫另一个同学站起来补充，他说：“他答的不完全。应该说是世界第一次无产阶级专政的政权。”刚说完，紧接着另一个同学站起来纠正说：“他的补充我同意，不过他也有一点地方说错了。应该说摧毁了旧的国家机器，因为巴黎公社并没有消灭国家。”当我看到同学们从学习中获得了新的知识时，我感到极大的快乐！
    为了使同学们获得更丰富的知识，我经常给他们介绍各种书籍，帮助他们成立了历史研究小组，常常请校外的同志来给他们作报告。每逢各种纪念日，我又帮助他们出壁报，或者举办展览会。学校里缺乏挂图，我便利用假期领导同学给学校绘制了三十多幅大大小小的图表。
    我喜爱自己的学生，我愿意常和他们在一块。我把他们当作自己的弟弟一样看待，时刻关心他们，对他们全面负责。天冷了，有同学没有衣服穿，我把自己的绒衣脱下来给他；有同学病了，我多方照顾他们，把自己的牛奶让给他吃。星期天，我和同学一起去游天坛、北海。寒假中，有的同学因为路远不能回家，我便请他们和我一块过新年。围着火炉，给他们讲江阴人民守城的历史故事，给他们讲祖国江南的春天，三峡的风景……彼此之间没有一点隔阂，大家尽情地笑着、玩着，只有一个共同的感觉：祖国太伟大了！生长在这样一个伟大的国家、伟大的时代，我们真是太幸福了！
    我对同学们的要求是严格的，从来不放松他们一点过错。同学犯了错误，我不轻易在大家面前正颜厉色去责备他们；我把他叫到寝室里，给他解释，让他认识错误，承认错误。我并经常鼓励同学向功课好、作风好的同学学习。
    同学们也都愿意和我接近，把我当作他们最亲密的兄长。他们常和我谈自己的志愿，谈他们的家庭，……我永远忘不了同学们对我的关心。有一次，我在讲课时忽然觉得肚子痛，像刀绞一般。同学们看见我脸色不好，知道我病了，连忙递上一张纸条劝我休息。一下课，一个同学端着一杯开水，拿着一包药，送到我手边，说：“老师，您吃点药。这是我们到校医室领的。”进了医院，每天都有同学来看我。有一天，我朦胧地睁开眼，只见一个学生站在我面前。
    契诃夫说过：“假使人能够在每人自己的土地上做了他能做的一切，这个人生会多么美妙呀！”为了伟大的祖国，为了社会主义建设事业，我愿意终身保持“人民教师”这个光荣称号，为它献出我的一切！
