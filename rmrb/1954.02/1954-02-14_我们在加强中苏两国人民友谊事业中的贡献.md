    Our Contribution to Strengthening the Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet People
    By Fu·Komissarzhevsky, Director of the Yermolova Theatre of the Soviet Union

    The Soviet people pay exceptional attention to the lives of the Chinese people and their artistic achievements. The Soviet people appreciate Chinese music, listen to Chinese songs, read novels and poems by Chinese writers and poets, and watch Chinese films and dramas with great interest. Chinese art, inspired by the great ideas of the struggle for peace and closely connected with life, is intimately understood by the Soviet people.

    Chinese writers' plays have been successfully staged in several theaters in Moscow. "The White-Haired Girl," "Romance of the West Chamber," and "Growing Up in Battle" have attracted many audiences. Our Yermolova Theatre staged Guo Moruo's historical tragedy "Qu Yuan." The ideas of loyalty to the motherland and one's own people, the protagonist's longing for freedom, justice, and the happiness of the people, which run through this play, are also intimate and easy to understand for our Soviet actors.

    Like all Soviet people, we are familiar with the life of our great neighbor, the Chinese people. However, this play speaks of a distant era in Chinese history, of the talented son of the Chinese people, the great patriotic poet Qu Yuan, who lived more than two thousand years ago in the "Warring States Period." In this regard, our knowledge was insufficient, and therefore we had to make efforts to study the era covered by the play.

    In overcoming these difficulties, the rich materials about ancient China preserved in the museums and libraries of Moscow gave us great help. For example, when studying the costumes of Qu Yuan's era, we used Qu Yuan's works with illustrations by ancient Chinese painters. We became familiar with the recently discovered materials about the State of Chu—Qu Yuan's homeland.

    The entire theater staff sincerely appreciates the valuable assistance of our Chinese comrades. We were very happy to be able to perform certain parts of the play for the playwright during the work process. Guo Moruo watched the preview of the play and gave us many valuable suggestions. He described to us in detail the situation in China during the time of Qu Yuan, told us some interesting stories about the poet's biography, talked about Qu Yuan's life in the court of King Huai of Chu, his struggle with the traitors—court officials—and his wandering life in the country. Professor Zheng Zhenduo, Director of the Institute of Archeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, also gave us a lot of help. He provided some suggestions on the play's sets, costumes, and props, which were designed by Honored Artist, painter Leikin.

    Now let's talk about the music of the play. The famous Soviet composer Gliere, the author of the ballet "The Red Poppy," composed the music for "Qu Yuan." This musician is not writing a musical work on a Chinese theme for the first time. Nevertheless, when composing the music for "Qu Yuan," Gliere also listened to hundreds of pieces by Chinese musicians and Chinese folk songs before starting to create.

    We believe that the immortal image of Qu Yuan, a poet who loved his motherland and people, and loved freedom and justice, has been deeply imprinted in the hearts of the audience. We are pleased that we completed the work of staging the play on the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the great Soviet Union and China.

    I wish the friendship and cultural exchange between the Soviet people and the Chinese people—who are advancing on the happiest and most correct path of life—further development and consolidation.

    我们在加强中苏两国人民友谊事业中的贡献
    苏联埃尔莫洛娃剧院导演  伏·科米萨尔热夫斯基
    苏联人民异常关注着中国人民的生活和他们的艺术成就。苏联人民欣赏中国的音乐，听中国的歌曲，读中国作家和诗人的小说和诗歌，满怀兴趣地看中国的影片和戏剧。为争取和平斗争的伟大思想所鼓舞的并和生活有密切联系的中国艺术，是苏联人所亲切了解的。
    在莫斯科的一些剧院里，曾经成功地上演了中国作家们的戏剧。“白毛女”、“西厢记”、“战斗里成长”等剧吸引了许多观众。我们的埃尔莫洛娃剧院上演了郭沫若的历史悲剧“屈原”。贯穿在这个剧本中的对祖国和自己人民的忠诚的思想，主人公对自由、正义和人民幸福的渴望，对于我们苏联演员来说，也是亲切和容易理解的。
    也像所有的苏联人一样，我们是了解我们伟大邻国——中国人民的生活的。但是这个剧本谈的是中国历史上一个久远的时代，谈的是生在两千多年以前“战国时代”的中国人民的天才儿子、伟大的爱国诗人屈原。在这方面，我们的知识是不够的，因此就不能不努力研究该剧所涉及的时代。
    在克服这些困难方面，莫斯科的博物馆和图书馆内所珍藏的有关古代中国的丰富材料，给我们以很大帮助。例如，我们研究屈原时代的服装时，就使用了附有中国古代画家的插图的屈原的作品。我们熟悉了最近发掘的关于楚国——屈原的祖国——的材料。
    剧院全体人员衷心地感激中国同志们的宝贵帮助。我们非常高兴的是在工作过程中能够把剧中某些部分演给剧作者看。郭沫若曾看过了该剧的预演，并给了我们许多宝贵的意见。他向我们详细地叙述了关于屈原所处时代的中国的情形，告诉了我们关于诗人传记中的一些有趣的故事，谈了些屈原在楚怀王宫廷里的生活，他和卖国贼——宫廷官吏们的斗争以及他在国内的流浪生活。中国科学院考古研究所所长郑振铎教授也给了我们很多的帮助。他对该剧的布景、服装和道具提供了一些意见。这些布景、服装和道具是功勋艺术家、画家雷金所设计的。
    现在来谈一谈该剧的音乐。著名的苏联作曲家、芭蕾舞剧“红罂粟”的作者格里艾尔为“屈原”一剧配曲。这位音乐家并不是第一次写关于中国情节的音乐作品。尽管如此，格里艾尔在为“屈原”一剧配曲时，还选听了数百件中国音乐家的作品和中国的民间歌曲，然后才开始动手创作。
    我们认为，屈原这个热爱祖国和人民，热爱自由和正义的诗人的不朽形象已深深地印入了观众的心里。我们感到欣幸的是，在伟大的苏联和中国签订友好同盟互助条约四周年纪念的日子里，我们完成了演出该剧的工作。
    谨祝苏联人民和中国人民——他们正在最幸福、最正确的生活道路上前进——之间的友谊和文化交流更加发展和巩固。
