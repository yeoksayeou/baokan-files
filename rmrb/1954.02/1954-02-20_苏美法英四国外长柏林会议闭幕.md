Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 19th: The four foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States held a closed-door meeting on the morning of February 18th at the former Allied Control Council building. In the afternoon, the four foreign ministers held a closing meeting at the same location.

    The closing meeting was chaired by Molotov. The four foreign ministers concluded their discussion of the third agenda item, "The Question of the Austrian State Treaty."
    The head of the Austrian delegation, Figl, spoke first at the meeting. He said that the Austrian government had stated that it could not accept the Soviet proposal to include the supplementary Article 4b in the Austrian State Treaty and to revise Article 33. However, the Austrian government decided to put forward a new proposal. The Austrian government proposed that the withdrawal period for troops stipulated in Article 33 of the original draft treaty be extended, but the end of this period should not be later than June 30, 1955.
    Molotov then spoke, offering some opinions on the third agenda item. Molotov said that at the meeting on February 16th to discuss the Austrian issue, the Soviet delegation had said that it would study Eden's views on the Soviet delegation's proposed draft of Article 4b. Eden's idea was that it was not necessary to include Article 4b, which stipulates that Austria shall not join any alliance or military bloc, in the Austrian State Treaty, but that the Austrian government should simply issue a statement on this issue. We seem to be able to accept this idea. This statement should be attached to the treaty so that it can guarantee the realization of the purpose of Article 4b, namely: Austria shall not join any alliance or military bloc aimed at opposing any country that sent troops to participate in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria.
    Molotov continued, "As for Article 33, the Soviet delegation proposed an amendment to the fifth section of this article at the meeting on February 14th. As everyone knows, the current fifth section reads as follows: 'Due to the delay in the conclusion of the German peace treaty, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have the right to temporarily postpone the withdrawal of their respective occupation forces from Austria after the Austrian State Treaty comes into effect. The four governments acknowledge that the issue of the withdrawal of the four countries' troops from Austria must be re-discussed no later than 1955.'" Molotov said that Figl's speech today was a compromise on the Soviet delegation's above-mentioned proposal. However, this speech is not sufficient to fully resolve the issue in Article 33. As it stands, it must be admitted that it is not yet possible to reach an agreement on the Austrian State Treaty. But this does not mean that the possibility of continuing negotiations on this issue to reach an agreement has been lost.
    Molotov concluded by saying that the Soviet government believes that the Austrian government will believe that the Soviet delegation's proposal on Article 33, after final revision, can conform to the basic interests of Austria. The Soviet government also believes that the four countries can reach an agreement on this issue.
    Dulles then spoke, saying that the U.S. delegation withdrew all the concessions it had previously made at the meeting regarding the draft Austrian State Treaty. It is clear that the Soviet delegation made many efforts at the meeting to reach an agreement on the Austrian issue, while the U.S. delegation even withdrew its own proposal: that is, to accept some of the clauses in the draft Austrian State Treaty that had not yet been agreed upon, as the Soviet representative had put it at the meeting of foreign ministers' assistants. This shows that the U.S. delegation does not actually want to conclude an Austrian State Treaty.
    Bidault then spoke, saying that the French delegation was not prepared to sign an Austrian State Treaty that included Soviet proposals. Eden made a similar statement to Dulles.
    Figl made some technical suggestions regarding Articles 56 and 57 of the draft Austrian State Treaty, which concern the powers of the four countries' ambassadors in Vienna. He also expressed the hope that the Austrian State Treaty issue should continue to be included as an issue in international negotiations.
    Molotov then spoke, saying that the Soviet delegation had taken note of the statements made here by the representatives of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, and the statement by the Austrian representative. Molotov believes that it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the solution to the problem that we have not fully resolved here today should not be delayed, and that measures should be taken to align the opinions expressed here. Molotov, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, proposed the following suggestion: "In order to continue efforts to reach an agreement on the Austrian State Treaty, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States believe that it is appropriate to continue negotiations on the Austrian State Treaty through diplomatic channels in Vienna, and invite the Austrian government to participate."
    Dulles spoke, beginning by saying that the Soviet proposal seemed to him at first to be acceptable, but later he proposed an amendment to the Soviet proposal. The amendment said: The Vienna negotiations of the four countries' ambassadors can only begin after the Soviet government has explained to the governments of the other countries participating in this meeting when it will be possible to determine the date for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Austrian territory. Dulles once again exposed the true purpose of the United States' position on the Austrian issue, saying: It is inappropriate to create the illusion that the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty is possible and will be achieved soon.
    Bidault supported Dulles' amendment, which was intended to conceal his unwillingness to adopt the Soviet proposal, which aimed to continue consultations on the Austrian issue to facilitate a joint agreement between the four countries and Austria.
    Eden also agreed with Dulles' amendment.
    Figl said that he would welcome continued consultations in Vienna if there were guarantees that the consultations would be successful.
    Molotov then presented the Soviet delegation's views on Dulles' amendment. Molotov said that there are two different paths: one is the path that helps to conclude the Austrian State Treaty, and the other is the path that hinders the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty. The Soviet delegation believes that Dulles' proposal does not help to conclude the Austrian State Treaty.
    Speaking about the reasons why it is difficult to conclude the Austrian State Treaty, Molotov emphasized that if there were no plots to revive German militarism reflected in the "European Defense Community" plan, and if there were no increasing danger of the merger of Germany and Austria, then there would have been no difficulty in concluding the Austrian State Treaty. However, as everyone knows, the Soviet government cannot be held responsible for the fact that the threat of the revival of German militarism is increasing.
    Molotov said that the Soviet government will act in the spirit of the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation today.
    Then Molotov, in his capacity as chairman, asked if anyone wanted to continue discussing the Austrian issue. Dulles said that he only wanted to express the hope that the four governments would maintain diplomatic contact so that the Austrian State Treaty issue could be submitted to the four countries' ambassadors in Vienna for discussion as soon as possible.
    Eden and Bidault said that they had no comments.
    Molotov then announced: The discussion of the Austrian issue is over.
    Next, the four foreign ministers, in accordance with prior agreement, turned to discuss the two proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation on the second agenda item at the meeting on February 17th: The first proposal was that the four countries should reach an agreement on the police in East and West Germany, including the number of police and various weapons. The second proposal called for measures to promote and expand economic and cultural ties between West Germany and East Germany, and to establish two all-German committees for this purpose.
    Dulles, Bidault, and Eden systematically rejected the concrete proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation, which aimed at fundamentally resolving the entire German issue during the meeting. Today, they again expressed that they were not even willing to promote the implementation of measures such as helping to develop economic and cultural ties between East and West Germany. The foreign ministers of the three Western countries also put forward various unconvincing arguments to defend their positions. For example, Dulles rejected the Soviet proposal on the police issue in the eastern and western parts of Germany, on the pretext that this issue was within the purview of the United Nations. The Western foreign ministers similarly attempted to defend their refusal to accept the Soviet proposal to establish two all-German committees without any reason, insisting that the meeting had no right to pass such a decision.
    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation suggested stipulating the number of police and weapons of various kinds in the eastern and western parts of Germany because it was necessary to clarify this issue. However, this was obviously not to the taste of West Germany. Therefore, all sorts of arguments were put forward here to oppose the adoption of the Soviet proposal. Molotov then pointed out that the arguments put forward by the Western foreign ministers to defend their rejection of the second Soviet proposal were untenable.
    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation, taking this situation into consideration, specially proposed the following proposal for discussion by the meeting: "The governments of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will continue to work to resolve the German issue satisfactorily in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace in Europe."
    Dulles immediately spoke, saying that he thought "it is too late to start discussing new proposals now." Bidault echoed Dulles' opinion, saying that the Soviet proposal "should not be included in the documents of this meeting." Eden said circuitously that he was "prepared to study" the Soviet proposal, but he immediately agreed with Dulles' opinion.
    Subsequently, the four foreign ministers unanimously adopted the communiqué of the results of the Berlin Conference, which included the decisions adopted at the previous closed-door meetings on the first agenda item, "Measures to Ease International Tensions and to Convene a Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China." At this time, Dulles said that the resolution passed at the meeting on the issue of arms reduction should in no way affect the current negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the atomic issue.
    At the end of the meeting, the four foreign ministers made closing speeches, in which they expressed their views on the results of the meeting.
    Dulles said that the results of the discussion of the second and third agenda items were "extremely regrettable." He insisted that this was due to the "conflict of fundamental principles" between East and West, and he defended the Western countries' policy of establishing military blocs of several Western European countries, which is precisely the policy that is hindering the establishment of a European collective security system. Dulles continued, "Regardless of the conflict of fundamental principles," the foreign ministers achieved some achievements at this meeting. He pointed out that these achievements were the agreement reached at the meeting to convene a meeting in Geneva of representatives of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and directly related countries, as well as the agreement reached on the issue of arms reduction. Dulles said, "We have learned a lot here, and this is valuable, and we should not ignore it." Dulles also said that the Western countries will not weaken their efforts in order to maximize their potential. This means that he is calling for a continued expansion of armaments.
    Bidault pointed out in his speech that the Berlin Conference avoided the unfortunate fate of other conferences that did not reach any agreement. Bidault also said that there are still some major differences, and it is not easy to eliminate these differences. He said that although the world is currently divided, this does not mean that one should not try to reach a common decision in order to move forward along the path of peace. Bidault considered the results of this four-power foreign ministers' meeting to be "not small." He said that the meeting passed important decisions that can improve international relations. Although this is less than what should have been achieved, the four foreign ministers can be hopeful when assessing these achievements.
    Eden then spoke. He said that the results of the discussion of the second and third agenda items at the meeting were "disappointing." At the same time, Eden called some of the agreements reached at the meeting positive gains. He described the resolution on convening the Geneva conference as progress and pointed out that this conference would bring the Panmunjom talks out of the impasse. He also said that he looked forward to the convening of this conference and hoped that important agreements sufficient to guarantee peace would be reached at this conference.
    Dulles, on behalf of the U.S. delegation, thanked those who attended the meeting.
    Finally, Molotov made a speech on the results of the meeting. Molotov said at the end of his speech that the Soviet delegation expressed its gratitude to the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom for their cooperation at this meeting. The Soviet delegation also thanked all the staff of the four delegations for their diligent and successful work during the meeting.
    Then Molotov announced the closing of the Berlin four-power foreign ministers' meeting.

    苏美法英四国外长柏林会议闭幕
      【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林十九日讯：苏、法、英、美四国外长二月十八日上午在前盟国管制委员会大厦举行秘密会议。下午，四国外长在原地址举行闭幕会议。
    闭幕会议由莫洛托夫担任主席。四国外长结束了第三项议程“关于对奥和约问题”的讨论。
    奥地利代表团团长费格尔在会上第一个发言。他说，奥地利政府曾表示不能接受苏联关于在对奥和约内列入补充的第四条乙款和关于修改第三十三条的建议，但奥地利政府决定提出新的建议。奥地利政府建议，原和约草案第三十三条所规定的军队撤退期限应予延长，但此期限的结束不得迟于一九五五年六月三十日。
    莫洛托夫接着发言，就第三项议程提出了一些意见。莫洛托夫说，在二月十六日讨论奥地利问题的会议上，苏联代表团说过它将研究艾登就苏联代表团建议的第四条乙款草案所提出的意见。艾登的意见意思是说，无须将规定奥地利不得参加任何联盟或军事同盟的第四条乙款列入对奥和约，而只要奥地利政府就这一问题发表一项声明就够了。我们看来可以接受这种意见。这个声明要附在和约上，这样它就可以保证实现第四条乙款所规定的目的，即：奥地利不得参加任何旨在反对任何曾派遣军队参加对德战争和解放奥地利的战争的国家的联盟或军事同盟。
    莫洛托夫接着说，至于第三十三条，苏联代表团曾在二月十四日的会议上对这一条的第五节提出了一个修正案。大家知道，现在的第五节是这样说的：“由于对德和约拖延未能缔结，美国、英国、法国、苏联四国政府在对奥和约生效后有权暂时延期撤退四国在奥地利的各自占领区内的占领军。四国政府承认必须不得迟于一九五五年重新讨论四国军队撤离奥地利的期限问题。”莫洛托夫说，费格尔今天的发言是对于苏联代表团上述建议的折衷。但这次发言还不足以圆满解决三十三条中的问题。照目前情形看来，不得不承认现在还不能就对奥和约达成协议。但这并不意味着已失去就这个问题继续进行谈判以达成协议的可能性。
    莫洛托夫最后说，苏联政府认为，奥地利政府将会相信，经过最后修正的苏联代表团关于第三十三条的建议是可以符合奥地利的基本利益的。苏联政府还认为，四国是能就这个问题达成协议的。
    杜勒斯接着发言，他说，美国代表团撤回它以前在会议上就对奥和约草案所作的一切让步。可见，苏联代表团为了就奥地利问题达成协议在会上作了好些努力，而美国代表团则甚至于撤回了自己提出的建议：即照苏联代表在外长助理会议上的提法来接受对奥和约草案中尚未取得同意的一些条款。这表明美国代表团实际上并不想缔结对奥和约。
    皮杜尔接着发言说，法国代表团不准备在这样一种包括有苏联建议在内的对奥和约上签字。艾登作了和杜勒斯类似的发言。
    费格尔就对奥和约草案的第五十六条和第五十七条提出了一些技术性的建议，这两条是关于四国驻维也纳大使的职权问题的。他还表示希望对奥和约问题今后仍应列为国际谈判中的一个问题。
    莫洛托夫接着发言说，苏联代表团注意到了美国、法国、英国政府代表在这里的发言和奥地利代表的发言。莫洛托夫认为必须提起注意：对我们今天在这里未能完全解决的问题的解决不应拖延，应当采取措施使在这里所表示的意见一致起来。莫洛托夫代表苏联代表团提出下列建议：“苏联、法国、英国、美国四国外长会议为了继续努力就对奥和约达成协议，认为宜于通过外交途径在维也纳继续进行对奥和约的谈判，并邀请奥地利政府参加。”
    杜勒斯发言，他开始说，苏联的建议初看似乎是他能够接受的，但后来他对苏联的建议提出了修正案。修正案说：维也纳四国大使的谈判只能在苏联政府向参加这次会议的其他国家政府说明何时才能确定苏军撤离奥境的日期以后开始。杜勒斯又一次暴露了美国在奥地利问题上的立场的真正目的，他说：造成以为缔结对奥和约是可能的并且很快就能达到的幻觉，是不适当的。
    皮杜尔支持杜勒斯为了掩饰不愿意采纳苏联的建议而提出的修正，苏联的建议的目的是要求继续就奥地利问题进行协商以便利四国和奥地利共同达成协议。
    艾登也同意杜勒斯的修正。
    费格尔说，如果能保证协商会获致成功的结果，他欢迎在维也纳继续进行协商。
    莫洛托夫接着就杜勒斯的修正提出苏联代表团的意见。莫洛托夫说，有两条不同的道路：一条是有助于缔结对奥和约的道路，另一条是阻挠缔结对奥和约的道路。苏联代表团认为，杜勒斯的建议无助于缔结对奥和约。
    莫洛托夫在谈到使对奥和约难以缔结的原因时着重指出，如果没有在“欧洲防务集团”计划中得到反映的复活德国军国主义的阴谋，如果没有日益加深的德奥合并的危险，那么缔结对奥和约本来是不会发生什么困难的。可是，大家知道，苏联政府对于德国军国主义复活的威胁日益增加这一事实，不能负任何责任。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联政府将按照苏联代表团今天所提出的建议的精神办事。
    然后莫洛托夫以主席的身份问道，有没有人要继续讨论奥地利问题。杜勒斯说，他只想表示，希望四国政府保持外交接触，以便尽早将对奥和约问题交给四国驻维也纳大使讨论。
    艾登和皮杜尔说，他们没有任何意见。
    莫洛托夫然后宣布：奥地利问题讨论结束。
    接着，四国外长依照事先的协议转而讨论苏联代表团在二月十七日会议上就第二项议程提出的两个建议：第一个建议是，四国应就东德和西德的警察问题包括警察的人数和各种武器在内，达成协议。第二个建议主张采取措施，以促进和扩大西德与东德之间的经济和文化联系，并为此目的而建立两个全德委员会。
    杜勒斯、皮杜尔、艾登在会议过程中有计划地拒绝苏联代表团提出的、目的在于根本解决整个德国问题的具体建议。他们今天又表示甚至不愿意促进像帮助发展东德与西德之间的经济和文化联系这样的措施的实行。三个西方国家的外长并提出种种不能令人信服的论据来辩护他们的立场。譬如，杜勒斯拒绝了苏联关于德国东西两部分警察问题的建议，借口是这个问题是属于联合国的职权范围的。西方国家外长同样毫无理由地企图辩护他们不接受苏联关于成立两个全德委员会的建议，硬说这次会议无权通过这样的决定。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团所以建议规定德国东西两部分各种警察的人数和武器，是因为有必要对这个问题加以澄清。但是，这显然是不合西德的口味的。因此这里提出了各式各样的论据来反对通过苏联的建议。莫洛托夫接着指出，西方外长提出来为他们拒绝苏联第二个建议辩护的那些论据是站不住脚的。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团考虑到这种情况，特提出下列建议交会议讨论：“法国、英国、美国和苏联政府将继续努力，以求根据巩固欧洲和平的利益来圆满解决德国问题。”
    杜勒斯立即发言说，他认为“现在开始讨论新的建议已经太晚了”。皮杜尔附和杜勒斯的意见说，苏联这条建议“不应列入这次会议的文件中”。艾登转弯抹角地说，他“准备研究”苏联的建议，但他立即又表示同意杜勒斯的意见。
    随后，四国外长一致通过了柏林会议结果的公报，其中包括第一项议程“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”的历次秘密会议上所通过的决定。这时候，杜勒斯说道，会上通过的关于裁减军备问题的决议丝毫不应该影响美国和苏联目前就原子问题进行的谈判。
    会议结束时，四外长作了闭幕发言，大家表示了自己对会议结果的看法。
    杜勒斯说，第二项议程和第三项议程讨论的结果使人“极感遗憾”。他硬说这是因为东方和西方“基本原则的冲突”，他并为西方国家建立若干西欧国家的军事集团这种政策辩护，而正是这种政策阻碍着欧洲集体安全体系的建立。杜勒斯继续说，“不管基本原则的冲突”，外长们在这次会议上还是取得了某些成就。他指出这些成就就是，会上大家获得协议在日内瓦召开美国、法国、英国、苏联、中华人民共和国及直接有关国家的代表的会议，以及大家在裁减军备问题上获得的协议。杜勒斯说，我们在这里学到了不少东西，这是有价值的东西，我们不应忽视。杜勒斯又说，西方国家将不减弱它们的努力，以便最大限度地发挥它们的潜力。这也就是说，他号召继续扩充军备。
    皮杜尔在发言中指出，柏林会议避免了像别的会议那种没有达成任何协议的不幸命运。皮杜尔又说道，可是现在还存在着一些重大的分歧，要消除这些分歧并不容易。他说道，虽然目前的世界是分裂的，但这并不意味着不应该设法取得共同的决定，以便沿着和平的道路前进。皮杜尔认为这次四国外长会议的成果“不小”。他说道，会议通过了能改善国际关系的重大决定。虽然这比应该取得的成果要小，但是，对这些已经取得的成果加以估计，四国外长是可以抱有希望的。
    艾登接着发言。他说，会上讨论第二项和第三项议程的结果是“令人失望的”。同时艾登又把在会上达成的一些协议称为是肯定的收获。他把关于召开日内瓦会议的决议说成是一个进步，并指出，这一会议将使板门店会谈走出绝境。他又说，他期待着这一会议的召开，并希望在这一会议上达成足以保障和平的重要协议。
    杜勒斯代表美国代表团向出席会议者致谢意。
    最后莫洛托夫作了关于会议结果的发言。莫洛托夫在结束发言后说，苏联代表团对美国、法国和英国三国外长在这次会议上的合作表示感谢。苏联代表团并感谢四国代表团的全体工作人员在会议过程中所做的勤勉的和成功的工作。
    接着莫洛托夫宣布柏林四国外长会议闭幕。
