Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd, TASS Delhi, February 22nd: Calcutta's official Indian newspaper "Lokmanya" commented on the results of the Berlin Conference, supporting the Soviet proposals, and considering the participation of the People's Republic of China as "one of the main factors in resolving international issues." The newspaper also emphasized that "the position taken by the United States, especially Dulles, in refusing to recognize People's China is unfounded."

Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, TASS Delhi, February 23rd: The influential bourgeois newspaper "People's Daily" published in Lucknow, supports the peaceful stance of the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The newspaper said that the proposals put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are reasonable and fair. Germany should be free and unified. The newspaper said that the Americans want to use Germany's knowledge, technology, fighting spirit and economic resources to serve their anti-Soviet bloc.

The newspaper also said that it is becoming increasingly clear that if the United States continues to pursue its current rearmament policy, Western European countries will become increasingly enslaved by the United States. Europe will eventually accept Molotov's rational views on European collective security.

Xinhua News Agency, February 25th, TASS Delhi, February 24th: Madras' "The Hindu" pointed out that the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference has made it possible for "further negotiations on international issues such as disarmament and the Far East situation."

The newspaper believes that the main achievement of the Berlin Conference was the decision to hold a meeting in Geneva with the participation of the People's Republic of China. The newspaper said, let us hope that this meeting will be the beginning of a better understanding of China's role in international politics.

    印度报纸赞成苏联在四外长会议上的主张
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社德里二十二日讯：加尔各答的印度官方报纸“洛克曼雅报”对柏林会议的结果发表评论，赞成苏联的主张，认为中华人民共和国的参加，是“解决国际问题的主要因素之一。”该报同时着重指出：“美国、特别是杜勒斯所采取的那种不愿意承认人民中国的立场，是毫无根据的。”
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社德里二十三日讯：勒克瑙出版的有影响的资产阶级报纸“人民报”拥护苏联代表团在柏林四国外长会议上的和平立场。该报说，苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫提出的建议是合理的、公正的。德国应该得到自由和统一。该报说，美国人想把德国的知识、技术、作战精神和经济资源用来为他们的反苏集团服务。
    该报又说，越来越清楚，如果美国继续执行它目前的重整军备政策，西欧国家将愈来愈受美国奴役。欧洲终究有一天将会接受莫洛托夫关于欧洲集体安全的合理观点的。
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社德里二十四日讯：马德拉斯“印度教徒报”指出，柏林四国外长会议已使今后有可能就“裁减军备和远东局势之类的国际问题举行进一步的谈判”。
    该报认为，柏林会议的主要成就是会议关于在日内瓦召开有中华人民共和国参加的会议的决议。该报说，让我们希望这次会议成为更好地理解中国在国际政治中的作用的开端吧。
