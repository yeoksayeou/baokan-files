Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Polish United Workers' Party is preparing for the Second Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party (March 10th). The national laboring people are extensively launching a socialist labor competition and have achieved success.

    Currently, party organizations in various localities are nominating delegates to attend the Party Congress. Party members, activists, trade union members, and members of agricultural production cooperatives across the country are holding meetings to discuss the two proposals on developing the national economy released by the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, and are offering opinions and suggestions for further discussion at the Party Congress.

    Since the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party in October 1953 decided to convene the Party Congress, socialist competitions to greet the Party Congress have been successively launched throughout the country. Participation in the competition is very widespread. For example, by January of this year, more than 82% and 95% of workers in the coal mining industry and textile industry, respectively, had participated in the competition. By the end of January, 750 villages and 412 agricultural production cooperatives in Koszalin Province had participated in the competition. Responding to the Party's call for further developing agriculture, they guaranteed to increase cattle by 13,000 head, pigs by 68,000 head, and sheep by 16,000 head. More than 18,000 and 14,000 teachers in Stalinogród Province and Kraków Province, respectively, participated in the competition, guaranteeing to improve the quality of teaching. Now, news of victories in labor competitions is coming from all over the country. From the start of the competition to mid-January of this year, Polish miners, metallurgical workers, textile workers, and construction workers have increased national production by 61,000 tons of coal, 16,700 tons of steel, more than 6 million meters of cloth, and more than 1,240 housing units. Since the beginning of this year, workers at the Bobrek Steel Factory have over-fulfilled the plan by producing approximately 500 tons of milled iron and more than 1,500 tons of rolled metal. The Kraków First Tannery has increased production by 75,500 kilograms of high-quality raw materials. The Stalin Textile Factory in Łódź has increased production by more than 70,000 kilograms of yarn this year. Hosiery factories across the country have over-fulfilled the plan by producing more than 427,500 pairs of socks during the competition.
     Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: Workers in Czechoslovakia are launching a socialist production competition to greet the Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

    The Tenth Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia is scheduled to be held from June 11th to 13th this year. As early as the end of last year, production competitions to greet the Party Congress had already begun in factories and mines throughout the country. Workers in various workshops of the Krompachy Metallurgical Factory put forward guarantees to shorten smelting time, improve labor productivity, and increase profit margins in the competition. All the employees of the "Tatra Light" hosiery factory guaranteed: to accumulate more than 110,000 crowns (Czechoslovak currency) for the state in the first quarter of this year by over-fulfilling the plan, and to over-fulfill the product quality plan and reduce production costs by more than 80,000 crowns. They also guaranteed that at least 12% of the workers would be able to use the advanced work method of the Soviet Kolabelnikova. All the young workers in the furnace workshop of the Lenin Steel Factory in Pilsen Province guaranteed that they would take the lead in the factory in the production increase and economy campaign to greet the Tenth Party Congress.

       Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: Hungarian workers are engaged in a production competition to greet the Third Congress of the Hungarian Working People's Party, scheduled to be held on April 18th. Advanced workers at the Lenin Steel Factory in Gyöngyös guaranteed to improve product quality and reduce product costs by 2.7 million forints (Hungarian currency) in the competition. In terms of reducing waste products, they guaranteed to save 720,000 forints for the state. The six-member group led by Kszohony at the factory also guaranteed to produce 100 tons of high-quality steel above the plan before the Party Congress. Miners in the Komló district planned to increase coal production to 132% of the fourth quarter of last year before the Congress, exceeding the first quarter plan for this year by more than 10,000 tons of coal, and train 250 more young miners. The advanced turner Ratos group at the Piek Vehicle Manufacturing Plant challenged the advanced Muzska turner group at the Rakosi Steel Plant. They guaranteed that they would not produce any waste products before the Congress and would complete the production plan for the first quarter of 1958 ahead of schedule. Pirkova, a female worker at the Kelenföld Textile Factory who won the title of "Outstanding Worker in Light Industry," guaranteed to increase production by 19% using advanced Soviet experience and to produce only first-class products. Sinkote, an advanced female worker at the Budapest Textile Factory, challenged workers at other textile factories, guaranteeing that her daily production would exceed the quota by 10% and that all products would be first-class. Her challenge has been responded to by many textile workers. In addition, many workers at machine tractor stations have also made guarantees to repair agricultural machinery ahead of schedule to facilitate spring plowing.
      Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: Sofia dispatch: Bulgarian workers have achieved remarkable results in the production competition to greet the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (February 25th).

    In the heavy industry sector, miners at the Dimitrov Mine are completing 140% of their production quotas every day. Miner Storkov's daily coal production exceeds the quota by 230%. Workers at the Maritsa Mine in the Maritsa mining area increased national production by 1,100 tons of coal above the plan in ten days. The Vulko Chervenkov machine tool manufacturing factory has begun to manufacture 56 new types of machines for the food industry during the competition. Workers Valyev and Petkov at the factory created a record of completing three shifts' quotas in each shift. Workers at the Vaptsarov Machine Manufacturing Plant are actively participating in Stakhanov work teams. Turner Ivanov at the factory completes more than twice his quota every day. In the textile industry, Dobreva, Nikolova, and Dimitrova, female workers at the Christo-Botev Textile Factory, have completed the quotas for the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) and have begun work on the Third Five-Year Plan. Vasilyeva, a female worker at the Petresov Textile Factory, completes several quotas every day. She is now working on the 1963 plan. Dimitrova, a female worker at the Dimitrov Textile Factory, takes care of 30 looms alone and is working on the June 1963 plan. All the workers at the factory have guaranteed to increase the variety of products and improve the quality of all products in order to greet the Sixth Party Congress. Bulgarian railway employees have also launched a campaign to increase transportation capacity and volume. A group of technicians at the Burgas locomotive factory exceeded the quota in January, allowing 107 carriages to leave the factory ahead of schedule, thus transporting an additional 18,000 tons of goods.
