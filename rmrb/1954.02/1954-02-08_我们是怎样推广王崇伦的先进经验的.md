    How We Promoted Wang Chonglun's Advanced Experience
    Yang Qingchun, Secretary of the CCP Anshan Iron and Steel Works Mechanical General Plant Committee
    Over the past year, under the leadership of the CCP Anshan Municipal Committee and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Mechanical General Plant have brought into play the creative wisdom of the working class, carried out work such as improving labor organization and strengthening planned management, and put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals for improving equipment and increasing equipment utilization, ensuring the supply of basic construction equipment and production maintenance spare parts for Anshan Iron and Steel. In this series of work, we paid attention to supporting the germination of new things, cultivated the young worker Wang Chonglun, and encouraged him to improve his tools eight times in succession, creating a "universal tool holder", thus expanding the scope of machine tool application, solving the problem of equipment imbalance, greatly increasing labor productivity, completing four times the annual workload in one year, and finding a direction for the mechanization movement in the machining department.
    Under the vigorous call and promotion of the leadership, all the workers of the Mechanical General Plant have set off a wave of enthusiasm for learning Wang Chonglun's innovative spirit, and many workers have improved their production technology under Wang Chonglun's influence. After learning from Wang Chonglun's experience, the plant has put forward a total of 389 rationalization proposals related to improving mechanical equipment, of which 86 have been successful; many suggestions have made great contributions to production.
    In promoting Wang Chonglun's experience, we first unified the leadership's thinking. The Party Committee had a special discussion and clarified that Wang Chonglun's experience in improving tools and expanding equipment utilization efficiency was the direction for carrying out the mechanization movement in the machining department; and whether this movement could be carried out in depth and correctly depended on the leadership. Therefore, we organized cadres to study, criticized the various erroneous ideas such as not believing in the creative wisdom of the masses, losing sensitivity to new things, regarding the creation and improvement of the workers as "buckwheat skin", thinking it was "nothing special," or saying: "Our conditions are not good, it is impossible to improve." It was pointed out that Wang Chonglun grew up gradually under the attention and cultivation of the leadership. At the same time, it was also explained that sensitivity, attention and support for new things is an important standard for checking a Communist Party member and a revolutionary worker's mass viewpoint and class stand. In this way, the cadres' understanding was gradually improved, and everyone understood that to rely on the working class to do a good job in production, it is necessary to vigorously support and foster the creations of the workers, and even the small buds must be given attention.
    On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, we carried out a series of publicity and organization work. The Party, the administration, the trade union and the Communist Youth League organizations clarified their respective responsibilities, strengthened the organizational leadership of rationalization proposals, included the handling of rationalization proposals in the work plan, and provided necessary materials, etc. At the same time, vigorous publicity and mobilization work was launched. First, a meeting of all plant employee representatives was convened, and while explaining production tasks and work plans, everyone was called upon to learn Wang Chonglun's pioneering spirit, use old waste materials, improve tools, expand equipment utilization efficiency, improve production technology, and solve key problems. At the meeting, workers who had achieved success in learning from Wang Chonglun and who had successfully improved tools were rewarded, and many suggestions that were under study and some new buds were also commended. After the meeting, each workshop held employee meetings separately, so that the workshop operation plan met with the masses and was grasped by the masses. At the same time, we also used our spare time to organize Wang Chonglun to report to the workers on his eight times of improving tools and experience, and to bring into play the strength of publicity and organization, using various forms of publicity to conduct extensive publicity, and the trade union workshop committee mobilized employees to conduct discussions. These practices were very effective. After listening to Wang Chonglun's report, most employees checked and revised their personal guarantee plans. Some workers were studying their suggestions, and after listening to the report and discussing it, they were also encouraged and their confidence was increased. Some workers also examined their erroneous ideas and expressed that they would learn from Wang Chonglun. In this way, in the promotion and learning of Wang Chonglun's pioneering spirit, the consciousness of the workers was further enhanced, and the increase production and practice economy competition was led to a higher climax, thereby guaranteeing the completion of the state plan and the increase production and practice economy tasks.
    In the mass movement to promote Wang Chonglun's advanced experience, carry out tool improvement, and expand equipment utilization efficiency, many innovation examples emerged, and we seized this point and carried out further publicity and mobilization. The approach was to organize workers in each workshop who had achieved success and innovation in learning from Wang Chonglun to perform on-site. The purpose of the performance was to use the results of the masses' learning from Wang Chonglun to educate the masses themselves, to further promote Wang Chonglun's pioneering spirit, thereby ensuring the completion of the production tasks. We instructed the workshop to prepare performance items, prepare charts for use in conjunction with the performance, set up eye-catching slogans and blackboards, and train the commentators during the performance, requiring the commentators to only talk about five things: the creator, the creation, the creation time, the previous situation, and the current effectiveness, etc.; avoiding the phenomenon of the commentator not grasping the center. In this way, we carried out concrete publicity on the promotion of advanced experience to the employees, and also carried out education on socialist labor attitude. After seeing other people's performances, many workers worked hard to study on their own. Zhang Youliang, a blacksmith in the Second Metalworking Workshop, was studying how to improve the clamp and cutter to increase the output of milled nuts. After seeing other people's performances, he worked hard to study and succeeded the next day, increasing efficiency nearly tenfold.
    In the process of promoting advanced experience, we also paid attention to carrying out collectivist education and implementing the policy of combining labor experience with science and technology. We realized that not only should the leadership provide support and encouragement to the employees, but also the employees should care and help each other. Therefore, we educated the employees that they should not only study and improve themselves, but also help other comrades to study, so as to eliminate discrimination against the germination of advanced things. We also put forward three requirements for the technicians of the whole plant, hoping that they would overcome non-working-class ideas, actively and enthusiastically participate in the production innovation movement, and support the rationalization proposals of the workers, so that they could be quickly realized. For example, when Chen Changchun, a worker in the Second Metalworking Workshop, converted an old machine tool into a universal machine tool, he received the help of many workers. If he lacked anything, everyone gave it to him, so that he quickly succeeded.
    Whether advanced experience can be promoted depends not only on mobilization and deployment, but also on the leadership's in-depth inspection and specific assistance. We once organized more than 20 cadres to go deep into the workshops to help promote Wang Chonglun's advanced experience, which achieved great results. In this way, we can deeply understand the situation, achieve concrete leadership, overcome the leadership's lack of depth, generality, and bureaucratic style, increase cadres' confidence, enrich leadership experience, and correct deviations in a timely manner; and more importantly, enable the suggestions of the workers to be supported and realized in a timely manner.

    我们是怎样推广王崇伦的先进经验的
    中共鞍钢机械总厂委员会书记　杨庆春
    一年来，鞍钢机械总厂职工在中共鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司的领导下，发挥了工人阶级的创造智慧，进行了改进劳动组织、加强计划管理等工作，并提出了改进设备、提高设备运用率等合理化建议一千多件，保证了鞍钢基本建设备品和生产检修备品的供应。在这一系列工作中，我们注意支持了新生事物的萌芽，培养了青年工人王崇伦，鼓励他先后八次改进工具，创造了“万能工具胎”，因而扩大了机床的运用范围，解决了设备不平衡的问题，大大提高了劳动生产率，一年完成了全年工作量的四倍，并给机械加工部门开展机械化运动找到了方向。
    在领导上的大力号召和推广下，机械总厂全体职工已掀起了学习王崇伦这一革新精神的热潮，很多职工在王崇伦的影响下，改进了生产技术。全厂在学习王崇伦的经验后，共提出了有关改进机械设备的合理化建议三百八十九件，其中有八十六件已获得成功；有很多建议对生产上的贡献很大。
    我们在推广王崇伦的经验时，首先统一了领导思想。党委会曾作了专门的讨论，明确了王崇伦改进工具、扩大设备运用效能的经验，是在机械加工部门中开展机械化运动的方向；而这一运动能否深入正确地开展，关键在于领导。所以，我们就组织干部进行了学习，批判了那种不相信群众的创造智慧，对新鲜事物失去敏感，把职工群众的创造改进看成是“荞麦皮”、认为“不稀罕”，或是说：“我们条件不好，不可能改进”等各种错误思想。并指出：王崇伦就是在领导上的重视和培养下逐步成长起来的。同时，也说明：对新鲜事物的敏感、重视和支持与否，是检查一个共产党员和革命工作者的群众观点、阶级立场的重要标准。这样，就逐步提高了干部的认识，使大家明确了要依靠工人阶级搞好生产，必须大力支持和扶植职工群众的创造，就是幼小的萌芽，也要给以重视。
    在统一思想认识的基础上，我们进行了一系列的宣传组织工作。党、行政、工会和青年团组织明确分工，加强了合理化建议的组织领导，把对合理化建议的处理列入作业计划，并供应必要的材料等。同时，大力展开了宣传动员工作，首先召开了全厂职工代表会议，在交代生产任务和作业计划的同时，号召大家学习王崇伦的首创精神，利用旧废料、改进工具、扩大设备运用效能，改进生产技术，解决关键问题。会上，对于学习王崇伦有成绩、改进工具获得成功的职工进行了奖励，对于许多正在研究中的建议和一些新的萌芽，也进行了表扬。会后，各个车间又分别召开了职工大会，使车间作业计划和群众见面，为群众所掌握。同时，我们又利用业余时间，组织王崇伦向职工报告他八次改进工具的经过和经验，并发挥宣传组织力量，利用各种宣传形式，进行广泛宣传，工会车间委员会并发动职工进行讨论。这些作法，收效很大，绝大部分职工在听了王崇伦的报告后，都纷纷检查和修订了自己的个人保证计划。有些工人正在研究自己的建议，听了报告并讨论后，也受到了鼓舞，提高了信心。有些工人并检查了自己的错误思想，表示要向王崇伦学习。这样，在推广学习王崇伦的首创精神中，进一步提高了职工群众的觉悟，把增产节约竞赛引向更高潮，从而保证了国家计划和增产节约任务的完成。
    在推广王崇伦的先进经验、开展改进工具、扩大设备运用效能的群众运动中，涌现出很多革新事例，我们就抓住这一点，进行了更进一步的宣传和动员。做法是：组织各车间学习王崇伦有成绩有创造的职工，在现场进行表演。表演的目的是用群众学习王崇伦的成果，来教育群众自己，进一步推广王崇伦的首创精神，从而保证生产任务的完成。我们责成车间准备表演项目，准备配合表演用的图表，布置鲜明的标语和板报，训练表演时的说明员，要求说明员只讲五件事，创造者、创造物、创造时间、以前情况和现在效能等；避免了说明员抓不住中心的现象。这样，我们就对职工具体地进行了推广先进经验的宣传，也进行了社会主义劳动态度的教育。很多工人看到别人的表演后，自己就努力研究。第二金工车间锻工张有良正研究改进挟具和刀具，以提高铣螺丝帽的产量，看到别人表演后，就努力研究，第二天获得了成功，提高效率近十倍。
    在推广先进经验当中，我们也注意进行了集体主义教育，贯彻了劳动经验和科学技术相结合的方针。我们体会到：不只领导上要对职工进行支持和鼓舞，也要使职工之间互相关怀和帮助，所以，我们就教育职工不但自己要研究改进，也要帮助别的同志研究，以消除对先进事物萌芽的歧视。对于全厂的技术员，我们也提出三项要求，希望他们克服非工人阶级思想，积极热情地参加生产革新运动，扶植工人群众的合理化建议，使之迅速实现。如：第二金工车间工人陈长春把旧机床改装成万能机床时，就得到了很多工人的帮助，他缺什么，大伙给什么，使他很快地获得了成功。
    先进经验的能否推广，不光是靠动员和布置，还需要领导的深入检查和具体帮助。我们曾组织了二十多名干部深入车间帮助推广王崇伦的先进经验，收到很大效果。这样就可以深入了解情况，做到具体领导，克服了领导不深入、一般化和官僚主义的作风，提高了干部信心，丰富了领导经验，出了偏向也可以及时纠正；而更重要的，是使工人群众的建议能及时得到扶植和实现。
