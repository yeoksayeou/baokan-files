    Eastern and Central-South China Universally Builds Farmland Water Conservancy
   [Report from this newspaper] Farmers in various parts of East China and Central-South China are making great efforts to build farmland water conservancy during the winter slack season, striving to increase grain production this year and support national economic construction. According to incomplete statistics, Guangdong, Fujian, and Anhui provinces alone have repaired and newly built more than 76,000 various small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, benefiting cultivated land (including consolidating existing projects and expanding the irrigated area) of more than 20 million mu. Most of these projects have already started, and some have been completed. In Anhui Province, more than 800,000 farmers are currently participating in small-scale farmland water conservancy winter repair projects. They expect to complete more than 59 million cubic meters of earthwork before spring planting, reducing drought, flood, and flood threats to more than 12 million mu of farmland. All of Shandong Province's more than 500 winter water conservancy projects have been completed, fully restoring the water conservancy projects destroyed by floods during last year's flood season, reducing the threat of waterlogging and floods to more than 30 million mu of farmland in Liaocheng, Dezhou, Laiyang, Linyi, Jining, Heze and other regions during this year's flood season. More than 300,000 mu of low-lying land in Licheng, Linyi, and other counties have also been basically exempted from waterlogging and turned into fertile land after the construction of ditch and furrow ridge fields and drainage ditches. The water conservancy construction work in the northern counties of Henan Province has also been largely completed, with more than 100 channels repaired and dug in the Xinxiang region. Xin'yang, Luoshan, and other six counties have built more than 1,700 ponds and dikes and are still working on more than 1,500 others. More than 60 counties in Hubei Province have fully or partially launched water conservancy construction campaigns, and the annual repair projects of dikes and embankments in Hunan Province's lakefront counties have been mostly completed, and small-scale water conservancy projects in mountainous and hilly areas have also generally started.
    The Party and government organs in various places generally attach great importance to the leadership of farmland water conservancy work. The water conservancy departments in many regions sent working groups as early as August and September last year to conduct surveys and investigations, study the occurrence of drought and flood disasters, analyze the characteristics of streams, and help the masses formulate practical farmland water conservancy construction plans. In order to gradually solve the technical guidance problems in the construction of farmland water conservancy projects, in addition to dispatching some technical cadres to go deep into districts and townships to strengthen guidance, more than 70 counties in Guangdong, Hunan, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces have successively trained more than 5,500 farmer water conservancy technicians. According to the existing cultural level of farmers, various places use practical teaching methods that combine theory with practice, such as field visits and construction site internships, so that farmers can initially understand the technology of farmland water conservancy construction and the basic knowledge of guiding construction. The trained farmers have played a great role in this year's water conservancy construction projects.
    Local people's governments have also allocated a large amount of funds to help farmers solve the financial difficulties of constructing farmland water conservancy projects. The farmers in various places have personally seen the benefits of farmland water conservancy construction in recent years, and have also raised some funds to invest in water conservancy construction. After studying the general line, the broad masses of farmers saw the beautiful scenery of socialism and showed a high degree of labor enthusiasm in the farmland water conservancy construction movement, and their work efficiency has been continuously improved. For example, the soil filling efficiency of farmers who built the Jiangwan Reservoir in Yingde County, Guangdong Province, increased from 0.98 cubic meters per person per day to 1.38 cubic meters. The work efficiency of general laborers in Anhui Province has increased by 20% compared with the past.

    华东和中南区普遍兴修农田水利
   【本报讯】华东、中南各地农民利用冬闲季节，大力兴修农田水利，争取今年增产更多的粮食，支援国家经济建设。据不完全统计，仅广东、福建、安徽三省修复和新建各种小型农田水利工程就有七万六千多处，受益田地（包括巩固原有工程及扩大工程的灌溉面积）在二千万亩以上。这些工程，大部都已开工，有的已经完成。安徽省目前参加小型农田水利冬修工程的农民有八十多万，他们预计在春种前完成五千九百多万土方，使一千二百多万亩农田减轻旱涝灾害和洪水威胁。山东省五百多项冬修水利工程已全部完工，完全恢复了去年汛期中被洪水破坏了的水利工程，使聊城、德州、莱阳、临沂、济宁、菏泽等专区三千多万亩农田在今年汛期中减少内涝和洪水的威胁。历城、临沂等县三十多万亩洼地，已作了沟洫畦田、挖排水沟等工程，也可基本免除内涝，变成良田。河南省北部各县水利兴修工作也大都完工，新乡专区修、挖的渠道有一百多条。信阳、罗山等六县已修好塘、堰一千七百多处，正在施工的还有一千五百多处。湖北省已有六十多个县全面地或部分地展开了兴修水利运动，湖南省滨湖各县堤垸岁修工程大半完工，山区和丘陵地带的小型水利工程也普遍动工。
    各地党、政机关对农田水利工作的领导，一般都很重视。很多地区的水利部门从去年八、九月间就派出工作组，进行勘测、调查，研究水旱涝灾发生情况，分析溪流特点，帮助群众订出切合实际的农田水利兴修计划。为了逐步解决兴修农田水利工程中的技术指导问题，各地除抽派一些技术干部深入区、乡加强指导外，广东、湖南、浙江、福建等省有七十多个县先后训练了农民水利技术人员五千五百多人。各地都是根据农民现有文化水平，运用实地参观、工地实习等边学边做的理论结合实际的教学方法，使农民初步懂得兴修水利的技术和指导施工的基本知识。训练过的农民，在今年兴修水利工程中起了很大的作用。
    各地人民政府还拨出大量资金，帮助农民解决兴修农田水利工程的经费困难。各地农民亲眼看到了几年来兴修农田水利的好处，也自筹了部分经费投入水利建设。广大农民学习总路线以后，看到了社会主义的美景，在兴修农田水利运动中都表现了高度的劳动热情，工作效率不断提高。如广东省英德县兴修江湾水库的农民，填土效率由每人每天零点九八公方增加到一点三八公方。安徽省一般民工的工作效率都比过去提高了百分之二十。
