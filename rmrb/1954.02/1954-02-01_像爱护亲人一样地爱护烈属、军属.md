Cherish the Families of Martyrs and Servicemen Like Our Own Relatives

"We will never let the hero's mother - Huang Jiguang's mother - encounter difficulties!"

Huang Jiguang's hometown, Jiguan Township in Zhongjiang County, Sichuan Province, was named a model township for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen in the entire district last year. Under the care and attention of the People's Government and the masses, the family of the martyr's mother, Huang, reaped an unprecedented harvest last year. Her 2.4 mu of paddy fields yielded an average of 750 jin per mu, an increase of 11 percent over the previous year.

Last spring, the People's Government, in order to take care of the production of Huang's family, sent her 2 million yuan in consolation money, 200 jin of oil cake (fertilizer) and a corn thresher. Huang added farm tools and fertilizer, and prepared for production. When transplanting seedlings, Hu Shidai, the leader of the mutual aid group, took the lead in transplanting seedlings for Huang. When Huang was in Beijing, Huang Jiguang's close comrades-in-arms and Gu Pingjun, the secretary of the Jiguan Township Party Branch, would visit her home every two or three days to help her take care of production and manage household affairs. Chang, the head of the 11th district, often visited her home to inquire about the production situation. During the autumn harvest, Gu Pingjun mobilized the masses to thresh rice for 53 families of martyrs and servicemen, and he personally harvested, threshed, and carried rice for Huang. After the autumn harvest, Huang Jiguang's youngest son, Huang Jishu, went to Chengdu to study, and there was a shortage of labor at home. The village's militiamen and youth immediately organized a farming team. Huang's house was old, and the People's Government allocated 4 million yuan to build a new house for her; the village's militiamen and youth carried firewood and burned tiles for her, and the new house was built in 20 days. Huang Jiguang's heroic deeds inspired the people of Jiguan Township, and they showed unparalleled love and respect for the hero's mother. They felt that being able to do something for Huang's family was the greatest glory, and they all said: "We will never let the hero's mother - Huang Jiguang's mother - encounter difficulties."

Love the Relatives of the Volunteers

One evening, the youngest son of Liu Shujun, a family member of the Chinese People's Volunteers living on Daping Zheng Street in the suburbs of Chongqing, accidentally fell on a stone while playing hide-and-seek and suffered a severe injury to his right kidney.

The neighbors were as anxious and concerned as if their own child had been injured. Li Shufang, the women's representative who was preparing dinner, immediately came to help take care of him. Xiong Xiuying, the preferential treatment committee member, was washing her hair, but she didn't wait for her hair to dry before rushing to the local People's Government to write a letter of introduction for Liu Shujun, so that the child could be treated in the city. When Liu Shujun took the child to the bus station, the passengers waiting at the station had already formed a long line. When the conductor and passengers learned that it was the child of a family member of the Volunteers who had been injured, they let her get on the bus first and competed to hold the child for her.

Wang Anding, the director of surgery at the Southwest Health Department's directly affiliated hospital, personally diagnosed Liu Shujun's child. The diagnosis determined that the child's right kidney was severely damaged and had to be removed. However, the mother was worried that the child was too young to withstand the surgery and hesitated. In order to save the child as soon as possible, the doctors and nurses patiently explained to her, and finally persuaded the mother. At this time, a neighbor brought her a certificate of free treatment from the district People's Government, and the resident section's preferential treatment committee lent her 300,000 yuan for pocket money. After the surgery, the little life of this Volunteer's relative was saved. Nine and a half days later, Liu Shujun smiled and helped her recovered child out of the hospital.

The care of the People's Government and the love of the masses deeply moved Liu Shujun, and she wrote a letter about this matter to her son in Korea.

(According to Xinhua News Agency)

"Your Work Ethic Inspired Me!"

In Qu County, Zhejiang Province, people are spreading the model deeds of shop worker Comrade Wang Shicheng in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen.

Regardless of day or night, rain or snow, Comrade Wang Shicheng visited and comforted the families of martyrs and servicemen whenever he had time, and learned about their living conditions. Once, Jiang Jinlian, the daughter of serviceman Jiang Yaofu, had a very severe sore on her foot and could not walk, so she asked Comrade Wang Shicheng for help. This day was the Dragon Boat Festival, and Comrade Wang Shicheng had not yet eaten lunch, but he immediately carried Jiang Jinlian on his back to the county Civil Affairs Department and the county hospital to negotiate medical treatment, and it was not until three or four in the afternoon that he finished the matter and went home to eat lunch. For example, Yu Zhijing, an old man in his sixties who was a family member of a serviceman, suddenly fell seriously ill, and his family was very anxious. After Comrade Wang Shicheng received this news, he rushed to find a doctor for him in the middle of the night, borrowed money to buy medicine for him, and personally decocted the medicine for him.

Comrade Wang Shicheng also paid attention to assisting the government in solving employment problems for family members of servicemen. For example, Mao Jishui's family of seven had difficulties in life. Comrade Wang Shicheng reported this situation to the government, and finally found a job for Mao Jishui. Now, Mao Jishui's family has solved the difficulties in life and has added new clothes.

Comrade Wang Shicheng can usually organize the masses to participate in preferential treatment work. He established a preferential treatment work group in the cotton textile industry trade union where he worked; under his influence, eight preferential treatment work groups and residential area preferential treatment work committees were established in Qu County. Now, Comrade Wang Shicheng has been elected as the deputy director of the Qu County Urban Area Preferential Treatment Work Committee and the Qu County Preferential Treatment Work Committee.

Wang Shicheng's exemplary actions have left a deep impression on people. Xu Yunmei, a family member of a serviceman, said: "The People's Government has cultivated a good comrade like Wang Shicheng. I must write a letter to my son and ask him to strive for meritorious service in Korea to repay the government's care for me." Volunteer soldier Ye Zhizhong said in his letter: "Your work ethic has inspired me and improved my work enthusiasm!" (Lin Jing)

"I Also Did My Bit!"

In Bishan County, Sichuan Province, one day, Huang Zaiting, the father of Huang Jiafu, a special-class meritorious volunteer of the Chinese People's Volunteers and a first-class blasting hero, was leading a fat and strong cow home. Unfortunately, the cow injured its foot on the way.

This cow was given to Huang Zaiting by the People's Government last spring after the news of Huang Jiafu's meritorious service on the Korean front reached the county. In February, when the green grass was just sprouting and there was a shortage of hay, he was given another 500,000 yuan in RMB. Huang Zaiting used this money to buy more than 400 jin of straw to feed the livestock. This time, he felt very uncomfortable when the cow injured its foot.

But as luck would have it, just as Huang Zaiting was anxious, a farmer he did not know came along, his name was Huang Dexu. He saw that the cow had injured its foot; he quickly washed the cow's foot and applied medicine. Before leaving, Huang Dexu insisted on not taking any reward, and only said: "I know you are the father of a hero, as long as you tell Jiafu, let him know that I have also done my bit, that is more precious than gold." (Ji Hui)

"This is What We Should Do!"

It was a Sunday evening, and the rain that had been falling all day had not stopped. In an office of the Nanjing Railway Trade Union sat an old man whose clothes were soaked, with a five- or six-year-old child standing beside him. He told his story in an anxious tone.

The old man was from Louzizhuang Village, Eighth District, Huang County, Shandong Province, named Wang Xiwu, and was a family member of a serviceman. His son worked in Songjiang County, Jiangsu. He and several fellow villagers went to Shanghai and wanted to visit his son in Songjiang County. When passing Pukou, his companions were separated, and he had no travel expenses (the money was in the baggage and was taken away by his companions). He was very anxious, and he accidentally fell and broke his scalp, and his grandson's shoes were also lost.

Comrade Huang Shaoqing, who was working in the office, stood up after hearing the old man's story and said kindly to the old man: "Now the railway is serving the people, and you are a family member of a serviceman, so we must take good care of you." Then he brought him a bowl of hot tea and took out 30,000 yuan from his pocket and handed it to the old man. Before the old man could reply, Xiao Liu brought a basin of hot water and asked him to wash his face, smiling and saying to the old man: "You really came to the right place, you have arrived at the home of the workers, ha..." Lao Zhang also called the passenger transport room and asked them to take good care of him. A female cadre walked out silently and found a pair of small cotton shoes in the home of a nearby railway worker and put them on the old man's grandson.

At this time, the old man was completely different from when he first came in. A smile began to appear on his worried face; the child snuggled in his arms, eating biscuits.

When the old man was about to leave, he took out a notebook from his pocket and asked the worker comrades to write down their addresses. He said: "Thank you for your help, I will definitely send the money back to you when I go back!" The comrades replied: "There is nothing to thank. You are a glorious family member of a serviceman, this is what we should do!" (Cao Zhijian)

    像爱护亲人一样地爱护烈属、军属
    “决不让英雄的母亲——黄继光妈妈碰到困难！”
    黄继光烈士的故乡——四川省中江县继光乡，去年被评为全区拥军优属模范乡。在人民政府和群众的关怀和照顾下，烈士的母亲——黄妈妈家去年获得了空前的丰收。她的二亩四分水稻田，平均每亩打了七百五十斤，比前年增产百分之十一。
    去年春天，人民政府为了照顾黄妈妈家的生产，送了她二百多万元慰问金、二百斤油枯（肥料）和一架包米脱粒机。黄妈妈添置了农具和肥料，做好了生产的准备。栽秧的时候，互助组组长胡世代抢先给黄妈妈栽秧。当黄妈妈到北京时，黄继光烈士生前亲密的战友和继光乡党支部书记顾平均，隔不上两、三天就要到她家去看看，帮她照管生产和料理家务。十一区区长常到她家去探问生产情况。秋收时，顾平均动员群众替五十三户烈属、军属打谷子，他自己也亲自替黄妈妈割谷、打谷、挑谷。秋收过后，黄妈妈的小儿子黄继恕到成都去上学，家里缺人干活，村里的民兵和青年马上就组织了代耕队。黄妈妈的房子旧了，人民政府拨了四百万元替她修新房子；村里的民兵和青年，都替她担柴、烧瓦，二十天内就把新房盖好了。黄继光烈士的英勇事迹鼓舞了继光乡的人民，他们对英雄的母亲表现了无比的热爱和尊敬。他们觉得能替黄妈妈家做点事就是最大的光荣，都表示：“决不让英雄的母亲——黄继光妈妈碰到困难。”　（群）
    热爱志愿军的亲人
    一天傍晚，住在重庆市郊大坪正街上的中国人民志愿军家属刘淑筠的小儿子在捉迷藏时不慎跌在石头上，右边肾脏受了重伤。
    左邻右舍就像自己的孩子受了伤一样地焦虑和关心。正在作晚饭的妇女代表李树芳，马上来帮着照顾。优抚委员熊秀英正在洗头发，也等不得头发吹干，马上赶到当地人民政府，替刘淑筠写介绍信，让孩子进城治疗。当刘淑筠抱着孩子到公共汽车站时，站上候车的乘客已经排成长长的行列。售票员和乘客们知道是志愿军家属的孩子跌伤时，都让她先上车，并且争着替她抱孩子。
    西南卫生部直属医院外科主任医师王安定亲自给刘淑筠的孩子诊断，诊断的结果确定孩子的右边肾脏受到严重损坏，必须割除。可是妈妈耽心孩子太小经不起开刀的手术，有点犹豫不定。医生和护士为了使孩子早点得救，耐心地给她解释，终于说服了这位妈妈。这时，邻居又替她带来了区人民政府的免费治疗证明书，居民段的优抚委员会又借给她三十万元的零用费。施行手术后，保住了这个志愿军亲人的小性命，九天半以后，刘淑筠笑嘻嘻地搀着已经痊愈了的孩子，走出医院大门。
    人民政府的关怀和群众的爱戴，使刘淑筠深受感动，她把这件事情写信告诉了在朝鲜的儿子。
                            （据新华社讯）
    “你的工作精神鼓舞了我！”
    在浙江省衢县人们传颂着店员工人汪世成同志拥军优属的模范事迹。
    汪世成同志不管白天黑夜，落雨下雪，只要一有空，他就到烈属军属家里去访问，慰问他们，了解他们的生活情况。有一次，军属蒋耀富的女儿蒋金莲脚上生了很厉害的疮，不能走路，要求汪世成同志给他帮助。这一天正是端午节，汪世成同志还没有吃中饭，马上背了蒋金莲到县民政科、县医院，交涉看病的事情，直到下午三四点钟把事情办好，他才回家吃中饭。又如，有一个六十多岁的军属余之敬老公公，突然生了很严重的病，一家人都很着急。汪世成同志得到这个消息以后，半夜赶去给他找医生看病，借钱给他买药，并且亲自给他煎药。
    汪世成同志还注意协助政府为军属解决职业问题。例如，军属毛吉水一家七口人，生活上有困难。汪世成同志就把这个情况向政府反映，终于给毛吉水找到了工作。现在，毛吉水一家人，解决了生活上的困难，都添上了新衣服。
    汪世成同志平时能组织群众参加优抚工作，他在自己所在的棉布业工会里，成立了优抚工作组；在他的影响下，衢县城区先后成立了八个优抚工作组，和居民区优抚工作委员会。现在，汪世成同志被大家推选为衢县城区优抚工作委员会和衢县优抚工作委员会的副主任。
    汪世成的模范行动给人们留下了深刻的印象。军属徐云妹说：“人民政府培养了像汪世成这样的好同志，我一定要写信给儿子，要他在朝鲜争取立功，来回答政府对我的关怀。”志愿军战士叶志中在信上说：“你的工作精神鼓舞了我，提高了我的工作积极性！”（林静）
    “我也尽了一点心意！”
    在四川省璧山县，有一天，中国人民志愿军特等功臣、一级爆破英雄黄家富的父亲黄再廷，牵着一条又肥又壮的牛向家走。真不幸，在半路上牛伤了脚。
    这条牛是去年春天，黄家富在朝鲜前线的立功喜讯传到县里后，人民政府送给黄再廷的。二月间，当青草刚刚发芽、干草缺乏的时候，又给他送来了五十万元人民币。黄再廷就用这笔钱买了四百多斤谷草，饲养牲口。这次，牛伤了脚，他感到难受透了。
    可是事情说来也巧，正当黄再廷焦急的时候，来了一个不相识的农民，他的名字叫黄德勖。他看牛伤了脚；赶紧给牛洗了脚，上了药。临行时，黄德勖坚持不要任何报酬，只是说：“我知道你是英雄的父亲，只要你告诉家富一声，让他晓得我也尽了一点心意，那就比金子都还贵重。”（吉汇）
    “这是我们应该做的事！”
    那是一个星期天的傍晚，下了一整天的雨还没有停止。在南京铁路工会的一间办公室里坐着一位衣服湿透了的老人，身边站着一个五六岁的孩子。他用焦急的口吻诉说着他的遭遇。
    老人是山东省黄县第八区楼子庄村人，名叫王希武，是个军属。他的儿子在江苏松江县工作。他和几位同乡一同去上海，想到松江县看看儿子。过浦口时，同伴失散，身边没有路费（钱放在包袱里，被同伴带走了），他心里非常着急，一不小心摔了一跤，跌破了头皮，孙子的鞋子也掉了。
    正在办公室工作的黄少卿同志听到老人的诉说后，站了起来，亲切地对老人说：“现在铁路就是为人民服务的，你是军属，我们更要很好地照顾你。”接着给他端来了一碗滚热的茶，从口袋里摸出三万元交给了老人。没等老人回话，小刘又打来一盆热水要他洗脸，笑着对老人说：“你真来得好啊，你到了工人的家里，哈……”老章又给客运室打了电话，要他们很好地照顾。一个女干部一声不响地走出去，到附近的铁路工人家里找了一双小棉鞋，给老人的孙子穿。
    这时，老人和刚进来时完全不一样了，他那发愁的面孔上开始出现了笑容；孩子偎依在他的怀里，吃着饼干。
    老人临行时，从衣袋里掏出了笔记本，要工人同志们把地址写下来。他说：“谢谢大家对我的帮助，回去后我一定把钱寄还你们！”同志们回答：“没有什么好谢的。你是光荣的军属，这是我们应该做的事！”（曹志坚）
