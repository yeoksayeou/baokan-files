	Prosperous and Happy Peaceful Democratic Country
	Factories and Collective Farms
	Soviet Union　Pǔ Bié Liè Wū Sī Jī
	Near Moscow is a factory famous throughout the Soviet Union—the State-owned First Kaganovich Bearing Factory. In our industrialized century, without the exquisite products produced by this factory, without ball bearings, roller bearings, and other bearings, it would be difficult to imagine the development of complex and diverse technical equipment. Various machine tools, automobiles, and tens of thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, and other machines working in the fields of collective farms all require these shiny, extremely delicate, and high-quality steel bearings.
	The Kaganovich Bearing Factory has never broken its connection with the countryside, and has provided assistance to the countryside during all stages of collective farm construction. Although the methods of assistance have differed in different periods, in any case, they have all been for a great purpose—to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, which is the strong and unshakable foundation of the Soviet system.
	Now Soviet workers are strengthening their assistance to farmers. They unanimously and enthusiastically support the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on "Measures for Further Developing Soviet Agriculture." All the staff and workers of the Kaganovich Bearing Factory believe that it is their duty to strive to achieve this extremely important task.
	A. Ovcharova, a lathe operator in the ball bearing workshop, treats the tasks put forward by the Party and the government with this attitude. She said at a meeting:
	"Further developing agriculture is a matter of vital importance to all Soviet people. Our factory manufactures bearings for tractors, combine harvesters, and automobiles; our duty is to help tractor manufacturers produce at least 750,000 tractors for the country in three or four years."
	Now the workers of this factory are striving not to waste every minute of work, enthusiastically paying attention to the achievements of advanced workers, and adopting their experience. They have accepted a large number of orders to manufacture parts and components for the double-row potato digging combine harvesters produced by agricultural machinery factories. This is a glorious order, and the workers have held brief production meetings to decide to complete this task ahead of schedule.
	The workers of the Kaganovich Bearing Factory not only help the countryside with Stakhanovite labor in the factory, but also many people are thinking of going to machine tractor stations and collective farms to work. Engineer Kostyuk has gone to the Vlachivsk Machine Tractor Station in the Lukhovitsky District to serve as the stationmaster. I. Yefremov, the foreman of the factory, has also gone to the "Red Dawn" Collective Farm to serve as the chairman. The task of building communism—creating an abundance of agricultural products—urgently needs to be solved now, so how many workers, engineers, technicians, young and old Communist Party members, and non-Party workers are anxiously waiting to be sent to the countryside!
	Not long ago, Gisenko, a fitter in the ball bearing workshop, went to the factory Party committee to make a request. Gisenko is a member of the Communist Youth League and a graduate of a technical school. He has a solemn face and speaks calmly and powerfully, yet unhurriedly. As if reasoning with himself, he said to the people of the Party committee:
	"Why shouldn't I respond to the Party's call and go to a machine tractor station? They also need fitters there!"
	"Which machine tractor station would you like to go to?" the people of the Party committee asked him.
	"Wherever a machine tractor station needs people, I will go there!" he replied simply.

	The Kaganovich Bearing Factory has voluntarily helped the Vlachivsk Machine Tractor Station and three collective farms in the Lukhovitsky District for more than a year. Sometimes Party workers help the tractor drivers and combine harvester drivers of the machine tractor station to launch competitions, sometimes the amateur art troupes of the factory's cultural palace come to perform; sometimes propagandists give them reports, sometimes experts assist them in organizing labor and using machines more rationally.
	The chairmen and stationmasters of the assisted farms and machine tractor stations also often visit their friends in this factory. Not long ago, F. Ganelarov, the chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm and a hero of socialist labor, visited this factory. He visited the various workshops, met with the workers, learned about the production situation, and finally reported on the achievements and shortcomings of their collective farm to the worker brothers through the radio.
	The farm led by Ganelarov is in the village of Dezhinov, an advanced large livestock farm located in the Oka River Basin. Dairy farming is very developed here, which has greatly benefited the farm. The farm has more than 700 cattle, including 360 dairy cows. This farm also pays great attention to the development of vegetable cultivation. In the autumn of 1953, the Kaganovich Bearing Factory sent a work team to the collective farm to help build greenhouses and hotbeds. I visited this building, which can be said to be a building of the collective farm, or a building of the factory.
	The farm's vice-chairman, S. Chichitov, accompanied us on the visit. We visited the farm's club and the ten-year school. Just as the students were having a break after class, the children were jumping and playing, very lively. We also visited the large livestock pen, which was as spacious as an asphalt road. Now the project is coming to an end, automatic drinking troughs have been installed, and overhead passages for transporting feed and manure are being erected. From this livestock pen, there are green storage towers filled with fresh feed, the spacious and bright "Red Corner" club, dormitories, and a new garden surrounded by neat fences—all of this is very comfortable and convenient, all for a long and beautiful life.
	Then we went to the farm's grassland, a vast depression. On the grassland stood piles of hay, like brown hats of giants. When we approached the village, we saw that a large area of this vast land was surrounded by new embankments. Outside the embankments, a bulldozer with three buckets was working. This machine was sent by the Kaganovich Bearing Factory, and the bulldozer operator, S. Orekhov, was also sent from the factory. The embankments here are two and a half kilometers long, and the purpose of building these embankments is to prevent the farm's new greenhouses from being flooded by the spring floods of the Oka River.
	Standing on the embankment, the metal frame of the greenhouse, the stone wall of the boiler, the parallel concrete seats for installing the hotbed frames, and the warm ditches are all clearly visible. The greenhouse project is about to be completed, and the project director said that this is only the first batch of projects.
	The project director said to me: "Our first greenhouse vegetable garden will have a 332-square-meter greenhouse, 1,000 hotbed frames, and a shed for placing peat humus blocks. Next time, we will build two more greenhouses and expand the hotbed frames to 4,250. What a large indoor vegetable garden!"
	"What a wonderful thing!" echoed the project director, Dunaev.
	These two people have been working at the factory since the Kaganovich Bearing Factory was built. When Dunaev first entered the factory, he was still a novice, but now he has become a foreman. Today, both of them are experienced production experts, leading the work of important production sections of the factory, and both have joined the Party.
	Along with them to build the construction site are twenty workers of various trades, such as lathe operator V. Frolov, metal appraisal worker A. Brezhnev, model worker V. Krupin (member of the Communist Youth League), and welding worker L. Galinin. The work here is suitable for each of them. And they all think that these jobs are glorious, beneficial to the people, and beneficial to themselves. They all say: "We are building workshops for producing abundant food! We are working in the fresh air."
	On the way back to Moscow, I stopped by the Party committee of the Lukhovitsky District. O. Demyanchaeva, the secretary of the district committee, had just sent away a group of Communist Youth League members who had just come from the Zhdanov District of Moscow. They were going to the collective farms to carry out work with the Communist Youth League members. I asked Demyanchaeva if the help from the comrades from the factory was enough for the district, and what requirements the district had for them. She said:
	"Our friendship is long-standing and strong. But we also hope that the enterprises in the Zhdanov District, including the Kaganovich Bearing Factory, will give us more cadres. In the factory, you can find many Party members and non-Party workers who are knowledgeable about agriculture. For example, the Kaganovich Bearing Factory sent us I. N. Yefremov. What a good chairman of the collective farm! However, they are reluctant to let go of some of their capable people. And what does the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party say?..."
	So she picked up a booklet from the table and read a passage that she had emphasized in Comrade Khrushchev's report:
	"Under the current circumstances, the socialist city helping the collective farm countryside with cadres is one of the important forms of further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance—the unshakable foundation of the strength of Soviet society."

    繁荣幸福的和平民主国家
    工厂和集体农庄
    苏联　普·别略夫斯基
    在莫斯科的附近有一座闻名苏联全国的工厂——国营第一卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂。在我们这个工业化的世纪中，如果没有这个工厂所出产的精巧产品，没有球轴承、滚珠轴承和其他轴承，要发展复杂的、各式各样的技术设备，是难以想像的。工厂的各种车床、汽车、在集体农庄田野上工作的成千成万架拖拉机、收割联合机和别的机器，都少不了这种闪闪发光、极其精巧细致的、用优质钢制造的各种轴承。
    卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂从来没有和农村中断过联系，在集体农庄建设的各个阶段中都给农村以帮助。虽说在各个不同的时期援助方式是不同的，但在任何情况之下都是为了一个伟大的目的——巩固工农联盟，这是苏维埃制度之所以强有力的不可动摇的基础。
    现在苏联工人们正在加强对农民的帮助。他们一致热烈拥护苏共中央九月全体会议“关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施”的决议。卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂的全体职工认为，努力实现这一极其重要的任务，是他们的职责。
    滚珠轴承车间的车工阿·奥夫查罗娃，就是以这种态度来对待党和政府所提出的任务的。她在一个会议上说：
    “进一步发展农业，是全体苏联人民的切身事情。我们工厂为拖拉机、收割联合机和汽车制造着轴承；我们的职责就是帮助拖拉机制造者在三、四年内给全国出产至少七十五万架拖拉机。”
    现在这个工厂的工人竭力不浪费每一分钟的工作时间，热心地注视着先进工作者的成就，并采用他们的经验。他们接受了一大批定货，为农业机械厂所出产的双行马铃薯挖掘联合机制造零件和部件。这是光荣的定货，工人们已举行了简短的生产会议，决定提前完成这个任务。
    卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂的工人们不仅在厂内以斯大哈诺夫式的劳动来帮助农村，而且还有不少人想到机器拖拉机站和集体农庄去担任工作。工程师柯斯秋克已到卢霍维采区的弗拉契夫斯克机器拖拉机站去担任站长了。该厂的领班伊·叶弗列摩夫也到
  “红色曙光”集体农庄去担任主席。建设共产主义的任务——创造丰裕的农产品的任务现在急待解决，因此有多少的工人、工程师、技术人员、年轻的年老的共产党员工人和非党工人，怀着焦急的心情在等待着被派到农村去啊！
    不久以前，滚珠轴承车间的钳工吉森科到工厂党委会去提出要求。吉森科是一个青年团员，是从技术学校毕业的。他长着一副庄重的面孔，说话沉静有力，而又从容不迫。他好像跟自己论理似地向党委会的人说：
      “我为什么不响应党的号召，也到机器拖拉机站去呢？那儿也须要钳工啊！”
    “那您愿意到哪个机器拖拉机站去呢？”党委会的人问他。
    “哪一个机器拖拉机站需要人，就到哪里去！”他简捷地回答道。
                ×　×　×
    卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂自愿帮助弗拉契夫斯克机器拖拉机站和卢霍维采区的三个集体农庄已非一年了。有时是党的工作者帮助机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手和收割联合机手们展开竞赛，有时是该厂文化宫的业余艺术团体来表演；有时是宣传员对他们作报告，有时是专家们协助他们组织劳动，更合理地使用机器。
    被帮助的农庄和机器拖拉机站的主席和站长们，也常常去拜访这个工厂里的朋友们。不久以前，斯大林集体农庄主席、社会主义劳动英雄费·甘涅拉洛夫访问了这个工厂。他参观了各个车间，跟工人们会晤了，了解了生产情况，最后还从广播中向工人兄弟们报告了他们集体农庄的成绩和缺点。
    甘涅拉洛夫领导的农庄在杰其诺夫村，这是一个位于奥卡河流域的先进的大饲畜场。这里的乳牛饲养业非常发达，使农庄获利很多。农庄拥有七百多头牛，其中乳牛有三百六十头。这个农庄也十分注意发展蔬菜种植。一九五三年秋，卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂派了一个工作队到集体农庄去帮助建设温室温床。我曾经参观了这个建筑，它可以说是集体农庄的建筑，也可以说是工厂的建筑。
    农庄的副主席谢·契契托夫陪同我们去参观。我们参观了农庄的俱乐部、十年制学校。刚好学生们下课休息，孩子们正在蹦蹦跳跳，十分热闹。我们还参观了大饲畜栏，里边简直宽敞得像条柏油路。现在工程就要结束了，自动饮水槽已经安装好了，正在架设输送饲料和畜粪的架空道。从这个饲畜栏过去，是装满新鲜饲料的贮青塔、宽敞明亮的
  “红角”俱乐部、宿舍和围着整齐的栏杆的新花园，——所有这一切，都是非常舒适方便的，都是为了长久的美好的生活。
    接着我们走进农庄的草原，这是一片茫茫的洼地。在草原上屹立着一堆一堆的干草，宛如巨人的褐色帽子。我们走到靠近村落的时候，才看出在这广阔的土地上有很大一块地方围着新土堤。在土堤的外面，正有一部装着三个斗的平土机在工作着。这部机器是卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂送来的，平土机手谢·奥列霍夫也是从该厂派来的。这里的土堤共长两公里半，建筑这条土堤是为了使农场的新温室不致被奥卡河的春汛所淹没。
    站在土堤上面，温室的金属架、锅炉的石墙、安置温床架的平行的混凝土座和暖沟等等都历历在目。温室的工程就要完成了，而工程主任说这还不过是第一批工程。
    工地主任对我说：“我们的第一个温室菜园将有一个三百三十二平方公尺的温室，一千个温床架，一个泥炭腐植泥块安放棚。下一次我们还要再建两个温室，把温床架扩充到四千二百五十个。真是好大的一个室内菜园子啊！”
    “真是多妙的事情啊！”工程主任杜纳耶夫附和着说。
    这两个人从卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂建厂之日起就在工厂工作。杜纳耶夫初进厂的时候还是个生手，但现在他已经当上了领班。今天他们两个都是有经验的生产能手，领导着工厂重要生产工段的工作，并且都已入党。
    跟他们一块来建筑工地的还有二十位各种工种的工人，如镟工弗·弗罗洛夫、金属鉴定工人亚·布列日涅夫、模型工人伏·克鲁平（青年团员）、焊接工人列·加里宁等人。这里的工作对他们每一个人都很合适。而他们也都认为这些工作是光荣的，既有益于人民，也有利于自己。他们都说：“我们在建造着生产丰裕食物的车间！我们在新鲜的空气中工作。”
    在回莫斯科的途中，我顺便到卢霍维采区的党委会去走了一趟。区委书记奥·杰米扬柴娃刚刚送走一批才从莫斯科日丹诺夫区来的青年团员们。他们是到各集体农庄来向青年团员们进行工作的。我问杰米扬柴娃，工厂来的同志们对本区的帮助够不够，区里对他们有什么要求。她说：
    “我们的友谊是悠久的、牢固的。但是我们还希望日丹诺夫区的各企业，包括卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂在内，再多给我们一些干部。在工厂是可以找到许多对农业内行的党员工人和非党工人的。举例说吧，卡冈诺维奇轴承工厂给我们派来了伊·尼·叶弗列摩夫。这是一个多么好的集体农庄主席啊！不过，他们还有些得力的人手不肯放。而苏共中央全会的决议讲的是什么呢？……”
    于是她就顺手从桌上拿起一本小册子来，念了
  一段她在赫鲁晓夫同志报告中着重划出来的话：
      “在目前的情况下，社会主义城市以干部帮助集体农庄乡村，是进一步加强工农联盟——苏维埃社会力量的不可动摇的基础——的重要形式之一。”
