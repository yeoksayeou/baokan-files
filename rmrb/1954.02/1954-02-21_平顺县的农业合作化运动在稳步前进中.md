    The Agricultural Cooperative Movement in Pingshun County is Advancing Steadily
    Li Lin, Secretary of the Pingshun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Focus on Pilot Projects, Gradually Expand
    In April 1951, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, piloted its first agricultural production cooperative – the Guo Yu'en Cooperative in Chuandi Village. At that time, some advanced emancipated peasants resolutely supported the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation and were willing to further organize themselves. They said: "We were emancipated through the land reform by listening to what Chairman Mao said. We harvested more grain by organizing. Following the Party's call is always right. Let's do it!" But some peasants did not understand or were not used to this kind of production organization. Some said: "Chuandi Village has gone communist! They're pooling everything together! We're going to eat from a big pot soon!" Some peasants from nearby villages secretly went to Chuandi Village to inquire. Some said: "Even real brothers can't get along. How can seven or eight families work together?" In addition, landlords and rich peasants took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage. Some peasants even divided their families; some even sold their livestock and sheep at low prices and began to eat and drink extravagantly. But soon, the facts changed their views. When the autumn harvest came, the Guo Yu'en Cooperative averaged 423 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 32.7 percent over 1950, 19.4 percent higher than the "strong" mutual aid group in the village, and 44 percent higher than individual farmers. At this time, the peasants in Chuandi Village concluded: individual households are not as good as mutual aid groups, and mutual aid groups are not as good as cooperatives. People from nearby villages who saw it with their own eyes also began to believe it.
    In 1952, according to the principle of focusing on pilot projects, ten cooperatives were piloted in the whole county (one or two in each district). The results of the pilot projects showed that the ten cooperatives averaged 517 jin per mu, an increase of 71.7 percent over 1951, 77 percent higher than the output of mutual aid groups in the same year, and 125 percent higher than the output of individual farmers in the same year. This fact further told the peasants: agricultural production cooperatives can indeed produce more grain. The members praised the agricultural production cooperatives as "money trees" and "treasure bowls." The masses outside the Yanggao Village cooperative said: "The cooperative is a banner. We must follow it. We will do a good job in the mutual aid group this year, and we will also set up a cooperative next year." At that time, more than 500 mutual aid groups in the county asked to be converted into cooperatives. Some set them up automatically without approval. They said: "Even if the leaders don't approve it and call it a 'mutual aid group,' we will run it like a cooperative." The Ma Haixin mutual aid group in Xigou Village, with its strong labor force, was the least convinced of the cooperative. But when the Li Shunda mutual aid group was converted into a cooperative, the members secretly competed with the cooperative. However, they could not compare with the cooperative in spring plowing. After the sowing was completed, they asked to join the cooperative. They said: "The cooperative is a train, the mutual aid group is a car, and the individual household is an ox cart. Communist Party members are the locomotives, leading us to the new society."
    The agricultural production cooperatives had won victories in pilot projects for two consecutive years, and more and more people asked to set up cooperatives. By 1953, the number had increased to 140. Except for some that were temporarily suspended due to insufficient conditions, 110 cooperatives were formally established. Although they suffered severe attacks from various natural disasters, all 110 cooperatives still increased production. The average yield increased by 14.8 percent over 1952, 20.5 percent more than mutual aid groups, and 46.5 percent more than individual farmers. Among the 3,410 members of the 110 cooperatives, 3,275 households exceeded their income before joining the cooperative; some of them exceeded it several times. Difficult households among the members, such as widowers, widows, and the lonely with no labor force, also received appropriate care. After the autumn harvest distribution, those who planned to withdraw from the cooperative did not withdraw, and those who had already withdrawn regretted it. At first, some women wanted to divorce in order to join the cooperative; now, some girls, when choosing a partner, ask, "Is his family in the cooperative?" as a standard for measuring the other party's progress.
    Party Organizations at All Levels Attach Importance to Leadership
    The Party organizations at the county, district, and village levels in Pingshun County all attached great importance to the leadership of the agricultural production cooperatives. When the pilot projects began in 1951, according to the requirement of "only allowing them to be run well, not allowing them to be run poorly," the county party committee personally led the work, selected strong and capable cadres to be stationed in the cooperatives to help, and often organized the main cadres of each district to visit the pilot cooperatives. In 1952, each district was responsible for the pilot projects by the district party secretary, the district head, and other main cadres. In most of the villages, the branch secretary personally led and served concurrently as the director of the cooperative. In the process of piloting, all party members were constantly educated, requiring each rural party member to become a "propagandist, organizer, and encourager to lead peasants to organize," so that a large number of party members, league members, and activists became the strong backbone of leading the cooperatives, leading the "big family" selflessly. Most party members, like Guo Yu'en, the party branch secretary of Chuandi Village, realized that the responsibility of Communist Party members is to ensure that every piece of land is cultivated well and that more grain is produced when the masses put their land into the cooperative. Only in this way will the masses be satisfied.
    The Pingshun County Party Organization adhered to the principle of "active leadership and steady progress," constantly correcting and preventing "left" or right tendencies, curbing the growth of spontaneous capitalist forces within the Party, and carrying out the struggle on two ideological fronts. In the spring of 1952, in light of the growth of right-leaning thoughts among some people within the Party, the report of Comrade Gao Gang on the direction of rural economic development was universally organized for study. After the study, more than 500 party members in the county joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After opposing the right-leaning, in the winter of 1952, a mood of impetuosity and adventurism appeared. In the spring of 1953, according to the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production, the county party committee not only paid attention to correcting the mood of impetuosity and adventurism, but also opposed the tendency of stagnation. In June, each district held a party member conference, commended good party members who actively led the peasants to take the socialist road, criticized party members who relaxed leadership over mutual aid and cooperation, and even punished individual degenerate bad elements who were seriously influenced by capitalist ideas, so that all party members further clarified the ideological boundaries and actively led the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    The Pingshun County Party Organization also regularly conducted socialist future education among the broad masses of peasants, encouraged the enthusiasm of peasants for mutual aid and cooperation, promoted the growth of socialist factors, and steadily implemented the socialist transformation of agriculture. The small-scale peasant economy has a long history and habits, but the peasants are unfamiliar with the socialist road. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen education on the socialist future and combine this education with the practical interests of the peasants. Pingshun is an old revolutionary base area. When formulating a three-year construction plan in 1951, the masses lacked confidence. Introducing the Soviet film "Spring in the Mountains" ("Sagen's Spring") to the masses encouraged everyone to build the mountains, and actively acted under Chairman Mao's call to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," which greatly promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the spring of 1952, the report of Comrade Gao Gang on the direction of rural economic development was universally studied; in the autumn, Li Shunda made a report to the broad masses on his visit to the Soviet Union; in the spring of 1953, the report of Comrade Deng Zihui on "the basic tasks and principles and policies of rural work" was studied. These had a great impact on the development and consolidation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The broad masses of peasants believed that Comrade Gao Gang's report pointed out the direction and was a "key to happiness." After listening to Li Shunda's report on his visit to the Soviet Union, "learning from the Soviet Union" became a conscious demand of the masses. Each village ordered a five-year construction plan and actively did a good job in mutual aid groups and cooperatives. After vigorously carrying out the propaganda and education of the general line, the enthusiasm of the peasants to take the socialist road became even greater, and their confidence became even higher.
    Rely on the Masses to Run Cooperatives Together
    The emergence of agricultural production cooperatives caused a series of changes in rural areas and brought many new problems to be solved. This is a mass movement, and it is necessary to rely on the practice of the masses to guide the movement and combine the spirit of the policy with the local actual situation. When we started the pilot projects, we paid attention to the selection of different regions and different production conditions. The first pilot project was carried out in Chuandi Village, the advanced village in the county. In 1952, it was promoted in key villages or base villages in each district. There were typical examples in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and cash crops, so as to provide classified guidance. The county party committee directly controlled three key cooperatives, and each district also controlled one or two key cooperatives. After two or three years of key cultivation, they all gained some experience and lessons. These old cooperatives then contacted the surrounding new cooperatives in groups, and general problems could be solved for them. In the spring of 1953, most of the new cooperatives had just been converted from mutual aid groups into cooperatives. How to assess production, how to plan production, how to organize labor, where to send fertilizer, what to plant in those lands, etc., a lot of problems were raised. Some cooperative directors could not command, were worried, and cried; some ran to Chuandi Village to find Guo Yu'en. According to this situation, the county party committee convened a mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting. Guo Yu'en introduced the experience of management, and introduced how he became the director of the cooperative; Wu Houli introduced the methods to comprehensively increase income; Shen Jilan introduced the experience of mobilizing women to participate in production, and Liu Chunyou introduced how he became an accountant. This solved everyone's problems in a timely manner, and allowed the new cooperatives to avoid detours. Later, this method was also used in spring plowing production and autumn harvest distribution, and the effect was very good.
    In 1951 and 1952, there were not many cooperatives in the pilot projects, and capable cadres could be selected to work full-time on the pilot projects. By 1953, the number of cooperatives had increased from ten to one hundred and ten, an increase of more than ten times, and it was difficult to send full-time cadres. Some cadres in the district could not run cooperatives, and many problems ran to the county party committee for solution, which was also impossible. The county party committee adopted the policy of "strengthening the specific leadership of the district party committee, giving play to the role of all cadres, coordinating the actions of all systems, and running cooperatives together." All cadres worked hard to study and strengthened specific leadership, which was an important factor in the success of all cooperatives in 1953.
    Agricultural production cooperatives are new things, and the quality of their operation has a great impact on the masses. Cooperatives must not relax their leadership over mutual aid groups, and even less can they discriminate against the masses outside the cooperatives, especially individual farmers. All cooperatives in the county contacted mutual aid groups in their own villages or nearby villages, invited them to participate in the formulation of production plans and various important activities, and organized observations to enable them to see the superiority of cooperatives from concrete facts. They also helped them solve difficulties in production. For example, the Yanggao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative often helped the masses outside the cooperative in terms of agricultural tools, draught animals, and manpower, which had a very good impact on the masses and laid a good foundation for the establishment of new cooperatives and the expansion of old cooperatives in the future.
    Full of Confidence, Continue to Advance
    By the winter of 1953, more than 25,000 peasant households in Pingshun County had been organized into mutual aid and cooperation teams, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total peasant households; 110 agricultural production cooperatives had more than 3,400 households, accounting for 11.8 percent of the total peasant households. However, we are not satisfied with this. The county party committee summarized the experience of running cooperatives for three years, analyzed the conditions for further developing agricultural production cooperatives, and believed that it was both necessary and possible, and the potential was great. The favorable conditions for developing cooperatives in our county at present are: First, the propaganda and education of the general line has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to organize and improve the socialist consciousness of the peasants. Second, there is a strong mutual aid and cooperation team and a foundation of more than ten years of organization. The broad masses of peasants have realized from their own experience that the road instructed by the Party and Chairman Mao is correct. Third, we have gained experience and lessons in the pilot project work over the past three years. Agricultural production cooperatives have gained prestige among the masses and have close ties with the masses. In particular, labor models such as Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Shen Jilan, and Wu Houli are flags, leading the broad masses of peasants forward. Fourth, the cadres have been trained and tested in the process of running cooperatives for three years. The strong party organization leads, and the broad masses of party members, league members, and activists have become guides on the socialist road and have become the strong backbone for the development of agricultural production cooperatives. All of these have laid a good foundation for the continued development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the future.
    Based on these circumstances, we are full of confidence in victory. We must vigorously develop mutual aid and cooperative organizations, consolidate, improve, and appropriately expand old cooperatives, and actively and steadily develop new cooperatives, and gradually improve temporary mutual aid groups into perennial groups and turn good mutual aid groups into cooperatives. We must run agricultural production cooperatives with a large number and good quality.
    In 1953, the average grain yield per mu of cultivated land in the county was 236 jin and 11 liang. The state-owned county farm produced an average of 651 jin of grain per mu; the agricultural production cooperative produced an average of 312 jin and 2 liang of grain per mu; the mutual aid group produced an average of 233 jin of grain per mu; and the individual household produced an average of 199 jin of grain. According to the average yield of the county, each farmer can have 500 jin of grain. If it is raised to the yield of agricultural production cooperatives with higher yields (more than 450 jin per mu), the income of each farmer can be increased from 500 jin to 1,000 jin; if it can reach the level of the farm, each person can have 1,500 jin of grain. In the future, with the use of machines and chemical fertilizers, the increase in production will be even greater. All sensible peasants clearly realize that only by taking the road of collectivization and supporting national industrialization can the peasants be freed from poverty forever and can it be guaranteed that everyone will take the road to prosperity. Now, under the illumination and encouragement of the general line, the broad masses of peasants in Pingshun County are actively running cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and are advancing on the socialist road!

    平顺县的农业合作化运动在稳步前进中
    中共平顺县委书记　李琳
    重点试办，逐步展开
    山西省平顺县一九五一年四月试办了第一个农业生产合作社——川底村郭玉恩社。当时，一些先进的翻身农民坚决拥护党的互助合作政策，愿意进一步组织起来。他们说：听了毛主席的话，土地改革翻了身，组织起来多打了粮，听党的号召永没错，干吧。可也有些农民对这种生产组织的改变还不了解、不习惯，有的说：“川底村共产啦！合伙啦！快吃大锅饭了呀！”附近村里有些农民偷偷地跑到川底村去打听。有的说：“亲弟兄还合不来，七家八伙合到一块怎能弄成？”再加上地主富农趁机造谣破坏，有的农民就把家分开了；甚至有个别的把牲口羊群贱价卖了，大吃大喝起来。但是不久，事实就改变了他们的看法。到秋收上来，郭玉恩社平均每亩收到四百二十三斤粮，比一九五○年多收百分之三十二点七，比本村“兵强马壮”的好互助组多收百分之十九点四，比单干农民多收百分之四十四。这时，川底村的农民做出了结论：单干户不如互助组，互助组不如合作社。附近村里亲眼看到的人也都开始相信了。
    一九五二年，根据重点试办的原则，在全县试办了十个社（每区有一个到两个）。试办的结果，十个社平均每亩收到五百一十七斤，比一九五一年增产了百分之七十一点七，比互助组同年的产量高百分之七十七，比单干农民同年的产量高百分之一百二十五。这个事实进一步告诉农民：农业生产合作社确实能多打粮。社员们歌颂农业生产合作社“好比摇钱树”、“好比聚宝盆”；阳高村社外的群众说：合作社是杆旗，我们要向他看齐，今年搞好互助组，明年咱也要办社。当时全县就有五百多个互助组要求转社。有的没经批准便自动办起来了，他们说：领导不批准，叫成“互助组”也行，咱可要照着合作社的样子来办。西沟村马海心互助组，劳力强壮，是最不相信合作社的；当李顺达互助组转社以后，组员们暗地里和合作社比赛。可是，在春耕生产中，怎样也比不上合作社；到下种结束，就要求入社了。他们说：合作社是火车，互助组是汽车，单干户是牛车。共产党员是火车头，领导咱们往新社会走。
    农业生产合作社一连两年试办胜利了，要求办社的就越来越多了。到一九五三年，发展到一百四十个社。除了一些条件不够的暂时停办外，正式建立了一百一十个社。虽然遭受到各种自然灾害的严重袭击，可是一百一十个合作社仍然全都增产了。平均产量比一九五二年增加百分之一十四点八，比互助组多百分之二十点五，比单干农民多百分之四十六点五。一百一十个社的三千四百一十户社员中，有三千二百七十五户超过了入社前的收入；其中有的超过了好几倍。社员中鳏寡孤独无劳力的困难户也得到了适当的照顾。秋收分配后，打算退社的人不退了，已经退社的也后悔了。一开始，为了入社，有的妇女要离婚；现在有些姑娘选对象时却要打听“他家在社不在？”作为衡量对方进步不进步的一条标准了。
    各级党的组织重视领导
    平顺县县、区、村各级党的组织都很重视对农业生产合作社的领导。一九五一年开始试办时，根据“只许办好，不许办坏”的要求，县委亲自领导，挑选了坚强得力的干部驻社帮助，并经常组织各区主要干部到试办社去参观。一九五二年各区都由区委书记、区长等主要干部负责试办，村里绝大部分是支部书记亲自领导、兼任社长。在试办的过程中，又不断地教育全体党员，要求每个农村党员都能成为“领导农民组织起来的宣传者、组织者、鼓舞者”，使大批的党员和团员、积极分子成为领导合作社的坚强骨干，大公无私地领导“闹大人家”。多数党员都和川底村党支部书记郭玉恩一样认识：群众把土地入到社里，共产党员的责任就是要保证把群众的每一块土地种好，多打粮食。只有这样，群众才会满意。
    平顺县党组织坚持“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，不断地纠正和防止“左”或右的倾向，制止党内资本主义自发势力的滋长，开展两条思想战线的斗争。一九五二年春天，根据党内有些人右倾思想滋长的情况，普遍组织学习了高岗同志关于农村经济发展方向的报告。学习后，全县有五百多个党员加入了互助合作组织。在反对右倾之后，一九五二年冬季又出现了急躁冒进的情绪。一九五三年春天，县委根据中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议，既注意纠正了急躁冒进情绪，也反对了稳步不前的倾向。六月份，各区召开党员大会，表扬了积极领导农民走社会主义道路的好党员，批评了对互助合作放松领导的党员，还处分了个别受资本主义思想影响严重以致蜕化的坏分子，使全体党员进一步划清了思想界限，积极领导互助合作运动。
    平顺县党组织还经常向广大农民进行社会主义前途教育，鼓舞农民互助合作的积极性，促进社会主义因素的增长，稳步地实行对农业的社会主义改造。小农经济已有很长期的历史习惯，农民对社会主义的道路却很生疏。因此，必须加强社会主义前途教育，并使这种教育和农民的现实利益结合起来。平顺是老根据地，在一九五一年制定三年建设计划时，群众信心不足；向群众介绍了苏联电影“山野的春天”（“萨根的春天”），鼓舞了大家建设山地的劲头，并且在毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的号召下积极行动起来，大大推进了互助合作运动。一九五二年春天，普遍学习了高岗同志关于农村经济发展方向的报告；秋季，李顺达参观苏联回来向广大群众作了访苏报告；一九五三年春季又学习了邓子恢同志关于“农村工作的基本任务和方针政策”的报告。这些，对互助合作运动的发展和巩固作用极大。广大农民认为高岗同志的报告指出了方向、是“开心的钥匙”。听了李顺达访苏报告后，“向苏联学习”成了群众自觉的要求，各村都订了五年建设计划，积极搞好互助组和合作社。大张旗鼓进行总路线的宣传教育以后，农民走社会主义道路的积极性更大了，信心更高了。
    依靠群众大家办社
    农业生产合作社的出现，在农村引起了一系列的改变，带来了许多新的问题要解决。这是群众性的运动，必须依靠群众的实践来指导运动，使政策精神与当地实际情况相结合。我们开始试办时，就注意了不同地区、不同生产条件的选择。最先在全县的先进村——川底村试办，一九五二年又在各区的先进村或基点村重点推开，有农业、林业、畜牧、经济作物各个方面的典型，以便分类指导。县委直接掌握三个重点社，各区也掌握一两个重点社，经过两三年的重点培养，都取得了一些经验和教训，这些旧社再分片联系周围的新社，一般的问题就可以帮助他们解决了。一九五三年春天，大部分新社刚由互助组转成社，如何评产，如何计划生产，如何组织劳力，肥料往那块地送，那些地种什么等等，一大堆问题提出来了。有的社长指挥不了，发愁，急得哭；有的跑到川底村去找郭玉恩。县委根据这情况召开了互助合作代表会，由郭玉恩介绍经营管理的经验，介绍他怎样当社长；武侯梨介绍全面增加收入的办法；申纪兰介绍发动妇女参加生产的经验，刘春有介绍他怎样当会计。这样适时地解决了大家的问题。使新社少走了弯路。以后在春耕生产和秋收分配时也采用了这个办法，效果很好。
    一九五一年和一九五二年，重点试办的社不多，可以选派得力的干部专职试办。到一九五三年，由十个社发展到一百一十个社，一下子增加了十倍多，派专职干部就发生了困难。区里有些干部不会办社，许多问题都跑到县委来解决也不可能。县委就采取了“加强区委的具体领导、发挥所有干部的作用、各个系统协同动作、大家办社”的方针。全体干部努力钻研，加强了具体领导，这是一九五三年所有的社全部能办好的一个重要因素。
    农业生产合作社是新生的东西，办得好坏对群众影响极大。合作社既不能放松对互助组的领导，更不能对社外群众特别是单干农民采取歧视态度。全县所有的社都联系着本村或附近村的互助组，在订生产计划和进行各个重要活动时，都邀请他们参加，并组织观摩，使他们从具体事实中看到合作社的优越性。在生产上也帮助他们解决困难。如阳高村农业生产合作社经常在农具、耕畜和人力等方面帮助社外群众，在群众中影响极好，为今后建立新社、扩大老社打下了良好的基础。
    满怀信心，继续前进
    到一九五三年冬季，平顺县组织起来互助合作的队伍已有二万五千多农户，占总农户百分之八十以上；一百一十个农业生产合作社已拥有三千四百多户，占总农户百分之十一点八。但是，我们并不以此为满足。县委总结了三年办社的经验，分析了进一步发展农业生产合作社的条件，认为既需要又可能，潜在力很大。我县目前发展社的有利条件是：一、经过总路线的宣传教育，大大鼓舞起广大农民组织起来的积极性，提高了农民的社会主义觉悟。二、已有了强大的互助合作队伍和十多年组织起来的基础，广大农民从自己的经历中体会到党和毛主席指示的道路正确。三、三年来在试办工作中取得了经验和教训，农业生产合作社在群众中有了威望，和群众有了密切的联系，特别是有李顺达、郭玉恩、申纪兰、武侯梨等劳动模范做旗帜，有力地带领着广大农民前进。四、干部在三年办社的过程中已受到锻炼和考验，有坚强的党组织领导，广大的党员、团员和积极分子已成为走社会主义道路的引路人，成为发展农业生产合作社的坚强骨干。所有这些，都给今后互助合作运动的继续发展打好了基础。
    根据这些情况，我们满怀胜利信心，要大力发展互助合作组织，巩固、提高和适当扩大旧社，积极稳步地发展新社，逐步地把临时互助组提高成常年组、把好的互助组办成合作社。要把农业生产合作社办得数量多、质量好。
    一九五三年全县每亩耕地平均产粮二百三十六斤十一两。国营县农场每亩平均产粮六百五十一斤；农业生产合作社每亩平均产粮三百一十二斤二两；互助组每亩平均产粮二百三十三斤；单干户平均产粮一百九十九斤。按全县产量平均，每个农民可以有五百斤粮食。如果都提高到产量较高的农业生产合作社的产量（每亩四百五十多斤），每个农民的收入便可由五百斤提高到一千斤；如果能达到农场的水平，每人就可以有一千五百斤粮食。将来使用机器和化学肥料，那增产就会更多了。一切明理的农民都认得很清楚：只有走集体化的道路，支援国家工业化，才会使农民永远摆脱贫困，才能保证大家走富裕的道路。现在，平顺县广大农民在总路线的照耀鼓舞下，正在积极办合作社和互助组，在社会主义的道路上前进！
