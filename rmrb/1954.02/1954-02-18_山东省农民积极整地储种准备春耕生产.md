Shandong Farmers Actively Prepare Land and Store Seeds for Spring Ploughing
    Various regions in Shandong Province are actively engaged in spring ploughing preparations. The province has a total of over 73 million mu of winter fallow land, of which over 35.58 million mu have been winter ploughed. Due to the greatly enhanced enthusiasm of the masses for production, coupled with the utilization of walking plows, the depth of winter ploughing has exceeded previous years. In the first district of Shouzhang County, over 30 percent of the winter-ploughed land was ploughed to a depth of eight inches. In the Dezhou area, the winter-ploughed land of mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives was generally ploughed to a depth of about five inches.

    In mountainous areas, farmers actively prepared the land to conserve moisture, increase the soil layer, and carried out tasks such as turning the soil, building land embankments, exchanging soil, and constructing terraced fields. In Junan County alone, over 18,000 mu of land were deeply ploughed, over 12,000 mu of land embankments were built, over 5,500 mu of soil were exchanged, over 3,600 mu of "ba dizhai" were built, and over 1,100 mu of terraced fields were constructed. In the plains, low-lying areas, and alkaline areas, farmers carried out tasks such as turning the soil, digging the soil, pressing sand on alkaline land, and leveling depressions to loosen the soil and improve soil quality. According to incomplete statistics from Guanxian, Tangyi, and Guantao counties, over 12,000 mu each of soil were improved and depressions were leveled. In Yunchang, Juye, Juancheng, Heze, and Cao counties, over 13,000 mu of land were turned. According to statistics from 148 townships in the Jiaozhou area, 7,000 mu of alkaline land were covered with sand, over 400 mu of waterlogged depressions were dug with bottom ditches, and 12,000 mu of “? di” were exchanged for soil.

    Mountainous areas and flood-affected areas, in conjunction with winter ploughing, repaired river embankments, land embankments, and carried out spring field sand removal. Junan County repaired 3,138 river embankments, the fourth district of Laiyang County repaired over 4,000 land embankments, and the sand washed into the spring fields in Yexian County has been removed by over 30 to 40 percent.

    Many regions have also paid attention to the preparation of seeds. Dezhou, Huimin, Jiaozhou, Heze and other areas have stored 4.85 million jin of cotton seeds. Linyi has prepared 2.674 million jin of soybean seeds and 485,000 jin of corn seeds. To meet the needs of farmers for spring production, the Provincial Cooperative Headquarters has now allocated more than 5,500 new-style farm implements to various regions. Including other agricultural implements, the total value is over 150 billion yuan. Local supply and marketing cooperatives have also planned and organized local handicrafts to process small agricultural implements. According to incomplete statistics from seven counties in the Jining area, over 120,000 small farm implements have been prepared. Cooperatives in Pingdu, Penglai, and Yexian have manufactured over 300,000 various small agricultural implements.

    山东省农民积极整地储种准备春耕生产
    山东省各地积极进行春耕准备工作。全省计有冬闲地七千三百余万亩，已冬耕三千五百五十八万亩。由于群众生产积极性大大提高，加以发挥了步犁的作用，冬耕深度均超过往年。寿张县一区有百分之三十以上的冬耕地深耕八寸；德州专区互助组和农业生产合作社的冬耕地，一般深耕五寸左右。
    在山区，农民们积极地整地保墒，加厚土层，进行了翻地、垒地、调换土壤、修筑台田等项工作。单莒南县深翻地就达一万八千多亩，垒地一万二千多亩，调换土壤五千五百多亩，拔地砦三千六百多亩，修台田一千一百多亩。平原低洼及盐碱地区，农民们为了疏松土壤，改良土质，进行了翻地、刨地、碱地压沙、平整洼地。据冠县、堂邑、馆陶等县不完全统计，改良土壤、平整洼地各一万二千多亩，郓城、巨野、鄄城、菏泽、曹县翻地一万三千多亩。胶州专区一百四十八个乡统计：碱地压沙七千亩，积水洼涝地挖出底沟四百余亩，“?地”换土一万二千亩。
    山区及水灾地区，结合冬耕，修整了河堰、地堰和进行了春田赶沙。莒南县修补河堰三千一百三十八条，莱阳县四区修地堰四千余条，掖县春田冲淤的沙子已超出百分之三十至四十。
    很多地区还注意了种籽的准备工作，德州、惠民、胶州、菏泽等专区，已储备棉种四百八十五万斤。临沂已备大豆种二百六十七万四千斤，玉米种四十八万五千斤。为供应农民春季生产的需要，省合作总社现已拨往各地的新式农具有五千五百多件，加上其他农具，总值在一千五百亿元以上。各地供销社并有计划地组织了地方手工业进行小农具的加工。据济宁专区七个县的不完整统计，已备妥小农具十二万余件。平度、蓬莱、掖县合作社，自造三十万件以上各种小农具。
