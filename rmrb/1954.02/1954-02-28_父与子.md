The gunner Niu Tongyang was standing on the anti-aircraft gun position, bathed in the winter sun, looking at the crystalline blue sky, vigilantly guarding the cities of the motherland. The second gunner Zhao Wenxuan suddenly ran over and said, "The company commander wants you to go to the company headquarters quickly. I heard that your father has come to see you! The company commander ordered me to take your post."

When Niu Tongyang heard that his father had come, he felt a burst of joy in his heart and walked down the mountain two steps at a time. As he walked, he thought: I haven't seen my father in five years, he must be older, his beard must be longer.... However, when Niu Tongyang walked into the company headquarters, he saw that his father was wearing a brand-new blue khaki cotton coat, a new felt hat, his face was full of oil, and his beard was shaved off. He looked much younger than he did five years ago, and Niu Tongyang almost didn't recognize him.

The company commander was talking to Niu Tongyang's father. When he saw Niu Tongyang standing at the door in a daze, he smiled and said, "Don't you recognize your father?" Before Niu Tongyang could answer, his father laughed and said, "When this child left home, I was still begging with a stick; in the past few years, I threw away the stick and picked up the plow. Don't blame him for not recognizing me!"

In the evening, the company commander specially gave his room to Niu Tongyang and his father to sleep together. The two talked about everything for years and didn't fall asleep until midnight. His father said excitedly, "Can you ask for leave to go home with your father?" Niu Tongyang was surprised and asked, "My father came to see me, why should I go home?" "Your mother misses you!" "It's enough for my father to go back and tell her." His father didn't say anything for a long time. After smoking a bag of tobacco, he said, "It's time to go home and get married. Xiuqin from the Meng family is not young anymore! Besides, your mother is waiting to have a grandson." "Father, Xiuqin is only nineteen this year, it's not too late to wait two more years." His father was a little unhappy when he heard this: "Child, the Niu family only has you as the only heir! The engagement with the Meng family was agreed upon by me and Xiuqin's father when we were begging together. The Meng family also only has one daughter. Before liberation, my family was so poor that the whole family wore one pair of pants, so we didn't dare to mention getting married. In the past few years, we have saved money and saved up twenty stones of grain, just waiting for you to go home and get married. I also made a special trip to the Meng family. Xiuqin's father said: In the past, we sold our sons and daughters, but this time we are betrothing our daughter, costing ten stones of grain to prepare a full dowry."

When Niu Tongyang heard his father say that the family had saved more than twenty stones of grain, and the Meng family also had ten stones, to prepare for his and Xiuqin's wedding, he immediately thought of what the instructor said when studying the general line. He thought: As a Communist Party member and a soldier defending the motherland, how could I watch my relatives hoard a large amount of grain? How could I occupy the grain that the country urgently needs for construction for my personal marriage?

Niu Tongyang didn't speak for a long time. His father thought he had agreed and said, "Let's go back!" But, completely unexpectedly, Niu Tongyang said: "Father, I can't leave the battle post of defending the motherland for the time being, but I advise you to sell the twenty stones of grain to the country so that the country can be built better!" When his father heard this, he glared at Niu Tongyang and said angrily: "If you don't want to go back, then forget it, but don't interfere with the grain. I can't lose both my person and my wealth!" When Niu Tongyang saw that his father was angry, he knew that he couldn't be impatient. After his father finished smoking another bag of tobacco, he changed the subject and said: "Father, how did my sister die?" His father was confused when he heard this and replied with undiminished anger: "Starved to death!" "How did our family's two acres of garden land disappear?" His father turned to look at Niu Tongyang and said: "Your mother was in confinement, and borrowed one stone of grain from Niu Wanjin. The interest rolled on, and we couldn't pay it back, so we used the land to pay off the debt!" Niu Tongyang said: "Father, in the past, the grain was all hoarded in the hands of the landlords, which caused our family to lose both people and wealth, and beg from door to door. Now the country needs grain in order to build socialism, so that we can use machines to farm in the future, produce more grain, and live a better life than today. How can my father say that we will lose both people and wealth?" After his father heard this, his anger subsided a little, but he still unwillingly said: "You are always right, and your father is wrong!" Niu Tongyang said: "We can't forget the pain after the wound has healed!"

Until dawn, Niu Tongyang's father didn't fall asleep, just smoking one bag of tobacco after another. Niu Tongyang asked: "Why isn't father asleep?" His father didn't say anything. When Niu Tongyang got up to put on his clothes, his father turned his face for a moment, as if he saw something terrible. He grabbed Niu Tongyang's arm and stared at his back, asking, "What's this?" Niu Tongyang looked and saw that his father had discovered the two scars on his back: "How did father forget? This was when I was thirteen years old, herding sheep for Niu Wanjin. He didn't give me food, and I couldn't bear the hunger, so I took a steamed bun from the kitchen. Niu Wanjin saw it, hung me in the stable, and whipped me with a leather whip..." His father didn't say anything again and let go of his hand.

When Niu Tongyang brought the water for washing his face, he caught sight of his father secretly wiping away tears, but he pretended not to see it.

After breakfast, the company commander had originally given Niu Tongyang four hours of leave to accompany his father to the city to stroll around; however, Niu Tongyang's father said: "I'm going home right away!" These words stunned both the company commander and Niu Tongyang. The company commander said: "Uncle, stay a few more days!" Niu Tongyang's father shook his head and said, "I can't stay. Company commander, the older I get, the more confused I become. In the past few years, the change from poverty to wealth has all depended on Chairman Mao's good leadership, but I only thought about my own glory and planning for my children, and I didn't think about how to help the country. In the past few years, I have saved grain in order to make the wedding more decent.... When Tongyang left home, he was just a little kid! Look how much he understands now! I will definitely sell the grain to the country when I go home; you should also work hard to protect our good life."

When Niu Tongyang sent his father to the train, he gave his father a letter and said: "Father, give this letter to Xiuqin and ask her to also mobilize her father to sell the grain to the country."

More than half a month later, Niu Tongyang was standing on the anti-aircraft gun position when he received two letters at the same time. One was sent by his father. The letter said: After returning home, I sold twenty-three stones of surplus grain. Originally, there were only twenty stones, but after the whole family calculated the detailed accounts, there were three stones that were extra, so they were sold together. When Niu Tongyang saw the other letter, he knew it was from Xiuqin, because the handwriting on the envelope was crooked, and those were the words that Xiuqin had learned to write after learning culture in night school. The letter said: After receiving the letter, I reasoned with my father and sold a total of sixteen stones of surplus grain. Because she took the lead in selling grain, she also mobilized others to sell more than forty stones, and was not only praised by the district government, but also gloriously joined the Communist Youth League.

After reading the letters, Niu Tongyang felt a burst of joy and relaxation all over his body. He looked up at the peaceful sky of the motherland, and the bright sunshine was shining on the smile on his face.

Niu Tongyang got up to put on his clothes, and his father turned his face for a moment, as if he saw something terrible... It turned out that his father had discovered the two scars on his back. Woodcut by Li Hua.

    父与子

    炮手牛同阳正站在高射炮阵地上，浴着冬天的阳光，了望着蓝晶晶的天空，警惕地保卫着祖国的城市。二炮手赵文宣忽然跑来，说：“连长叫你快到连部去，听说你爹来看你啦！连长命令我替你值班。”
    牛同阳听说爹来了，立刻心里一阵高兴，两步并做一步地往山下走。他一边走一边想：五年没见面，爹一定更老了，胡子更长了……。可是，牛同阳走进连部一看，他爹穿着一套崭新的蓝卡叽布棉衣，戴着一顶新毡帽，满脸油光光的，胡子也刮掉了，比五年前还要年轻得多，简直不敢相认了。
    连长正和牛同阳的爹说话，一见牛同阳站在门口发愣，笑着说：“不认识你爹啦！”还没等牛同阳回答，他爹早哈哈的笑起来说：“这孩子离家时，俺还拉着棍要饭吃呢；这几年，俺扔掉棍子，扶起步犁来，不认得莫怨他啊！”
    晚上，连长特别把自己住的屋子让给牛同阳和他爹一起睡。爷俩东拉西扯，几年的事儿都谈起来了，直到半夜还没睡着。他爹兴奋地说：“你能不能请假跟爹回家呀？”牛同阳一听很奇怪，问：“爹来看了我，我怎还回家？”“你娘想你呗！”“爹回去讲讲就行了。”他爹半天没吭声，抽了一袋烟后，说：“也该回家把亲事办了，孟家的秀琴也不小啦！再说，你娘直等着抱孙子哩。”“爹，秀琴今年才十九，再等两年也不晚。”他爹一听，有点不高兴：“孩子，牛家可就是守你一棵独苗儿！和孟家订亲，还是俺和秀琴的爹一块要饭时商妥的，孟家也只这么一个闺女。解放前，俺家穷得全家穿一条裤子，不敢提娶亲；这几年省吃俭用，积蓄了二十石粮食，专等你回家结婚用。俺还特别到孟家走了一趟，秀琴的爹说：往年俺卖儿卖女，这一回聘闺女，破费十石粮，办个满堂嫁妆。”
    牛同阳一听爹说家里存有二十石余粮，孟家也存有十石，要为他和秀琴办喜事，立刻想起学习总路线时指导员讲的话，他想：自己是一个共产党员、保卫祖国的战士，能看着自己的亲人囤积着大批粮食吗？能为个人的亲事占有祖国建设非常需要的粮食吗？
    牛同阳半天没说话，他爹以为同意了，说：“回吧！”但是，完全出乎他爹的意外，牛同阳说：“爹，我暂时还不能离开保卫祖国的战斗岗位，可是，我劝爹把那二十石粮食卖给国家，让国家建设得更好！”他爹一听，瞪了牛同阳一眼，生气地说：“你不回去就算了，粮食的事你也别管，俺不能弄个人财两空啊！”牛同阳见爹生了气，知道急躁不得，等他爹又把一袋烟抽完后，拐个弯子说：“爹，我妹子是怎死的？”他爹听问这个，弄得莫名其妙，怒气未消地回答道：“饿死的呗！”“咱家二亩园子地怎没的？”他爹回过头来看了看牛同阳，说：“你娘坐月子，借了牛万金一石粮，利滚利，还不起，拿地顶了账！”牛同阳说：“爹，以前粮食都囤在地主手里，才弄得咱家人财两空，沿门讨饭。现在国家需要粮食，是为了建设社会主义，叫咱们将来能用机器种地，多打粮食，日子过得比今天更好，爹咋说弄个人财两空呢。”他爹听完，怒气减了些，却又不甘示弱地说：“都是你对，爹的错！”牛同阳说：“咱可不能好了疮疤忘了痛啊！”
    一直到东方发白，牛同阳的爹都没睡着，只是一袋接一袋地抽烟。牛同阳问：“爹怎没睡？”他爹没吭声。牛同阳爬起来穿衣服时，他爹偶一回脸，像看见什么可怕的东西似的，一把拉住牛同阳的胳臂，两眼盯住他的脊背，问：“这是怎的？”牛同阳一看，原来爹发现了他背上的两条伤疤：“爹怎忘了？这是我十三岁那年，给牛万金放羊，不给饭吃，饿得受不了，到厨房拿了一个馍，叫牛万金看见了，吊在马棚里，用皮鞭子抽的……”他爹又不吭声了，松开了手。
    牛同阳端来洗脸水时，一眼瞅见爹正偷偷地抹眼泪，但他装做没看见。
    吃罢早饭，连长本来给了牛同阳四小时的假，让他陪爹进城逛逛；可是，牛同阳的爹说：“俺马上回家去！”这话叫连长和牛同阳都愣住了。连长说：“老大爷再多住几天吧！”牛同阳的爹摇摇头，说：“住不下。连长，俺越老越糊涂。这几年由穷变富，全靠毛主席的好领导，可俺光想自己风光，替儿女打算，就没想怎样帮助国家。这几年积存粮食也是为了办亲事体面些……。同阳这孩子离家时，还是个小娃娃哩！看现在懂得多少吧！俺回家定把粮食卖给国家；你们也好好干，保住俺们的好日子。”
    牛同阳送爹上火车时，交给了他爹一封信，说：“爹，把这信给秀琴，让她也动员她爹把粮食卖给国家。”
    过了半个多月，牛同阳正站在高射炮阵地上，他同时接到了两封信。一封是爹寄来的，信上说：回家后就卖了二十三石余粮。原来只有二十石，全家一算细账，还有三石是多余，也一块卖了。另一封信，牛同阳一看就知道是秀琴来的，因为信封上的字迹歪歪扭扭，是秀琴在夜校学习文化才学会写的字。信上说：接到信后，就讲道理给爹听，一共卖了十六石余粮。她因为带头卖粮，还动员别人卖了四十多石，不但受到了区政府的表扬，还光荣地参加了青年团。
    牛同阳看完信，浑身感到一阵愉快和轻松，他抬头了望着祖国平静的天空，明亮的阳光正照射着他脸上的笑容。（附图片）
