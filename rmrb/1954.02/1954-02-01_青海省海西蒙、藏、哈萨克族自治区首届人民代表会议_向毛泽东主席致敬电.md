To the Respected Chairman Mao:

We, the people of all ethnic groups in Haixi, report to you with incomparable excitement: The People's Government of our Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region of Qinghai Province has been formally established. For the past four years, under the glorious illumination of your ethnic policies, the people of all ethnic groups in Haixi have united as never before. The Kazakh people, who were brutally murdered and persecuted by the Ma Bufang bandits and lived a nomadic life in the mountains and wilderness for more than ten years, have been resettled and established their homes. Our people of all ethnic groups are increasing their friendship of mutual assistance and cooperation day by day, uniting around you, and have begun a happy life in the warm big family of the motherland. In the vast pastoral areas, a new atmosphere of "prosperity for both people and livestock" has truly emerged. As of the end of 1953, our various livestock had increased by 53 percent compared to 1951. There are already sixteen schools on the vast grasslands, and the children of herdsmen have the opportunity to go to school. Three hundred and thirty-eight children of all ethnic groups have participated in the work of the People's Government. All these benefits have been obtained under your leadership. Our people of all ethnic groups happily sing "Chairman Mao is like the sun." We firmly believe that following you forever means happiness and brightness. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, we will definitely build the Haixi Autonomous Region into a more prosperous and happy place in the future. This time, the representatives of all ethnic groups in Haixi gathered together to discuss and decide on the major affairs of our people. We assure you that we will give full play to the initiative of "being masters of our own affairs," closely unite the people of all ethnic groups, work hard to develop animal husbandry production, and support the great construction of national industrialization. Finally, we, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Haixi, pay our highest respects to you and wish you good health.

               Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region People's Representative Conference
