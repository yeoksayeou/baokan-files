Correctly Choosing a Factory Site is an Important Task in Industrial Layout
Zhang Bin, Deputy Director of the General Administration of Electricity, Ministry of Fuel Industry

Many industrial departments across the country are beginning or preparing to select new factory sites. This is a very complex and arduous task, and it is an important step in correctly realizing the country's overall socialist industrialization plan. An inappropriate arrangement not only affects the construction speed and costs during the plant construction period but also determines whether the plant's long-term production and operation are reasonable and economical, and even affects the deployment of the country's entire industrial plan. In the past, individual factory sites were improperly selected, affecting unreasonable internal production or operation, which prevented the reduction of product costs for a long time. Some factory sites are threatened by floods every year, or lack water supply, which affects production. Some individual factory sites even had to be suspended midway through construction or add many temporary remedial measures due to improper arrangements, becoming a long-term burden.

Based on our recent preliminary experience in organizing several factory site selections with Soviet experts, the leadership must pay attention to the following points:

Factory site selection is a complex political, economic, and technical issue. Its work scope involves many political, economic, cultural, and academic departments outside the enterprise system. In the entire construction process of each new factory, it is the first problem to be solved after the national plan is determined. Each factory can only carry out design, ordering, and construction after the factory site is determined. Whether the factory site is determined in a timely and correct manner will decisively affect the subsequent preliminary design, technical design, and construction time and content, up to the long-term operation and production after the factory is completed. Therefore, the leadership must attach importance to the factory site selection work, strengthen leadership, and organize personnel organizations capable of undertaking this work to undertake this work.

The factory site must be suitable for the factory's production and operation characteristics and achieve the goals of safety, economy, reliability, and rationality. This is the basic principle for selecting the site of each factory. To this end, it is necessary to determine in advance the various scientific conditions and data (including political, economic, natural, technical, health, etc.) required for plant construction according to the product plan, production contacts, and construction and production capacity and period specified in the approved planning task book. Then, select locations that meet these conditions in the construction zone determined by the national industrial distribution principle. Taking the selection of a power plant as an example, it must propose general and specific conditions and data for the selection of the power plant based on the principles in the planning task book, such as: the location and area of each workshop and the entire factory in the power plant production process; the quantity, distribution, and distance of power and heat supply, and the voltage, current, air pressure, and steam temperature specifications determined by this; the load-bearing capacity per square meter of land required for machine equipment and plant buildings; the quantity and quality of water required, the quantity and quality of coal used and transportation conditions, the conditions for the removal of coal ash, the factory health protection conditions, the allocation of the capacity of each individual unit, the construction and completion time, and the final production capacity of the plant. At the same time, it is also necessary to carefully consider the changes in temperature, air humidity, and rainfall due to China's vast territory, and the specific conditions such as insulation and cooling that require special attention in the production equipment and operation and maintenance of the power industry. Neglecting or omitting one or two necessary conditions may cause errors. At present, we lack experience in this area and must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. However, in the Soviet Union's data, there are many unit standards, numbers, and various coefficients from the largest to the smallest. Which point should be adopted to suit the specific situation must be carefully studied. Otherwise, the unit numbers are very small, but the absolute numbers will differ greatly. After the existing conditions are determined, the new plant must also be considered in combination with the existing relevant production equipment in the local area and the long-term plan for future development. If the consideration is not thorough, it will affect the difficulties in production and construction in future development or increase additional investment.

Factory site selection must take into account whether the relationship between its own factory site and the entire industrial area is reasonable. Each factory in the same industrial area has its own special needs. It is wrong for any factory to overemphasize its own conditions, hinder the reasonable conditions of most factories, and infringe on the overall interests.

Factory site selection must be coordinated with the existing situation of local urban construction and the future development and construction plan. When selecting a factory site, it should be as close as possible to the city to take advantage of the original urban industry, commerce, labor, transportation, medical, cultural, and health conditions. If these are not considered and the factory site is determined independently, it will affect the planned and rational development of urban layout, or become an obstacle to urban construction, or because it is too far from the city, it is necessary to set up various conditions required for the life of employees, which not only increases investment but also affects the future attendance rate and mobility of employees.

Factory site selection must be considered in conjunction with the existing situation and future development plans of transportation. Transportation conditions play an extremely important role in factory site selection. The type and capacity of transportation, and the weight and size limits of equipment, directly affect the timeliness and possibility of plant construction. At the same time, transportation conditions are also a necessary condition for the factory to rely on to supply raw materials and promote products in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to correctly consider the characteristics of its own transportation volume and transportation products, cooperate with the existing transportation conditions, and cooperate with the plan for the development of transportation construction, arrange the status of the factory, and determine the transportation equipment suitable for the transportation throughput required in factory construction and production.

Factory site selection must, as far as possible, choose natural conditions suitable for plant construction, such as appropriate topography. There was a factory that was selected in a narrow area between mountains and rivers. Although various conditions were very good, because the mountain water rushed down between the factories during the rainy season, several flood control dams had to be built. When the railway passed, many long-distance bridges had to be built, and the terrain was too high, and the railway slope was too large, which affected the carrying capacity of transportation and greatly increased construction costs, and also affected the future development of the industrial area. Historical sites and natural scenery in the plant construction area should also be given as much care as possible.

Therefore, in addition to meeting its own requirements, the factory site selection work must take care of the coordination, cooperation, and connection of all relevant aspects. In this way, the most reasonable and correct factory site can be selected.

In order to correctly organize the factory site selection work, adapt to the special requirements of the factory site selection work, and cooperate with all aspects of the work, it is best to organize a special factory site selection committee so that the factory site selection work has a special responsible organization and personnel to better contact and cooperate with all relevant parties. If several factories are being built at the same time in the same area, it is best to conduct joint factory site selection. The higher-level authorities should uniformly organize the factory site selection committee and the factory site selection working group to jointly negotiate within a certain period of time. This can make the factories cooperate closely and greatly improve work efficiency. In the factory site selection work, special attention must be paid to the reliability and accuracy of various data, data, and physical samples. The provision and selection of these data have a decisive effect on the factory site selection and the correctness of the design work in the future. Which data should be collected must be studied in advance to propose a detailed outline and conduct investigation and research. Do not blindly believe in old data. Last year, the construction of a factory in an area expanded the seismic intensity and provided wrong information because it casually adopted the records in the county chronicles, which delayed the factory site selection and design for nearly a year and suffered great losses. The investigation and research on the data of railways, transportation, power supply, steam supply, water supply, drainage, and communication, etc., shared in the joint factory site selection in the same area, and the determination of the plan, is best organized or participated in the joint unified working group under the unified leadership of the municipal construction organs. This is the most effective way to save manpower, improve efficiency, and cooperate with the overall situation.

The leadership must pay attention to the ideological leadership in the factory site selection work, educate employees to understand the country's relevant political policies and economic policies, especially the purpose of the new plant construction, and the political and economic tasks that it will undertake in the entire national construction. The staff of the factory site selection are required to have an overall concept and socialist design ideas ideologically. Require the factory site selection personnel to have a solid and correct work style in their work, ensure the reliability and accuracy of handling each data and data, and the practical rationality of each plant construction condition, and oppose the careless, irresponsible, and unsound work style.

In short, the factory site selection work has its own characteristics, and it is necessary to adopt effective organizational leadership and working methods suitable for these work characteristics. The above is only a general preliminary experience. For factories of various different natures, attention must also be paid to its special conditions and content.

    正确地选择厂址是工业布置中的重要工作
    中央燃料工业部电业管理总局副局长　张彬
    全国不少工业部门正在开始或准备选择新厂址，这是一件非常复杂而艰巨的工作，它是正确实现国家社会主义工业化的整体计划中的一个重要步骤，这一着安排得不妥当，不仅影响到建厂时期的工程速度与建设费用，而且决定了该厂长年的生产与经营是否合理与经济，甚至影响到国家整个工业计划的部署。过去曾有个别厂址因为选择不当，影响到内部生产或经营上的不合理，长期地使产品成本不能降低；有些厂址年年受到洪水侵淹的威胁，或供水缺乏，使生产受到影响；甚至个别厂址由于安排不当，建厂不得不中途停顿，或者临时增加许多补救措施，成为长年的累赘。
    根据我们最近与苏联专家一起组织几次选厂工作的初步体验，领导上必须注意下列几点：
    厂址选择是一个复杂的政治、经济、技术问题，它的工作范围关系到许多本企业系统以外的政治、经济、文化学术部门，它在每一个新建厂的整个建设程序中，是国家计划确定后首先要解决的问题，每个工厂只有在厂址确定后，才能进行设计、订货、施工。厂址确定得及时、正确与否，就使以后的初步设计、技术设计、施工的时间与内容，直到工厂完成后长期的经营生产，都受到决定性影响，所以领导上必须重视厂址选择工作，加强领导，并组织能够担负起这一工作的人员机构，来担负这一工作。
    厂址必须适合工厂生产、经营上的特点，达到安全、经济、可靠、合理的目的，这是选定每一工厂厂址的基本原则。为此，必须根据批准的计划任务书中规定的产品方案、生产联系及建设与生产的能力、时期等原则，事先确定建厂所需的各项科学的条件与数据（包括政治、经济、自然、技术、卫生等），再根据国家工业分布原则所决定的建厂地带中，选择合于这些条件的地点。以选择一个发电厂为例，它就要根据计划任务书中的原则，提出电厂选择的一般与具体的条件及数据，如：电厂生产过程中各个车间的与全部工厂的方位与面积；供电供热的数量、分布与距离，以及由此决定的电压、电流、气压、汽温等规格；机器设备厂房所需的土地每平方公尺承载力；用水所需的量与质，用煤的量与质及运输条件、煤灰排除的条件，工厂卫生防护的条件，各单个机组容量的配备，建设与完工的时间，以及这个厂最终生产容量等一般条件，同时还要注意周密考虑由于中国地域广大，气温、空气湿度、雨量的变化，对于电业生产设备与运行维护中所需特殊注意的绝缘冷却等具体条件。如果疏忽或遗漏一两个必要的条件，都可能造成错误。目前我们对于这一方面经验很缺乏，必须学习苏联的先进经验，但苏联的资料中有许多单位标准、数字，各种系数自最大到最小，采用那一点才适合具体情况，必须慎重研究，否则单位数字相差很小，但绝对数字会相差很大。在现有条件确定后，还必须将新厂与当地现有有关的生产设备，与将来发展的长远计划结合考虑，如考虑不周即会影响今后发展中生产与建设的困难，或增加额外投资。
    选厂必须照顾自己的厂址与整个工业地区的关系是否合理，同一工业地区各个工厂都有它自己特殊的需要，那一个工厂过分强调自己的条件，妨碍了多数工厂的合理状况而侵害整体的利益，都是错误的。
    选厂必须与当地城市建设现有情况与将来发展建设计划配合。选厂时应尽量靠近城市，利用原有城市工商业、劳动力、交通、医疗、文化卫生等条件。如果不考虑这些，独自确定厂址，就会影响城市布置上有计划的合理的发展，或成为城市建设的一个障碍，或者因为离开城市太远，而必须自行设置各种职工生活上所需的条件，这样不仅增加投资，还影响到将来职工的出勤率与流动性。
    选厂必须与交通运输的现有情况与将来发展计划互相配合考虑。交通运输条件对于厂址选择起着极其重要的作用，运输的种类、能力、对机件设备重量大小的限制，直接影响建厂的及时与可能，同时运输条件也是将来工厂生产时依赖它供应原材料与推销产品的必要条件，所以必须正确地考虑自己的运输量与运输品的特点，配合现有交通运输状况及配合交通建设发展的计划，安排工厂的地位，确定适合于工厂建设与生产中所要的交通吞吐量的运输设备。
    选厂必须尽可能地选择适合于建厂的自然条件，例如适当的地形地势。曾有一个工厂，选在一个山水之间的狭长地带上，虽然各种条件很好，但因为雨季山水下来冲过各工厂之间地段，必须建筑几条防洪坝，铁路经过时，必须多建长距离的桥梁，并且地势太高，铁路坡度太大，影响到运输的载重量与大大增高了建设费用，还影响到工业区将来的发展。对建厂地区的历史古迹、自然风景也都要给以尽可能的照顾。
    所以选厂工作除了适合本身要求外，必须照顾有关各个方面的协调、配合、联系，这样，才算选定了一个最合理最正确的厂址。
    为了正确地组织选厂工作，适合选厂工作的特殊要求，配合各方面的工作，最好组织专门的选厂委员会，这样使选厂工作有专责机构与人员，更好地与有关各方面联系配合。如果同一地区有几个厂同时建设，最好进行联合选厂，由上级统一组织选厂委员会与选厂工作组，在一定时期内共同协商，这样更能使各厂密切配合，大大地提高工作效率。选厂工作中必须特别重视各种资料、数据、实物样品的可靠确实，这些资料的提供选择，对于一个工厂的厂址选择与今后设计工作的正确，有决定性的作用，应该收集哪些资料，必须事先研究提出详细提纲并作调查研究，不能轻信旧资料，去年有一地区的建厂就因为随便采用县志上的记录，扩大了地震烈度，提供了错误的资料，使选厂与设计延迟了将近一年，受到极大损失。在同一地区共同选厂中共用的铁道、交通、供电、供汽、供水、排水、通讯等资料的调查研究与方案的确定，最好组织或参加到联合统一的工作组中在市政建设机关统一领导下进行，这是最节省人力、提高效率与配合整体的有效办法。
    领导上必须注意选厂工作中的思想领导，教育职工认识国家有关政治方针和经济政策，特别是新厂建设的目的，及其在整个国家建设中要在政治上、经济上担负的任务，要求选厂的工作人员在思想上具有整体观念与社会主义的设计思想。要求选厂人员在工作中踏实、正确的工作作风，保证处理每一个资料、数据的可靠确实，每一个建厂条件的切实合理，反对粗枝大叶、不负责、不踏实的作风。
    总之，厂址选择工作，有它本身的特点，需要采取有效的适合于这一工作特点的组织领导与工作方法。上述仅是一般的初步的经验，对于各种不同性质的工厂，还须注意它的特殊条件与内容。
