    The First Phase of Work Experience in Establishing an Agricultural Cooperative in Liulin Village, Chang'an County
    Li Guangrui
    On December 27, 1953, when we visited Liulin Village, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, which is four miles away from Wangmang Village in the Duqu District, we found that Yao Dongcheng, the village's labor model, mutual aid team leader, and Communist Party member, was leading four activists in studying reference materials on establishing an agricultural production cooperative. They said, "We have long seen the benefits of Director Pu's (referring to Pu Zhongzhi, director of the Wangmang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative - author) agricultural cooperative. They replaced small livestock with large livestock; they deep-plowed with ten-inch plows; their total wheat yield per mu reached 560 jin, which is more than one and a half times higher than ours; if we don't follow them, we will fall further and further behind." Yao Youzhi (Communist Party member), the village representative director, said, "We proposed establishing an agricultural production cooperative in the spring of 1953, but the county and district insisted that we wait until after 1954; we really couldn't bear it. If the government doesn't send cadres, we'll do it ourselves." Meng Zhizhong, the mutual aid team leader, also said, "We all hope to establish a cooperative and become prosperous soon." Based on this situation, we discussed the backbone leadership, mutual aid foundation, and mass demands with the township Party branch secretary and concluded that the conditions for establishing a cooperative were ripe. Therefore, we reported the situation to the county and district committees, and they also agreed to establish an agricultural production cooperative in Liulin Village.

    On December 31, 1953, the work team arrived in the village. The first step was to systematically investigate the understanding of establishing an agricultural production cooperative among all classes, households, and individuals in the village, understand their concerns, and analyze the ideological roots of these concerns, thereby determining appropriate content for propaganda and education. We conducted a household-by-household study of ideological trends in the village and learned that: ten households were determined to join the cooperative, fifteen households would follow along and could be won over despite having some problems, and seven households were temporarily unwilling to participate. Then, we convened meetings of village cadres, Party members, Youth League members, mutual aid team leaders, and mass meetings, and conducted in-depth informal talks with each household to specifically ascertain the ideological concerns of each household and individual. At this stage, the main concerns of the masses were: Farmers with more land were afraid of receiving less grain after joining the cooperative. Some said, "I have twenty mu of land. According to the Wangmang Village cooperative's method of distributing grain with land accounting for 46% of the total income, I won't get as much grain as someone with ten mu of land; if I join the cooperative, won't I become poorer?" Yao Shilian, a middle peasant's wife, said, "Chairman Mao's policies are all very good, except for the land-for-shares system; everything else is fine." Poor and hired peasants were afraid of being unable to repay old debts after joining the cooperative; afraid of not having money to repair broken houses; women were afraid of not having firewood, not having livestock to turn the millstone, and not being able to eat the persimmons on the trees; old men were afraid of being paid according to age, not being supported, and not having money to buy coffins and burial clothes; students were afraid of not being able to attend school; Yao Youkai had periodic tapeworm disease and was afraid that when he couldn't work due to illness, everyone would criticize him for pretending to be sick; Huang Chengyi (a poor peasant) was afraid of being bullied by others after joining the cooperative. In response to this situation, we decided that: on the one hand, we would convene mass meetings to explain how peasants would follow the socialist path, what the content and benefits of agricultural production cooperatives were. After learning, we clarified various ideological concerns and then registered people to join the cooperative according to the principle of voluntariness. The benefits of doing so are: First, it can correct everyone's understanding of agricultural production cooperatives and avoid many unnecessary concerns. Second, it avoids the tendency of some people blindly proposing to join the cooperative before clarifying the nature of agricultural production cooperatives. Third, it can expand the impact of learning; regardless of whether they are willing to join the cooperative or not, we welcome them to learn, so that some people who are temporarily unwilling to join can also receive education and learning opportunities. At the same time, we established a cooperative construction committee to lead the work in groups; men studied every night and produced during the day; women studied once every other noon. On the other hand, we must avoid conducting general propaganda and education that is superficial. Instead, we should grasp the relationship between the "lock and key," use the real people and real events of the Pu Zhongzhi agricultural production cooperative for propaganda and education, and focus on explaining that agricultural production cooperatives are established on the basis of private property, with voluntary joining and free withdrawal, especially explaining that the grain harvested in the cooperative is distributed fairly and rationally according to labor and land; and introduce the actual income of the Pu Zhongzhi agricultural production cooperative members household by household. Generally, their income increased by two or three shi compared to before joining the cooperative, and the most was seven or eight shi. Even Ye Zhenxian, who had more land but less labor, also increased by one shi, nine dou, and eight sheng. Four households not only solved the difficulty of not having enough to eat for many years but also paid off their debts. We also studied some other materials, explaining the reserved vegetable plots, firewood distributed with grain, and mutual assistance in cases of sores and illnesses. After learning, discussing, and explaining in this way, combined with the ideological concerns of the peasants, everyone had a correct understanding of the agricultural production cooperative and heard them reflect everywhere: "The agricultural production cooperative is so good, why shouldn't we join!"

    The second step is to criticize spontaneous capitalist ideas and establish the superiority of socialist ideology. After initial learning, most peasants in Liulin Village had a high enthusiasm for joining the cooperative. However, because three households with more land and less labor had not received a profound education in the national grain purchase work, they still wanted to keep the surplus grain to lend at high interest in the spring. Therefore, they not only did not want to join the cooperative themselves, but they were also afraid that if all the masses joined the cooperative, they would be left alone, feeling lonely and not glorious; and that after everyone joined the cooperative, they would not be able to hire workers, lend money, or have anyone to exploit. Therefore, they secretly worked through their wives to undermine others. For example, they said to others, "It's hard to say whether the cooperative is good or bad. Let's not join for now. If it's done well in a year or two, it won't be too late to beg to join even if we have to wear skirts!" This affected many people. The poor peasant Meng Jin'xue was still considering whether to join the cooperative in the middle of the night. The hired peasant Yao Shiqing also said, "My wife originally wanted to join the cooperative, but she suddenly changed her mind last night and wouldn't let me join, saying, 'If you join, I'll divorce you!'" In the evening, the learning group's enthusiasm for learning also declined, and fewer people attended. In response to this situation, we decided: On the one hand, we would convene mass meetings to continue strengthening socialist education, pointing out the above-mentioned few people who wanted to exploit others by hiring workers and lending money (without mentioning their names), guiding everyone to discuss what capitalist spontaneous forces are, how to block the capitalist road, and how to embark on the socialist road of common prosperity? In fact, it was an appropriate criticism of the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small farmers. On the other hand, we convened women's meetings to inspire them to recall the past, compare it with the present, and look to the future, conducting in-depth ideological education. Most women recalled tearing down houses, removing tiles for sale, and not having enough to eat for more than eight months a year before liberation, eating wild vegetables and radishes all day long, their faces turning green. Speaking of this, everyone couldn't help but shed tears. Wu Gaiqin, a poor peasant woman, said, "Before liberation, my two children were hungry for five days without food; after liberation, the land reform distributed land, which was the first great turning over; organizing mutual aid teams, producing more grain, and earning money from sideline occupations to pay off debts was the second great turning over; in previous years, we ate corn, but this year we ate white steamed buns and rice, and in the future, when we are in the cooperative, we will have an even better life!" After this comparative education, everyone's understanding of the Communist Party was enhanced, and the socialist ideological position was consolidated. They went back and actively persuaded their men to join the cooperative. Meng Zhongyi, a poor peasant, said, "My wife was influenced by others the day before yesterday and didn't want me to join the cooperative, but after the meeting yesterday, she said, 'Others don't join, but our family will resolutely join!'" The ideological awareness of the masses was generally improved, and the three surplus grain households sold more than one shi of white rice to the state.

    The third step is to establish the prestige of cadres and cultivate a core leadership team to prepare conditions for establishing and consolidating the cooperative. After a comprehensive study of the superiority and experience of the Pu Zhongzhi agricultural production cooperative, more than 20 households had held family meetings and were considering joining the cooperative, and some had even visited the Pu Zhongzhi agricultural production cooperative in Wangmang Village. However, at this time, problems arose again, and everyone was talking about it everywhere: "The cooperative is good, what we hear is good, and what we see is good, but we are afraid that we won't be able to run it well in Liulin Village." Yao Shilian, an old middle peasant, said, "How many good labor models like Pu Zhongzhi and Yi Jidong can there be in Chang'an County?" Zhao Yingyu, a hired peasant, also said, "I really want to join the cooperative, but I am illiterate. I can't recognize the accountant's writing. If I work 100 workdays, and after a long time, he only counts 70, wouldn't I be cheated! If I want to join the cooperative, I'll wait until I finish the literacy class and learn to write my own accounts." Obviously, everyone was considering the issue of cadres running the cooperative again.

    Originally, Yao Dongcheng, the mutual aid team leader, had shortcomings in his past work. When he led the mutual aid team to engage in sideline occupations, four or five thousand yuan passed through his hands, but he didn't use an accountant, relying on his memory, and more than 600,000 yuan of financial procedures were not clarified; last year, when he set up a livestock breeding station, he used the wrong person, and a donkey's leg was kicked and broken by a horse, and everyone suffered losses. Yao Youzhi, the village representative director, had a bad attitude in the past, and some of the masses also had opinions. Therefore, the masses did not have high faith in them. This requires properly resolving the cadre issue, establishing leadership prestige, and increasing the masses' confidence in running the cooperative in their own village. After research, it was decided that: on the one hand, we would convene a Party branch meeting, inspiring Communist Party members Yao Dongcheng and Yao Youzhi to face their shortcomings, make self-criticisms to the masses, and overcome their shortcomings; on the other hand, we would educate the masses to have a comprehensive understanding of cadres, making everyone aware that Yao Dongcheng has always been active and responsible in serving everyone, suffered losses when promoting sideline products - reed mats (cotton drying equipment) - for the village, and did not complain; he also exhausted his own livestock when pulling grass for the breeding station, suffering great losses, and did not complain; Yao Youzhi has made great progress in the past half year after studying in the county and has worked very seriously. At the same time, we also combined learning with discussions of the financial and accounting system, management, and calculation of labor of the Ma Tinghai agricultural production cooperative, explaining that with receipts in hand, no one can cheat, and also explaining that the cooperative will never allow intentional undercounting of work points. After this two-way education, the masses had a more comprehensive understanding of the cadres' advantages and disadvantages. This not only strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses but also improved leadership prestige, thereby making the masses realize that as long as everyone is united and acts in accordance with the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation, they can run the cooperative very well.

    长安县柳林村建立农业合作社第一阶段的工作经验
    李光锐
    一九五三年十二月二十七日，我们从陕西省长安县杜曲区王莽村到相隔四里路的柳林村去访问时，就发现该村劳动模范、互助联组长、共产党员姚东成领导着四个积极分子在学习建立农业生产合作社的参考资料。他们说：“蒲主任（指王莽村农业生产合作社主任蒲忠智——作者）农业社的好处我们早看出来了。人家把小牲口换成大牲口；用十寸步犁深耕；全部麦田每亩收了五百六十斤，比我们高一多半；我们再不走就越撩越远了。”村代表主任姚有志（共产党员）说：“一九五三年春天咱们就提出要建立农业生产合作社，可是，县上和区上硬要叫我们等到一九五四年以后再说；我们实在忍耐不住了。如今政府若不派干部来，我们就自己动手。”互助组长孟志中也说：“我们大家都希望早办社，早富裕。”根据这个情况，我们就和乡支部书记研究骨干领导，互助基础和群众要求，认为建社条件已经成熟。于是把情况向县委、区委作了汇报，他们也同意在柳林村建立农业生产合作社。
    一九五三年十二月三十一日，工作组到村第一步就系统地调查全村各阶层、各户、各个人对建立农业生产合作社的认识，了解他们有什么顾虑，并分析研究产生这种顾虑的思想根源，由此确定恰当的宣传教育内容。我们在村里曾经逐户研究思想动态，了解到：坚决入社的有十户，跟着走的和虽有问题但能够争取的十五户，暂时不愿参加的七户。接着，召开村干部、党员、团员、互助组长会，群众会，深入各户漫谈，具体摸清各户、各个人的思想顾虑。在这一阶段，群众主要顾虑是：地多的农民怕入社后分粮少，有的说：“我有二十亩地，照王莽村合作社的办法，土地按四六分粮（即：土地分红占总收入的百分之四十六），就分不到十亩地的粮；入了社，不是越过越穷吗？”中农姚世连的老婆说：“毛主席的政策都很好，撇开土地入股这一条，样样都能行。”贫雇农怕入社后无力偿还旧债；怕房子破了没钱修补；妇女怕没柴草烧，没牲口套磨子，树上的柿子娃吃不上；老汉怕按年龄计工，没人供养，没钱买棺材、老衣；学生怕上不了学；姚有凯的肠内有周期条虫病，他怕病发了不能做活时，大家会批评他装病；黄成义（贫农）怕入社后，别人欺负他。针对这种情况，研究确定：一方面召开群众会，讲解农民走社会主义如何走法，农业生产合作社的内容和好处是些什么。经过学习，澄清了各项思想顾虑，然后按自愿原则报名入社。这样做的好处：首先是可以端正大家对农业生产合作社的认识，避免许多不必要的顾虑。第二是避免一些人在未弄清农业生产合作社性质以前，盲目提出入社的偏向。第三可以扩大学习影响，不管愿不愿入社，我们都欢迎他们来学习，使一些暂时不愿入社的人，也能得到教育和学习的机会。同时，成立建社委员会，分组领导，男人每天晚上学，白天生产；妇女隔一天中午学习一次。另一方面，必须避免进行一般宣传教育，隔靴搔痒，而应掌握好
  “锁子和钥匙”的关系，引用蒲忠智农业生产合作社的真人真事进行宣传教育，并着重讲明农业生产合作社是在私有财产基础上办起来的，入社自愿和退社自由，特别讲明社里打下粮食，按劳力与土地公平合理地分配；又逐户介绍了蒲忠智农业生产合作社社员的实际收入，一般都较入社前增加两、三石，最多达七、八石，就是土地多而劳力少的叶振贤也增加了一石九斗八升。有四户不但解决了多年来不够吃的困难，而且把账也还清了。还学习了一些其他材料，交代了自留菜地、柴草随粮食分配、生疮害病大家帮助等。经过这样结合农民的思想顾虑，边学习、边讨论、边解释以后，大家才对农业生产合作社有了正确认识，而且到处听到他们反映：“农业生产合作社是这样好，咱们不入为啥哩！”
    第二步是批判自发的资本主义思想，树立社会主义思想优势。柳林村农民经过初步学习后，多数农民入社情绪很高。但由于有三户土地多而劳力少的农民，在国家购粮工作中还没有受到深刻的教育，还想将余粮留到春天放高利贷，因此，不仅自己不愿入社，而且还怕群众都入了社后，单留下他们，孤单得很，不光荣；并且都入了社后，将来雇不到工，放不了债，没有被剥削的对象。因而，通过他们的老婆暗地活动，扯别人的腿。如对人说：“合作社好坏难保，咱们暂时不入，等一、两年办好了，那怕穿裙子下拜请求也不迟哩！”影响了许多人。贫农孟金学睡到半夜仍在考虑入不入社的问题。雇农姚世青也说：“我的女人原来要求入社，昨晚乍变，还不叫我入，她说：
  ‘要入就离婚’！”到了晚上，学习小组的学习情绪也低落，人也少了。针对这种情况，我们确定：
  一面召开群众会继续加强社会主义教育，把上述少数想靠雇工、放债剥削别人的人指出来（不提姓名），引导大家讨论啥叫资本主义自发势力，用啥办法堵塞资本主义道路，怎样才能走上大家富裕的社会主义道路？实际上是对小农自发的资本主义倾向作了适当的批判。一面召开妇女会，启发回忆过去对比现在，看将来，进行深入的思想教育。多数妇女想起解放前拆房屋溜瓦卖，一年就有八个多月没饭吃，成天吃野菜、萝卜，吃得脸上发绿，谈到这里，大家不由得流下泪来。贫农妇女吴改芹说：
  “解放前，我的两个娃饿了五天没吃饭；解放后，土地改革分了地，是第一次大翻身；组织互助组，多打了粮食，搞副业挣钱又还清了账，是第二次大翻身；往年吃玉米，今年吃白馍和米饭，将来到了合作社更要过好日子哩！”经过这种对比教育后，提高了大家对共产党的认识，巩固了社会主义思想阵地。她们回去又主动地劝男人入社。贫农孟中义说：“我女人前天受了别人影响，不要我入社，昨天开会回来说：‘别人不入，咱家坚决入’！”群众的思想觉悟都普遍提高，三户余粮户又卖给国家一石多白米。
    第三步是树立干部威信，培养一把子骨干核心领导，为办社和巩固社准备条件。经过全面学习蒲忠智农业生产合作社的优越性和办社经验以后，已有二十多户开了家庭会，酝酿入社，有的还到王莽村蒲忠智农业生产合作社去参观过。但，在这时候又发生了问题，大家到处议论着：“合作社好是好，听到的也是好，看到的也是好，就怕咱柳林村办不好。”中农姚世连老汉说：“像蒲忠智和益纪东那样好的劳动模范，咱长安县能有几个？”雇农赵英玉也说：“合作社我很想参加，就是不识字，会计写账认不得，我做了一百个劳动日，日子一久，他硬计七十个，不是白吃亏！要入社，等我上完速成识字班，学会给自己写账后再说。”显然，大家又在考虑办社的干部问题了。
    原来互助联组长姚东成在过去工作中有缺点，领导互助组搞副业，四、五千万元从他一手中经过，不用会计，凭心记账，有六十多万元的经济手续未弄清楚；去年办牲畜配种站，用人不当，驴腿被马踢断，大家受了损失。村代表主任姚有志过去态度不好，部分群众也有意见。因此，群众对他们信仰不高。这就要妥当地解决干部问题，树立领导威信，提高群众对于本村办社的信心。后经研究确定：一面召开党的支部会，启发共产党员姚东成和姚有志两人正视自己的缺点，向群众检讨，克服缺点；一面教育群众对干部要有全面认识，使大家知道姚东成为大家服务，一贯积极负责，为村里推销副业产品——围箔（晒棉用具）误工，受了损失，毫无怨言；给配种站拉草又累死自己的牲口，损失很大，也未抱怨；姚有志在县上学习后，近半年来大有进步，工作也很认真。同时，我们又结合学习讨论了马廷海农业生产合作社的财务、会计制度、经营管理及计算劳动的办法，说明自己手里有单据，谁也不能捣鬼，也说明社里绝不允许有意少记工账等。经过这样双方面的教育，使群众对干部的优点和缺点有比较全面的认识。这样，既密切了干部与群众的关系，又提高了领导的威信，从而使群众认识了只要大家团结一致，按照党的互助合作政策办事，同样能把合作社办得很好。
