    Reader's Letters Abstract:

    The Method of Issuing Labor-Substitute Fees Cannot Solve Production Difficulties for Military Dependents
    Huang Yuansheng of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army writes: The method used in Daba Township, Xinzha District, Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, for providing labor-substitution for military dependents is to issue labor-substitution fees. However, some military dependents who lack labor, even after receiving the labor-substitution fees, cannot hire people to farm their land during the busy agricultural season, leading to land lying waste and difficult living conditions. When they approached the township government, the cadres said, "The money has already been given to you; you must figure out a solution yourselves." Some military dependents wrote letters about this situation to their sons or husbands in the army, causing some comrades to feel uneasy. We believe that simply issuing labor-substitution fees without organizing labor to assist military dependents is a way of shirking responsibility and cannot solve the difficulties of military dependents. Moreover, this approach can easily lead some military dependents lacking planning to spend the labor-substitution fees carelessly, failing to achieve the goal of helping military dependents improve production. As far as I know, the method of issuing labor-substitution fees is quite common in Wujin County. I suggest that the Wujin County People's Government study this issue and find ways to resolve it.

### 发代耕费的办法不能解决军属生产困难

    发代耕费的办法不能解决军属生产困难
    中国人民解放军某部黄元生来信：江苏省武进县新闸区大坝乡对军属代耕方法是发代耕费。但是有些缺乏劳动力的军属领了代耕费，在农忙时却无法雇到人种田，致使田地荒芜，生活困难。他们找到乡政府，干部说：“钱已经发给你们了，你们自己去想办法吧。”有的军属就把这种情况写信告诉部队中自己的儿子或丈夫，致使个别的同志情绪不安。我们认为：这样光发代耕费而不组织劳动力为军属代耕，是一种推卸责任的做法，不能解决军属的困难；而且，这种做法也很容易使一部分缺乏计划的军属把代耕费随便花掉，而不能很好达到帮助军属搞好生产的目的。据我所知，发代耕费的办法在武进县相当普遍，建议武进县人民政府研究这个问题并设法加以解决。
