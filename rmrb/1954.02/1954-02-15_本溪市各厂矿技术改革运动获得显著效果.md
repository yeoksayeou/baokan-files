    Since the third quarter of last year, factories and mines in Benxi City have launched a technical reform movement focused on implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, promoting advanced experiences, and carrying out mechanization and rationalization proposals, and have achieved significant results. After the Benxi Iron and Steel Company thoroughly implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, focusing on the workshops, it changed the raw material used for the production of lime from lime to limestone, which can reduce costs by ten billion yuan per year. After the steelmaking workshop researched and used the "automatic charging machine," manual charging was no longer necessary under high-temperature conditions, and the charging time was shortened, thus reducing the steelmaking time by half an hour. After the automation of the "mud gun" used to block the iron tapping hole in the blast furnace workshop, workers no longer had to push the "mud gun" against the sparks to block the iron tapping hole, improving working conditions. Zhao Jinchang, a technician at Benxi Coal Mine, persisted in research despite failing four times and finally succeeded in the fifth experiment, creating a "safety hook," thus eliminating casualties caused by derailments and runaway cars.
    Currently, the technical reform movement in various factories and mines has been integrated with the discussion of national planning work. For example, the blast furnace workshop has incorporated the technical reform plan into the first quarter's organizational measures plan, and at the same time, has proposed fifteen topics to the six work sections to guide workers to find ways to break through key problems in order to ensure the completion of the first quarter's plan three days ahead of schedule. By January 20th, employees of the Nanfen Iron Mine had already proposed one hundred and four rationalization proposals, of which thirty-four were critical.

    本溪市各厂矿技术改革运动获得显著效果
    本溪市各厂矿从去年第三季度起，展开以贯彻苏联专家建议、推广先进经验、开展机械化和合理化建议为内容的技术改革运动以来，已收到显著效果。本溪钢铁公司围绕车间，彻底贯彻了苏联专家建议之后，把原来的石灰改成石灰石，一年即可降低成本十亿元。制钢车间研究和使用“自动装料机”后，在高温下不再用人力装料，并且缩短装料时间，炼钢时间因而缩短了半小时。高炉车间堵出铁口的“泥炮”自动化了之后，工人再不用推着“泥炮”顶着火花去堵出铁口，改善了劳动条件。本溪煤矿技术员赵金昌，失败四次仍然坚持研究，终于第五次试验成功，创造了“安全钩”，从而消灭了因人车掉道、跑车而造成的伤亡事故。
    目前，各厂矿的技术改革运动，已经与讨论国家计划工作结合在一起。如高炉车间，把技术改革方案编入第一季度组织措施计划里去，同时，分别给六个工段提出十五个课题，引导工人想办法突破关键，以保证提前三天完成第一季度计划。南芬铁矿职工到一月二十日已经提出一百零四件合理化建议，其中关键性的就有三十四件。
