Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 24th: The U.S. side has once again violated the Armistice Agreement by insulting and interfering with the neutral personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) inspection team in Incheon. According to a special report submitted to the NNSC on February 22nd by the Incheon NNSC inspection team, while the Incheon team was performing its inspection duties at the U.S. military's K-16 airfield on the 22nd, Polish team member Major Jagielnicki was having lunch in the airfield club's restaurant. A small note written in Polish was placed in the pocket of his coat, which was left in the lobby. The note read: "Come to the club at 9:00 PM tonight or 11:00 AM tomorrow morning to play 'shuffleboard'. A man holding a newspaper will be watching you. Follow him to the men's restroom, and he will give you instructions." The Incheon team has already notified the U.S. liaison officer of this provocative incident of insulting NNSC personnel, requesting that the incident be clarified and that similar incidents against NNSC inspection team personnel be prevented from occurring in the future.

General Li Sang-cho, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, already exposed and condemned the U.S. side's obstruction, interference, and open intimidation of the NNSC in yesterday's letter to U.S. Senior Member Lacey. General Li Sang-cho pointed out that it is precisely because the U.S. side intentionally and continuously violates the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements that the U.S. side obstructs and interferes with the NNSC inspection teams in the south in various ways.

The records, reports, and other documents of the NNSC contain instances of the U.S. side using various methods to obstruct and interfere with the activities of the NNSC. The provocative incident of the U.S. side insulting the Incheon NNSC inspection team is just a new example. The U.S. side violated the Armistice Agreement on January 20th and 21st by prohibiting the Incheon NNSC inspection team from entering the port of Incheon to perform inspection duties, and is now doing its utmost to obstruct the NNSC from investigating this incident. U.S. personnel have beaten Captain Larsson, a Swedish member of the Daegu NNSC inspection team, and publicly abducted Mr. Hadukiewicz, a Polish member of the NNSC inspection team, at the Gangneung airfield. Incidents of U.S. personnel verbally abusing, intimidating, and attempting to bribe NNSC inspection team personnel have also occurred at various ports in South Korea. The teams have also been repeatedly subjected to obstruction and interference by the U.S. side while performing their inspection duties.

    美方又违反停战协定侮辱仁川中立国人员
    仁川中立国小组要美方加以澄清并防止今后发生类似事件
    【新华社开城二十四日电】美方又违反停战协定，侮辱和干涉仁川中立国视察小组的中立国人员。根据仁川中立国视察小组二十二日给中立国监察委员会的特别报告，仁川小组于二十二日在美军K十六机场执行视察任务时，波兰组员雅盖尔尼茨基少校在机场俱乐部的餐厅进午餐，在他的放在大厅里的外衣的口袋里被放进了一张用波兰文字写的小纸条，纸条上面写着：“今天晚上九时或明天上午十一时到俱乐部来玩‘推圆盘’游戏，一个手里拿着报纸的人望着你，跟他到男厕所去，他将给你指示。”仁川小组已将这一侮辱中立国人员的挑衅事件通知美方联络官，要求对这一事件加以澄清，并防止今后对中立国视察小组人员发生类似事件。
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在昨天给美方首席委员拉西的信中，就已经揭露和谴责美方对中立国监察委员会阻挠、干涉和公开威吓的行为。李相朝将军指出：正是因为美方有意地不断违反停战协定和双方协议，美方对中立国监察委员会在南方的中立国视察小组多方加以阻挠和干涉。
    在中立国监察委员会的记录、报告及其他文件中，载有美方使用各种方式对中立国监察委员会进行阻挠和干涉活动的事例。美方侮辱仁川中立国视察小组的挑衅事件只不过是一个新的例证。美方在一月二十日和二十一日违反停战协定禁止仁川中立国视察小组进入仁川港口执行视察任务，现在又极力阻挠中立国监察委员会对这一事件进行调查。美方人员曾殴打大邱中立国视察小组的瑞典人员拉尔逊上尉，并曾在江陵机场公开劫持中立国视察小组波兰人员哈都克耶维赤。在南朝鲜的各口岸，还发生了美方辱骂、威吓和企图贿买中立国视察小组人员的事件。各小组在执行其视察任务时也一再受到美方的阻挠和干涉。
