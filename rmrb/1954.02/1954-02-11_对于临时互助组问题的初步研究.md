    Preliminary Research on the Issue of Temporary Mutual Aid Teams
    Huanggang Prefectural Committee Office, Hubei Province
    I. Old Exchange Labor and Mutual Aid
        Habits Before Liberation
    In the Huanggang area of Hubei, the vast number of peasants had various old-style exchange labor and mutual aid habits to solve the difficulties in agricultural production. Although these exchange labor and mutual aid habits were diverse in form, they were not complex in essence. They can be basically divided into two types:
    The first type is the exchange of labor. The most common is "dahuan gong" (打换工), which is the practice of "scratching each other's backs" during the busy farming season; usually, the form of mutual assistance is one labor for one labor. This form is generally aimed at relatives, friends, and clans, within the scope of a village or a bay, based on personal relationships. Members are relatively fixed; you help me, and I help you. Everyone knows how much labor is contributed, and it is roughly equal. Even if there are some differences, they are generally not nitpicked. Some are based on production needs (such as shared water wheels), and
   exchange labor is carried out "conveniently." In this case, it is generally necessary to "match soldiers with soldiers, and generals with generals," "fairly divide the rice and share the meals." Those with less labor or weaker labor sometimes call for overtime, sometimes return labor afterward, and sometimes even pay wages to those who contribute more labor. "Dahuan gong" is a relatively reasonable form in the original labor mutual aid habits, and it is widely used by farmers, and some even expand to various aspects of daily life (such as building houses, weddings, and funerals). Secondly, there is the so-called "da bang gong" (大帮工), which is a temporary combination with a large scope and great suddenness. It is generally to concentrate efforts to overcome difficulties from natural disasters or man-made calamities; some are when everyone has finished their own work, they invite each other to help a few people quickly "finish up" or to help the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households "make a living." This kind of help is only based on the principle of finishing the work, without calculating labor accounts or asking for wages, and only eating a big meal at the helped family (sometimes not even that). Although it can also exert collective strength and relatively seize the "fire," it is somewhat wasteful, and the work is done relatively roughly. In addition, there is labor mutual aid between farmers and handicraftsmen. Farmers plant fields for workers, and workers do work for farmers. The exchange standard varies from place to place. Some exchange one labor for one labor, and some calculate according to market prices. Although it is sometimes not very equivalent, because everyone considers from the actual situation and needs, there is no major problem.
    The second type is the exchange labor and mutual aid of plowing cattle and farm tools. This form emerged to solve the difficulties of production materials. It is not only a way for farmers to solve difficulties among themselves, but it is also related to landlords and rich peasants. First of all, in terms of farm tools, except for landlords, rich peasants, and some stingy people who take this opportunity to demand labor exchange or other compensation from peasants, most of them borrow each other without remuneration. Because waterwheels are of higher value, if they are used to draw a lot of water, some compensation is generally given, but if they are used to pump water for rice seedlings, it is rarely calculated. Secondly, in terms of plowing cattle, there are the following forms of exchange labor and mutual aid: (1) Exchanging labor for cattle. More common is that households lacking cattle first help the cattle-owning households in order to "borrow" their cattle for convenience. After the cattle owners finish using them, they are borrowed for use. In addition, a few cattle-owning households, because of their weaker labor force, first lend their cattle to those who lack cattle in order to get them to "manage their crops." The standard for exchanging labor for cattle varies from place to place. Some need to provide some cattle grass in addition to returning labor. (2) Jointly raising cattle, that is, several households jointly buy and use cattle. In terms of feeding, some take turns feeding according to the share of cattle ownership; some entrust it to a household with conditions to feed, and the remaining households provide feed or other compensation according to their shares, and the cattle-raising household can also use the manure to fertilize the fields. (3) "Da Niu" (搭牛) or "Ke Niu" (稞牛). "Da Niu" means that some households without cattle first give a part of the price to households with cattle to obtain
   a certain right to use; some cattle-owning households have to return the money to the original owner at the end of the year without interest, and the right of use of the households without cattle is cancelled. "Ke Niu" means giving the cattle owner a certain price according to the time of using the cattle or the amount of plowing. (4) Foster raising cattle, that is, Party A invests in buying cattle and entrusts them to Party B to raise, and both parties use them together for their own convenience; if the cow gives birth to a calf or the calf grows into a big cow, Party B can also obtain partial ownership.
    From the above situations, we can see that it has the following characteristics:
    First, the original habit of exchange labor and mutual aid in rural areas was entirely generated to meet the needs of peasants under the then social and economic conditions. From the characteristics of agricultural production in the Huanggang area, some crops not only have a strong time sensitivity, but also are intricate and complex in certain seasons. In this case, the peasants have no money to hire labor, and at the same time, there is no labor to hire. In order to strive for "a thousand plows and ten thousand rakes are not as good as planting early" and solve the difficulty of "one hand cannot catch two fish," exchange labor and mutual aid must be carried out. At the same time, some agricultural activities have a large scope, such as drawing water, repairing ponds, and building weirs, which are beyond the reach of individual efforts, and exchange labor and mutual aid must also be carried out.
    Second, the original exchange labor and mutual aid were small in scale, generally composed of three or five households. Because the peasants at that time simply wanted to solve difficulties and seize the "fire," coupled with the fragmentation and dispersion of land and the backwardness of production tools, it was impossible to squeeze dozens of people to work on small pieces of land at the same time. Only with small, flexible, and simple characteristics can it meet the needs of the peasants.
    Third, the original exchange labor and mutual aid were generally voluntarily combined based on certain relationships such as relatives, friends, clans, and neighbors. This is not only determined by the then patriarchal social conditions, but also because the peasants most emphasized "one heart" and "harmony." Only when people with certain relationships in peacetime are combined can a "mutual trust" foundation be laid, so as to wholeheartedly engage in production.
    Fourth, the original exchange labor and mutual aid were basically mutually beneficial according to the specific conditions in the past. In particular, the exchange labor and mutual aid of plowing cattle and farm tools is the accumulation of historical experience of peasants and is worth studying. Mutual benefit is the material basis for maintaining this mutual aid habit of peasants. Of course, if viewed from a specific mutual aid activity, it is indeed not "half a catty to eight taels," and even not very mutually beneficial is also a fact; however, the relationship between peasants is multi-faceted, and the interactions are very close. Today, Zhang San may benefit a little from Li Si on this issue, and tomorrow, Li Si may benefit a little from Zhang San on that issue. In fact, everyone knows in their hearts. At the same time, because this mutual aid is very temporary, there is no nitpicking. In short, "mutual benefit" cannot be absolutized. It is specifically resolved through various activities on a voluntary basis.
    The above is from the perspective of the then situation. Some of these issues are still worth paying attention to in the future development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Of course, the past habits of exchange labor and mutual aid have some basic weaknesses, which must be improved and upgraded:
    First, due to the limitations of the then social conditions, it could only be limited to the level of "solving difficulties and seizing the fire." In addition, without fixed leadership and planning, it was difficult to achieve intensive cultivation and meticulous work. The order of work was also often not arranged through democratic discussion, so in some places it was not mutually beneficial.
    Second, during rice transplanting and harvesting, there were some wasteful phenomena of excessive eating and drinking. Some poor peasants often dared not exchange labor because they could not afford the meals, which, to a certain extent, restricted the participation of poor peasants in mutual aid.
   II. Development of Temporary Mutual Aid Groups After Liberation
        Situation
    The current temporary mutual aid groups in various parts of the Huanggang area generally have the following situations:
    The first type is the old-style exchange labor and mutual aid, which completely maintains the old set of forms and habits of exchange labor and mutual aid, with little improvement. Even if a group leader is selected, he does not actually play a role; many still pay too much attention to eating and drinking during rice transplanting according to past habits, resulting in great waste. Despite this, we must not completely deny its role. Because (1) it is still beneficial to production; (2) it temporarily suits the tastes of the peasants; and (3) it is the starting point of new-style mutual aid groups.
    The second type of exchange labor and mutual aid has slightly improved compared to the first type, that is: focusing on agricultural activities, a few households with certain relationships (private feelings, land connections, or shared ponds, weirs, and waterways) get together, in which, in addition to a simple labor allocation system, a group leader is selected to control the leadership. These group leaders are mostly activists in the social reform movement and production movement. Because it focuses on agricultural activities, although it is temporary, the members of the organization are generally fixed in certain mutual aid activities. At the same time, due to the simple labor allocation system, the group members also began to have "matching labor" requirements. These create conditions for further improvement and upgrading.
    The third type of exchange labor and mutual aid has more mutual aid content than the second type, expanding from one agricultural activity to mutual aid in one or several major production seasons, with a strong seasonality. With the increase in mutual aid activities, not only are there scheduling and labor allocation systems, but also simple scoring and labor recording (such as fixed points and records, recording labor by time, etc.) and periodic clearing and settlement systems. At the same time, because the organization members are basically fixed, the leadership core has also begun to form, with a relatively good group leader. From the perspective of mutual aid activities, it is basically mutual aid during busy times, no mutual aid during slack times, mutual aid for major events, and no mutual aid for minor events, with great flexibility. Compared with general year-round mutual aid groups, in addition to the leadership core and various systems being different in degree, the main difference lies in still staying at the stage of "seizing the fire" and solving difficulties. This is a transitional form of temporary seasonal mutual aid groups moving towards year-round mutual aid groups.
    In the Huanggang area, the number of temporary mutual aid groups in the above situation is the largest. According to incomplete statistics from eleven counties in April 1953, it accounts for 92.9% of the organized farm households
   (total of three types). Generally speaking, the first type is the most, the second type is the second most, and the third type is less; in areas where the mutual aid and cooperation movement is developing well, the third type also has a considerable number. This fully shows that the development of temporary mutual aid groups not only has its own development law from low to high and from small to large, but also can never completely deviate from the masses' original mutual aid forms, habits, and experience.
    However, some cadres, due to insufficient understanding of the characteristics and importance of developing temporary mutual aid groups, hindered the development of the masses' original mutual aid relationships. From the perspective of guiding ideology, one bias is that it does not start from the current rural reality and the peasants' habitual level, and the requirements are too high, thinking that this kind of organization is "backward" and "does not look like a mutual aid." As a result, they are eager for quick success and blind pursuit of advanced forms. As a result: first, they beat drums and make a lot of noise, engage in large-scale reorganization, destroy the original organizational foundation, and violate the principle of voluntariness; second, the system strives to be "complete," and the activities strive to be
   "collective," absolutizing the "mutual benefit" requirement, and restricting the peasants' enthusiasm for mutual aid on the basis of inherent habits from many aspects. Therefore, the masses criticized us: "Eating pot rice, you have to weigh it with a steelyard." The masses who originally wanted to exchange labor and mutual aid were afraid of being criticized for being "backward" and "not mutually beneficial," so they had to not help each other; some mutual aid groups, in order to cope with the situation, stipulated this system and that system, but in fact they were set up in vain, forming a serious formalism of "doing it for the cadres to see, and I will disband as soon as the cadres leave"; some mutual aid groups, because they were afraid of too much interference, even engaged in secret mutual aid. These situations greatly affected the normal development of temporary mutual aid groups; and to a certain extent, they destroyed many of the masses' original feasible habits. For example: Before liberation, peasants used the method of "da bang gong" to concentrate their efforts to help solve the production problems of the orphaned, widowed, disabled, and households lacking labor, especially during the busy farming season of "seizing the fire," which was very effective. However, because some cadres overemphasized "equivalent mutual benefit," and restricted "free" activities within the group, the production of these people has become a problem. Peasants reflect: "Mutual aid and mutual aid, cut off the road to relatives." They are extremely dissatisfied with these restrictions.
    Another bias is: thinking that this kind of organization "is not our development direction," or thinking that "since the masses have habits, there is no need for leadership," neglecting the leadership of temporary mutual aid groups, and letting them develop freely, so that they stagnate on the inherent basis for a long time. This is also unfavorable for further developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement and developing production in the future.
  III. On the Future Development, Consolidation, and Improvement
      Opinions on Temporary Mutual Aid Groups
    It is obviously still of great significance to lead and further develop and improve temporary and simple labor mutual aid organizations. Not only because this kind of organization suits the current habits, experience, and cognitive level of the majority of peasants, and is a form that the broad masses like and are most easily accepted; but also it can widely solve the peasants' difficulties in seizing the "fire" and other production difficulties at this stage; at the same time, with the development of production, coupled with our active leadership, it can lay a broad foundation for guiding peasants to develop year-round fixed mutual aid organizations and agricultural production cooperatives.
    How to develop, consolidate, and improve temporary mutual aid groups?
    First, it is necessary to correct the understanding of rural work cadres regarding temporary mutual aid groups. In the past two or three years, cadres have had a very deep misunderstanding of temporary mutual aid groups. Leading cadres should vigorously solve these ideological problems through summarizing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, so that cadres can understand the characteristics, role, and importance of this kind of organization.
    Second, the experience of the Huanggang area in recent years has proved that the development of temporary mutual aid groups is not very difficult and can be developed relatively freely and universally. As long as our cadres can grasp the basic requirements of the masses to overcome difficulties and develop production, based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and on the basis of inherent mutual aid habits, grasp the main links in production, and give general calls and specific leadership, it is possible to develop a large number. As long as we can use the method of "proof and persuasion" and patiently guide them, we can gradually improve and gradually improve after a large number of developments.
    Third, some people think that this kind of mutual aid group will be done by the masses themselves, and there is no need for leadership, or they think that it is not easy to lead, it is difficult to create experience, it is difficult to establish a banner, and let it develop spontaneously. These understandings are wrong. According to the experience of areas with better development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in our region, as long as the leadership is correctly strengthened, within two or three years after the land reform, this kind of organization can develop to 60% to 70% of the rural population, and can continuously and constantly carry out the patriotic production increase movement; the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is also relatively normal. On the contrary, in areas where this kind of mutual aid organization has not strengthened its leadership, so that the movement is in a state of laissez-faire or blindly pursuing advanced forms, the policy cannot be well implemented, what should be improved and improved cannot be improved and improved, which affects the mutual aid and cooperation movement and affects production.
    Fourth, in order to make temporary mutual aid groups consolidated, improved, and turned into year-round mutual aid groups, it is necessary to always grasp the following joints: (1) At the end of each important production season, through summarizing, the peasants should systematically recognize the benefits of "organizing"; (2) They should be good at studying the masses' inherent forms and methods of exchange labor, summarizing several basic and feasible successful experiences, and gradually improving from the masses' original level; (3) The content of production mutual aid should be continuously enriched, such as collective research on cultivation techniques, etc., to enlighten them on further mutual aid and cooperation requirements;
   (4) In addition to the county-level responsible for running several agricultural production cooperatives well, we must also carefully cultivate a year-round mutual aid group in a township or a base point, fully demonstrate the superiority of "producing more grain," establish a banner, and create experience suitable for the then local conditions and acceptable to the masses, so that the masses can see the direction of progress.
    As long as we do this, we can guide a large number of temporary mutual aid groups to gradually develop, improve, and improve, and it will not be difficult to turn a part to year-round mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives.

    对于临时互助组问题的初步研究
    中共湖北黄冈地委办公室
    一、解放前旧有的换工互助
        习惯
    湖北黄冈地区广大农民，为了解决农业生产各方面的困难，很早就有各种旧式的换工互助习惯。这种换工互助习惯，虽然在表现形式上多种多样，但实质上并不复杂。归纳起来，基本上可分为两种类型：
    第一种，劳动力之间的换工互助。其中最大量的是“打换工”，就是在大农忙“抢火色”的季节，采取“换手抓痒”的办法；通常实行一工抵一工的互助形式。这种形式一般是以亲朋、户族为对象，以一村、一湾为范围，以私人感情为基础，成员相对固定，你帮我，我帮你，工多工少，各人心中有数，大体相等，即使有些差额，一般也不去斤斤计较。也有的是根据生产上的需要（如打伙车水等），
  “就便”进行换工，在这种情况下，一般就得“兵对兵、将对将”，“平打米、凑吃饭”，劳动力较少较弱者，有的叫工加班，有的事后还工，有的甚至拿出工钱付给多工户。“打换工”是在原有劳动互助习惯中，比较合理的一种形式，为农民所广泛采用，有的甚至扩大到日常生活（如做屋、婚丧事情等）各方面的换工互助。其次，有所谓“大帮工”，它是一种临时组合，范围较大，带有很大突击性，一般是为了集中力量，克服天灾人祸困难；也有的是在大家生活已经搞完的情况下，互相邀约替少数人赶紧“煞尾子”，或是给老弱孤寡户帮忙“赶生活”，这种帮工，只以赶完生活为原则，既不算工账，也不要工钱，做到那家就大吃一顿了事（有时也不吃）。它虽然也能发挥集体力量，相对地抢住“火色”，但有些浪费，生活也做得比较粗糙。此外，还有农民与手工工人之间的劳动互助，农民给工人种田，工人给农民做工。其中换工标准，各地有所不同，有的一工换一工，有的各按市价折合计算，虽然有时不很等价，但因各人都从实际与需要考虑，问题不大。
    第二种，耕牛、农具的换工互助。这种形式是为了解决生产资料的困难而出现的。它不仅是农民与农民之间解决困难的一种办法，有的甚至与地主、富农也发生关系。首先，在农具方面，除地主、富农和一些刻薄人家，借此向农民索取人工交换或其他代价之外，大部分是互相借用，不计报酬。水车由于价值较高，如系搬大水，一般仍要给予一些代价，但如系车搭秧水，也很少计较。其次，在耕牛方面，有以下几种换工互助形式：（一）人牛换工。较普遍的是缺乏耕牛的户，为了借有牛户的耕牛“方便”，先给对方帮工，等牛主用完之后，借来使用；此外，少数有牛户，因为劳动力较弱，为了图谋缺牛户给他“赶庄稼”，先把耕牛借给对方先用的也有。人牛换工标准，各地有所不同，有的除还工之外，还须出点牛草。（二）伙养牛，就是几户农民伙买、伙用。在饲养上，有的是按占有牛的股份大小，轮流饲养；有的是交由有条件的一户饲养，其余各户按股供给饲料或其他代价，养牛户还可落粪肥田。（三）“搭牛”或“稞牛”。“搭牛”，有的是无牛户先给有牛户一部分代价，取得
  一定使用权；有的到年终有牛户还得将钱归还原主，不计利息，无牛户使用权取消。“稞牛”是按用牛时间或犁田多少，给牛主一定代价。（四）寄养牛，就是甲方投资买牛，交由乙方饲养，双方共同使用，各有方便；如系母牛生下小牛或是小牛养成大牛，乙方并可取得部分所有权。
    从以上这些情况中，我们可以看出它有这样几个特点：
    第一，农村原有换工互助的习惯，完全是适应当时社会经济条件下农民之间的需要而产生的。从黄冈地区农业生产的特点来看，有些农作不仅有强烈的时间性，而且在一定的季节里错综复杂。在这种情况下，农民既无钱请工，同时又无工可请，为了争取“千犁万耙，不如早插一下”，解决“一只手捉不到两个鱼”的困难，必须换工互助。同时，有些农事活动范围很大，如车水、修塘、筑堰等，都非单干力所能及，也必须换工互助。
    第二，原有的换工互助规模较小，一般都是由三、五户人家组成。因为农民当时只是简单地为了解决困难，抢住“火色”，加上土地的零细、分散，生产工具的落后，不可能在小块土地上，挤上十几二十个人同时劳动，只有具备小型、灵活、简单的特点，才能适合农民的需要。
    第三，原有的换工互助，一般都是以亲朋、户族、邻居等一定关系为基础，自愿结合起来的。这不仅是当时宗法社会条件决定它必须如此，同时也因为农民是最强调“一心”、“合意”的，只有平时有一定关系的人相结合，才能打下“互信”的基础，从而全心全力，搞好生产。
    第四，原有的换工互助，按照过去的具体的条件来说；基本上也是互利的。特别耕牛、农具的换工互助，是农民历史经验的积累，值得加以研究。互利是维系农民这种互助习惯的物质基础。当然，如果从某一具体互助活动上看，确不是“半斤对八两”，甚至不很互利也是事实；但是，农民之间的关系是多方面的，往来是很密切的，今天在这个问题上，张三或许要沾李四一点，明天在那个问题上，李四可能又要沾张三一点，事实上，各人心中有数。同时，由于这种互助的临时性很大，因此，也不斤斤计较。总之，“互利”不能绝对化，它是在自愿的基础上，通过各种活动来具体解决的。
    以上，是从当时情况来看的。其中有些问题，即在今后开展互助合作运动中，仍值得注意。当然，过去的换工互助习惯，有若干基本弱点，必须注意加以改进和提高：
    第一，由于受着当时社会条件的限制，只能局限在“解决困难、抢住火色”的水平上，加之没有固定的领导与计划，很难作到精耕细作。做活先后也往往不是经过民主讨论安排的，因之在某些地方不是互利的。
    第二，在插秧、割谷时，有些大吃大喝的浪费现象，部分贫苦农民，往往因为管不起饭而不敢换工，这样，在一定条件上限制了贫苦农民参加互助。
  二、解放后临时互助组的发展
        情况
    当前黄冈地区各地的临时互助组，一般有如下几种情况：
    第一种是旧式换工互助，完全保持旧有的一套换工互助的形式和习惯，很少有所改进。有的即使选了一个组长，实际上不起作用；不少的在插秧中仍照过去的习惯过分讲究吃喝，浪费很大。尽管如此，也决不能完全否定它的作用。因为（一）它对生产仍有好处；（二）暂时还适合农民口味；（三）是新型互助组的起点。
    第二种换工互助，比第一种稍有改进的地方，就是：以农事活动为中心，有一定关系（私人感情，田地瓜葛或共塘堰水路）的几户人家凑合拢来，其中除有简单的拨工制度以外，并选有组长掌握领导。这些组长，多半是社会改革运动和生产运动中的积极分子。由于它是以农事活动为中心，虽带有临时性，但组织成员在一定互助活动中是大体固定的。同时，由于有了简单的拨工制度，组员也就开始有了“对工”要求。这些，为进一步改进和提高创造了条件。
    第三种换工互助，比之第二种，是互助的内容加多了，由一个农事活动扩大到在一个或几个主要生产季节中实行互助，具有浓厚的季节性。随着互助活动的增多，不仅有了排工、拨工制度，而且有了简单的评分记工（如死分死记、按时记工等）和定期清工结账制度。同时，因为组织成员基本固定下来，领导核心也开始形成，有了一个比较好的组长。从互助活动上看，基本上是忙时互助、闲时不互助，大事互助、小事不互助，有很大灵活性。它和一般常年互助组相比，除领导核心、各种制度在程度上有所不同外，主要差别在于仍停留在“抢火色”、解决困难上。这是临时季节性互助组走向常年互助组的一种过渡形式。
    黄冈地区的互助组织，以上述情况的临时互助组的数量为最大。据一九五三年四月份十一个县不完全的统计，占已组织农户的百分之九十二点九
  （三种合计）。一般地说，第一种最多，第二种次之，第三种较少；在互助合作运动开展较好的地区，第三种也有了相当数量。这就充分说明：发展临时互助组，不仅同样有它由低到高、由小到大的发展规律，而且决不能完全脱离群众原有的互助形式、习惯和经验。
    可是，有些干部由于对发展临时互助组的特点和重要性认识不足，妨碍了群众旧有互助关系的发展。从指导思想看，一种偏向是不从当前农村的实际情况和农民的习惯水平出发，要求过高，认为这种组织是“落后”的，“不像一个互助的样子”，于是急躁冒进，盲目追求高级形式。其结果：一是大擂大轰，搞大编组，破坏了原有的组合基础，违背了自愿原则；一是制度力求“完整”，活动力求
  “集体”，把“互利”要求绝对化，从多方面限制了农民在固有习惯基础上的互助积极性的发挥。因此，群众批评我们：“吃锅巴饭，要用戥子称。”本来想换工互助的群众，怕被批评“落后”“不互利”，也只好不互助了；有些互助组为了应付，明规定这制度、那制度，实则虚设，形成“搞起来给干部看，干部走了我就散”，有严重的形式主义；有些互助组因为害怕干涉过多，甚至暗互助明不互助。这些情况，都大大影响了临时互助组的正常发展；并在一定程度上破坏了群众许多原有的可行的习惯。比如：在解放前，农民对于孤寡残疾以及缺乏劳力户的生产问题，特别是农忙抢“火色”时，用“大帮工”的办法，集中力量帮忙做，解决得很好。可是，因为有些干部过分强调“等价互利”，组内限制“自由”活动，以致现在这些人的生产成了问题。农民反映：“互助互助，六亲断路。”对这些限制极为不满。
    另一种偏向是：认为这种组织“不是我们的发展方向”，或者认为“群众既然有习惯，就用不着领导”，轻视对临时互助组的领导，放任自流，使之长时期停滞在固有的基础上。这对今后进一步开展互助合作运动，发展生产，同样是不利的。
  三、对今后发展、巩固、提高
      临时互助组的意见
    有领导地、进一步发展和提高临时的简单的劳动互助组织，显然仍有重要的意义。不仅因为这种组织适合多数农民目前的习惯、经验和认识水平，是广大群众所喜爱、所最容易接受的一种形式；而且它能在现阶段广泛解决农民抢“火色”和其他生产上的一些困难；同时，随着生产的发展，加上我们的积极领导，就能为引导农民发展常年定型互助组织以及农业生产合作社奠立广阔的基础。
    如何发展、巩固和提高临时互助组呢？
    第一、必须端正农村工作干部对于临时互助组的认识。两三年来，干部对临时互助组的错误认识是很深的，领导干部应通过总结互助合作运动，大力解决这些思想认识问题，使干部认识这种组织的特点、作用及其重要性。
    第二、从黄冈地区几年来的经验证明：发展临时互助组，并不是很困难的，是可以比较放手地普遍发展的。只要我们干部能抓住群众克服困难、发展生产的基本要求，根据自愿互利的原则，并在固有互助习惯的基础上，抓住生产中的主要环节，加以一般号召和具体领导，就有可能大量发展。只要我们能用“证明和说服”的方法，耐心诱导，就可以在大量发展以后，逐步改进，逐步提高。
    第三、有人认为这种互助组群众自己会搞，用不着领导，或者认为不好领导，很难创造经验，很难树立旗帜，让它自发地发展吧。这些认识都是错误的。根据我区互助合作运动发展较好的地区的经验，只要正确地加强领导，在土地改革后两三年内，这种组织可以发展到农村户口的百分之六、七十，而且能够持续地、不断上升地开展爱国增产运动；互助合作运动的发展也比较正常。反之，凡是对这种互助组织没有加强领导，使运动处于放任自流状态或盲目追求高级形式的地区，就使政策不能很好地贯彻，应该改进、提高的，不能改进和提高，影响了互助合作运动，影响了生产。
    第四、要使临时互助组巩固、提高、转向常年互助组，必须经常抓住以下几个关节：（一）要在每一重要生产季节告一段落时，通过总结，使农民系统地认识“组织起来”的好处；（二）要善于研究群众固有的换工形式和方法，总结出几条基本可行的成功经验，从群众原有的水平出发，逐步提高；（三）要不断充实生产互助的内容，如集体研究耕作技术等，启发他们进一步互助合作的要求；
  （四）除了县级负责办好若干个农业生产合作社以外，还要认真地在一个乡或一个基点培养好一个常年互助组，充分显示出“多打粮食”的优越性，树立旗帜，创造出适合于当时当地条件的、为群众所能接受的经验，使群众看到前进方向。
    只要这样做，我们就可以引导大量的临时互助组逐步发展、改进和提高，就不难使一部分转向常年互助组和农业生产合作社。
