The Xi'an Area Basic Construction Workers' Winter Training Committee (including the Northwest Construction Engineering Bureau, Shaanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Northwest Textile Bureau, Electricity Bureau, and nine other units) winter training work, involving more than 17,000 employees, has been universally launched under the unified leadership of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in late December of last year. After studying the general line of the state during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, the workers clearly recognized the importance of basic construction for the country's socialist industrialization, understood their glorious tasks and prospects in the national construction cause, and recognized the consistency of personal interests and class interests, immediate interests and long-term interests. They overcame the phenomena of "demanding wage increases" and "demanding welfare" that existed at the beginning of the winter training and initially carried out criticism and self-criticism. Workers who were previously not content with their jobs and wanted to transfer to other professions no longer wanted to transfer, and the number of people taking long leave decreased. In the past, some workers wanted to earn money to buy land, hoard grain, open shops, and become "bosses." Now, they have dispelled these erroneous ideas and deposited their surplus money in the National Bank. Fan Zhengzhi, a worker at the Municipal Construction Engineering Company, said: "We should not only see the small immediate benefits, but must obey the long-term interests of the country. We must know that 'when the big river has water, the small river is wide; when the big river has no water, the small river dries up.'" In the 8th to 15th Squadrons alone, workers deposited 37.9 million yuan of surplus money into the National Bank on December 23rd of last year. Workers from rural areas also persuaded their families to sell surplus grain to the state. One group of five workers wrote letters to persuade their families to sell seven or eight dan of surplus grain to the state. Before studying the general line, engineer Zhao Fuzhong had also actively studied the advanced Soviet plastic theory of design experience. However, he thought that it didn't matter if more materials were used, and if the Soviet plastic theory was used and problems occurred with the building, he would be punished. Therefore, he still used the backward British and American elastic theory for design. After studying the general line, he realized that increasing production and practicing economy is the main method to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. Therefore, he inspected four projects designed last year that did not follow advanced experience (wasting 176 tons of cement), and boldly adopted plastic design in the design of the Popular Theatre this time, estimating that it could save more than 20% of the total cement consumption. He also said: "In the past, I thought that having technology was enough. After studying the state's general line during the transition period, I realized that I must have a high degree of political consciousness to improve design standards and make designs suitable for the country's construction needs, otherwise I will make mistakes."

    Currently, all units will, in accordance with the instructions of the Northwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, enlighten the broad masses of employees, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to carefully examine last year's work, commend the good, criticize the bad, and further enhance the political consciousness of employees, laying the foundation for doing a good job in basic construction.

    西安基本建设职工学习总路线后觉悟提高
    西安地区基本建设职工冬训委员会（包括西北建筑工程局、陕西省建筑工程局及西北纺织局、电业局等九个单位）所主持的一万七千多职工冬季训练工作，已在中共西安市委统一领导下，于去年十二月下旬普遍展开。经过国家过渡时期总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务学习后，工人们明确认识了基本建设对国家社会主义工业化的重要意义，认识了个人在国家建设事业中的光荣任务和前途，认识了个人利益和阶级利益、眼前利益和长远利益的一致性，克服了冬训开始时的“闹工资”、“闹福利”等现象，并初步开展了批评和自我批评。过去不安心工作想转业的工人不转业了，请长假的人减少了。过去有些工人想赚钱买地，囤粮，开铺子，当“老板”，现在，他们打消了这些错误思想，把余钱都存入国家银行。市建筑工程公司工人范正志说：“我们不应该光看到眼前小利益，必须服从国家长远利益，要知道‘大河有水小河宽，大河没水小河干’。仅八至十五等八个中队，去年十二月二十三日一天内，工人们把余钱存入国家银行就有三千七百九十万元。来自农村的工人还劝说家庭把余粮卖给国家。有一个小组的五个工人写信说服家庭，把七、八担余粮卖给国家。工程师赵福仲没有学习总路线前，也曾主动地学习过苏联先进的塑性理论的设计经验，但是他想材料用多点和自己无关，如果用苏联的塑性理论，房子出了问题，自己还要受处分，因此仍用英美落后的弹性理论进行设计；学习总路线后，他才认识到增产节约是加速国家社会主义工业化的主要方法。因此，检查了去年由于没有按照先进经验设计的四个工程（浪费水泥一百七十六吨），并在这次设计大众剧院时，大胆地采用了塑型设计，估计可节省全部水泥用量百分之二十多。他还说：“我过去认为有了技术就行了，学习了国家过渡时期总路线后，才认识到必须具有高度的政治觉悟，才能提高设计水平，才能做出适合国家建设需要的设计，否则就会犯错误”。
    目前各单位将根据中共中央西北局的指示，启发广大职工，用批评与自我批评的武器，认真检查去年的工作，表扬好的，批评坏的，使职工政治觉悟进一步提高，为作好基本建设工作打下基础。
