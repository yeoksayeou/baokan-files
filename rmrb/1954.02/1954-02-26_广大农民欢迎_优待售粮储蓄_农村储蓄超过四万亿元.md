    The Broad Masses of Farmers Welcome "Preferential Grain Sale Savings"
    Rural Savings Exceed Four Trillion Yuan
   [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In recent months, after selling surplus grain, the broad masses of farmers have actively purchased means of production to expand agricultural production, and enthusiastically participated in "preferential grain sale savings" to accumulate funds for expanding production. The rural savings of the People's Bank have increased sharply. As of the end of January this year, the national rural savings figure reached 4.2 trillion yuan, an increase of approximately 3.4 times compared to the end of November last year; of which, the Northeast region increased by more than 14 times, the North China region increased by 5.7 times, and the Central South region increased by 4.4 times. Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces have overfulfilled their savings plans.
    Farmers in various localities have expressed great gratitude for the government's establishment of "preferential grain sale savings" services to help them systematically accumulate funds from grain sales as capital for spring plowing production. Farmers in Shiligou Village, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, said: If we save the money, we will have a foundation for spring plowing production. The government takes such good care of us, we must produce well.
    In carrying out the "preferential grain sale savings" work, People's Banks in various localities have actively simplified procedures and improved working methods. Cadres from the Hebei Provincial branches and sub-branches of the People's Bank have adopted the method of "backpacking down to the countryside" to collect savings in various villages. People's Banks in many areas of Anhui, Shandong, and other provinces have adopted methods such as "at the station during the day, at the group households at night" and "combining mobility and fixed locations" to facilitate farmers' deposits. This not only smoothly completed the savings plans, but also further strengthened the relationship between farmers and the bank. The savings group of the People's Bank in Masanjiazi Village, a suburb of Shenyang, went deep into the countryside to handle savings business. Wang Jacai, a farmer in the village, said with emotion: "It's so late, and the bank cadres still come to my home to handle savings procedures. This is truly the people's own bank!"
    After the Spring Festival, farmers in some areas have begun to withdraw deposits to purchase means of production. People's Banks in various localities are now actively preparing to carry out payment work. People's Banks in Hubei, Jiangxi, and other places have organized mobile teams to make payments in the countryside, and have entrusted credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives to make payments on their behalf in places where banking institutions are scarce or manpower is insufficient, in order to facilitate farmers' withdrawals. The suburban People's Bank of Beijing has paid out 150 million yuan in farmers' deposits, accounting for about 9 percent of farmers' savings.

    广大农民欢迎“优待售粮储蓄”
    农村储蓄超过四万亿元
   【本报讯】近几月来，广大农民在出售余粮以后，一面积极购买生产资料，扩大农业生产；一面踊跃参加“优待售粮储蓄”，积蓄扩大生产的资金。人民银行的农村储蓄额急剧增加。到今年一月底止，全国农村储蓄数字达四万二千亿元，比去年十一月底约增加三点四倍；其中东北区增加十四倍多，华北区增加五点七倍，中南区增加四点四倍。四川、湖南等省已超额完成了收储计划。
    各地农民对政府举办“优待售粮储蓄”业务，帮助他们有计划地积蓄售粮所得的款项作为春耕生产的资金，表示非常感激。山西省榆次县什里沟的农民说：咱们把款储蓄起来，春耕生产就有了底垫。政府对咱们这样照顾，咱们可得好好生产。
    各地人民银行在开展“优待售粮储蓄”的工作中，积极简化手续，改进工作方法。人民银行河北省各分、支行的干部采用“背包下乡”的办法，到各村流动收储。安徽、山东等省许多地区的人民银行，采用“白天在站点，晚上到组户”、“流动与固定相结合”等办法，便利农民存款。这样既顺利完成了收储计划，同时也进一步密切了农民和银行的关系。沈阳市郊区马三家子村的人民银行储蓄小组，深入农村办理储蓄业务。该村农民王家才感动地说：“天这样晚，银行干部还到我家里办储蓄手续，这真是人民自己的银行！”
    春节以后，有些地区的农民已开始提取存款，购置生产资料。各地人民银行现正积极准备开展兑付工作。湖北、江西等地的人民银行已组织流动小组到农村巡回付款，并在银行机构少或人力不足的地方委托信用合作社、供销合作社代兑，以便利农民取款。北京市郊区人民银行已兑付农民存款一亿五千万元，占农民储蓄额的百分之九左右。
