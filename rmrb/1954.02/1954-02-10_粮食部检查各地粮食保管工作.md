The Ministry of Food Inspects Grain Storage Work in Various Regions

[This Newspaper] Currently, the work of storing public grain has come to an end in various regions, and the grain purchasing work is still ongoing. According to investigations, the public grain stored in various regions generally has high moisture content and many impurities, not meeting the standards set by the Central Ministry of Food. The safe moisture content for stored grain initially proposed by the Central Ministry of Food is generally 13%, the storage moisture content is 13% to 13.5%, and the sun-drying moisture content is generally 16%. However, a large portion of the grain stored in various regions currently exceeds the safe moisture content. For example, the soybeans purchased in Anqing Special District, Anhui Province, generally have a moisture content of 23% to 28%. In Qingpu, Jinshan, Wujiang, and other places in Jiangsu Province, the japonica rice with a moisture content of 25% to 35% accounts for 14.4% of the total purchase. In some areas of Hubei Province, the moisture content of grain is as high as 20% to 30%. The impurity content of the grain stored in various regions is also high. In Yueyang, Shaoyang, Xiangtan, and other places in Hunan Province, more than 20 million catties of stored grain do not meet the standards, with mud and germinated millet accounting for 80%. Due to the high moisture content and many impurities in the public grain stored in various regions, coupled with the dispersed warehouses, poor equipment, or the lack of a strong sense of responsibility among grain storage personnel, grain heating, mold, and insect infestations have occurred in many areas.

In order to urge grain departments at all levels to strengthen grain storage work and to further understand the specific situation of grain storage in grassroots units, the Central Ministry of Food has organized six inspection teams to go to the Northeast, North China, East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest major administrative regions to conduct grain depot inspections and help major administrative regions (provinces) study and solve various specific problems in grain storage.

    粮食部检查各地粮食保管工作
   【本报讯】目前，各地公粮入库工作已经结束，购粮工作还在继续进行。据调查，各地入库公粮一般水分大、杂质多，不合中央粮食部规定的标准。中央粮食部初步提出的入库粮食的安全水分一般为百分之十三，储纳水分为百分之十三至十三点五，翻晒水分一般为百分之十六。但目前各地入库的粮食有很大一部分超过了安全水分。如安徽省安庆专区收购的大豆含水分一般在百分之二十三至二十八。江苏省青浦、金山、吴江等地粳稻含水分在百分之二十五至三十五的竟占收购总数的百分之十四点四。湖北省部分地区粮食的含水量竟高达百分之二十至三十。各地入库粮食含杂量也较大。湖南省岳阳、邵阳、湘潭等地入库粮不合标准的有二千多万斤，其中泥、芽谷子达百分之八十。各地入库公粮由于水分大、杂质多，加上仓库分散，设备较差，或者由于粮食保管人员工作责任心不强，不少地区已发生粮食发热、霉变和生虫等现象。
    中央粮食部为了督促各级粮食部门加强粮食保管工作，同时进一步了解基层单位保管粮食的具体情况，已组织六个检查组分赴东北、华北、华东、中南、西南、西北等大行政区，进行粮库检查，帮助各大行政区（省）研究解决粮食保管上的各项具体问题。
