Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency's Lao dispatch: A communique issued on the 8th by the Lao Resistance Government announced: The Lao People's Liberation Army has liberated Attopeu, the capital of Attopeu Province in southern Laos, and the southeastern part of the Bolaven Plateau.

The communique stated that while launching a large-scale offensive against enemy defenses along the Nam Ou River in northern Laos, the Lao People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the enemy in Attopeu, the capital of Attopeu Province in southern Laos, on January 31. The defending enemy force numbered approximately 600, with a portion distributed among nine outpost strongholds and watchtowers in the suburbs, and the majority stationed in the city of Attopeu.

On the evening of January 31, the Lao People's Liberation Army eliminated the watchtowers and strongholds guarding the French military airport in the suburbs of Attopeu. Simultaneously, another unit of the Lao People's Liberation Army eliminated the French stronghold of Bai Ai (transliteration) located southwest of Attopeu. Consequently, the Lao People's Liberation Army tightly besieged the city.

On the afternoon of February 1, after the Lao People's Liberation Army liberated the main part of the city, the enemy took advantage of the dim twilight to break out of the city and flee north. The Lao People's Liberation Army immediately pursued them. According to the latest news, the Lao People's Liberation Army has caught up with the fleeing enemy and annihilated a portion of them. The Lao national flag is now flying over the capital of Attopeu Province. The Lao people from Bai Ai to the banks of the Kong River north of Attopeu are joyously celebrating this new victory.

The communique stated that the victorious offensive in northern Laos has liberated a vast area from the border near Dien Bien Phu to Luang Prabang, and has connected the Lao people's resistance base in Sam Neua Province with the liberated areas of northwestern Vietnam. The simultaneous liberation of Attopeu and Bai Ai in southern Laos are two of the most important enemy strongholds on the Bolaven Plateau. With the removal of these two enemy strongholds, the southeastern part of the Bolaven Plateau has been completely liberated; the Lao people's resistance base in southern Laos has been further expanded, extending all the way to the northern region of Kon Tum Province in south-central Vietnam, newly liberated by the Vietnam People's Army, and connecting with the liberated area in the southern part of Quang Nam Province in south-central Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Vietnam News Agency, 8th dispatch: On February 1, a unit of the Vietnam People's Army shelled the enemy airport in Dien Bien Phu in northwestern Vietnam, destroying two enemy aircraft. On February 6, another unit of the Vietnam People's Army shot down an enemy aircraft near Dien Bien Phu. The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army has awarded the two People's Army units with the Third-Class Military Service Medal.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: Under the victorious offensive of the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, the morale of the Bao Dai puppet army is disintegrating, especially in South Vietnam where serious phenomena of lack of fighting spirit are constantly occurring.

According to United Press, in recent weeks, more and more Bao Dai puppet soldiers have defected to the Vietnam People's Army. French South Vietnamese strongholds recently captured by the Vietnam People's Army, "half of which were lost due to mutiny or desertion by the defending forces." United Press admitted: "This has caused a great crisis in the morale of the French Union forces." The Bao Dai puppet army's trend of collapse at the mere sight of the enemy has caused "serious anxiety" to the French government and also caused anxiety to the American interventionists. On the 4th, "American military officials" admitted: "Due to the abandonment of several military strongholds in southern Vietnam without any resistance, the (American) government frankly expressed anxiety about the morale of the Indochina Vietnamese army (i.e., the Bao Dai puppet army)."

    寮国解放军解放阿速坡省省会阿速坡
    全部解放了波罗芬高原东南部，扩大了抗战基地
   【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社寮国讯：寮国抗战政府八日发表的公报宣布：寮国人民解放军已解放寮国南部阿速坡省省会阿速坡及波罗芬高原的东南部。
    公报说，寮国人民解放军在对寮国北部南乌江沿岸的敌军防线发动大规模攻势的同时，在一月三十一日对寮国南部阿速坡省省会的敌军发动进攻。防守的敌军约有六百名，除一部分敌军分布在城郊的九个前哨据点和了望塔外，大部敌军驻守在阿速坡城中。
    一月三十一日晚，寮国人民解放军在阿速坡城郊拔除了守卫法军机场的了望塔和据点；同时，另一路寮国人民解放军部队拔除了位于阿速坡西南的法军据点拜爱（译音）。于是，寮国人民解放军将这个城市紧紧地包围起来。
    二月一日下午，当寮国人民解放军解放了该城的主要部分后，敌军乘暮色苍茫的时机突出城外往北逃窜。寮国人民解放军随即跟踪追击。据最后消息说，寮国人民解放军已追上逃敌，并歼灭了部分敌军。寮国的国旗现已飘扬在阿速坡省省会的上空。从拜爱到阿速坡北部的公河沿岸一带的寮国人民正在欢欣地庆祝这个新的胜利。
    公报说，寮国北部的胜利攻势，已使从奠边府附近边境到琅勃剌邦之间的广大地区获得解放，并使寮国人民的抗战基地桑怒省和越南西北部的解放区连成一片。这次同时解放了的寮国南部的阿速坡和拜爱，是波罗芬高原上的两个最重要的敌军据点。这两个敌军据点被拔除后，波罗芬高原的东南部就全部解放了；寮国南部人民的抗战基地更加扩大了，一直伸展到越南人民军新解放的中越南部昆嵩省的北部地区，并和中越南部的广南省南部的解放区连成一片。
   【新华社九日讯】越南通讯社八日讯：二月一日，一支越南人民军部队炮轰越南西北地区奠边府的敌军机场，击毁敌机两架。二月六日，另一支越南人民军部队在奠边府近郊击落敌机一架。越南人民军总司令部已授予这两支人民军部队以三级军功章。
   【新华社六日讯】在越南人民武装胜利的攻势之下，保大伪军士气涣散，特别是在南越不断发生严重的士无斗志的现象。
    据合众社透露，最近几个星期，有愈来愈多的保大伪军投向越南人民军。最近被越南人民军攻占的法军南越据点，“其中有一半是由于守军叛变或逃跑而失守的”。合众社承认：“这使法兰西联邦军的士气发生很大的危机”。保大伪军望风披靡的颓势，已使法国政府感到“严重不安”，也使美国干涉者感到焦虑。“美国军界人士”四日承认：“由于越南南部有若干军事据点未作什么抵抗就放弃了，（美国）政府直率地对印度支那越南军队（即保大伪军）的士气表示焦虑。”
