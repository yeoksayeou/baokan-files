Xinhua News Agency:

    Northeast China will undertake large-scale mechanical industry construction this year. There are dozens of mechanical industry construction projects this year, with eight being key projects. Among the key projects are the newly built First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, and the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, which began construction in the past two years and will be undergoing larger-scale construction this year; and the reconstructed or expanded Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, and Shenyang Wire Factory. Additionally, there are the newly built Harbin Boiler Factory and Harbin Electric Meter & Instrument Factory, which will begin construction this year. Except for the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, these projects are all part of the Soviet Union's aid to our country's construction projects.
    After the completion of these important mechanical and electrical factories in Northeast China, they will manufacture a large number of high-quality machinery, electrical equipment, materials, and tools for the country's industry, agriculture, and transportation sectors. For example, after the completion of the expansion of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, it will produce thousands of precision, high-speed machine tools every year. After the Harbin Boiler Factory and the Electric Meter & Instrument Factory go into production, they can manufacture a large number of high-pressure boilers and millions of various precision electric meters, instruments, and meters every year. These two factories, together with the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, can manufacture complete sets of power generation equipment, providing power equipment for our country's industry under construction. After the completion of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, it will produce a large number of riveting machines, rock drills, pneumatic picks, and other production tools powered by compressed air. These are important tools for constructing factories, bridges, manufacturing trains, automobiles, ships, and mining. After the completion of the expansion of the Shenyang Wire Factory, it will supply various wires and cables needed for telecommunications, power transmission, and transportation equipment to factories, mines, and urban construction across the country. After the completion of the new First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, a large number of domestically produced automobiles will be manufactured to meet the needs of construction.
    These mechanical industry construction projects in Northeast China are not only large in scale but also technologically advanced. The newly built First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will install the world's most advanced equipment of various types during the construction process. After the completion of this factory, the entire factory will become a large-scale assembly line operation connected from the air to the ground by conveyor belts. After the completion of the newly built Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, several huge production workshops will be equipped with the world's first-class equipment. The three reconstructed or expanded factories—Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, and Shenyang Wire Factory—will fundamentally change the unbalanced equipment, low output, few product varieties, and harsh labor conditions caused by the old backward design after reconstruction or expansion. After the expansion of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, the number of production workshops in the entire plant will increase to more than a dozen, and various new equipment supplied by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic will be installed. The production capacity of the entire plant will be six times higher than it is now. After the reconstruction and expansion of the Shenyang Wire Factory, the number of modern workshops will increase to more than twenty, the number of product types in the entire factory will increase to twenty-five, and the production capacity will increase five to twelve times compared to now.
    According to the national plan, these large-scale and technologically complex factories will be completed in a short period of time. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory and the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory will be put into production this year. The Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, and the Shenyang Wire Factory will also be largely or partially completed and partially put into production this year.

    东北区进行大规模机械工业建设
    【新华社讯】东北区今年将进行大规模的机械工业建设。今年机械工业建设的项目共有数十个，有八项是重点工程。在重点工程中，包括前年和去年已经动工、今年将进行更大规模施工的新建第一汽车制造厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、哈尔滨电机厂、改建或扩建的沈阳第一机床厂、沈阳风动工具厂、沈阳电线厂，以及今年将开始动工的新建哈尔滨锅炉厂、哈尔滨电表仪器厂等。这些工程，除哈尔滨电机厂外，都是属于苏联帮助我国建设的工程项目。
    东北区这批重要的机械、电器工厂建设完成以后，将为全国工业、农业和交通运输业制造大量优良的机械、电气设备、器材和工具。如沈阳第一机床厂扩建工程完工后，每年将生产数千台精密的、高速度的机床。哈尔滨锅炉厂、电表仪器厂投入生产后，每年可制造大量高压锅炉和数以百万件计的各种精密的电表、计器和仪器。这两个工厂和哈尔滨电机厂等配合起来，便可制造成套的发电设备，为正在建设中的我国工业提供动力装备。沈阳风动工具厂建设完工后，将大量生产铆钉机、凿岩机、风镐等以压缩空气作动力的生产工具。这些都是建筑厂房、桥梁，制造火车、汽车、轮船，以及开凿矿山的重要工具。扩建的沈阳电线厂完工后，将供应全国各地工厂、矿山、城市建设以大量的电讯、送电、交通设备所需要的各种电线和电缆。新建第一汽车厂完工后，我国自产的汽车将会大量地制造出来，供应建设的需要。
    东北区这批机械工业建设工程，不仅规模巨大，而且技术设备也非常先进。新建的第一汽车制造厂，在建厂过程中要安装世界上最新式的各种设备。这个工厂建成以后，全厂将成为从空中到地下全用运输带联结起来的大流水作业整体。新建哈尔滨量具刃具厂建成后，几个巨大的生产车间都将用世界上第一流的设备装备起来。三个改建或扩建的工厂——沈阳第一机床厂、沈阳风动工具厂、沈阳电线厂，经过改建或扩建，也将从根本上改变旧有落后设计给它们造成的设备不平衡、产量低、生产品种少、劳动条件恶劣的情况。沈阳第一机床厂扩建以后，全厂生产车间将增加到十几个，并且都要安装苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国供应的各种新式设备。全厂生产能力将比现在提高六倍。沈阳电线厂改建和扩建以后，现代化的车间将增加到二十多个，全厂产品种类将增加到二十五种，生产能力也要比现在提高五倍到十二倍。
    根据国家计划，这些规模宏大、技术复杂的工厂，都将在短期间内建成。哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂今年便要投入生产。哈尔滨电机厂、第一汽车制造厂、沈阳第一机床厂、沈阳电线厂等，也将在今年大部或部分建成，并局部进行生产。
