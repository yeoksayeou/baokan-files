    Beware of Deceptive Practices by Illegal Private Merchants
    Liu Xinhua of the Second Sanatorium of Liaoxi Province writes: The letter from the General Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government published in the People's Daily on January 24th exposed the illegal activities of Beijing's private Lianhua Linji Art Supply Cooperative (hereinafter referred to as Lianhua) in cutting corners and stealing state assets. These facts clearly show that it is absolutely necessary to raise vigilance against the "five poisons" behavior of illegal private industrial and commercial households.
    I have also dealt with Lianhua in the past. Before the "May Day" holiday last year, I went to Lianhua to purchase portraits of great figures. This private merchant boasted about the large scale and high quality of the portraits supplied by their cooperative.... A giant portrait five feet wide and eight feet high was priced at 1.3 million yuan; later they said that each portrait would only cost 800,000 yuan, and I could enjoy a 20% discount if I paid the full amount in advance. At that time, I noticed their cunningness and did not fall for it. Later, I went to the Siwei Art Studio, a private business on Di'anmen Street, to order portraits. In order to guard against their "five poisons" behavior, I only paid a deposit of one million yuan and signed a small contract. Because I did not go through a trust company (at that time I did not know that I should do so), the goods delivered were mostly substandard. Because I had not paid the full amount, the private merchant had no choice but to send someone to Northeast China by train to rework the portraits. I believe that these facts should attract the attention of procurement personnel in state organs in various places; and I suggest that the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce should strengthen education and leadership for these merchants to curb the deceptive and illegal behavior of illegal merchants.

### 警惕不法私商的欺骗行为

专栏：读者来信摘要

    警惕不法私商的欺骗行为
    辽西省第二疗养院刘辛华来信：一月二十四日人民日报所刊北京市人民政府秘书厅的来信中，揭发了北京市私营联华林记艺术供应社（以下简称联华）偷工减料、盗窃国家财富的不法行为。从这些事实中，可以清楚地看到：提高对不法私营工商业户的警惕，防止他们的“五毒”行为，是十分必要的。
    我过去也和联华打过交道。去年“五一”节前，我到联华购买伟人像。这家私商就吹嘘他们供应社的规模大、画像质量高……，一幅五尺宽、八尺高的巨像要价一百三十万元；后来又说每幅只要八十万元，让我付足全部货款，就可按八折优待。当时我发现他们的奸狡情况，就没有上当。后来我到地安门大街私营四维美工社订做，为了警惕他们的“五毒”行为，我只付了一百万元订款，签了一张小合同。由于没有通过信托公司（那时我不知道应当这样做），结果所交的货大部不合标准。因为没有把款付足，私商才不得不派人坐火车到东北来重新加工。我认为，这些事实应该引起各地国家机关采购人员注意；并建议北京市工商行政管理部门对这些商人加强教育和领导，以制止不法商人的欺骗违法行为。
