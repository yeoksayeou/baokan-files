    Jiangsu Provincial Monopoly Business Corporation Tries Brewing Liquor with Non-Grain Raw Materials; Annually Saves Over Ten Million Jin of Grain
    To meet the requirements of saving grain and ensuring market supply, the Jiangsu Provincial Corporation of the China Monopoly Business Corporation, starting in the second quarter of 1953, organized breweries and sideline brewing households to learn techniques from each other, promoted the production of liquor from non-staple grains, and actively organized various localities to find products containing starch, sugar, and cellulose to experiment with brewing. Since August of last year, various localities, adhering to the spirit of "using local materials," have successfully experimented with brewing using rotten sweet potatoes, grass seeds, arrowhead, water caltrop, artemisia seeds, gorgon fruit, and vegetable juice. Currently, the four types of water caltrop, arrowhead, gorgon fruit, and artemisia seeds have begun mass production. According to preliminary estimates, brewing liquor with these four types of raw materials can produce more than five million jin of 46-proof liquor annually, saving more than ten million jin of grain per year.
    According to the trial production of the Suzhou Branch of the China Monopoly Business Corporation, every hundred jin of water caltrop meat can brew seventeen jin of 46-proof liquor. It is estimated that thirty million jin of water caltrop can be purchased annually as raw material. Every hundred jin of water caltrop can yield fifty-seven jin of water caltrop meat. Calculating based on the standard of seventeen jin of liquor produced per hundred jin of water caltrop meat, two million nine hundred thousand jin of 46-proof water caltrop liquor can be produced annually, saving approximately four million seven hundred thousand jin of red sorghum or five million eight hundred thousand jin of barley. Arrowhead brewing was successfully trialed by the Baoying Wholesale Department of the China Monopoly Business Corporation. Every hundred jin of arrowhead can produce seven to nine and a half jin of 46-proof liquor. Due to the difficulty in preserving arrowhead, approximately twenty million jin can be purchased annually. Calculating based on nine and a half jin of liquor produced per hundred jin, more than one million nine hundred thousand jin of liquor can be brewed, replacing more than three million several hundred thousand jin of red sorghum.
    Gorgon fruit can be used to brew Daqu liquor. The Zhenjiang Procurement and Supply Wholesale Station of the Jiangsu Provincial Monopoly Business Corporation trialed it, with the result that every hundred jin of gorgon fruit produces forty-eight jin and two liang of 62-proof flour liquor. Gorgon fruit has a large yield, and approximately two million jin can be purchased annually, which can produce approximately one million jin of 62-proof Qu liquor, which can replace two million two hundred thousand jin of red sorghum.
    Artemisia seeds are the seeds of artemisia annua (also known as Qinghao), and are abundant in Gaoyou Lake, and are also produced in water network areas such as Lingtang and Minta. According to the trial brewing of the Gaoyou Wholesale Department of the China Monopoly Business Corporation, every hundred jin of raw materials can produce fifty-three jin of 46-proof liquor, and can brew 60- to 70-proof liquor. Currently, artemisia seeds in Gaoyou Lake alone can be purchased for about six hundred thousand jin, which can brew more than three hundred thousand jin of 46-proof liquor, which can replace about six hundred thousand jin of red sorghum. The Jiangsu Provincial Monopoly Business Corporation has now summarized these experiences, promoted them, and called on various localities to continue trial brewing in order to better save grain.

    江苏省专卖事业公司试用非粮食原料酿酒
    每年可节约粮食一千多万斤
    中国专卖事业公司江苏省公司试用非粮食原料酿酒成功，每年可节约粮食一千余万斤。
    中国专卖事业公司江苏省公司在节约粮食和保证市场供应的要求下，从一九五三年第二季度开始，组织酿坊和副业酿户互相学习技术，推广非主要粮食制酒，并积极组织各地寻找含有淀粉、糖质和纤维素的产品试验酿酒。从去年八月份以来，各地本“就地取材”的精神，使用了烂山芋、草子、茨菇、菱角、蒿苗籽、芡实和青菜汁等试酿已经成功。现已开始大量生产的有菱角、茨菇、芡实和蒿苗籽四种。根据初步估计，用这四种原料酿酒每年可产四十六度烧酒五百多万斤，一年就可以节约粮食一千余万斤。
    根据中国专卖事业公司苏州支公司试制的情况，每百斤菱肉可酿四十六度烧酒十七斤，估计每年可收购三千万斤菱角作原料，每百斤菱角可剥五十七斤菱肉，按每百斤菱肉出酒十七斤的标准来计算，每年可产四十六度菱角酒二百九十万斤，约可节省四百七十万斤红粮或五百八十万斤大麦。茨菇酿酒是中国专卖事业公司宝应批发部试酿成功的，每百斤茨菇可产四十六度烧酒七斤到九斤半，由于茨菇保存困难，每年约可收购二千万斤，按每百斤出酒九斤半计算，则可酿酒一百九十余万斤，可代替三百数十余万斤红粮。
    芡实可酿大曲酒，江苏省专卖事业公司镇江采购供应批发站试酿的结果，每百斤芡实产六十二度面酒四十八斤二两。芡实产量很大，每年可收购二百余万斤，可制六十二度曲酒一百万斤左右，能代替二百二十万斤红粮。
    蒿苗籽即蒿苗（亦称蒿白）的种子，盛产高邮湖中，菱塘、闵塔等水网区亦有出产。根据中国专卖事业公司高邮批发部的试酿，每百斤原料，可产四十六度烧酒五十三斤。且可酿六十度到七十度的酒。目前仅高邮湖的蒿苗籽即可收购六十万斤左右，可酿四十六度烧酒三十万斤以上，约可代替六十万斤红粮。现江苏省专卖事业公司，已总结了这些经验，加以推广，并且号召各地继续试酿，以便更好地节约粮食。（陈宗英）
