Xinhua News Agency, Guisui, February 27th: Representatives from all ethnic groups and sectors in Suiyuan Province warmly endorsed the resolution passed by the first session of the third Suiyuan Provincial People's Representatives Conference regarding the merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia.

	Sun Lanfeng, Vice Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, said: The merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia will enhance the understanding of all ethnic groups regarding Chairman Mao's great ethnic policies and further strengthen unity among them. It will also strengthen unified leadership, streamline administrative organs, and transfer cadres to industrial construction. Ali Benbayaner (Mongolian), a People's Representative from the Ikh Zhao League, said: The Mongolian and Han people of our Ikh Zhao League welcome this move. This is not only because the Mongolian and Suiyuan regions have had close historical and geographical ties in the past, but especially because it is greatly beneficial to the future construction and development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In the past, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Mongolian and Han people established close ethnic relations. Through the joint efforts of the Mongolian and Han people, the autonomous region was established and developed. In the future, under the unified leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, our ethnic groups will be even more united and work together to transition to a socialist society. Bai Zhenduo, a Hui representative, said: This measure is fully in line with the interests of all ethnic groups, and we, the Hui people, express our heartfelt support. Tang Zhaoxing, a first-class industrial labor model from Baotou City, said: To realize national industrialization, we must rely on the joint efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country to accomplish this great task. The merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia will further unleash the enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups in building the motherland. In the future, we must help the ethnic minorities develop like brothers and sisters and transition to a socialist society together. Guo Laohu, a renowned agricultural production cooperative director, stated: I think the merger has many benefits. The Mongolian and Han people will be more closely united, working together to build our country more beautifully, and the lives of our farmers will be better. Mongolian women representatives said: After the liberation of Suiyuan, Chairman Mao sent doctors to treat Mongolian women, allowing sisters who had been unable to bear children for many years on the grasslands to hold healthy babies. This merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia will further help the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities develop in all aspects. Ren Cuifeng, a representative from the Suiyuan Provincial literary and art circles, and Li Shilin, a representative from the scientific community, both believe that the merger of the two regions will further promote the development of cultural arts and scientific undertakings of all ethnic groups. Akewang Danseng, Living Buddha of the Zhalagen Temple in Hangjin Banner, Ikh Zhao League, said: Through this joyous event, we realize the fundamental difference between the old and new societies. We lamas warmly support the merger of the two regions and are willing to abide by the laws of the government and work together with the people of all ethnic groups to build the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    绥远人民拥护绥远和内蒙古合并
    【新华社归绥二十七日电】绥远省各族各界代表热烈拥护省第一届第三次各界人民代表会议关于绥远和内蒙古合并的决议。
    绥远省人民政府副主席孙兰峰说：绥远和内蒙古的合并，将提高各民族人民对毛主席伟大民族政策的认识，进一步加强各民族间的团结；同时将会加强统一领导，精简行政机构，抽调干部转入工业建设。伊克昭盟人民代表阿利本巴彦尔（蒙族）说：我们伊克昭盟的蒙、汉人民都欢迎这样作，这不仅因为蒙绥地区在历史上、地理上过去有着密切的关系，特别是对今后内蒙古自治区的建设和发展有很大好处。过去，在共产党的领导下，蒙汉人民建立了亲密的民族关系，在蒙汉人民共同的努力下，建立和发展了自治区，今后在内蒙古自治区人民政府统一的领导下，我们各民族更加团结，共同努力，一道过渡到社会主义社会。回族白振铎说：这一措施是完全符合各族人民利益的，我们回族人民表示衷心的拥护。包头市一等工业劳动模范唐兆兴说：要实现国家工业化，必须依靠全国各民族人民的共同努力，才能完成这个伟大的任务。绥远和内蒙古的合并，将会进一步发挥各民族人民建设祖国的热情。今后我们一定要像亲兄弟一样来帮助少数民族发展，共同过渡到社会主义社会。著名的农业生产合作社主任郭老虎表示：我觉得合并的好处非常多，蒙汉人民将更紧密团结，同心协力地把咱们国家建设得更美满，我们农民的生活也会过得更好。蒙族妇女代表们说：绥远解放后，毛主席派来了医生给我们蒙族妇女治病，使草原上多年不生养的姐妹们抱起胖娃娃了。这次绥远和内蒙古合并，更会帮助蒙族和其他各少数民族在各方面得到发展。绥远省文艺界代表任翠凤和科学界代表李士林都认为两地合并，将更促进各民族文化艺术和科学事业的发展。伊克昭盟杭锦旗扎拉根庙活佛阿克旺丹僧说：通过这件令人喜悦的大事，我们就觉到新旧社会的根本不同，我们喇嘛热烈拥护两个地区的合并，并愿遵守政府的法令，和各族人民共同为建设内蒙古自治区而努力。
