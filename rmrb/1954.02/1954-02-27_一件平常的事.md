Title: An Ordinary Thing

It happened one morning. Deputy Instructor Li Guozhang met Aunt Zhao from the village outside the company headquarters. Aunt Zhao said:
	"Instructor, please ask for Gao Zesheng's cotton coat, I want to take it apart and wash it."

The village was preparing to take apart and wash the soldiers' cotton coats these past two days. But why did Aunt Zhao specifically ask to take apart and wash Gao Zesheng's? The deputy instructor couldn't figure it out for a moment. So he chatted with Aunt Zhao while thinking about it. Aunt Zhao began by saying: "Kindness must be repaid! Giving gifts, I know you definitely won't accept them; I'll do some sewing and mending for you, to express my feelings a little!"

Then, Aunt Zhao told this story: Back when the artillery company first arrived in Gucheng Village, it was summer, and the continuous rain often caused the Danjiang River to flood. One afternoon, Gao Zesheng, the company's communicator, took a shirt to wash by the river. Beside him was a child, about six or seven years old, who was also playing with a piece of torn cloth in the water. Gao Zesheng recognized him as Aunt Zhao's child from the village, named Fa-Liang.

The child innocently stared at the tree roots and leaves floating on the water, rolling around in the reddish-brown muddy water, completely engrossed. At some point, the small piece of torn cloth in the child's hand was washed away by the river.

Suddenly, the child didn't even have time to scream before being swept into the water by the waves crashing against the riverbank.

Gao Zesheng heard the sound of falling water, and when he turned around sharply, he didn't see the child, only a foot flashing in the swirling vortex, quickly disappearing. So, he hurriedly threw down the clothes in his hand, took off his shoes, and plunged into the water. The water wasn't very deep, but the current was rapid. He managed to grab the child, pulled him with all his might, and climbed ashore covered in mud. Fortunately, he acted quickly and rescued the child. When he carried the frightened child back to Aunt Zhao, he wrung the water out of his clothes and said, "Auntie! You have to be careful in the future! Don't let the child play by the river alone again!" Aunt Zhao stroked the child's head, listened to Gao Zesheng, and felt grateful and ashamed. When Gao Zesheng bent down to pick up his shoes and pour out the mud, Aunt Zhao said, "Take off your clothes, I'll..." Gao Zesheng didn't even wait for her to finish speaking before turning around and running away.

The water of the Danjiang River flows silently eastward day and night. Half a year has passed. This incident had gradually faded from Gao Zesheng's memory. It wasn't until last night, when the deputy instructor talked to him and mentioned the incident, that he remembered it again.

"Why didn't you report it to the squad leader at the time?" the deputy instructor asked kindly, with a tone that was more surprise than blame.

"About this matter," Gao Zesheng said reasonably, "I really didn't think about reporting it at the time. I felt it was something I should do, an ordinary thing, and didn't need to be reported. If I or someone else did something wrong, I would definitely report it."

"Doesn't doing what you should do need to be reported?" the deputy instructor retorted. But when he noticed the embarrassed look on Gao Zesheng's face, he immediately changed his tone: "Do you often think about this incident?"

"I do, when I see that child Fa-Liang jumping and playing, when I see children in groups going in and out of the school gate, I suddenly remember that I saved Fa-Liang as if it happened only yesterday."

The deputy instructor calmly asked him, "What do you think?"

Gao Zesheng seemed a little uneasy in front of the deputy instructor. Such a question was not easy to answer, but he finally said the following: "Children, how adorable! Their current happiness makes me envious and proud. Compared to my childhood, it's like heaven and earth. As for me saving the child, it's something a people's soldier and a Youth League member should do. Doing this makes me feel honored." He seemed even more humble and excited at the end.

The deputy instructor looked at this eighteen-year-old young soldier, who came from a poor rural family in the old society and grew up under the education of the Party after liberation, and smiled.

    一件平常的事
    王倪
    这天上午，副指导员李国章在连部大门外遇见了村里的赵大娘。赵大娘说：
      “指导员：请把高泽生的棉衣要来，我给他拆洗。”
    村里这两天正酝酿着要给部队拆洗棉衣。但赵大娘为什么偏偏提出要给高泽生拆洗呢？副指导员一时想不透。于是边想边和赵大娘闲谈起来。赵大娘开口就说：“恩情要报呵！送点儿东西吧，我知道你们一定不肯收；我给你们缝缝补补，表表我一点儿心吧！”
    接着，赵大娘便说出了这样一件事：还是炮兵连刚到古城村的时候，正是夏天，连绵的霪雨使得丹江河常常涨水。一天下午，连部通讯员高泽生拿了件衬衣到河边去洗，旁边有一个大约六七岁的孩子，拿了块破布片也在洗着玩。高泽生认得这是村里赵大娘的孩子，名叫发亮。
    孩子天真地出神地望着水面上飘着的树根、树叶，在发红的泥水里打滚。不知什么时候，孩子手里的那块小破布片，被河水冲得远远的了。
    突然，孩子连叫喊一声都没来的及，便随着冲击着河岸的浪头，栽到水里去了。
    高泽生听见了落水的声响，猛回头一看，没有孩子，只见在翻滚的漩涡里有只脚一闪，很快又不见了。于是，他急忙甩掉手里的衣服脱下鞋子，扑到水里去了。水不太深，但却是急流。他好容易抓住了孩子，用力地拖住，带着一身泥水爬上了岸。多亏他的动作迅速，救出了孩子，当他把吓昏了的孩子抱回去交给赵大娘时，一边拧着衣服上的水，一边说：“大娘！以后可得小心啊！别再让孩子自个儿到河边去玩啦！”赵大娘抚摸着孩子的头，听着高泽生说着，心里又感激，又惭愧。等高泽生弯下腰提起鞋子倒泥水时，赵大娘说：“你把衣服脱下来，我……”高泽生还没等她说完，就回过头跑了。
    丹江的水，日夜不停地静静地向东流着。半年过去了。这件事在高泽生的记忆里已日渐淡漠了。直到昨天晚上，副指导员找他谈话时，提起了这件事，他才又重新想了起来。
    “你当时为什么不向班长汇报呢？”副指导员带着与其说是责备倒不如说是惊异的语气亲切地问。
    “关于这件事”，高泽生满有理似地说，“我当时的确没想到要汇报。我觉得这是我应该做的事，也是一件平常的事，不需要汇报，要是我或是别人做错了一件事，无论如何我是要汇报的。”
      “难道做了应该做的事就不需要汇报吗？”副指导员反问了一句。但当他发觉高泽生脸上有些窘的样子时，就马上改了口气：“你经常想起这件事吗？”
    “想起的，当我看见发亮那孩子跳跳蹦蹦玩耍时，当我看见孩子们成群结队的在学校门口出出进进时，我就突然想起我救发亮那孩子好像是昨天才发生过的一样。”
    副指导员平静地问他：“你怎么想的？”
    高泽生在副指导员面前显得有些不安。这样的问题不太好答复，但他终于说了以下的话：“孩子们，真可爱呵！他们现在的幸福，真使我羡慕而感到骄傲。和我小时候比起来，真是一个天上，一个地下。至于我救孩子的事，这是一个人民战士、青年团员应做的事。做这事，使我感到光荣。”他说到最后，更显的谦虚而激动。
    副指导员望着这个十八岁的青年战士，出身于旧社会苦难的农村中，解放以后，在党的教育下成长起来的青年战士，笑了。
