    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th. TASS reports from Dusseldorf, according to the German News Agency, the Central Executive Committee of the German Communist Party issued a call on the 5th for all Germans to rise up and resolutely demand a nationwide referendum, as suggested by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, "to see whether the German people support the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, or a peace treaty?" This practice of allowing the German people to make a free decision can promote agreement between the people of eastern and western Germany and create excellent preconditions for free, secret, equal, and democratic elections throughout Germany. Anyone who does not advocate this free and democratic decision by the German people does not respect the German national right to self-determination and is an enemy of freedom and peace.
    The Central Executive Committee of the German Communist Party firmly believes that in a nationwide referendum, the people of eastern and western Germany will certainly vote against military treaties that lead to death and in favor of peace. Past public opinion polls against militarism and in favor of a peace treaty have already proven this point.

    德共号召德国人民要求举行全德公民投票
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社柏林讯：据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息，德国共产党中央执行委员会于五日号召全体德国人起来坚决要求举行苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫在四外长会议上建议的全德公民投票，“看看德国人民究竟是拥护波恩条约和巴黎条约呢，还是拥护和约呢？”这种由德国人民作自由决定的做法，可以促使德国东部和西部的人民达成协议，可以为举行全德的自由、秘密、平等和民主的选举创造优良的先决条件。谁不主张由德国人作这种自由的和民主的决定，谁就是不尊重德国的民族自决权，谁就是自由与和平的敌人。
    德国共产党中央执行委员会坚信，在举行全德公民投票时，德国东部和西部的人民一定会投票反对招致死亡的军事条约而拥护和平。过去举行过的反对军国主义和拥护和约的民意测验已经证明了这一点。
