    The Hungarian National Mixed Team has won the title of world champion and defeated the British professional football team mixed team, which had been "invincible" for ninety years, in November 1953, shattering the myth of the "kingdom of football."

    Shortly after the start of the first half, the Hungarian team's high level of technical skill was revealed. Under the general principle of "striving for a shot," they adopted simple movements and rapid zone attacks. Nine minutes after the start, forward Jinqieshi broke through the defense line of the Central Institute of Physical Education team and quickly passed the ball to another forward, Paqituoer, who kicked it into the goal. At this time, the audience applauded warmly. Next, the Hungarian team increasingly and frequently attacked the penalty area of the Central Institute of Physical Education team. The Hungarian team's players ran fast, and their short-distance passing and dribbling were both stable and fast, launching multiple attacks in succession. However, the Central Institute of Physical Education team advanced step by step, heading off and intercepting, turning danger into safety. Fourteen minutes after the start, Hungarian team forward Sucha passed the ball from behind to Baob尔查伊, who immediately passed it to Warnai, who cleverly dribbled the ball forward and suddenly shot towards the goal. Central Institute of Physical Education team goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu leaped up and saved the dangerous ball with excellent movements, earning high praise from the audience.

    In the second half, the Central Institute of Physical Education team attacked more frequently than in the first half, breaking through the Hungarian team's defense line several times and directly attacking the goal, but it was saved by the Hungarian team's goalkeeper. Sometimes the two sides were in a tug-of-war, with the ball going south and north, and the offense and defense changing frequently. The audience cheered constantly for the wonderful performance of both sides. Nineteen minutes later, a touching scene appeared in the Central Institute of Physical Education team's attack. Forward Xuan Longnan stubbornly and skillfully intercepted the opponent's ball and immediately passed it to another forward, Chen Chengda. Chen Chengda sprinted forward and kicked hard, sending the ball flying towards the opponent's goal. However, the opponent's goalkeeper used a skilled movement to deflect it to the side, sending the ball out of bounds. Soon after, the Central Institute of Physical Education team's goal was again surrounded by the Hungarian team's attack. The Hungarian team's players were crisscrossing within the Central Institute of Physical Education team's penalty area. Suddenly, midfielder Vadaci intercepted a ball coming from the flank, quickly turned around, and shot the ball into the net. After that, the Central Institute of Physical Education team strictly defended, thwarting the Hungarian team's offensive again and again. Goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu repeatedly saved dangerous balls with excellent skills such as catching the ball in the air and intercepting the ball with a horizontal dive.

    The match was conducted in a friendly atmosphere, and the result was 2-0, with the Hungarian team winning.

    On the afternoon of the 15th, the Hungarian National Mixed Football Team and the China Railway Sports Association (hereinafter referred to as the Railway) Football Team held a wonderful friendly match at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium. The Hungarian team players demonstrated skilled techniques and a high degree of cooperation in the match, resulting in a 4-0 victory.

    Railway employees in our country have a wide interest in football. After carefully observing and learning from the football match between the Hungarian team and the Central Institute of Physical Education team on the 14th, the Railway team players who played on the 15th studied tactics and fully demonstrated a brave and tenacious fighting will in the match.

    At 2 pm, the match began, and the Hungarian team took the advantage. After getting the ball, they used the triangular short-distance passing method to start the attack. Around 2:10, the ball was intercepted by Sucha, the Hungarian team's main attacking forward; the Railway team players quickly pounced, but Sucha adopted a feint tactic, pretending to pass the ball first, cleverly avoiding the surveillance of the Railway team's defenders, and then kicked hard, sending the ball into the net. Thirty minutes later, Sucha shot another goal. The audience in the stands applauded warmly. Subsequently, the Hungarian team brought the ball to the penalty area several times. The Railway team adopted a strategy of defense first and appropriate offense. The defenders defended tightly, and midfielder Gao Baozheng intercepted the opponent's attacking ball many times, with exceptionally flexible movements, effectively curbing the opponent's offensive. He won applause and cheers from the audience. The first half ended with a score of 2-0, with the Hungarian team taking the lead.

    Not long after the start of the second half, Hungarian team forward Bala scored a goal, and the battle entered a tense stage. The Hungarian team players' passing and dribbling movements were flexible, and they used various feints to confuse the opponent. For most of the second half, the ball hovered in the Railway team's half. The morale of the Railway team players became stronger as they fought. They also used short-passing methods to repeatedly attack the opponent's goal, but the ball was blocked by the Hungarian team players with flexible movements. When Railway team forward Xiao Ziwen shot hard, the audience thought it would go into the net, but the opponent's goalkeeper, Durai, leaped up and saved the dangerous ball. Near the end of the match, the Hungarian team players passed the ball to the opponent's penalty area. Just as they were vying for the ball in a tense situation, Hungarian team player Vadaci cleverly rushed up and headed the ball into the goal. At the end of the match, the Hungarian team won 4-0.

    During the match, the Chinese and Hungarian players demonstrated excellent new sportsmanship. Players automatically raised their hands when they committed fouls, and both sides respected the referee's decisions. When Hungarian team forward Kish and Railway team midfielder Gao Baozheng collided while fighting for the ball, both immediately helped each other up and shook hands in apology. This noble act of friendship left a deep impression on the audience. (Xinhua News Agency)

    匈牙利全国混合队曾荣获世界冠军的称号，并在一九五三年十一月击败了九十年来所谓“立于不败之地”的英国职业足球队混合队，粉碎了“足球王国”的神话。该队现正在埃及进行球赛。来我国的这一队，是它的兄弟队之一。参加十四日的比赛的匈牙利全国混合队的阵容如下：球门：朱·佩斯蒂。后卫：约·孔尼亚，尼·汉尼，扬·科瓦奇。中卫：乔·佩斯蒂，瓦达奇。前锋：金切什，帕奇托尔，苏查，瓦尔纳伊，包波尔查伊。

    在上半时开场后不久，匈牙利队的高度技术水平就显示出来了。他们在“争取射门”这个总的原则下，采用简捷的动作和快速的区域攻法。开场后九分钟，前锋金切什突破中央体育学院队的防线，迅速把球传给另一前锋帕奇托尔而踢入一球，这时，观众报以热烈的鼓掌。接着，匈牙利队越来越频繁地攻入中央体育学院队的罚球区域。匈牙利队的球员跑得快，短距离的传球、带球，既稳又快，接连举行多次进攻。但中央体育学院队步步为营，头顶脚截，化险为夷。开场后十四分钟，匈牙利队前锋苏查从后面把球带给包波尔查伊，包波尔查伊立即传给瓦尔纳伊，瓦尔纳伊又巧妙地盘球向前，刹那间砰然直射球门。中央体育学院队守门员张俊秀一跃而起，以出色的动作救出了险球，获得观众高声称赞。
    到了下半时，中央体育学院队进攻的次数比上半时增多了，几次突破匈牙利队后卫线，直扣球门，但为匈牙利队守门员救出。有时双方成拉锯状态，球儿忽南忽北，攻守频易。观众为双方的精采表演不断喝采。十九分钟之后，一个动人的镜头出现在中央体育学院队的进攻中，前锋玄龙南顽强而又巧妙的截获了对方的球，马上传给另一前锋陈成达，陈成达向前疾驰，猛力一踢，球儿飞向对方球门。但对方守门员以熟练的动作向旁一托，使球越野而去。不久之后，中央体育学院队球门又受到匈牙利队的环攻。匈牙利队队员，纵横在中央体育学院队的禁区内。突然间中卫瓦达奇截获从侧翼传来的一球，迅速地转过身来，把球射入网内。此后，中央体育学院队严守防地，一次又一次地挫败了匈牙利队的攻势，守门员张俊秀以腾空接球、横扑截球等出色的技巧，多次救出险球。
    比赛是在友好的气氛中进行的，结果是二比零，匈牙利队获胜。

    我国铁路员工对足球有着广泛的兴趣，十五日出场比赛的铁路队队员们，在十四日细心观摩、学习了匈牙利队和中央体育学院队的一场足球比赛后，研究了战术，在比赛中，也充分表现了勇敢、顽强的战斗意志。

    下半场比赛开始不久，匈牙利队前锋巴拉即攻入一球，战局进入紧张阶段。匈牙利队队员传球、盘球动作灵活，并用各种假动作迷惑对方。下半场大部分时间，球都在铁路队的半场上盘旋。铁路队的队员士气越战越旺盛，他们也运用了短传方法，屡次将球攻到对方球门前，但都被匈牙利队队员以灵活的动作，将球挡住。当铁路队前锋萧子文猛射一球，观众都以为射入网内，但对方守门员杜拉伊一跃而起，救出险球。最后快终场时，匈牙利队队员又将球传到对方罚球区，正在互相争夺紧张之际，匈牙利队瓦达奇巧妙地冲上用头一顶，又将球顶入球门。终场匈牙利队以四比零获胜。
    在比赛过程中，中、匈双方队员都表现了优良的新体育道德作风，队员犯规都自动举手，双方球员都十分尊重裁判员的裁判。当匈牙利队前锋基什和铁路队的中坚高保正在争夺一球碰倒时，两人马上相互扶起，并握手致歉。这种崇高的友谊行动，给观众留下了深刻的印象。（新华社）
