The basic-level election work in Xikang Province has been basically completed. All areas in Xikang Province that should conduct general elections (excluding some minority areas) have completed basic-level elections, except for the urban area of Ya'an. This includes 507 townships (towns) in 21 counties in the Han areas that have implemented land reform and three townships in the suburbs of Ya'an. At the same time, the election work in the minority nationality areas equivalent to districts and townships in these areas was completed through consultation.

The basic-level election work in Xikang Province started with trial implementation and phased progress from the beginning of June last year and lasted for half a year. Before the start of the general election, the election committees of Xikang Province and various places transferred and trained a large number of cadres. About 4,000 cadres were invested in the general election work throughout the province. All propaganda institutions in the province also fully utilized propaganda forces and various propaganda tools to cooperate with the general election for propaganda and education work.

In the entire process of the general election, all localities generally implemented the spirit of "general election serving production," "no delay in both production and general election," and "promoting production through general election." The leading aspects of each county, district, township (town) conducted serious research in advance on how each step of the general election work should be combined with production, and made unified arrangements for production and general election work based on local agricultural activities. During the busy autumn harvest season, all counties suspended the general election activities one after another and devoted all their efforts to leading the autumn harvest work. After the autumn harvest was completed, they continued to carry out the work.

Voters from all over the country actively participated in the election activities. When holding the election meeting, most counties participated in the voting, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of voters in each county. In some electoral districts of Huili, Yanbian, and Luding counties, 100% of the voters voted.

Through the general election, the people's congresses and basic-level political power organizations in various places all included representatives with status equivalent to those of various ethnic groups and strata, including many family members of revolutionary martyrs, family members of revolutionary soldiers, agricultural production labor models, and mutual aid team leaders. In ethnic mixed and ethnic concentrated areas, all ethnic groups have their own representatives. For example, in Shimen County, the Tibetan and Yi populations in 17 townships and one autonomous township accounted for only 10.4% of the county's total population, but the elected representatives accounted for 15.4% of the county's representatives. Mianning, Dechang, Yuexi, Huili, Miyi, Xichang and other counties in Xichang Prefecture gave appropriate and necessary care to the ethnic groups with a small number of people scattered within their borders. For example, in Mianning Chengguan Town Ethnic Minority Democratic United Township, there were 74 Tibetans, and in Chengxiang Town, there were 8 Huis, each of whom produced a township people's representative. In Miyi County, the Yi population in Puwei Ethnic Minority Democratic United Township accounted for only about 17% of the Han population, but among the three county people's representatives elected in the township, the Yi people accounted for one. Among the representatives elected in various places, women also accounted for a certain proportion.

In this general election, cadres of all grassroots organizations generally received a mass appraisal and democratic education. Many cadres were loved and praised by the masses for their firm stand, democratic style, and active responsibility, and were re-elected as people's representatives; some cadres, although they had achieved results in their work, had problems with their style. After reviewing their shortcomings to the masses and expressing their determination to correct them, they still regained the understanding and trust of the people and were elected; as for individual bad elements, lawless and undisciplined elements, and those who have committed serious commandism errors and are extremely dissatisfied with the masses of the people, they have been eliminated from the grassroots organizations. In the election, Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League in various places were especially trusted by the masses. In the first batch of townships elected by the Ya'an Prefecture, Communist Party members and members of the Communist Youth League accounted for 28.5%. Through the general election, many cadres criticized their coercive and commanding style, improved their working methods, and further strengthened the ties between the people's government and the people.

After the general election, the broad masses of the people more practically realized the essence of democracy, and thus their political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm further increased. When the first session of the township people's congress was held after the general election in various places, the masses put forward demands, useful suggestions and criticisms on production and construction. According to statistics from eight townships in Lushan County, seven townships in Shimen County, and one township in Tianquan County, there were 285 proposals. Among the 45 proposals in Xinmin Township, Shimen, 31 were related to production. The people's representatives of 22 townships in Mianning County brought a total of 628 proposals from the masses, including criticisms and suggestions on the work of the government, as well as opinions on production, transportation, and cultural construction. After the rectification of various grassroots organizations in the countryside, the phenomenon of "five mores" has been initially overcome, and rural cadres have had time to engage in their own production. The working system of grassroots organizations and the working methods of cadres have also been initially improved. Generally, necessary systems have been established, and the past "package" of affairs-ism style has begun to change. After the election in ethnic mixed areas, the unity between ethnic groups has been further strengthened. In the past, the Yi and Han people in Liguo Township, Daqiao Autonomous Region, and Langhuan Township, Lizhou District, Xichang County, often had land and debt disputes. Every autumn harvest, the Yi and Han people always quarreled. At the beginning of the election work, the cadres of the two townships convened a joint meeting of the Yi and Han people. In just three days, 24 land and debt disputes were resolved, which was warmly welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups.

People's representatives and rural cadres in various places have actively studied and publicized the general line of the state during the transition period and the state's policy of purchasing grain, and many representatives and cadres have also used their own practical actions to mobilize the vast number of farmers to sell surplus grain, which has greatly promoted the progress of grain purchase work. After the Tianquan Chengxiang Town People's Congress made a resolution to mobilize farmers to sell surplus grain to the state, each representative cooperated with various propaganda forces to carry out propaganda, so that the farmers in the town sold more than 140,000 jin of rice to the state in four days. Zheng Jiayue, chairman of the Zhongli Township People's Government of Ya'an County, after studying the state's general line during the transition period, mobilized the people at home to sell all the more than 20 shi of surplus grain to the state. Yu Yongqing, a member of the Lushan Siyan Township People's Government (and also the head of the mutual aid group), after studying the general line and grain purchase policy in the township, went back and convened a villagers' meeting to mobilize everyone to sell the surplus grain to the state, and at the meeting, he voluntarily reported that he would sell all 500 jin of his surplus grain to the state.

### 西康省基层选举工作基本完成

    西康省基层选举工作基本完成
    西康省应进行普选的地区（一部分少数民族地区不进行普选）除雅安市区外，已全部完成基层选举工作。包括实行了土地改革的汉族地区二十一个县的五百零七个乡（镇）和雅安市郊区三个乡；同时采用协商办法，完成了这些地区内相当于区的和乡的少数民族聚居区的选举工作。
    西康省的基层选举工作从去年六月初开始试办和分批进行，历时半年。在普选开始前，西康省及各地选举委员会都抽调训练了大批干部，全省投入普选工作的干部约达四千人。全省各宣传机构也都充分发挥了宣传力量，利用各种宣传工具，配合普选进行宣传教育工作。
    在整个普选进行过程中，各地一般都贯彻了“普选服从生产”、“生产、普选两不误”、“通过普选推动生产”的精神。各县、区、乡（镇）领导方面对于普选工作的每个步骤如何与生产相结合的问题，事先都进行了认真的研究，并根据当地农事活动，把生产与普选工作作了统一安排。在秋收紧张时期，各县均相继暂停了普选活动，全力领导秋收工作。在秋收完成后又继续进行。
    各地选民都踊跃地参加了选举活动，在召开选举大会时，大多数县参加投票的选民占各该县选民总数的百分之九十以上。会理、盐边、泸定等县部分选区百分之百的选民都投了票。
    经过普选，各地人民代表大会和基层政权组织中，均包括了与各民族各阶层地位相当的代表，其中还有不少革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、农业生产劳动模范、互助组长。在民族杂居及聚居地区，各族人民都有了他们自己的代表。如石棉县十七个乡和一个自治乡的藏、彝族人口只占全县人口的百分之十点四，但选出的代表却占了全县代表的百分之十五点四。西昌专区的冕宁、德昌、越嶲、会理、米易、西昌等县，对于散居境内的人数较少的民族，均给了适当和必要的照顾。如冕宁城关镇民族民主联合乡有藏民七十四人，城厢镇有回民八人，都分别产生了一位乡人民代表。米易县普威民族民主联合乡彝族人口只占汉族人口百分之十七左右，但全乡选出的三名县人民代表中，彝族就占了一名。各地当选的代表中，妇女的代表也都占有一定的比例。
    在这次普选中，所有基层组织的干部，普遍受到了一次群众性的鉴别和民主教育。有不少干部由于立场坚定、作风民主和积极负责而受到群众的热爱和赞扬，再次当选为人民代表；也有一些工作虽有成绩但作风有毛病的干部，经过向群众检讨自己的缺点和表明改正决心，仍重新取得人民的谅解和信任而当选；至于个别坏分子、违法乱纪的分子和犯有严重命令主义错误而为人民群众所极不满意的分子，则已从基层组织中剔除出去。选举中各地共产党员与青年团员尤其得到群众的信任。雅安专区各县第一批普选乡选出的人民代表中，共产党员与青年团员占百分之二十八点五。经过普选，很多干部批判了自己的强迫命令作风，改进了工作方法，更加密切了人民政府与人民之间的联系。
    广大群众经过普选以后，更加实际地体会到民主的实质，因而政治积极性和生产积极性进一步高涨。各地召开普选后第一届乡人民代表大会时，群众纷纷提出了有关生产建设方面的要求和有益的建议与批评。据芦山县八个乡、石棉县七个乡、天全县一个乡的统计，即有提案二百八十五件。石棉新民乡四十五件提案中，有关生产的有三十一件。冕宁县二十二个乡的人民代表，带来群众的提案共六百二十八件，其中包括对政府工作的批评建议，以及生产、交通、文化建设等方面的意见。农村中各种基层组织经过整顿以后，“五多”现象已初步克服，乡村干部已有时间从事自己的生产。基层组织的工作制度与干部的工作方法也有了初步的改进，一般均建立了必要的制度，开始转变了以往“一揽子”的事务主义作风。民族杂居地区经过选举以后，更加加强了民族之间的团结。过去，西昌县大桥自治区李果乡与礼州区琅环乡的彝、汉两族人民，常闹土地和债务纠纷，每年秋收时，彝、汉人民总要吵嘴闹架。在选举工作开始时，两乡干部即召开了彝、汉两族人民联席会，仅三天时间，即解决了土地、债务纠纷二十四件，受到各民族人民热烈欢迎。
    各地人民代表和乡村干部都积极学习和宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线和国家收购粮食的政策，不少代表和干部还以自己的实际行动，动员广大农民出售余粮，大大推动了购粮工作的进展。天全城厢镇人民代表大会作出了动员农民出售余粮给国家的决议以后，各个代表即配合各种宣传力量进行宣传，使该镇农民在四天中卖了十四万多斤稻谷给国家。雅安县中里乡人民政府主席郑加钺，学习了国家过渡时期的总路线以后，动员家里的人把二十石余粮全部卖给国家。芦山思延乡人民政府委员俞永清（又是互助组组长），在乡上学习了总路线和购粮政策以后，回去就召开了村民大会，动员大家把余粮卖给国家，并在大会上自报要把自己五百斤余粮全部卖给国家。
