The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Saburov, Pervukhin, Shvernik, Pospelov, and Shatalin, attended the closing ceremony of the conference.

The conference, over the course of three days, discussed the report by A. Kozlov, Minister of Soviet State Farms, on the implementation of the resolution of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee regarding improving the work of state farms. Speakers at the conference included heads of state farms from various regions, agricultural scientists, agronomists, livestock breeding experts, and administrative personnel from agricultural departments. In their speeches, they introduced the production experiences and achievements of their farms, examined the shortcomings in the work of state farms, and also spoke of the enormous potential of state farms in increasing crop yields and livestock productivity, and put forward suggestions for improving the work of state farms. The agronomist Filatov from the Gorky State Farm in Moscow said: Last year, his farm had 400 hectares of land (15 mu per hectare), and the vegetable harvest per hectare was 36.2 tons, an increase of 39 percent compared to before. This was due to their use of peat and humus clods to cultivate vegetable seedlings and the square-cluster planting method to cultivate vegetables. Kaminsky, the head of the Petro Pavlovsky State Farm in Chelyabinsk Oblast, said: The sown area of his farm has exceeded 29,000 hectares, with more than 160 tractors and combine harvesters. Last year, the total grain harvest was nearly 50,000 tons, with a yield of 2 tons to 2.2 tons per hectare. Shevchuk, the director of the "Second Five-Year Plan" State Farm in the Kuban region, said: Thanks to the good care of livestock on his farm, the milk yield per dairy cow reached 4,400 kilograms last year; the amount of meat, milk, and eggs turned over to the state increased greatly compared to the previous year. The milkmaid Lorenko from the "Alamykin" State Farm in the Kyrgyz Republic pointed out: His farm has adopted electric milking, and the work of feed preparation and transportation has been mechanized. On behalf of his work team, he pledged to ensure that each 100 dairy cows will produce 5,600 kilograms of milk per year this year. Vorobyov, the director of the Kolsky Animal Husbandry State Farm in Murmansk Oblast, pointed out: At present, the number of silver foxes, blue foxes, white sable, and black sable and other animals that produce valuable fur cultivated by his farm has increased to eight times that of 1940. Yanatev, the director of the "Metalworker" State Farm in Ukraine, said: Last year, his state farm handed over to the state four and a half times the amount of pork compared to 1940, the vegetable planting area increased by two times, and the laborious work in agriculture and animal husbandry has been mechanized. This year, the farm will adopt the square-cluster planting method to grow potatoes and vegetables, the number of hotbeds will increase to four times that of last year, and all grain land fertilization will be carried out by aircraft.

Before the closing of the conference, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a long speech, which was greeted with warm applause from the participants.

The conference finally passed a letter to all Soviet state farm workers, calling on them to launch a socialist competition and strive to victoriously realize the tasks of further developing agriculture put forward by the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee.
