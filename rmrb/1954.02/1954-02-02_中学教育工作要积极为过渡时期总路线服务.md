    The national secondary education conference convened by the Central Ministry of Education, based on the general line of the state during the transition period, reviewed and summarized the secondary education work of the past four years, determined the guidelines and tasks of secondary education in the future, and discussed the 1954 secondary school enrollment plan, the principles of ideological and political education, the key points of teaching work, and strengthening school leadership and other important issues, making the delegates more clearly aware of how secondary education during the transition period should actively serve the general line. This is the main achievement of this conference.
    In the past four years, the restoration and development of secondary education has been rapid, and the reform of secondary education has also achieved certain results. The current number of students in secondary schools is twice the highest number of secondary school students in Chinese history. In recent years, a total of 216,000 students have graduated from senior high schools, providing a large number of new students for universities and making a significant contribution to the state's plan to train senior construction cadres; a total of 1,055,000 students have graduated from junior high schools, ensuring the completion of enrollment tasks for senior high schools, secondary technical schools, and secondary normal schools, and providing a part of the labor force with a junior high school education level for the production front. In general, the political and ideological level and scientific and cultural knowledge of these graduates are higher with each passing year. We must affirm the achievements of the past few years. The achievement of these results is due, on the one hand, to the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, and the fact that the guidelines and policies of our secondary education have been correct, and the work of these years has basically conformed to the spirit of the state's general line during the transition period; on the other hand, it is because all secondary education workers, especially all teachers, have united, worked diligently, and loyally served the people.
    The guideline for secondary education stipulated by this national secondary education conference is: according to the state's general line and general task during the transition period, on the basis of rectification and consolidation, actively and steadily improve the quality of secondary schools, especially to run senior high schools, complete secondary schools, and worker-peasant rapid middle schools well, and develop them in a planned and focused manner according to needs and possibilities. All localities must conscientiously implement this guideline so that secondary education can more effectively serve the general line.
    Secondary education is an educational stage that links the past and the future. On the one hand, it cultivates reserve forces for the state to train senior construction cadres, and on the other hand, it also has the task of raising the cultural level of the people. It is incorrect to only see one aspect and ignore the other; but it is also incorrect to treat the two equally without distinguishing priorities and urgency. At present, senior high schools cannot meet the requirements of training sufficient reserve forces for universities in terms of both quantity and quality, so senior high schools must be developed in quantity and also improve their quality; although the scale of junior high schools is relatively large, it cannot be limited to meeting the enrollment needs of senior high schools, secondary technical schools, and secondary normal schools, it must meet the cultural requirements of the people as much as possible, and continuously provide reserve labor forces with a certain cultural and scientific knowledge for the country's industrialization. Since last year, due to the fact that not all junior high school graduates can continue their studies, some cadres have mistakenly thought that there are too many junior high school graduates. This view is obviously incorrect. It should be known that cultural backwardness is still a major weakness in our country at present. If we want to build socialism, we must gradually raise the cultural level of the people. The problem now is definitely not that there are too many junior high school graduates, but that we have not guided some junior high school graduates who have not continued their studies to the production front, we have not conducted enough labor education for middle school students in peacetime, and we have not done the necessary organizational work for junior high school graduates to participate in production work. We must have a clear understanding of this point. Naturally, the development of schools must be based on needs and possible conditions, and cannot blindly rush forward. The so-called possible conditions here should include the meaning of tapping potential, creating conditions, and overcoming difficulties. The key problem at present is teachers. The current shortage of teachers is a very big problem. This problem will still exist for several years to come. But this problem must be actively solved step by step. In this conference, when everyone discussed this year's enrollment plan, they determined many ways to balance teachers, and fully realized the importance of tapping potential and creating conditions. This spirit should continue to be implemented to ensure the completion of this year's enrollment plan.
    How to improve the quality of existing secondary schools is a matter related to many aspects and is a long-term task in the future; at present, we must implement the conclusions made by this conference on the following issues into practical work.
    First of all, all secondary education workers must understand that "the current task of secondary schools is to educate students with the spirit of the state's general line during the transition period, and cultivate them to become comprehensively developed new people who actively participate in socialist construction and defend the motherland." To this end, our secondary schools must implement comprehensive development education in terms of politics, culture, and health. It is wrong to only pay attention to the development of one aspect and ignore other aspects, or to separate the various aspects. It must be emphasized here that the current health status of students is very unsatisfactory. All localities should conscientiously check the implementation of the "Decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on Improving the Health Status of Students at All Levels of Schools." The Central Ministry of Education should quickly and correctly streamline teaching materials, reduce the burden of students' homework, and supervise and assist educational administrative organs and schools at all levels to improve the health status of students. At the same time, it is also necessary to reduce the excessive burden on teachers and pay attention to the health of teachers.
    It is necessary to strengthen ideological and political education for students and correct the one-sidedness in ideological and political education in the past. We must use the thinking of the working class, combined with China's current reality and the ideological situation of students, to conduct specific and in-depth ideological and political education for students to improve their socialist consciousness. At present, we should focus on strengthening students' patriotism education, labor education, collectivism education, and discipline education. We must make students love the motherland and realize that the greatness of the motherland today is inseparable from the long-term revolutionary and bloody struggle of countless martyrs. At present, the motherland has entered a new historical period of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and our tasks are even more arduous. Young people should respond to the call of the motherland, train themselves to build a great socialist country and defend the beloved motherland. We must study well, correctly solve the relationship between the individual and the country, the individual should obey the interests of the country, and any noble ideal of the individual should be linked to the great ideal of building socialism and communism. We must educate students to love labor, love the working people, and correctly understand the noble meaning of labor, so that students understand that only by relying on the labor of all the people can a socialist society be built, and it is wrong to despise physical labor and the working people. We must cultivate students' collectivist thinking and living habits well in the middle school stage, educate them to cherish collective interests, cherish public property, and consciously abide by discipline, so as to prepare for participating in the cause of building socialism. Our method of conducting ideological and political education for students is mainly to cultivate their socialist thinking in a positive way, and we must oppose various crude and impetuous methods; of course, we cannot take a laissez-faire attitude towards the mistakes that students make in learning and behavior.
    The key to improving the quality of secondary school teaching lies in improving the quality of teachers. This conference attached importance to the issue of improving teachers, but it is still necessary to study feasible methods. According to the current level of teachers, teaching work should first focus on studying teaching materials, with the focus on mastering teaching materials and correspondingly improving teaching methods and doing a good job in classroom teaching. This is realistic. This decision must be implemented. This is also the focus of secondary schools currently learning from the advanced education experience of the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Central Ministry of Education should further revise and edit secondary school teaching syllabuses, textbooks, teaching methods, and teacher reference books, solve the difficulties of teachers in teaching, and strengthen the teaching guidance of various subjects, and assist various schools in summing up experience. School principals should pay more attention to teaching work and lead teaching work, and organize all teachers in the school into teaching groups to give full play to the role of collective mutual assistance, so as to solve teaching problems and strengthen teachers' self-education.
    To run secondary schools well, it is currently urgent to strengthen the leadership of party committees at all levels over education work. This first requires party committees at all levels to strengthen their leadership over educational administrative organs at all levels. In recent years, general provincial party committees have paid attention to the leadership of secondary schools, and have also allocated backbones for many secondary schools to improve the leadership of education departments and schools themselves; however, county-level party committees and governments have paid little attention to leading secondary schools in the county, and provincial-level leading organs are too far away to reach these secondary schools, resulting in many schools being in a state of no management. This conference decided to gradually achieve direct management of secondary schools in the county by the county, according to the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management by the province, special zone, and county. Therefore, party committees at all levels below the province should, in accordance with the central government's policies, give secondary schools regular care, leadership, and strict supervision from the political, ideological, and organizational aspects. The county-level party committee should assist the county government to strengthen the leadership of the county education section. The county party committee should include the management of secondary schools in its agenda and regularly check the work of the school. Party committees at all levels should care for and lead the political theory study of secondary school teachers; and provide the main leading cadres for secondary schools that still lack leading backbones. It is necessary to enable the vast number of secondary schools to have the reliance of the party, which is the most fundamental link in improving the current situation of secondary schools.
    The task of secondary education in the future is arduous. In order to implement the resolutions of this national secondary education conference, party committees and educational administrative organs at all levels must firmly grasp the study of the general line by secondary school teachers, enlighten the socialist consciousness of all teachers, make them clearly understand the purpose and future of their work, and consciously participate in the great cause of building socialism. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the unity between party members and non-party members, and between new and old teachers in secondary schools, so that they can work together with one heart and one mind, overcome difficulties, do a good job in teaching, and actively serve the state's general line during the transition period.

    中学教育工作要积极为过渡时期总路线服务
    中央教育部这次召开的全国中学教育会议，根据国家过渡时期的总路线，检查和总结了过去四年的中学教育工作，确定了今后中学教育的方针和任务，并讨论了一九五四年的中学招生计划、思想政治教育的原则、教学工作的重点以及加强学校领导等重要问题，使到会代表更明确地认识了过渡时期的中学教育应如何积极地为总路线服务。这是这次会议的主要收获。
    在过去四年中，中学教育的恢复和发展是很快的，中学教育的改革也取得了一定的成绩。现在中学在校学生人数相当于中国历史上中学生最高数字的一倍。几年来高中共毕业了二十一万六千人，供应了高等学校以大量新生，为国家培养高级建设干部计划作了重大的贡献；初级中学共毕业了一百零五万五千人，保证了高级中学、中等技术学校和中级师范学校的招生任务的完成，并为生产战线提供了一部分具有初级中学文化程度的劳动力。一般说，这些毕业生的政治思想水平和科学文化知识，是一届比一届高的。我们必须肯定过去几年工作的成绩。这些成绩的取得，一方面是因为在中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，我们中学教育的方针、政策是正确的，这几年的工作基本上是符合国家过渡时期总路线的精神的；另一方面是因为全体中学教育工作者，尤其是全体教师们，团结一致，辛勤努力，忠诚地为人民服务。
    这次全国中学教育会议所规定的中学教育的方针是：根据国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，在整顿巩固的基础上，积极地稳步地提高中学的质量，特别要办好高级中学、完全中学和工农速成中学，并根据需要与可能，作有计划有重点的发展。各地必须认真执行这一方针，使中学教育更有效地为总路线服务。
    中学教育是一个承上启下的教育阶段，它一方面为国家培养高级建设干部的后备力量，一方面又负有提高人民文化水平的任务。仅仅看到一面，而忽视另一面是不正确的；但不分轻重缓急，而将二者平均看待，也是不正确的。当前高级中学在数量和质量上都不能适应为培养高级建设干部的高等学校造就足够后备力量的要求，因此高级中学在数量上就必须发展，同时要提高质量；初级中学的规模虽然较大，但也不能以供应高级中学、中等技术学校、中级师范学校的招生需要为限，它必须尽可能地满足人民文化的要求，为国家工业化不断提供有一定文化科学知识的后备劳动力。去年以来，由于初级中学毕业生不能全部升学，在有些干部思想上造成一种错觉，以为初级中学毕业生太多了。这种看法显然是不正确的。须知文化落后还是我国当前的一大弱点，我们要建设社会主义，就必须逐步地提高人民的文化水平。现在的问题决不在于初中毕业生太多，而在于我们没有把一部分未升学的初中毕业生引导到生产战线上去，我们平时没有向中学生进行足够的劳动教育，没有为初中毕业生参加生产工作做好应有的组织工作。关于这一点我们必须有明确的认识。自然，学校的发展必须根据需要与可能条件，不能盲目冒进。这里所谓可能条件应包含发挥潜力，创造条件，克服困难的意义。当前的关键问题在于师资。目前师资不足，是一个极大的问题。这问题在今后若干年内还是会存在的。但这问题必须积极设法逐步解决。在这次会议中，大家在讨论今年招生计划时，对师资的平衡，已定出了许多办法，充分认识了发挥潜力、创造条件的重要意义。这种精神还应贯彻下去，保证今年招生计划的完成。
    如何提高现有中学的质量，这是关系许多方面的问题，是今后长期的工作；目前，我们必须把这次会议对以下几个问题所作出的结论贯彻到实际工作中去。
    首先必须使全体中学教育工作人员，明了“当前中学的任务，是以国家过渡时期的总路线的精神教育学生，培养他们成为积极参加社会主义建设和保卫祖国的全面发展的新人”。为此，我们的中学必须从政治、文化、健康各方面施行全面发展的教育。只注意一方面的发展，而忽视其他方面，或将各个方面分割开来，都是不对的。这里必须强调指出，当前学生的健康状况是十分不能令人满意的。各地应认真检查“中央人民政府政务院关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”的执行状况。中央教育部应从速正确地精简教材，减轻学生课业的负担，并督导、协助各级教育行政机关及学校，改善学生健康状况。同时也要减轻教师过重的负担，注意教师们的健康。
    必须加强对学生的思想政治教育，纠正过去思想政治教育中的片面性的偏向。我们要以工人阶级的思想，结合中国当前的实际和学生的思想状况，具体深入地对学生进行思想政治教育，提高学生的社会主义觉悟。目前应以加强学生的爱国主义教育、劳动教育、集体主义教育、纪律教育为重点。要使学生热爱祖国，认识祖国今天的伟大是跟无数先烈长期革命流血斗争分不开的。目前祖国已进入社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的新的历史时期，我们的任务，更为艰巨，青年应响应祖国的召唤，为建设一个伟大的社会主义国家，为保卫可爱的祖国而锻炼自己。必须很好地学习，正确地解决个人和国家的关系问题，个人应服从国家的利益，个人的任何崇高的理想都应该和建设社会主义、共产主义这一伟大的理想联系起来。要教育学生热爱劳动，热爱劳动人民，正确认识劳动的崇高意义，使学生明了只有倚靠全体人民的劳动才能建设社会主义社会，轻视体力劳动，轻视劳动人民都是不对的。要在中学阶段好好培养学生的集体主义思想和生活习惯，教育他们爱护集体利益，爱护公共财物，自觉地遵守纪律，为参加建设社会主义的事业作好准备。我们对学生进行思想政治教育的方法，主要地是正面地培养他们的社会主义思想，要反对各种粗暴、急躁的方法；当然，对于学生在学习和行为上所犯的过错，也不能采取放任的态度。
    提高中学教学质量的关键在于提高师资。这次会议是重视提高教师问题的，但还须研究切实可行的办法。根据目前教师的水平，教学工作首先要着重研究教材，以精通教材，相应地改进教学方法，搞好课堂教学为重点，这是切合实际的。这一决定必须贯彻。这也就是当前中学学习苏联先进教育经验的重点。同时中央教育部要进一步修订和编辑中学教学大纲、教科书、教学法、教师参考书，解决教师们在教学上的困难，并加强各科教学指导，协助各校总结经验。学校校长应多注意教学工作，领导教学工作，要把全校教师组织到教学小组里来，充分发挥集体互助的作用，以便解决教学上的问题和加强教师的自我教育。
    要把中学办好，目前亟须加强各级党委对教育工作的领导。这首先要求各级党委加强对各级教育行政机关的领导。近年来，一般省级党委已经注意了对中学的领导，也为不少中学调配了骨干，改善了教育部门及学校本身的领导状况；但县级党委和政府还很少注意领导县内的中学，而省级领导机关对这些中学又鞭长莫及，致使许多学校处于无人管理的状态。这次会议决定按统一领导，省、专区、县分级管理的原则，要逐步做到县内的中学由县直接管理。因此省以下的各级党委要按照中央的方针，从政治、思想、组织上给中学以经常的关怀、领导和严格的监督。县级党委应协助县政府，加强县教育科的领导工作。县委应把管理中学，列入自己的议事日程，按时检查学校工作。各级党委应关心和领导中学教师的政治理论学习；要替尚缺领导骨干的中学，配备主要领导干部。必须使广大的中学有党的依靠，这是改进目前中学状况的最基本的环节。
    中学教育今后的任务是艰巨的。为了实现这次全国中学教育会议的决议，各级党委和教育行政机关要抓紧中学教师总路线的学习，启发全体教师的社会主义觉悟，使他们明确认识自己的工作的目的和前途，自觉地参加建设社会主义的伟大事业。同时必须加强中学内党员和非党员之间，新老教师之间的团结，使他们同心同德，克服困难，做好教学工作，积极为国家过渡时期的总路线服务。
