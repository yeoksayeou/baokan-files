    Why Doesn't the Songjiang Province Coal Mining Construction Materials Company Allocate Fuel Oil According to Plan?
    Kang Guoqing, manager, and Liu Guoliang, business section chief, of the Songjiang Province Wuchang County Coal Mining Construction Materials Company, write: Three large industrial production units are located in our company's area and require us to supply fuel oil and heavy diesel oil. Therefore, we accurately grasped the needs of these units and submitted monthly and quarterly plans to the Songjiang Province Company. In the three months since November 1953, we have submitted plans for 40 tons of fuel oil and heavy diesel oil to the provincial company. The provincial company approved this plan, but failed to allocate it in a timely manner. Until now, we have not received even four *jin* of oil. This has affected our company's supply plan, and the Shanhetun Rice Mill was forced to suspend operations due to our company's supply shortage. Currently, the oil reserves of various factories are not high. We have repeatedly written official letters, made phone calls, and sent people to the provincial company to urge the allocation, but the provincial company is still not actively allocating oil to us.
    We believe that the provincial company does not have a sufficient understanding of the role that state-owned commerce should play in national construction. We hope that they will combine this with the study of the General Line and examine the shortcomings in their work.

    松江省煤业建筑器材公司为什么不按计划调拨燃料油
    松江省五常县煤业建筑器材公司经理康国卿、业务股长刘国良来信：本公司所在地有三个较大的工业生产单位，需要我们公司供应燃料油与重柴油。因此，我们准确地掌握了这些单位的需要量，按月、按季向松江省公司提出计划。从一九五三年十一月份以来的三个月中，我们先后向省公司提出四十吨燃料油与重柴油的计划。省公司批准了这一计划，可是却不及时调拨。直到现在，我们连四斤油也没收到，这就影响了我公司的供应计划，山河屯制米厂就因我公司供应失调而曾被迫停工。目前各个厂子的库存油都不多，我们接连写公文、打电话，并几次派人到省公司催调，但省公司还是不积极给我们调油来。
    我们认为，省公司对国营商业在国家建设中应有的作用还认识不足，希望他们结合总路线的学习，检查工作中的缺点。
