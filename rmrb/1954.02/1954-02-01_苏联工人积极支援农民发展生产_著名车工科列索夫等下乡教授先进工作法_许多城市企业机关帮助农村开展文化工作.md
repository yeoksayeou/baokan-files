Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st - Helping machine tractor station workers in rural areas learn advanced production techniques from factories is a new task for the Soviet working class in supporting agricultural laborers to develop agricultural production. Kolesov, a famous turner from the Kubyshev Central Volga Mother Machine Factory, and others have recently gone to the countryside to help machine tractor station mechanics learn the advanced work methods they have created. This has set a worthy example for the working class to voluntarily help rural areas develop production.

　　Kolesov is a famous production innovator in the Soviet Union. The powerful cutting method he created has greatly improved metal cutting work in Soviet industry. Not long ago, he applied to the factory director to go to the countryside in order to introduce his advanced cutting method to rural mechanics. Zhiro, a famous driller and Stalin Prize winner, and mechanic Morozov also applied to go to the countryside at the same time as Kolesov.

　　After these advanced workers' requests were approved, they organized a work group to go to a district that the factory was responsible for helping. They first went to the oldest Krotov Machine Tractor Station in the entire state. Kolesov immediately introduced the content of the powerful cutting method to the station's mechanics and suggested that the station's lathes also adopt this advanced work method. To convince the machine tractor station's mechanics of the advantages of this cutting method, Kolesov personally demonstrated it. He increased the feed rate by three times and made twelve iron pipes for the livestock farm in half a work shift (normally the machine tractor station could only make four). In addition, Kolesov also gave the machine tractor station's turners the drawings of his lathe tools and taught them how to grind the tools. Zhiro also taught the machine tractor station's workers his rapid drilling method. After adopting this method, Shelyakov, a worker at the machine tractor station, doubled his labor productivity.

　　The work group organized by Kolesov and others also helped the Krotov Machine Tractor Station repair power generation equipment, increasing power generation, and helped the station repair many idle lathes. Mechanic Morozov said to the mechanics of the machine tractor station: "We want to make all your lathes run, and you should protect the equipment like the workers in our factory."

　　The work group also helped the Krotov Machine Tractor Station improve labor organization, assisted them in establishing a glory board, and designed many propaganda posters, calling on rural workers and farmers to work together to successfully implement the resolution of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

　　After working at the Krotov Machine Tractor Station, the work group went to the Georgiev and Skolkov Machine Tractor Stations to provide voluntary assistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 31st - Many cities across the Soviet Union, while helping rural areas develop production, are also vigorously helping rural areas carry out various cultural and educational activities. Moscow has already had 1,600 enterprises and government offices help rural areas carry out many cultural and educational activities. Moscow's cultural and scientific institutions have widely publicized the resolutions of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in the rural areas of the Moscow region, and disseminated a great deal of production knowledge in agriculture and animal husbandry. The collective farms and state farms in the state also screened color films introducing square-cluster planting, and nearly 400,000 people received this education in disseminating advanced agricultural production technology. In the past three months, cultural and scientific workers in Leningrad have conducted more than 600 reports in rural areas. They also helped rural areas hold agricultural film exhibitions and folk art activities. The city's libraries have also sent more than 17,000 books to rural areas to enrich rural reading rooms. In Novosibirsk, the clubs of 17 factories and government offices helped rural areas with recreational activities. The main actors and directors of the city's theaters went to the countryside to help collective farmers conduct district and village amateur art activities. The Natural Museum of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek Republic organized a mobile exhibition for the development of cotton production and exhibited it in rural cotton-producing areas. At the same time, it held more than 40 report meetings. The writers of Stalingrad also voluntarily helped the Kayepov Machine Tractor Station carry out literary and artistic work and organize literary and artistic evenings. They are also preparing to create feature articles about the advanced figures of the machine tractor station.

    【新华社莫斯科三十一日电】帮助农村机器拖拉机站工作人员学习工厂的先进生产技术，是苏联工人阶级支援农业劳动者发展农业生产的一项新任务。古比雪夫中伏尔加母机工厂的著名车工科列索夫等人，最近已到农村中帮助机器拖拉机站的机械工人学习他们所创造的先进工作法，这为工人阶级义务帮助农村发展生产树立了值得学习的榜样。
    科列索夫是苏联著名的生产革新者。他创造的强力切削法，大大改进了苏联工业中的金属切削工作。不久以前，他向厂长申请下乡，以便把自己的先进切削法介绍给农村的机械工人。与科列索夫同时申请下乡的还有工厂中著名的钻工、斯大林奖金得奖人日罗夫和机械工人莫罗佐夫等人。
    这些先进工人的要求得到批准后，便组织了工作小组，到该厂负责义务帮助的一个区去。他们首先到全州最老的克罗托夫机器拖拉机站，科列索夫立即向该站机械工人介绍了强力切削法的内容，并建议该机器拖拉机站的车床也采用这个先进的工作法。为了使机器拖拉机站的机械工人相信这种切削法的优点，科列索夫亲自表演。他把走刀量加大三倍，在半个工作班内车制了十二根供饲畜场用的铁管（平常机器拖拉机站只能车四根）。此外，科列索夫还把自己车刀的图样交给机器拖拉机站的车工，并教会他们磨制车刀的方法。日罗夫也把自己的快速钻孔法教给机器拖拉机站的工人。采用这个方法后，机器拖拉机站的谢里亚科夫就把劳动生产率提高了一倍。
    科列索夫等人组织的工作小组还帮助克罗托夫机器拖拉机站修理了发电设备，增加了发电量，还帮助该站修理了许多停工的车床。机械工人莫罗佐夫对该机器拖拉机站的机械工人说：“我们要使你们的全部车床转动起来，你们要像我们工厂的工人一样保护设备。”
    工作小组还帮助克罗托夫机器拖拉机站改进了劳动组织，协助他们建立了光荣牌，并设计了许多宣传画，号召农村的工人们和农民一道为顺利实现苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全体会议的决议而奋斗。
    工作小组在克罗托夫机器拖拉机站工作以后，又到格奥尔基耶夫和斯科尔科夫机器拖拉机站义务进行帮助。
    【新华社莫斯科三十一日电】苏联全国有许多城市在帮助农村发展生产的同时，还大力帮助农村开展各种文化教育工作。莫斯科已经有一千六百个企业和机关帮助农村进行了许多文化教育工作。莫斯科各文化科学机关在莫斯科州的农村中，广泛宣传了苏共中央一九五三年九月全会的决议，并传播了许多农业和饲畜业的生产知识。该州各集体农庄和国营农场还放映了介绍正方穴播法的彩色影片，将近有四十万人受到了这种传播先进的农业生产技术的教育。列宁格勒市的文化科学工作者三个多月来已经在农村进行了六百次以上的报告，他们还帮助农村举行农业电影展览和民间艺术活动检阅。该市各图书馆还向农村送了一万七千多册书籍，以充实农村的阅览室。在新西伯利亚城，有十七个工厂和机关的俱乐部帮助农村进行文娱活动。该市各剧院的主要演员和导演都分别到农村帮助集体农民进行区和村的业余文艺活动检阅。乌兹别克共和国科学院自然博物馆组织了发展棉花生产的流动展览会，到产棉地区的农村展览，同时，还举行了四十多次报告会。斯大林格勒的作家们也义务帮助卡耶波夫机器拖拉机站开展文艺工作，组织文艺晚会。他们还准备创作机器拖拉机站的先进人物的特写。
