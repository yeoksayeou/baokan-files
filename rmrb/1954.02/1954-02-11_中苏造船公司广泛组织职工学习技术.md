    The Sino-Soviet Shipbuilding Company, under the leadership of the Party committee and with the help of Soviet experts, has widely organized technical learning, which has universally improved the technical level of workers.
    With the development of production, the company has increased a large number of new workers, new products have gradually increased, and the quality requirements of products have also continued to improve. Therefore, improving the technical level of workers is directly related to the company's future production. In order to strengthen technical learning, Soviet General Manager Sibyakin ordered all factories in November 1953 to universally organize technical learning in major types of work. The Party committee also made a resolution on carrying out technical education. Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres of various branch factories formed technical education committees to specifically lead this work, and stipulated that Tuesdays and Fridays be technical learning time. The Communist Youth League committee formulated a work plan to implement the Party committee's resolution, and mobilized all Communist Youth League members and young workers, and the workers actively signed up to participate. Xing Hongzhai, a worker at the forging factory, said: "I used to think that my life was just about forging iron, and it didn't matter if I didn't learn technology. After studying the General Line, I realized that if we want to realize the industrialization of the country, we must master modern science and technology."
    According to the instructions of the Party committee, the company's technical education is closely linked to production practice and the promotion of advanced experience. For example, the fitter factory is preparing to summarize the experience of good production teams in the factory and promote it during technical learning. In addition to lecturing workers on theory in the classroom, technician Zhu Gongsheng from the power plant sometimes takes workers to the site, disassembles the automatic switch on the lathe, and explains technical issues such as current.
    In the teaching process, Soviet experts actively and enthusiastically provided guidance in many aspects, and sometimes personally lectured to solve key problems in production. General Manager Sibyakin sometimes personally went deep into key factories such as the mechanical factory to understand the workers' learning situation.
    After less than two months of study, the technical level of many workers has been improved, and great achievements have been made in production. For example, Wang Dequan, a worker in the mechanical factory, combined specific situations when learning to sharpen knives, sharpening different knives for different jobs. In learning the advanced experience of multi-knife and multi-blade tools, he combined theory and practice to study grinding the lathe tool into one knife with three blades, which increased production efficiency by three times. Jiang Xingfu, the production team leader of the shipyard, improved the front tip of the wind drill through technical learning, which increased work efficiency by fifty times.
    The factories have organized eighty-eight classes according to different types of work, and currently more than 4,200 workers have participated in technical learning.

    中苏造船公司广泛组织职工学习技术
    中苏造船公司在党委的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，广泛地组织了技术学习，使工人的技术水平普遍提高。
    随着生产的发展，该公司增加了大批的新工人，新产品也逐渐增多，产品的质量要求也不断提高。因此，提高工人的技术水平，直接关系到该厂今后的生产。为了加强技术学习，苏联总经理西比亚金同志在一九五三年十一月命令各厂普遍组织各主要工种的技术学习。党委也做出了关于开展技术教育的决议。各分厂党、行政、工会、青年团干部组成了技术教育委员会，专门领导这一工作，并规定每星期二和星期五为技术学习时间；团委制定了实现党委决议的工作计划，并在全体团员、青年职工中进行了动员，工人都积极报名参加。锻工厂工人邢洪斋说：“我过去认为我这一辈子就是打铁的，不学技术也不要紧，学习总路线后我可明白了，要想实现国家的工业化，必须掌握现代化的科学技术。”
    根据党委的指示，该公司的技术教育紧紧地与生产实际和推广先进经验结合起来。如钳工厂准备总结本厂好的生产小组的经验，在技术学习时予以推广。动力厂技师朱公盛除了在课堂上向工人讲理论外，有时还把工人领到现场，拆开车床上的自动电门，讲解电流等技术问题。
    在教学过程中，苏联专家积极热情地给予了多方面的指导，有时并亲自讲课，解决生产中的关键问题。总经理西比亚金同志有时也亲自深入到机械厂等重点厂去了解工人学习情况。
    经过不到两个月的学习，很多工人的技术水平得到了提高，并且在生产上创造了很大的成绩。如机械厂工人王德全在学习磨刀中，结合具体情况，干什么活磨什么样的刀。在学习多刀多刃的先进经验中，他就把理论和实际结合起来，研究将车刀磨成一刀三刃，使生产效率提高了三倍。造船厂生产组长姜兴富，通过技术学习，改进了风钻前尖，使工作效率提高了五十倍。
    各厂已根据不同工种组织了八十八个班，目前参加技术学习的工人已达四千二百余名。
