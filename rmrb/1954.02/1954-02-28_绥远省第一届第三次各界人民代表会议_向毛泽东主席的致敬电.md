The Third Session of the First People's Congress of All Circles of Suiyuan Province
A Message of Respect to Chairman Mao Zedong

Respected Chairman Mao:
The Third Session of the First People's Congress of All Circles of Suiyuan Province solemnly opened on January 11th, amidst the close unity of all ethnic groups. The convocation of this meeting coincides with the entry of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan into its second year. Under the brilliant illumination of the general line for the transition period, the Mon-Sui region has entered a new era of greater national unity and vigorous construction. Everyone is jubilant and extremely excited. We, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups and all circles in the province, extend to you our highest respect.

Our meeting has been very successful. We conveyed and discussed the general line and general tasks for the transition period, reviewed the work report of the Provincial People's Government over the past four years, and determined the work guidelines and tasks for 1954. We discussed and approved the proposal of the Mon-Sui Bureau regarding the merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, the abolition of the Suiyuan provincial establishment, and unified leadership by the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. All of these have created favorable conditions and a foundation for further enhancing the unity and friendship of all ethnic groups and promoting and developing various construction undertakings, especially economic construction undertakings.

Today, the meeting has successfully concluded. We would like to assure you that under your leadership and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups and all circles in Suiyuan will resolutely abide by the resolutions of this meeting, further implement the ethnic policy, do a good job in the merger of Mon-Sui, strengthen national unity, increase production, practice strict economy, vigorously support the nation's various construction undertakings, and strive to realize the great historical task of achieving the nation's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and gradually transition to a socialist society.
