Comrades!

    On March 14, 1954, the Soviet people will elect representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

    Our country is greeting this major event with the rapid development of its economy and culture amid its growing strength.

    The greatest achievement of the Soviet people is the reconstruction of industrial enterprises, cities, and villages destroyed by the German fascist aggressors during the war. Hundreds of factories, dozens of cities, and thousands of villages were razed to the ground by the enemy, and millions of people were left homeless. However, in just a few years, industrial enterprises rebuilt with the latest machines have joined the ranks of socialist industry; cities and villages burned and destroyed by the enemy have been restored; air-raid shelters where many regions' residents huddled together have been filled in, and new well-equipped residences have been built for the residents. All of this required great effort and the expenditure of a great deal of manpower and material resources. But all of this has been achieved! The iron will of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and the selfless and heroic labor of our people, have overcome all difficulties and once again demonstrated the great vitality of the Soviet system.

    In their rapid and unstoppable advance, the Soviet people have far surpassed the economic level at which the war interrupted their peaceful labor. The previous election to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was held in 1950, the final year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (the first post-war Five-Year Plan). After successfully completing that Five-Year Plan under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people spared no effort to complete the new Fifth Five-Year Plan. In 1953, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union had increased to two and a half times the pre-war level of 1940.

    Heavy industry has always been and remains the foundation of our economic development in peacetime, and the foundation of our national defense. Long before the war, the Party established a strong and first-class heavy industry to implement the socialist transformation of the entire national economy and to prepare the country for active defense. After the Great Patriotic War, the development of heavy industry achieved new and great achievements. In 1953, the Soviet Union produced 38 million tons of steel, twice that of 1940; 320 million tons of coal, twice that of 1940; 52 million tons of oil, an increase of 70 percent over 1940; and 133 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 2.8 times that of 1940. The core of our industry, Soviet machine manufacturing, is developing and expanding at an even greater rate: the machines and equipment produced in 1953 were 3.8 times that of pre-war 1940.

    The transportation and construction industries have made important progress. The volume of freight of industrial and agricultural products on the transport arteries of our vast land—railways, sea routes, inland rivers and canals, and highways—increases year by year. The entire transport industry now has powerful technical equipment. The amount of construction work for enterprises, institutions, and residences in industry, agriculture, culture, and public utilities increases year by year. Construction organizations have been provided with powerful machines and equipment.

    The achievements in the development of heavy industry have created conditions for greatly increasing the production of daily necessities. The Communist Party and the Soviet government have formulated a broad plan to accelerate the development of light industry and the food industry, in order to greatly increase the supply of food and industrial products to residents in the next two or three years. This plan is now being implemented unremittingly, and the working people of our country have already seen the initial results of the various measures taken by the Party and the government. In 1953, especially in the second half of 1953, the development of the daily necessities industry was faster than in 1952. The output of these industries increased by 10.5 percent in 1952, and by 14 percent in the second half of 1953 alone. Hundreds of textile factories, shoe factories, leather factories, and food industry enterprises are under construction. In 1953 alone, nearly 300 new enterprises producing daily necessities were put into production. Light industry and food industry enterprises are being expanded and equipped with new equipment.

    In order to further fully develop socialist industry, the Party has taken all measures to explore and utilize the inherent potential of our industry. We still have backward enterprises, and even entire industrial sectors that cannot complete their prescribed tasks. Many new machines are sometimes not well utilized, and equipment downtime is still too long. Not enough attention is still paid to the quality of products. Many enterprises have not completed the task of increasing labor productivity and reducing production costs. In many enterprises, factory production sites are still used very uneconomically. Among our economic leading cadres, there are still backward and incompetent people who are mired in convention, do not believe they have a responsibility to adopt advanced and progressive methods wherever possible, or actively support innovators in production. To eliminate all these shortcomings, to raise backward enterprises to the level of advanced ones, it is necessary to unleash the tremendous inherent potential in our industry, thereby guaranteeing a new and powerful upsurge in all sectors of industry.

    The Communist Party is convinced that our glorious working class and our experienced and skilled engineers and technicians will launch socialist emulation on a larger scale to complete the great tasks currently facing our industry, transportation, and construction industries, and further increase labor productivity, reduce production costs, improve product quality, and utilize all our resources and potential more economically and rationally.

    Our agriculture has achieved significant results. Collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms that were destroyed during the war have been fully restored. The sown area and the yield per unit area of major crops have not only reached but have exceeded pre-war levels. However, the Party's starting point is not these indisputable and huge achievements in the development of agriculture, but the ever-growing material needs of the working people. Without further rapid development of agriculture, it will not be possible to fully guarantee the production of abundant grain, and it will not be possible to supply enough raw materials for our constantly developing light industry and food industry. The resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and a series of resolutions on agricultural issues subsequently formulated by the Party and the government put forward a combat-ready and specific program, stipulating the rapid development of all sectors of socialist agriculture, primarily animal husbandry and the production of potatoes and vegetables. Realizing this program is the urgent task of the entire Party and the entire Soviet people.

    Half a year has passed since the closing of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU. This is not a long time, but much has been done in this short time. The material and technical foundation of agriculture has been further strengthened and consolidated. In 1953, agriculture received 139,000 general-purpose tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 18,000 row-crop tractors, 41,000 grain combine harvesters, 69,000 freight trucks, more than 2 million pieces of tillage equipment, seeders, harvesters, and other agricultural machinery, and 6 million tons of mineral fertilizers. Now, the whole problem lies in correctly and masterfully using the powerful technical equipment. In view of the decisive significance of cadres, the Party sent more than 100,000 agronomists and animal husbandry specialists to machine tractor stations to serve collective farms, and sent a large number of engineers and technicians who are good at organizing the correct use of the constantly increasing tractors.

    However, the Party believes that all these measures are only the first step in the great national cause of rapidly developing agriculture. We still have many shortcomings in the work of machine tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms, and many potentials have not been utilized. For example, if we only open up virgin land and wasteland in our eastern, southeastern, and other regions (this work has already been started by the Party and the government), we may be able to expand the grain sown area by several million hectares. The significance of this work is significant. Grain is the foundation of the entire agricultural production: the more grain we produce, the more grain we can get, not only more food but also more meat, oil, and other animal products.

    The Communist Party is convinced that the glorious collective farmers of our country, the staff of machine tractor stations and state farms will devote all their strength to unleash the full potential of socialist agriculture in a short period of time, raise backward regions and collective farms to the level of advanced ones, and comprehensively increase the yield per unit area of land and the productivity of livestock, so that all collective farms without exception will prosper, all collective farmers will become prosperous people, and our country will have enough of all kinds of food to supply the growing urban residents, and enough of all kinds of raw materials to supply light industry.

    What exactly is the purpose of the Communist Party's continuous improvement of the entire social production (including both industry and agriculture)? The purpose is to continuously improve the welfare of the Soviet people and fully meet the growing material and cultural needs of the Soviet people. Firmly realizing this goal is the highest guideline for all activities of the Party and the government, and the most important component of the communist construction plan. The reason why we build and expand factories and power stations, lay new railways, consolidate collective farms, supply agriculture with the latest and most advanced machines, and invest a lot of capital in all these aspects, in the final analysis, is to make workers, collective farmers, intellectuals—all Soviet people—live better, and to improve the material and cultural level of our people year by year and day by day.

    The overall improvement of our economy is the foundation for the continuous increase in the income of the working people. The real wages of workers and staff are constantly increasing. The state retail prices of industrial products and food are decreasing year by year. The state budget for the benefit and appropriation of residents, such as social insurance allowances and pensions, allowances for mothers with many children or single mothers, free medical care, free education, free training to improve business, etc., are increasing. With the increase in the monetary wages and real wages of workers and staff, the income of farmers is also increasing. In 1953, the agricultural tax and the compulsory sales quota for the private economy of collective farmers were reduced, the procurement and purchase prices of most agricultural products were increased, the agricultural tax arrears of collective farmers in previous years were completely exempted, and the arrears of collective farmers in the sale of livestock products and potatoes to the state were cancelled. The arrears of collective farms in the sale of potatoes and vegetables were cancelled. All this has promoted the improvement of the material welfare of collective farmers. Only due to the implementation of economic incentives for collective farms and collective farmers and some measures taken in taxation policy, the income of collective farms and collective farmers increased by more than 13 billion rubles in 1953.

    Trade is constantly expanding. In 1953, the trade system obtained goods worth 33 billion rubles more than stipulated in the annual plan. In 1953 alone, the goods sold to residents by state trade and cooperative trade were 21 percent more than in 1952. The sales volume increased particularly for the following products and goods: meat, oil, cheese, sugar, vegetables, silk fabrics, clothes, shoes, furniture, sewing machines, clocks, gramophones, radios, televisions, bicycles, motorcycles, and small cars. While continuously increasing the production of daily necessities, the Party and the government took measures to increase and expand shops and other trade enterprises. The Communist Party has put forward a task—this task must be realized—to resolutely improve the organization of Soviet trade and the level of service to consumers, and strive to make it possible for the Soviet people to buy what they need in every city and every village in two or three years.

    What the Communist Party is constantly concerned about is building houses for the working people, and currently our houses are still not enough. This is also understandable: due to the continuous growth of industry, the residents of industrial centers and cities are increasing year by year. In the early years after the war, what needed to be built first were the cities, workers' residential areas, and villages that were burned down by the enemy in the past occupied areas, because millions of people were homeless in those places and they were crowded in air-raid shelters. The following figures illustrate the situation of our country in housing construction: in the past few years after the war, cities and workers' residential areas have built houses with a construction area of more than 183 million square meters for workers and staff, while in rural areas, more than 4 million houses have been built for collective farmers and rural intellectuals. The Soviet government constantly increases the appropriation for housing construction. In the past year alone, residents of cities and workers' residential areas have obtained houses with a construction area of more than 28 million square meters, while collective farmers and rural intellectuals have obtained more than 400,000 new houses. The government has done a lot of things. But this does not mean that the existing achievements can be satisfied. In 1954 and in the coming years, housing construction should have a broader scale. The Communist Party will unremittingly and consistently strive to further improve the living conditions of the working people.

    Schools, hospitals, children's institutions, and cultural institutions are being built everywhere in our cities and villages. In 1953, the investment in cultural and public utilities construction increased by 22 percent compared with 1952. The state's appropriations for the following projects increase year by year and will continue to increase in the future: developing health care, improving cities and workers' residential areas, increasing hospitals, maternity hospitals, clinics, sanatoriums, and resorts for the working people, and improving medical and welfare facilities for residents.

    The Communist Party will continue to work tirelessly to further improve the lives of the people, and the Party will resolutely and consistently implement the plan it has formulated to improve the material welfare of the working people. The Party considers this its sacred responsibility.

    The Party is always concerned about developing socialist culture, enriching the spiritual wealth of our people, and further developing national education, science, literature, and art. To make all workers and peasants cultured and educated people—this is the task of the Communist Party.

    Our country has realized seven-year universal compulsory education. By the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the transition from seven-year education to universal secondary education will be completed in the capitals of various federated republics, state centers, and border region centers, as well as major industrial centers across the country, in order to implement universal secondary education nationwide during the next Five-Year Plan period. The state's appropriations for national education are increasing year by year. Now, more than 57 million people in our country are participating in various studies. More than 3 million people are studying in colleges and specialized schools alone.

    The Party believes that ensuring the development and continuous development of advanced Soviet science is one of its most important tasks. Our scientists have all the conditions to engage in fruitful creative labor, and they have enriched science with many extremely great discoveries in all fields of knowledge. They have mastered the method of using atomic energy, thereby shattering the American monopoly on atomic energy. They are successfully solving many problems related to the use of our country's rich natural resources for the benefit of the people. All of these are indisputable. But at the same time, Soviet science still has many unresolved problems, first of all the problem of how to further accelerate the development of agriculture. While calling on Soviet scientists to solve these problems, the Party will try its best to consolidate and expand the creative cooperation and close contact between science and practice, and will try its best to apply the latest achievements in science to industry and agriculture, and to further continuously improve the lives of our people.

    Within the Soviet socialist system, there are huge and truly inexhaustible potentials that can be used to further and more vigorously develop our country's economy and culture, and to continuously improve the welfare of the people. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union considers it one of its basic and main tasks to fully utilize these potentials to ensure the further and comprehensive development of Soviet society and to ensure the continuous and rapid development of our country's productive forces. The higher the Soviet people raise the national productive forces, the more our industry and our agriculture produce, the faster the magnificent task of producing abundant products is solved, and the sooner communism can be victorious in our country.

    Continuously strengthening the national strength of the Soviet socialist state—the bastion of world peace and security—is the most important condition for our country to victoriously build a communist society. The strength and stability of our country depend on the unshakable alliance of the working class and collective farmers, on the spiritual and political unity of the entire Soviet society, and on the unbreakable friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    The Communist Party has tempered the solid alliance of workers and peasants into a decisive force, which guarantees the victory of the October Socialist Revolution and guarantees the completion of socialism in our country. This great force guarantees that we will achieve ever-increasing achievements on the glorious road of building communism. Further strengthening the alliance of workers and peasants is the condition for the closer unity of all the working people of our country around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and the basis for strengthening the strength and power of our socialist state.

    The Communist Party's national policy has eliminated the phenomena of hostility and discord among all nationalities in our country, and united them in a unified brotherly family. It has tempered the unbreakable friendship between all nationalities who enjoy equal rights, which is the source of the invincible power of the multi-ethnic Soviet state, and the premise for all the achievements of the fraternal Soviet republics. This friendship has grown and been consolidated in the common struggle of the people of all nationalities in our country against foreign aggressors, against the Tsarist autocracy, and against the oppression of capitalists and landlords. The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union have strengthened this friendship with blood in the domestic war and the Great Patriotic War. In the years of socialist construction in our country, common construction labor and mutual assistance have consolidated this friendship. This friendship is unbreakable and unshakable. This is a great brotherly friendship, and no force in the world can destroy this friendship. The grand national festival celebrated by the Ukrainian nation, the Russian nation, and the Soviet nationalities this year—the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia—vividly shows this unbreakable friendship of the Soviet nationalities.

    The Communist Party considers it its sacred responsibility to tirelessly consolidate the friendship of all nationalities, because it is the basis of the strength and invincible power of our socialist multi-ethnic country.

    Realizing the wishes of our people—guaranteeing peaceful labor and continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of the working people—is the sacred responsibility of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. Therefore, the Party and the government are doing everything possible to stop new wars, make all countries coexist peacefully, ease international tensions, and establish normal international relations.

    Our foreign policy is clear. This is a policy of peace and friendship with the people of all countries. This policy was announced by the great Lenin, the founder of our Party and the Soviet state, who pointed out the possibility of long-term peaceful coexistence between two different economic systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system. Only those short-sighted politicians in the capitalist camp will regard our consistent and sincere desire to strive for peace as a sign of weakness of the Soviet state. The Soviet Union defeated Hitler's Germany, which once enslaved many countries in Europe, which proves that it knows how to defend itself and how to give a fatal blow to any aggressor.

    After the war, our country has become stronger and more powerful. It has all the necessary conditions to ensure the peaceful labor of our people and to give a worthy blow to anyone who dares to infringe on our freedom and independence. We are not afraid of the threats of any aggressors, but for the benefit of our people and the people of all countries in the world, we resolutely and consistently advocate peace. We believe that there is no dispute in the current international situation that cannot be resolved by peaceful means.

    The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has been confirmed by all its actions. At present, the whole world sees the great difference between the artificially created atmosphere of unease and war frenzy in capitalist countries and the atmosphere of peaceful and creative construction labor and the atmosphere of stability and confidence peculiar to socialist countries. Everyone knows that what the Soviet people are mainly concerned about and most eager for is to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries. Any objective and unprejudiced person will believe this after seeing our cities and villages and seeing the inspiring peaceful labor of the Soviet people. Millions of people in all countries call our motherland the pioneer and banner of peace. The banner of peace and friendship with the people of all countries is sacred and inviolable to us Soviet people! We are and will always hold high this great and noble banner.

    The people's democratic countries in Asia and Europe and the peace-loving Soviet state are fighting together for peace in close brotherly solidarity. The People's Republic of China has become a powerful force in the camp of peace and democracy. Together with the Soviet Union, the entire camp of peace and democracy is growing and becoming stronger, and the movement of the people of all countries to defend peace is also developing and expanding. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union will use all its strength in the future to strive for peace, to strive to further consolidate the powerful socialist camp of peace and democracy, to strive to further strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet people and the great Chinese people and the working people of all people's democratic countries, and to strive to develop the economic ties between the Soviet Union and all countries in the world and establish friendly relations.

    While the Communist Party is vigilantly protecting the interests of the people and their peaceful labor, it cannot but take into account that there are still reactionary imperialist forces abroad that are trying to aggravate international tensions and incite new wars. Therefore, while firmly and consistently pursuing a policy of peace, while defending and protecting the sacred and great cause of peace for the people of all countries, the Party believes that it is necessary to tirelessly improve and strengthen the armed forces of the Soviet state to ensure the security of our motherland.

    The Soviet socialist system, which has forever eliminated the exploitation of man by man, has enabled the outstanding figures among the working class, collective farmers, and working intellectuals to manage the regime, forming the unbreakable spiritual and political unity of the entire Soviet society. This system is the most democratic social and state system in the world. The broad masses of the people themselves participate in the management of the Soviet state. The people of our country elect their most outstanding sons and daughters into the highest state power organ—the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    The task of the Communist Party is to tirelessly develop our Soviet socialist democracy, and strive to enable millions of working people to participate more widely and more actively in the management of the state. The Party has been carrying out and will continue to carry out an irreconcilable struggle to eliminate all kinds of bureaucratic and red-tape manifestations in some links of the Soviet organs, to correct the attitude of indifference and contempt towards the needs and opinions of the working people. The Party will tirelessly strengthen socialist legality to protect the sacred and inviolable rights of every citizen of our motherland stipulated in the Soviet Constitution.

    Comrade voters!

    The thirty-six years since the establishment of the Soviet state have irrefutably and clearly proved the indisputable and world-historical superiority of socialism over capitalism. Socialism means developing productive forces, means free and peaceful labor for oneself and the entire society, means continuously improving the welfare of the people, means establishing equality and friendship among all nationalities, and means consistently striving for lasting and durable peace. Capitalism means economic crisis, means the ruthless and cruel exploitation of the working people, means the terror of unemployment, means the poverty and hunger suffered by one part of society while another part is extravagant and obtains incredibly huge profits. Capitalism means national oppression and a policy of inciting hostility and war among nationalities.

    We all see how our country is full of new, vigorous, and vital forces, how it has overcome and overcome the incredible difficulties brought about by the war, how the people's lives have been improved, and how we are advancing confidently along the road to prosperity.

    How can the capitalist world be compared with us? The capitalist world gives the people a bleak prospect of economic decline and increasing poverty. No artificial expansion of the military industry can prevent the ruthless and increasingly imminent economic crisis in capitalist countries, the signs of which are becoming more and more obvious and serious. Unemployment is increasing, while peaceful industrial sectors are shrinking. The prices of daily necessities are constantly rising, taxes are increasing, and the living standards of the working people are declining. Domestic reaction is increasing, and the war frenzy that brings huge profits to monopoly capitalists is being promoted as much as possible.

    And the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, relying on the great superiority of the Soviet socialist system, firmly and confidently leads the country to the final victory of communism.

    In all its activities, the Party always follows the great doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and follows the wise instructions of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the immortal creator of the Communist Party and the founder of the Soviet state. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by J. V. Stalin, the Party led the people of all nationalities in our country to the victory of socialism along the road pointed out by Lenin. The Party has been realizing Lenin's instructions, it has been constantly strengthening the Soviet state, strengthening the unbreakable alliance of workers and peasants, strengthening the great friendship of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and tirelessly concerned about further prospering our economy and improving the material and cultural living standards of the Soviet people.

    Our country has all the necessary conditions to build a completely communist society. However, we still have some economic tasks to be solved and some difficulties in development. In order to victoriously solve our urgent tasks and overcome these shortcomings and difficulties, we must more widely launch self-criticism, especially criticism from below. The Communist Party wants to strive to make all Soviet people bravely and unreservedly expose the shortcomings in their work, and more actively help the Party to quickly correct these shortcomings.

    The reason why the Party has enabled our country to achieve victories with world-historical significance is that it is the advanced team of the working people, and that it has always relied on the trust of the people and the creative enthusiasm of millions of people. The Party deeply trusts the power of the people, trusts their revolutionary energy, and the Party has close and inseparable ties with the people. The great unity of the Party, the government, and the people is the living source of all our victories, and the foundation for our confident and steady advance along the road of communism.

    The electoral alliance formed by Communists and non-Party people is a vivid manifestation of this unity. The Communist Party, together with the trade unions, the Youth League, and other organizations and groups of the working people, participates in the election of the highest state power organ of our country—the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Candidates for representatives are jointly nominated by Communists and non-Party people.

    In the past elections, the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance have always inevitably achieved victory. The people of our country unanimously vote for the candidates of this alliance to express their full trust in the Communist Party and their support and support for its policies.

    The Communist Party hopes that in this election, all voters will also unanimously vote for the candidates jointly proposed by Communists and non-Party workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and once again express their trust in the Party and support for the Party's policies that reflect the fundamental interests of the people.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sincerely hopes that the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance will be unanimously elected as representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and hopes that voters will understand and support the policies implemented by the Party, and calls on all voters—male and female workers, male and female peasants, Soviet intellectuals, Soviet Army and Navy personnel to unite more closely around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and to struggle to realize the magnificent tasks of communist construction.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls on all Party members to unanimously elect non-Party candidates as representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, just as they elect Party member candidates as representatives. The Communist Party hopes that non-Party voters will unanimously elect Party member candidates as representatives, just as they elect non-Party candidates as representatives.

    Voters' votes for the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance are in favor of the Communist Party's policies, and are in favor of realizing the tasks stipulated by the Party—further developing our socialist industry, rapidly developing agriculture, continuously improving the material welfare and cultural level of the people, and striving to strengthen the strength and power of our socialist country, and achieve new achievements in the struggle to defend and consolidate peace, and in the struggle to build a communist society in our country. Comrade voters! The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls on you to unanimously go to the polling stations to vote on March 14, 1954. Every voter should not give up their glorious right to elect representatives to the Supreme Soviet. Let this day of March 14, 1954, be a national festival for the Soviet working people, and let it once again powerfully show the close unity of the Party, the government, and the people. Let us vote for the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance!

    Long live our great motherland—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

    Long live the great Soviet people, the builders of communism!

    Long live the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and all the people!

    Under the banner of Lenin-Stalin, under the leadership of the Communist Party, advance to the complete victory of communism!

      The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

专栏：

    苏联共产党中央委员会告全体选民，男女工人、男女农民、苏维埃知识分子和苏联陆海军人员书同志们！
    一九五四年三月十四日，苏维埃人民就要选举苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃代表了。
    我们的国家在强盛的情况下以经济和文化的迅速发展来迎接这一重大事件。
    苏维埃人民的最伟大的成就是重建了战争期间被德国法西斯侵略者破坏的工业企业、城市和乡村。几百个工厂、几十个城市、几千个村庄被敌人夷为平地，几百万人民无家可归。但是，在短短的几年以后，用最新型的机器装备重建起来的工业企业又加入了社会主义工业的行列；被敌人烧毁和破坏了的城市和乡村恢复了；曾有许多地区的居民挤在一团的防空壕填平了，设备优良的新住宅为居民建筑起来了。这一切都需要很大的努力，需要花费大量的人力和物力。但是，这一切都做到了！共产党和苏维埃政府的钢铁一般的意志，我国人民忘我的英雄劳动克服了一切困难，又一次显示了苏维埃制度的伟大的活力。
    苏维埃人民在他们迅速的、不可阻挡的前进中，已远远超过了战争中断他们和平劳动时的经济水平。上一届苏联最高苏维埃选举是在一九五○年，即第四个五年计划（战后第一个五年计划）最后一年举行的。在共产党领导下，苏维埃人民在胜利完成了那个五年计划以后，不遗余力地来完成新的第五个五年计划。一九五三年，苏联的工业总产量已增为战前一九四○年水平的二倍半。
    重工业一向是而且仍然是我们和平时期经济发展的基础，是国防力量的基础。党为了实行整个国民经济的社会主义改造并为国家准备积极的防御，早在战前就建立了强大的、头等的重工业。卫国战争以后，重工业的发展取得了新的巨大的成就。一九五三年，苏联生产了三千八百万吨钢，为一九四○年的二倍；三亿二千万吨煤，为一九四○年的二倍；五千二百万吨石油，比一九四○年增加百分之七十；一千三百三十亿瓩时电力，为一九四○年的二点八倍。我们工业的核心——苏联机器制造业正在以更大的速度发展着和扩大着：一九五三年生产的机器和设备为战前一九四○年的三点八倍。
    运输业和建筑业有了重要的发展。我们的辽阔的国土上的运输动脉——铁路、海路、内河和运河以及公路——上的工业品和农产品的货运量逐年增加。整个运输业现在都有强大的技术设备。工业、农业、文化和公用事业的企业、机关和住宅的建筑工作的工作量逐年增加。建筑机构得到了效力强大的机器和机械。
    在重工业发展方面所获得的成就已为大大增加日用品生产创造了条件。共产党和苏维埃政府拟订了一个加速发展轻工业和食品工业的广泛计划，以便在今后两、三年内大大增加对居民的粮食和工业品的供应。现在正在坚持不懈地实现这个计划，我国劳动人民已经亲眼看到党和政府所采取的各种措施的初步成绩。在一九五三年，特别是在一九五三年下半年，日用品工业发展的速度比一九五二年为大。这些工业一九五二年的产量增加了百分之十点五，而在一九五三年下半年就增加了百分之十四。几百个纺织工厂、鞋类和制革工厂以及食品工业企业正在建筑中。单是一九五三年一年，就将近有三百个生产日用品的新企业投入生产。轻工业和食品工业企业正在扩大并装设新式设备。
    为了进一步全力发展社会主义工业，党采取了一切措施来发掘并利用我们工业的内在潜力。我们仍然有落后的企业，甚至还有整个的工业部门不能完成规定的任务。许多新式机器有时未能加以很好的利用，设备闲置的时间仍旧很多。对产品的质量仍未予以足够的重视。不少的企业没有完成提高劳动生产率和减低生产成本的任务。在许多企业中，工厂的生产场地仍然利用得很不经济。在我们的经济领导干部中，仍然有落后的和不称职的人，他们墨守陈规，不认为他们有责任来尽一切可能采用先进的、进步的方法或积极支持生产革新者。要消灭这一切缺点，把落后的企业提高到先进的水平，就要发挥我们工业中的巨大的内在潜力，从而保证工业各部门的新的强大高涨。
    共产党深信，我们光荣的工人阶级和我们经验丰富的、熟练的工程师和技师们将以更大的规模展开社会主义竞赛，来完成我们工业、运输业和建筑业当前的伟大任务，并进一步提高劳动生产率，减低生产成本，提高产品质量，以及更经济地、更合理地利用我们所有的资源和潜力。
    我国农业获得了重大的成就。战争期间遭到破坏的集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场已完全恢复了。播种面积和主要农作物的单位面积产量不仅已经达到而且已经超过了战前水平。但是，党的出发点并不是农业发展方面所获得的这些不容争辩的巨大成就，而是劳动人民不断增长的物质需求。如果不进一步急速发展农业，就不能充分保证丰裕的粮食生产，不能为我们不断发展的轻工业和食品工业供应足够的原料。苏联共产党中央委员会九月全体会议的决议及党和政府随后所制订的一系列关于农业问题的决议，提出了一个战斗的、具体的纲领，规定迅速发展社会主义农业的一切部门，首先是饲畜业和马铃薯与蔬菜的生产。实现这个纲领是全党和全体苏联人民的迫切的任务。
    苏共中央九月全体会议闭幕后已经半年了，这段时间并不长，但就在这段不长的时间内已做了许多事情。农业的物质技术基础更加加强和巩固了。一九五三年，农业得到了十三万九千台一般用拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），一万八千台中耕用拖拉机，四万一千台谷物联合机，六万九千辆载货汽车，二百多万件耕作农具、播种机、收割机和其他农业机器，以及六百万吨矿质肥料。现在，全部问题在于正确地、以主人翁的态度利用强大的技术设备。鉴于干部具有决定性的意义，党派遣了十万多名农艺师、饲畜师到机器拖拉机站去为集体农庄服务，派出了大批善于组织正确地使用不断增加的拖拉机的工程师和技术人员。
    但是，党认为这一切措施在急速发展农业这个伟大的全民事业中，还只是第一个步骤。我们在机器拖拉机站、集体农庄、国营农场的工作中还有许多缺点，还有许多潜力没有发挥。譬如说，我们单只开垦我国东部、东南部和其他地区的处女地和荒地（这项工作党和政府已经开始进行），我们就有可能把谷物播种面积扩大几百万公顷。这个工作的意义是重大的。谷物是整个农业生产的基础：我们生产的谷物越多，那我们不仅能得到更多的粮食而且能得到更多的肉类、油类和其他畜产品。
    共产党深信：我国光荣的集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员会拿出自己的全部力量，以便在短期内发挥社会主义农业的全部潜力，把落后的区和集体农庄提高到先进的水平，使田地的单位面积产量和牲畜的产品生产率获得全面的高涨，从而使所有集体农庄毫无例外地都得到繁荣，使所有集体农民都成为生活富裕的人，使我国有足够的各种食品来供应日益增长的城市居民，并有足够的各种原料供应轻工业。
    共产党之所以不断提高整个社会生产（包括工业，也包括农业）的目的究竟是什么呢？这个目的就是继续不断地增进苏联人民的福利，充分满足苏联人民的不断增长的物质和文化需要。坚定不移地实现这一目的，是党和政府的一切活动的最高准则，是共产主义建设计划的最重要的一个组成部分。我们之所以要建造和扩充工厂和电力站，敷设新铁路，巩固集体农庄，以最新式的、最先进的机器供给农业，我们之所以要在这一切方面投入大量的资金，归根到底都是为了使工人、集体农民、知识分子——全体苏联人生活得更美好，为了逐年逐日地提高我国人民的物质和文化水平。
    我国经济的全面提高是劳动人民的收入不断提高的基础。职工的实际工资正在不断地提高。工业品和食品的国家零售价格一年年地节节减低。国家预算中给居民的利益和拨款，如社会保险津贴和养老金，多子女母亲或单身母亲的津贴，免费医疗，免费教育，提高业务的免费训练等等费用都在增加。随着职工的货币工资和实际工资的提高，农民的收入也在增加。一九五三年，降低了农业税和集体农民私人经济的义务交售定额，提高了大部农产品的征购和收购价格，完全免除了集体农民往年积欠的农业税，取消了集体农民往年在交售给国家的牲畜产品、马铃薯方面的欠数。取消了集体农庄往年在交售马铃薯和蔬菜方面的欠数。这一切都促进了集体农民物质福利的提高。仅是由于对集体农庄和集体农民实行经济上的鼓励以及在税收政策方面所采取的一些措施，一九五三年集体农庄和集体农民的收入就增加了一百三十多亿卢布。
    贸易不断地在扩大。一九五三年贸易系统获得了价值比年度计划规定多三百三十亿卢布的商品。仅仅国家贸易和合作社贸易一九五三年出售给居民的商品就比一九五二年多百分之二十一。销售量增加得特别多的是下列的产品和商品：肉类、油类、乳酪、糖、蔬菜、丝织品、衣服、鞋类、家具、缝纫机、钟表、留声机、收音机、电视机、自行车、机器脚踏车和小汽车。党和政府一面不断地增加日用品的生产，一面采取措施，增加和扩大商店和其他贸易企业。共产党提出一项任务——这个任务一定要实现的——坚决改善苏维埃贸易的组织工作和对消费者的服务水平，力求两三年以后使苏联人民在每一个城市和每一个农村中都能买到他们所需要的东西。
    共产党经常不断关怀的是为劳动人民建筑住宅，目前我们的住宅还不够。这也是可以理解的：由于工业不断地增长，工业中心和城市的居民一年年在增加着。在战后的最初几年中，首先需要建筑的是过去敌占区内被敌人焚毁的城市、工人居住区和村庄，因为在那些地方有几百万人无家可归，他们挤在防空壕中。下列的数字说明了我国在住宅建设方面的情况：在战后几年中，各城市和工人住宅区为工人和职员建筑了建筑面积达一亿八千三百多万平方公尺的房屋，而在农村，为集体农民和农村知识分子建筑了四百多万幢住宅，苏联政府经常不断地增加对住宅建设的拨款。单在去年一年，城市和工人住宅区的居民就获得了二千八百多万平方公尺建筑面积的房屋，而集体农民和农村知识分子则获得了四十多万幢新住宅，政府作了很多的事情。但这并不是说，可以满足现有的成就。在一九五四年和今后各年内，住宅建设应当具有更广泛的规模。共产党将坚持不懈和始终不渝地力求进一步改善劳动人民的居住条件。
    在我国的城市和农村，到处都在建筑学校、医院、儿童机构和文化机关。一九五三年对文化和公用事业建设的投资额比一九五二年增加了百分之二十二。国家在下列项目上的拨款一年比一年增加，而且将来还要继续不断地增加，这些项目是：发展保健事业，改善城市和工人住宅区，增设医院、产妇院、诊疗所、疗养院和劳动人民的休养所，改善居民的医疗和福利设施。
    共产党将继续不倦地为进一步改善人民的生活而努力，党将坚决地、坚持不懈地执行它所制订的提高劳动人民物质福利的计划。党认为这是自己的神圣责任。
    党时刻关心发展社会主义文化，丰富我国人民的精神财富，进一步发展国民教育、科学、文学和艺术。使全体工人和农民都成为有文化和有教养的人——这就是共产党的任务。
    我国已经实现了七年制普及义务教育。到第五个五年计划结束时，在各加盟共和国首都、州中心和边疆区中心，以及全国各大工业中心，将完成从七年制教育到普及中等教育的过渡，以便在下一个五年计划期间在全国范围内实行普及中等教育。国家在国民教育方面的拨款一年比一年增多。现在我国参加各种学习的人有五千七百万以上。单在高等学校和专科学校学习的就有三百多万人。
    党认为保证发扬并不断发展先进的苏维埃科学，是自己的最重要的任务之一。我国的科学家有着一切条件来从事有成效的创造劳动，他们以一切知识领域内的许多极其伟大的发现丰富了科学。他们掌握了利用原子能的方法，从而粉碎了美国在原子能方面的垄断。他们正在顺利地解决有关利用我国的丰富自然资源来为人民谋福利的许多问题。所有这些都是无可争辩的。但是同时，苏联科学仍然有着许多没有解决的问题，首先是关于如何进一步加速发展农业的问题。党一方面号召苏联科学家来解决这些问题，一方面将尽力设法巩固和扩大科学和实践之间的创造性的合作和紧密的联系，将尽力设法把科学上的最新成就运用到工业和农业中去，并用来进一步不断改善我国人民的生活。
    在苏维埃社会主义制度内，蕴藏着巨大的、真正取之不尽的潜力，可以用来进一步地、更加大力地发展我国的经济和文化，用来不断增进人民的福利。苏联共产党认为充分地利用这些潜力以保证苏维埃社会的进一步的全面的发展，保证我国生产力的不断的迅速发展，是自己的一个基本的和主要的任务。苏联人民把全国的生产力提得愈高，我们的工业和我们的农业生产的东西就愈多，生产丰裕产品的宏伟任务就解决得愈快，共产主义也就能在我国愈早地获得胜利。
    不断加强苏维埃社会主义国家——世界和平与安全的堡垒——的国力，是我国胜利地建设共产主义社会最重要的条件。我们国家的强大和稳固，依靠工人阶级和集体农民不可动摇的联盟，依靠整个苏维埃社会精神上和政治上的团结一致，依靠苏联各族人民牢不可破的友谊。
    共产党把巩固的工农联盟锻炼成为一种决定性的力量，这种力量保证了十月社会主义革命的胜利，保证了我国社会主义的建成。这种伟大的力量保证我们在建设共产主义的光荣道路上获得日新月异的成就。工农联盟的进一步加强是我国全体劳动人民更紧密地团结在共产党和苏维埃政府周围的条件，是加强我们社会主义国家的力量和威力的基础。
    共产党的民族政策消除了我国各族人民之间的仇视和不睦的现象，把他们团结在一个统一的兄弟大家庭中。它锻炼了享有平等权利的各族人民之间牢不可破的友谊，这种友谊是多民族苏维埃国家不可战胜的力量的源泉，是各兄弟苏维埃共和国获得一切成就的前提。这种友谊是我国各族人民在反对外国侵略者、反对沙皇专制、反对资本家和地主的压迫的共同斗争中成长和巩固起来的，苏联各族人民在国内战争和伟大卫国战争中用鲜血加强了这种友谊。在我国进行社会主义建设的年代中，共同的建设劳动和互助巩固了这种友谊。这种友谊是牢不可破的、不可动摇的。这是一种伟大的兄弟友谊，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这种友谊，今年乌克兰民族、俄罗斯民族和苏联各民族所庆祝的盛大的全民节日——乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年，就鲜明地显示了苏联各族人民的这种牢不可破的友谊。
    共产党认为它的神圣责任是，不倦地巩固各族人民的友谊，因为它是我们社会主义多民族国家的实力和不可战胜的力量的基础。
    实现我国人民的愿望——保证和平劳动及不断提高劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平，这是共产党和苏联政府的神圣责任。因此，党和政府正在竭尽全力制止新战争，使各国人民和平共处，缓和国际紧张局势，建立正常的国际关系。
    我们的外交政策是明确的。这是和平与各国人民友好的政策。这个政策是我们党和苏维埃国家的缔造者伟大的列宁所宣布的，列宁指出了两种不同的经济制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度长期和平共处的可能性。只有资本主义阵营中的那些目光最短浅的政客，才会把我们始终不变的、争取和平的真诚愿望看作苏维埃国家软弱的表现。苏联击溃了曾经奴役过欧洲许多国家的希特勒德国，这就证明它知道怎样自卫和怎样给任何侵略者以致命的打击。
    战后，我国变得更加强大、更加有力了。它有着一切必要条件来保障我国人民的和平劳动，并给任何胆敢侵犯我们的自由和独立的人以应有的打击。我们不怕任何侵略者的威胁，但为了我国人民和世界各国人民的利益，我们坚决地、坚持不渝地主张和平。我们相信，目前国际局势中没有任何争端是不能用和平方法解决的。
    苏联的和平外交政策已经被它的一切行动证实了。目前，全世界都看到：在资本主义国家中那种人为的不安和战争狂的气氛，跟社会主义国家所特有的那种和平的、创造的建设劳动的环境以及安定的、充满信心的气氛，是有着多么大的差别。大家都知道，苏联人主要关心的和最渴望的是和各国人民和平友好相处。任何一个客观的、没有成见的人，在看到我国的城市和农村、看到苏联人民的令人鼓舞的和平劳动之后，都会相信这一点。各国千千万万的人都把我们祖国称为和平的先驱和旗手。和平与各国人民友好的旗帜对我们苏联人来说，是神圣不可侵犯的！我们正在而且将永远高高举起这面伟大、崇高的旗帜。
    欧亚两洲各人民民主国家和爱好和平的苏维埃国家，在紧密的兄弟团结中一同为和平而奋斗。中华人民共和国已成为和平民主阵营中的强大力量。跟苏联一道，整个和平民主阵营日益成长和壮大，各国人民的保卫和平运动也在发展和扩大。苏联共产党今后将以自己的全部力量来争取和平，争取进一步巩固强大的和平民主社会主义阵营，争取进一步加强苏联人民和伟大的中国人民及各人民民主国家的劳动人民的友好与合作，争取尽力发展苏联与世界各国的经济联系以及建立友好的关系。
    共产党在警惕地保护人民的利益和他们的和平劳动，同时也不能不估计到，在国外还有着反动的帝国主义势力存在，它们企图加剧国际紧张局势，企图煽动新的战争。因此，在坚定不移和始终不渝地推行和平政策的同时，在捍卫和保护各国人民的神圣的伟大和平事业的同时，党认为必须不倦地改进和加强苏维埃国家的武装力量，以保证我们祖国的安全。
    永远消灭了人对人的剥削的苏维埃社会主义制度，使工人阶级、集体农民和劳动知识分子中的优秀人物管理了政权，形成了整个苏维埃社会的牢不可破的精神上和政治上的团结一致。这一制度是世界上最民主的社会和国家制度。广大的人民群众自己参加管理苏维埃国家。我国人民把自己最优秀的儿女选进最高国家政权机关——苏联最高苏维埃。
    共产党的任务就是不倦地发展我们苏维埃社会主义民主，力求使千百万劳动人民更广泛、更积极地参加管理国家。党已在进行而且还要继续进行不调和的斗争，以消除苏维埃机关的某些环节的各种官僚主义和繁文缛礼的表现作风，以纠正对劳动人民的需求和意见采取漠不关心和轻视的态度。党将不倦地加强社会主义法治，以保障苏联宪法所规定的我们祖国每个公民的神圣不可侵犯的权利。
    选民同志们！
    苏维埃国家成立以来的三十六年，无可反驳地和明显地证明了社会主义较之资本主义具有着无可争辩的、有世界历史意义的优越性。社会主义就是发展生产力，就是为了自己和整个社会而进行自由的和平的劳动，就是不断增进人民的福利，就是建立各民族间的平等和友谊，就是为巩固的持久的和平而一贯奋斗。资本主义就是经济危机，就是对劳动人民无情的和残酷的剥削，就是失业的恐怖，就是社会上一部分人遭受贫困和饥饿而另一部分人穷奢极欲和获得难以置信的庞大利润。资本主义就意味着民族压迫和煽动各民族间敌意和战争的政策。
    我们大家都看到，我们国家是如何充满着新的、朝气勃勃的和富有生命力的力量，它如何战胜并克服了战争所带来的不可思议的困难，人民的生活得到怎样的改善，我们怎样满怀信心地沿着繁荣的道路前进。
    资本主义世界怎么能和我们相比呢？资本主义世界给予人民的是经济衰落和日益贫困的黯淡前途。任何人为地扩大军事工业，都不能够防止资本主义国家中无情的日益迫近的经济危机，这种经济危机的征象越来越明显和严重。失业现象不断增加，而和平工业部门却不断缩小。日用必需品的价格不断上涨，税额日增，劳动人民的生活水平日益下降。国内反动有增无已，给垄断资本家带来巨额利润的战争狂正在被尽力鼓吹。
    而苏联共产党凭借苏维埃社会主义制度的极大的优越性，坚定地和满怀信心地把国家引向共产主义的最后胜利。
    党在其全部活动中始终遵循着马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，遵循着不朽的共产党的缔造者和苏维埃国家的奠基者乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁的英明遗训。党在以约·维·斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导下，沿着列宁所指出的道路领导我们祖国各族人民取得了社会主义的胜利。党一直在实现列宁的遗训，它不断地在加强苏维埃国家，加强牢不可破的工农联盟，加强苏联各族人民的伟大友谊，不倦地关心进一步繁荣我国经济和提高苏联人的物质和文化生活水平。
    我国已具备了建设完全的共产主义社会的充分的一切必要条件。然而，我们还有一些尚待解决的经济任务，还有某些发展中的困难。为了胜利地解决我们的迫切的任务并克服这些缺点和困难，我们必须更广泛地展开自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。共产党要力求做到使全体苏联人勇敢地、无所顾忌地揭露工作中的缺点，更积极地帮助党迅速改正这些缺点。
    党之所以能使我国取得具有全世界历史意义的胜利，是因为它是劳动人民的先进的队伍，是因为它始终是依靠着人民的信任和千百万人的创造积极性。党深深信任人民的力量，信任他们的革命精力，党和人民有着密切的和不可分割的联系。党、政府和人民的伟大的团结一致就是我们一切胜利的活的泉源，就是我们沿着共产主义道路满怀信心稳步前进的基础。
    共产党人和非党人民结成的选举联盟就是这种团结一致的鲜明表现。共产党与工会、青年团以及其他劳动人民的组织和团体一起，参加我国最高国家政权机关——苏联最高苏维埃的选举。代表候选人是由共产党人和非党人民联合提名的。
    在过去历届选举中，共产党和非党联盟总是必然取得胜利。我国人民一致投这一联盟的候选人的票，以此来表示他们对共产党的充分信任和对它的政策的拥护和支持。
    共产党希望在这一次选举中，全体选民也将一致投共产党人与非党工人、农民、知识分子所共同提出的候选人，再一次表示信任党和支持反映人民根本利益的党的政策。
    苏联共产党中央委员会衷心希望共产党和非党联盟候选人被一致选举为苏联最高苏维埃代表，希望选民们了解和拥护党所执行的政策，并号召全体选民——男女工人、男女农民、苏维埃知识分子、苏联陆海军人员更紧密地团结在共产党和苏维埃政府的周围，为实现宏伟的共产主义建设任务而奋斗。
    苏联共产党中央委员会号召全体党员，像选举党员候选人为代表一样，一致选举非党候选人为苏联最高苏维埃代表。共产党希望，非党选民像选举非党候选人为代表一样，一致选举党员候选人为代表。
    选民们投共产党和非党联盟候选人的票，就是赞成共产党的政策，就是赞成实现党所规定的任务——进一步发展我们的社会主义工业，急速发展农业，不断提高人民的物质福利和文化水平，尽力加强我们社会主义国家的力量和威力，在保卫和巩固和平的斗争中，在我国建设共产主义社会的斗争中获得新的成就。选民同志们！苏联共产党中央委员会号召你们在一九五四年三月十四日一致前往选举站投票。每一个选民都不要放弃自己选举最高苏维埃代表的光荣权利。让一九五四年三月十四日这一天成为苏联劳动人民的全民的节日，让它再度有力地显示出党、政府和人民的紧密团结。让我们投共产党和非党联盟候选人的票！
    我们伟大的祖国——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    共产主义的建设者——伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    共产党、苏维埃政府和全体人民牢不可破的团结万岁！
    在列宁—斯大林的旗帜下，在共产党的领导下，向共产主义的完全胜利前进！
      苏联共产党中央委员会
