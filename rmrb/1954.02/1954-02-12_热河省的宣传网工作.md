    Propaganda Network Work in Rehe Province
    Lu Sen
    Over the past three years, in implementing the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the Masses of People Throughout the Party," the CCP Rehe Provincial organizations have made certain progress in terms of leadership thinking, the general understanding of propaganda work among party members, the organization of the propaganda network, and the effectiveness of propaganda work.
    Three years ago, the Party Central Committee pointed out in its decision on establishing a propaganda network: "Currently, the party's organizations at all levels neglect the regular propaganda work for the masses of people." The situation in Rehe was no exception at that time. Many comrades believed that propaganda work was only the responsibility of the propaganda departments, while comrades in the propaganda departments were accustomed to rushing around during sudden campaigns and commemorative festivals, lacking regular work. However, over the past three years, under the leadership of the Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, through the tempering and education of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and anti-bureaucracy, anti-commandism, and anti-violation of law and discipline, the ideological awareness of party members throughout the province has generally improved, and bureaucracy and commandism have been basically overcome. Therefore, more importance has been attached to regular propaganda work. It is on this basis that the propaganda network has grown from scratch, from small to large. Now, the province has 1,800 Party reporters and 80,000 propagandists. The working system for leading the propaganda network has also been gradually consolidated. Counties regularly hold meetings such as representatives of propagandists' meetings and propagandists' forums. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties and banners, in the second half of 1953, county party committees held a total of 13 joint meetings of branch secretaries and propagandist representatives' meetings, with 1,341 participants; district committees held a total of 209 joint meetings of branch secretaries and propagandist representatives' meetings, with 8,174 participants. The connection between reporters and propagandists and the work of transmission stations have also been gradually strengthened. For example, seven district-level reporters in the 5th district of Wudan grasped the three transmission stations in the district in 1953, regularly dividing the work to transmit information to 208 propagandists in the district, a total of 29 times in ten months. Each reporter also strengthened the leadership of the village branch propagandist meetings and propagandist group meetings on a village-by-village basis. According to statistics from five villages, district reporters helped village branches hold propagandist meetings 41 times, group meetings 85 times, and district propagandist representatives' meetings 5 times, commending 40 model propagandists and rewarding 14. Now, more than 95 percent of the propagandists in the district can play a role.
          Over the past three years, reporters and propagandists have played a significant role in both sudden and regular propaganda work. For example, the Chengde Agricultural Implement Factory had failed to complete its production tasks for one year and three months in the past. Since April 1953, it has paid attention to propaganda work, especially strengthening propaganda work in finding "窍门" (qiàomén, "tricks of the trade" or "key methods"). In the second quarter alone, employees were mobilized to find 128 窍门, and production efficiency generally increased, some by as much as 30 times. As a result, the production task for the second quarter was completed seven days ahead of schedule. Another example is the cadres in the 10th district of Beipiao County, whose style of forced command was very serious. However, after the establishment of "one station and three networks" in 1953, the style of forced command was basically overcome, and the connection between the Party and the people was strengthened.
    In the three years of building the propaganda network, there are the following points of experience:
      (1) Three years of experience have proven that the consolidation and development of the propaganda network is certainly a regular task, but it is also a leap-forward advancement. The propaganda network in Rehe Province has fully served the large-scale political movements such as the peace signature campaign, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti," the "Five-Anti," the implementation of the Marriage Law, and the general election, as well as the central tasks of spring plowing, drought resistance, etc.
  On the one hand, it fully served these movements, and on the other hand, it was rectified and developed in these movements. In these movements, reporters and propagandists played a full role because the tasks were prominent, the strength of the whole Party was concentrated, and the leading organs of the Party at all levels were most likely to grasp leadership, supervision, and specific assistance. Reporters and propagandists, because they were deployed comprehensively at the same time, were also most likely to encourage and help each other. In these movements, the propaganda network was also easy to rectify and develop, because reporters and propagandists received better training in these movements, the quality of their work was easy to assess, and a group of new activists emerged. The leadership to rectify and develop the propaganda network was also more concentrated. Therefore, in addition to attaching importance to using the propaganda network in regular work and combining it with consolidating and developing the propaganda network, Party organizations must also pay special attention to fully using and vigorously rectifying and developing the propaganda network in each sudden central task and major political movement.
    (2) The organizational form of the propaganda network, as well as the main organizational components of the propaganda network, must be adapted to the needs of production and mutual aid and cooperation, so as to promote the development of production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, thereby facilitating the development and consolidation of the propaganda network. In 1951, a large proportion of the propagandists developed in various parts of Rehe Province were primary school students. Although they used forms such as loudspeakers, rooftop broadcasts, amateur theater troupes, and blackboards for propaganda, they played a certain role, but they could not combine propaganda with production and mutual aid and cooperation, so they did not have a great effect on promoting production. In the spring of 1953, the Rehe Provincial Propagandist Representatives' Meeting proposed that the main development targets for rural propagandists should be farmer activists in mutual aid teams, agricultural production cooperatives, collective farms, and state-owned farms, and also proposed that propagandist groups should be organized as far as possible on the basis of teams and cooperatives. The experience of the past year has proven that this approach is a better way to closely integrate the propaganda network with production and mutual aid and cooperation, and is an organizational guarantee for in-depth propaganda in production and mutual aid and cooperation.
    (3) After the establishment of the propaganda network, there must be regular leadership from the Party organization; otherwise, the propaganda network cannot always play a role. So, how can the Party achieve regular leadership of the propaganda network? First and foremost, the most fundamental thing is to strengthen the regular leadership of the Party branch. The common characteristic of the several model villages in propaganda work that were rewarded last year is that the branch paid more attention to the leadership of the propaganda network and propaganda work, and the branch secretary or branch propaganda committee member themselves were model propagandists. Conversely, where the branch does not manage the propaganda network or does not manage it enough, the role of the propaganda network is small, or even just an empty shell. Therefore, how to strengthen the Party branch's leadership of the propaganda network is of decisive significance for doing a good job in propaganda network work. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly explain the leadership relationship of the branch to the propaganda network, and establish and improve the organizational system of leadership, mainly the division of labor of the branch leadership, the meeting system within the scope of the whole branch and the group, and the reporting system. Secondly, when provincial, county, and district Party cadres go to work in the villages, they must use the propagandists through the village branch. It is wrong to use propagandists over the heads of the branch, or even to ignore the existing propagandists and organize a group of temporary propagandists.
    At the same time, the leading organizations of the Party at the provincial, county, and district levels should all face the Party branch in their work on the propaganda network, that is, they should help the branch do a good job in the work of propagandists as directly as possible. The province, county, and district levels should have appropriate divisions of labor. The main responsibilities of the province and county levels are to provide basic propaganda materials in a timely manner and summarize and promote the experience of propagandists' work. The method of supplying materials is that the provincial level mainly compiles basic propaganda materials. The propaganda points issued are generally only suitable for reporters and not for the needs of propagandists. Therefore, in addition to key points, it is also necessary to frequently compile short and popular propaganda materials such as "blackboard newspapers," "propagandist speeches," and literary and artistic propaganda products. The county level mainly runs training classes for propagandist backbones, propagandist sectional meetings, and district transmission station personnel meetings to convey and explain work tasks and propaganda materials compiled by the province and county. The main methods of summarizing and promoting experience are to hold propagandist representatives' meetings separately by the province and county. The role of this kind of representative meeting is to summarize and promote experience, commend and reward models, so as to cultivate the backbone of propagandists. The district committee leadership should mainly focus on the transmission station and the joint meeting of branch secretaries, especially the transmission of the transmission station should be carried out regularly. But it must be pointed out that the propagandist training classes and sectional meetings held at the county level, and the transmission carried out by the district committee, must be combined with strengthening the branch's leadership of the propagandists, that is to say, the main targets of training and transmission should be the leading cadres of the branch and the backbone of the propagandists, and the main contents of training and transmission should be the propaganda tasks and their significance and basic propaganda materials (striving to combine them with the actual situation of the local masses at that time), and they should be responsible for conveying them back through the branch, studying them in conjunction with the situation in each village, so as to stipulate the specific content and methods of propaganda in each village. County and district Party cadres who go to the countryside should be given the task of helping the branch lead the work of the propaganda network, and this should be regarded as a working system. This is very beneficial for strengthening the branch's regular leadership of the propaganda network.
      (4) Only when the Party's propagandists unite all the propaganda forces that can be united, master all the propaganda tools that can be mastered, and achieve a huge team of so-called "many soldiers, many generals, and complete weapons" can they play a huge propaganda role. Take Sanhe Village in Chengde County as an example. Before the rectification in 1953, there were many propaganda talents and propaganda tools in the village, but they were not used. After the rectification, attention was paid to giving play to the role of other propaganda forces, so that they and the propagandists divided the work and mastered the singing group, blackboard newspaper, and other organizations and tools, which made the propaganda work look brand new.
    The number of propagandists in a village or a factory should not be too small. As long as they meet the conditions, there should be as many as possible; but they still cannot encompass all propaganda forces. Therefore, the unity and cooperation of propagandists with them is very important.
    The propaganda method of propagandists is mainly oral and individual propaganda; but all other effective forms of propaganda should not be abandoned. Therefore, all propaganda organization tools should be effectively mastered. Film teams and cultural halls and stations have now formed an important propaganda force in cities and villages. The propaganda departments of Party committees should regard them as an important part of the propaganda network, strengthen their guidance in terms of policies, principles, and ideology, so as to closely combine their reporters' and propagandists' activities and give full play to their propaganda role.
    Of course, there are still many shortcomings in the work of the propaganda network in Rehe Province. For example, some Party organizations still lack regular leadership for the work of reporters and propagandists, and some Party organizations have not yet included the issue of the work of reporters and propagandists on the agenda. Under these circumstances, the work of reporters and propagandists will be pushed forward and stopped, and will be done sometimes and not done at other times. This situation needs to be changed in the future.

    热河省的宣传网工作
    鲁森
    三年来，中共热河省各级组织在执行党中央的“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”中，不论在领导思想上、一般党员对宣传工作的认识上、宣传网的组织上，以及宣传工作的成效上，都有一定的进步。
    三年前，党中央在关于建立宣传网的决定中指出：“目前我们党的各级组织忽视对于人民群众进行经常的宣传工作”，当时热河的情况并不例外。有许多同志认为宣传工作只是宣传部门的事，而宣传部门同志则习惯于在突击性的运动和纪念节日里奔忙一阵，没有经常性的工作。然而，三年来，在中央和东北局的领导下，经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”和反官僚主义、反命令主义、反违法乱纪等等运动的锻炼和教育，全省党员的觉悟水平普遍提高了，官僚主义和命令主义基本上克服了，因而对经常的宣传工作也就重视了。正是在这一基础上，宣传网从无到有，从小到大，现在全省已有党的报告员一千八百人，有宣传员八万人。领导宣传网的工作制度也逐渐巩固，各县经常召开宣传员代表会和宣传员座谈会等会议。据十个县、旗不完全统计，在一九五三年下半年，县委共召开支部书记联席会、宣传员代表会十三次，参加人数为一千三百四十一人；区委共召开支部书记联席会、宣传员代表会二百零九次，参加人数为八千一百七十四人。报告员与宣传员的联系及传授站的工作也逐渐加强了。例如乌丹五区七名区级报告员，一九五三年抓紧了全区三个传授站，经常分工向全区二百零八名宣传员进行传授，十个月共传授二十九次。每个报告员又以村为单位加强了村支部宣传员会议和宣传员小组会议的领导。据五个村统计：区报告员帮助村支部召开宣传员会议四十一次，小组会议八十五次，召开区宣传员代表会五次，表扬模范宣传员四十名，奖励十四名。现在该区百分之九十五以上的宣传员都能起作用。
          三年来，报告员与宣传员，无论在突击性或经常性的宣传工作中，都起了很大的作用。例如承德农具厂，过去曾有一年零三个月未完成生产任务，从一九五三年四月起，注意了宣传工作，特别是加强了找“窍门”中的宣传工作。仅第二季度就发动职工找出窍门一百二十八个，生产效率普遍提高，有的提高到三十倍。这样第二季度生产任务就提前七天完成。又如北票县十区干部，原来强迫命令作风非常严重，但在一九五三年建立“一站三网”后，基本上克服了强迫命令作风，密切了党与人民的联系。
    在三年来的建立宣传网工作中，有以下几点体会：
      （一）三年来的经验证明，宣传网的巩固与发展固然是经常性的工作，但是又是跳跃式前进的。热河省的宣传网在三年来的和平签名、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”、贯彻婚姻法、普选等大的政治运动，及春耕、抗旱等等突击性的中心任务中，
  一方面全力为这些运动服务，另一方面又在这些运动中得到了整顿和发展。在这些运动中，报告员、宣传员充分发挥了作用，其原因是：任务突出，全党力量集中，各级党的领导机关，又最可能做到抓紧领导督促和具体帮助。报告员和宣传员由于同时全面出动，也最易起到相互鼓励相互帮助的作用。在这些运动中，宣传网也便于整顿和发展。因为报告员和宣传员在这些运动中受到了较好的锻炼，工作的优劣也容易评定，同时出现了一批新的积极分子，整顿发展宣传网的领导力量也更集中。因此，党的组织除了应该重视在经常工作中使用宣传网并结合巩固发展宣传网以外，还必须特别重视在每个突击性的中心任务和大的政治运动中充分使用和大力整顿发展宣传网。
    （二）宣传网的组织形式，以及宣传网的主要组织成分，必须适应于生产及互助合作的需要，这样才可以推动生产及互助合作运动的发展，从而也便利宣传网的发展巩固。一九五一年热河全省各地发展的宣传员中，有很大一部分是小学生，他们虽利用广播筒、屋顶广播、业余剧团、黑板报等形式进行宣传，起了一定作用，但不能结合生产及互助合作进行宣传，因而对推动生产作用不大。一九五三年春，热河全省宣传员代表会议提出农村宣传员的主要的发展对象是互助组、农业生产合作社、集体农庄和国营农场中的农民积极分子，同时提出尽可能以组、社为单位编宣传员小组。一年来的经验证明，这样做法是使宣传网与生产及互助合作密切结合的较好办法，是深入生产与互助合作宣传的组织保证。
    （三）宣传网建立以后，必须有党组织的经常领导，否则不能使宣传网经常起作用。那么，党怎样做到对宣传网的经常领导呢？首先，最基本的是加强党的支部的经常领导。去年所奖励的几个宣传工作模范村，其共同特点是支部比较注意对宣传网和宣传工作的领导，并且支部书记或支部宣传委员自己就是模范宣传员。相反的，支部不管宣传网或者管得不够的地方，宣传网的作用很小，甚至是空架子。因此，如何加强党支部对宣传网的领导，对作好宣传网工作有决定意义。因此，明确交代支部对宣传网的领导关系，并建立和健全领导的组织制度，主要是支部领导的分工、全支部及小组范围的会议、汇报制度。其次，省、县、区党员干部去村工作时必须通过村支部去使用宣传员。越过支部使用宣传员，甚至撇开现有的宣传员不用，而去组织一批临时宣传员，都是不对的。
    同时，省、县、区三级党的领导组织，在宣传网的工作上都应该面向党支部，即应尽可能直接帮助支部做好宣传员工作。省、县、区三级应有适当分工，省、县两级主要责任是及时供给基本宣传材料和总结推广宣传员工作经验。供给材料的方法，省级主要编写基本宣传材料。所发的宣传要点一般只是适合报告员而不适合宣传员的需要。所以，除要点外，还需要经常编写“黑板报”、“宣传员讲话”及文艺宣传品等简短、通俗的宣传材料。县级主要是开办宣传员骨干训练班，宣传员片会，区传授站人员会议等，传达讲解工作任务及省、县编写的宣传员材料。总结和推广经验的主要办法，是由省、县分别召开宣传员代表会议，这种代表会议的作用就在于总结推广经验，表扬奖励模范，以培养宣传员的骨干。区委领导应主要抓住传授站和支部书记联席会议，特别是传授站的传授应经常坚持进行。但须提出：县级召开的宣传员训练班和片会，及区委进行的传授都必须与加强支部对宣传员的领导结合起来，就是说，训练和传授的主要对象应是支部的领导干部和宣传员的骨干，训练和传授的主要内容是宣传任务及其意义和基本宣传材料（力求结合当时当地群众实际情况），责成他们回去后通过支部传达，结合各村情况进行研究，从而规定各村宣传的具体内容和做法。县、区党员干部下乡，应交给他们帮助支部领导宣传网的工作任务，并将这作为一种工作制度。这对于加强支部对宣传网的经常领导很有好处。
      （四）党的宣传员只有团结了一切可能团结的宣传力量，掌握了一切可能掌握的宣传工具，做到所谓“兵多将广武器全”的庞大队伍，才能发挥巨大的宣传作用。以承德县三合村为例。在一九五三年未整顿前，村里有不少宣传人材和宣传工具，但没有使用。整顿以后，就注意了发挥了其他宣传力量的作用，使他们和宣传员分工掌握了演唱组、黑板报等组织和工具，这就使宣传工作面貌一新。
    一个村庄、一个工厂，宣传员的人数不可太少，只要合乎条件，应尽量多些；但仍不能包罗一切宣传力量，因此，宣传员与他们的团结合作就很重要。
    宣传员的宣传方法，主要是口头的个别的宣传；但不应放弃其他一切有效的宣传形式。因此，对所有的宣传组织工具都应切实掌握起来。电影队和文化馆、站，目前已在城市和乡村中形成一个重要的宣传力量，党委宣传部门要把他们当做宣传网的重要组成部分之一，加强其方针、政策、思想领导，才能使其报告员、宣传员的活动密切结合起来，并充分发挥其宣传作用。
    当然目前热河省的宣传网工作上仍存在很多缺点的。如有些党的组织对报告员、宣传员工作还缺乏经常性的领导，有些党的组织还没有把报告员、宣传员的工作问题列入议事日程，在此情况下，报告员、宣传员的工作也就推推动动，忽做忽辍。这种情况是需要今后设法改变的。
