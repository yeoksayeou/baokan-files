    Strengthening Party Unity is the Fundamental Guarantee for Achieving the General Line of the Transition Period

    From February 6th to 10th, 1954, the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Fourth Plenary Session. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, entrusted by the Central Political Bureau and Comrade Mao Zedong, delivered a report to the plenary session. After detailed discussions, the plenary session unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" proposed based on the suggestion of Comrade Mao Zedong, and unanimously approved the Central Political Bureau's work since the Third Plenary Session and the resolution to convene a National Congress of the Party within 1954.

    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held under the following circumstances: On the one hand, the Party's work had achieved tremendous results. The movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the peaceful liberation of Tibet, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the ideological remolding of intellectuals, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and a series of other social reform movements had achieved victories. Economic construction, cultural and educational work, democratic political construction, foreign affairs and international activities, united front work, and the work of the Party itself had all made great achievements. These victories and achievements have established the extremely high prestige of the Communist Party of China among the people, and the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong has become the core of the Party's solid unity; on the other hand, the Party has put forward a great new historical task, that is, the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, which is to transform and build our country into a great and glorious socialist country in a fairly long period. Such a task is of a more profound and more extensive nature than the past revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and contains extremely complex and extremely acute struggles. The Fourth Plenary Session fully estimated the achievements of the past work. But no matter how great the achievements of the past are, the Communist Party must never be complacent about it. The Fourth Plenary Session paid special attention to how to ensure the realization of the general line of the transition period, which is a greater and more arduous task. The Fourth Plenary Session unanimously believed that the Party's solid unity is the fundamental reason why the Party has achieved victory in the past. In the future, in order to achieve victory in the extremely complex and extremely acute struggles, and to realize the socialist construction and socialist transformation of our country, we can only rely on the leadership of the Party and rely on the Party's solid unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. The Fourth Plenary Session considered that the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" proposed by the Central Political Bureau based on the suggestion of Comrade Mao Zedong was timely and wise, and was a document of great historical significance in the life of the Party, and unanimously adopted this resolution.

    The Communist Party of China is the great, glorious, and correct party of the Chinese working class. The Communist Party of China is basically united, consolidated, and sound. This is a fact. Not only do we admit this ourselves, the people of the whole country admit it, but even our enemies cannot but admit it. Then, why should we emphasize the issue of strengthening unity?

    From the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism, from the viewpoint of class struggle, it is completely necessary and not at all surprising that we seriously raise the issue of strengthening Party unity at this time.

    We want to transform and build China into a great socialist country. This is something that the imperialists do not like very much, and it is also something that the domestic reactionaries do not like very much. The imperialists and their running dogs never forget to create a counter-revolutionary restoration in China. The resolute counter-revolutionary elements in the exploiting classes that have been eliminated and will be eliminated will do everything possible to carry out sabotage activities. These destructive activities of the enemy are diverse, but the first target of their destructive activities is to destroy the Chinese Communist Party, because the Party is the leader of the Chinese people. The enemy will not only sabotage the Party from the outside, using rumors, slander, sowing discord, and all possible despicable means, but it is more dangerous to find their agents within the Communist Party, create disunity within the Party, and create splits within the Party, so as to "capture the fortress from within." In history, the Soviet Communist Party had Trotskyites, Zinovievites, and Bukharinites, and recently there was Beria, and in the Chinese Communist Party there were Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao. These people were all agents of imperialism and their running dogs within the Communist Party. From this, it can be seen that it is not surprising that imperialism and reactionaries want to find agents within the Communist Party. On the contrary, it would be strange if imperialism and reactionaries did not seek agents within the Communist Party.

    Imperialism and reactionaries must seek agents within the Communist Party, and they have also found such agents. Even in the Soviet Union, which had built a socialist society and completely eliminated the exploiting classes, they still found agents like the Beria group within the Communist Party. Then, it is understandable that imperialism and reactionaries will never fail to seek agents within the Chinese Communist Party. If our Party does not maintain Party unity with great vigilance, then imperialism and reactionaries may find their agents in our Party.

    The Fourth Plenary Session analyzed the internal situation of the Chinese Communist Party and believed that some factors within the Party threatened Party unity. The most important of these is that a part of the cadres, even some senior cadres, are developing an extremely dangerous sense of pride. "They have become dizzy with success in their work, forgetting the humble attitude and spirit of self-criticism that a Communist Party member must have, exaggerating their personal role, emphasizing their personal prestige, thinking that they are number one in the world, can only listen to flattery and praise, cannot accept criticism and supervision, suppress and retaliate against critics, and even regard the areas and departments they lead as their personal capital and independent kingdoms." (Communique) If the Party does not stop the development of this pride and bad tendency of individualism in time, it will inevitably lead to confrontation with the Party, undermine Party unity, and there is a sad future for them to develop into individualistic ambitionists and become agents of imperialism and reactionaries within the Party. The Fourth Plenary Session pointed out that pride is an "extremely dangerous" emotion, precisely because the development of this emotion is enough to lead to Party disunity, Party splits, and setbacks or failures in the Chinese revolution, so it is extremely dangerous.

    Since this extremely dangerous sense of pride already exists and is growing in a part of the cadres, even some senior cadres, and may develop to the extent of threatening Party unity, the Fourth Plenary Session is completely necessary to sound the alarm to the entire Party, especially to these cadres, especially the senior cadres among them, so as to eliminate this danger in its infancy, protect Party unity, protect the life of the Party, and protect the revolutionary cause of our country so that it can proceed smoothly.

    For this purpose, the Fourth Plenary Session stipulated various specific measures to strengthen Party unity.

    In order to strengthen Party unity, the Fourth Plenary Session made creative provisions on the issues of inner-Party struggle and criticism and self-criticism, based on the fourth and fifth articles of the conclusion of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" and the experience of the Chinese revolution. This provision is very important for fully developing inner-Party democracy and fully developing inner-Party criticism and self-criticism.

    The Fourth Plenary Session pointed out that criticism of the shortcomings or mistakes of Party members should distinguish between different situations and adopt different policies. For those who intentionally undermine Party unity, confront the Party, insist on not correcting their mistakes, and even engage in sectarian activities, splitting activities, and other harmful activities within the Party, the Party must carry out ruthless struggle and impose strict sanctions, even expelling them from the Party when necessary. Because only in this way can we safeguard Party unity and safeguard the interests of the revolution and the interests of the people. However, for those comrades who have shortcomings of a less important nature or have made mistakes of a less important nature, or for those who have serious or relatively serious shortcomings or have made serious or relatively serious mistakes, but can still put the interests of the Party above their personal interests and are willing to correct and implement the correction after being criticized and educated, we should adopt the policy of "treating people with kindness" and "curing diseases and saving people." Their shortcomings or mistakes must be seriously criticized or necessary struggles must be carried out according to the specific circumstances; however, this criticism or struggle should implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong: "Start from unity, reach the goal of unity through criticism or struggle," and should not deny them the opportunity to correct, let alone deliberately exaggerate their individual, local, temporary, and relatively unimportant shortcomings or mistakes into systemic, serious shortcomings or mistakes, because this attitude does not start from unity, cannot achieve the goal of unity, and is not conducive to the Party.

    In order to correctly conduct inner-Party struggle and criticism and self-criticism, both to achieve the purpose of correcting mistakes and shortcomings and to achieve the purpose of strengthening Party unity, the Party must, on the one hand, fight against the phenomenon of suppressing criticism, resolutely implement the principles of "know everything, say everything," "the speaker is not guilty, the listener should take warning," "correct if you have it, encourage if you don't," and must oppose such people who do not oppose criticism and self-criticism in words, but believe in practical actions that criticism and self-criticism can only be applied to others, only to the scope of others' work, and cannot be applied to themselves, cannot be applied to the scope of their own work, because this is refusing criticism and self-criticism. On the other hand, we must oppose another type of person who does not want to consolidate Party discipline, promote Party unity, and help comrades make progress through criticism and self-criticism, but wants to use the name of criticism and self-criticism to weaken and undermine Party discipline, thereby weakening and undermining Party unity and Party prestige, because such an attitude is completely intolerable to the Party.

    The Fourth Plenary Session is a meeting of important historical significance for the Communist Party of China since the Seventh National Congress. The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" passed by the Fourth Plenary Session based on the suggestion of Comrade Mao Zedong has great historical significance for the Communist Party of China. It awakens all Party comrades, especially Party cadres, especially senior cadres, to raise their sense of responsibility for the revolution, their vigilance against enemy conspiracies, their vigilance against individualistic ambitionists who may appear within the Party, and indicates specific ways to ensure and strengthen the most precious thing for the whole Party and the people of the whole country – the unity of the Chinese Communist Party. This is a heavy blow to imperialism and reactionaries. This provides a fundamental guarantee for the smooth realization of the general line of the transition period and for building our country into a great socialist country. It is the responsibility of all Party comrades, cadres at all levels, especially senior cadres, to closely unite under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, to implement the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" of the Fourth Plenary Session into the practice of the Party, so that our Party is united on the basis of consistent Marxist-Leninist thought, as harmonious as a family, as solid as a piece of steel, so as to unite the entire working class, unite all the working people and the people of the whole country, move from victory to victory, and strive to defeat any conspiracy and sabotage of domestic and foreign enemies and ensure the victory of the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

### 增强党的团结是实现过渡时期总路线的根本保证

    增强党的团结是实现过渡时期总路线的根本保证
    一九五四年二月六日至十日，中国共产党第七届中央委员会举行了第四次全体会议。刘少奇同志受中央政治局和毛泽东同志的委托向全会作了报告，经过详尽的讨论，全会一致通过了根据毛泽东同志的建议而提出的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，并一致通过了批准三中全会以来中央政治局的工作和在一九五四年年内召开党的全国代表会议的决议。
    中国共产党的七届四中全会，是在这样的情况下举行的：一方面，党的工作得到了巨大的成绩，抗美援朝运动、和平解放西藏、土地改革、镇压反革命、对知识分子的思想改造、“三反”“五反”及其他一系列的社会改革运动都取得了胜利，经济建设工作、文化教育工作、民主建政工作、外交和国际活动、统一战线工作以及党的工作，都有巨大的成就。这些胜利和成就，使中国共产党在人民中树立了极高的威信，以毛泽东同志为首的党的中央成为全党坚固团结的核心；另一方面，党提出了伟大的新的历史任务，即党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，这就是要在一个相当长的时期内，把我们的国家改造和建设成为一个伟大的光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。这样的任务，比之过去反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命，具有更加深刻和更加广泛的性质，并包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。党的四中全会充分地估计了过去工作的成绩。但过去的成绩不论怎样巨大，共产党是决不能因此自满的。四中全会特别注意的，是怎样来保证过渡时期总路线这个更伟大更艰苦的任务的实现。四中全会一致地认为：党的坚固的团结是党在过去所以取得胜利的根本原因，在今后，为了在极复杂极尖锐的斗争中取得胜利，实现我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，只有依靠党的领导，依靠党在马克思列宁主义基础上的坚固团结。四中全会认为中央政治局根据毛泽东同志的建议而提出的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，是适时的，英明的，是在党的生活中具有重大历史意义的文件，全体一致通过了这个决议。
    中国共产党，是中国工人阶级的伟大的、光荣的、正确的政党。中国共产党在基本上是团结一致的，是巩固的，是健全的。这是事实。这不但我们自己承认，全国人民承认，就是我们的敌人也不能不承认的。那末，为什么还要强调增强团结的问题呢？
    从马克思列宁主义的立场来看，从阶级斗争的观点来看，我们在这个时候严肃地提出增强党的团结的问题，是完全必要的，是一点也没有什么希奇的。
    我们要把中国改造和建设成为一个伟大的社会主义的国家，这是帝国主义者很不喜欢的，也是国内的反动分子很不喜欢的。帝国主义及其走狗时刻不忘地要在中国制造反革命的复辟。已被消灭和将被消灭的剥削阶级中的坚决反革命的分子要千方百计地来进行破坏活动。这些敌人的破坏活动是多种多样的，但他们破坏活动的第一个目标，就是破坏中国共产党，因为党是中国人民的领导者。敌人不但会从外面，用造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间和所有可能的卑鄙手段等来破坏党，更危险的是到共产党内部寻找他们的代理人，制造党内的不团结，制造党内的分裂，这样来“从内部夺取堡垒”。在历史上，苏联共产党内出过托洛茨基分子、季诺维也夫分子、布哈林分子，最近还出过贝利亚，在中国共产党内出过陈独秀和张国焘，这些人都是帝国主义及其走狗在共产党内部的代理人。由此可见，帝国主义和反动派要在共产党内部找寻代理人，是没有什么奇怪的。相反的，如果帝国主义和反动派不向共产党内部找寻代理人，那反倒是奇怪的了。
    帝国主义和反动派一定要向共产党内部找寻代理人，他们也找到过这样的代理人，甚至在已经建成了社会主义社会、已经完全消灭了剥削阶级的苏联，还在共产党内找到像贝利亚集团这样的代理人。那末，可以理解，帝国主义和反动派决不会不在中国共产党内找寻代理人的。如果我们党不十分警觉地保持党的团结，那末，帝国主义和反动派是可能在我们党内找到他们的代理人的。
    四中全会分析了中国共产党的内部情况，认为党内有些因素使党的团结受到威胁。其中最重要的，是一部分干部甚至某些高级干部，滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，“他们因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神，夸大个人的作用，强调个人的威信，自以为天下第一，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国。”（公报）他们这种骄傲情绪和个人主义恶劣倾向的发展，如果党不予以及时的制止，必然会走到与党对抗，破坏党的团结，就有发展成为个人主义的野心家、成为帝国主义与反动派在党内的代理人的可悲的前途。四中全会指出，骄傲情绪是“极端危险”的情绪，正是因为这种情绪发展下去，足以招致党的不团结，招致党的分裂，招致中国革命的挫折或失败，所以它是极端危险的。
    既然这种极端危险的骄傲情绪在一部分干部甚至某些高级干部中已经存在和滋长，并且可能发展到威胁党的团结的程度，四中全会完全有必要向全党敲起警钟，向这一部分干部特别是其中的高级干部敲起警钟，以便在萌芽状态时就消灭这种危险，保护党的团结，保护党的生命，保护我国的革命大业使之能够顺利的进行。
    为此目的，四中全会规定了各项增强党的团结的具体办法。
    为了增强党的团结，四中全会对于党内斗争和批评与自我批评的问题，根据“联共党史”结束语第四条第五条，和中国革命实践的经验，作了创造性的规定。这种规定，对于充分发展党内民主，充分发展党内的批评与自我批评，是非常重要的。
    四中全会指出：对于党员的缺点或错误进行批评，应当区别不同的情形，采取不同的方针。对于那种有意地破坏党的团结，而与党对抗，坚持不改正错误，甚至在党内进行宗派活动、分裂活动和其他危害活动的分子，党就必须进行无情的斗争，给以严格的制裁，直至在必要时将他们驱逐出党。因为只有这样，才能维护党的团结，才能维护革命的利益和人民的利益。但是对于那种具有在性质上比较不重要的缺点或犯有在性质上比较不重要的错误的同志，或者对于那种虽然具有严重或比较严重的缺点、犯有严重或比较严重的错误，但在受到批评教育以后，仍能把党的利益放在个人的利益之上，愿意改正并实行改正的同志，应当采取“与人为善”、“治病救人”的方针。对于他们的缺点或错误必须按照具体情况进行严肃的批评或必要的斗争；但是这种批评或斗争应当贯彻中央和毛泽东同志的指示：“从团结出发，经过批评或斗争达到团结的目的”，不应当不给他们改正的机会，更不应当故意将他们的个别的、局部的、暂时的、比较不重要的缺点或错误夸大为系统的、严重的缺点或错误，因为这种态度就不是从团结出发，就不能达到团结的目的，就不利于党。
    为了正确地进行党内斗争和批评与自我批评，既达到改正错误缺点的目的，又达到增强党的团结的目的，党就必须一方面向压制批评的现象作斗争，坚决实行“知无不言，言无不尽”，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”这些原则，就必须反对这样一种人，他们口头上并不反对批评和自我批评，可是在实际行动上却认为批评和自我批评只能适用于别人，只能适用于别人工作的范围内，而不能适用到自己，不能适用到属于自己工作的范围内，因为这就是拒绝批评与自我批评。另一方面，必须反对另一种人，他们不是想经过批评和自我批评来巩固党的纪律，来促进党的团结和帮助同志的进步，而是想假借批评和自我批评的名义来削弱和破坏党的纪律，从而削弱和破坏党的团结和党的威信，因为这样的态度是党所完全不能容许的。
    四中全会是中国共产党自第七次大会以来具有重要历史意义的一次会议。四中全会根据毛泽东同志的建议而通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，对于中国共产党有巨大的历史意义，它唤起全党同志首先是党的干部特别是高级干部提高对于革命的责任心，对于敌人阴谋的警惕性，对于党内可能出现的个人主义野心家的警惕性，并指示了具体办法来确保和增强对于全党、对于全国人民最宝贵的东西——中国共产党的团结。这是对于帝国主义和反动派的沉重打击。这是对于过渡时期总路线的顺利实现，对于把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家给了一个根本的保证。全党同志，各级干部，首先是高级干部的责任，是要紧紧团结在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导之下，把四中全会“关于增强党的团结的决议”贯彻到党的实践中去，使我党在马克思列宁主义思想一致的基础上，团结得如同一个和睦的家庭一样，如同一块坚固的钢铁一样，以便团结整个工人阶级，团结全体劳动人民和全国人民，从胜利走向胜利，为战胜内外敌人的任何阴谋破坏，保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业的胜利而奋斗。
