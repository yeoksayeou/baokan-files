Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 17th: General Timayya, the Indian Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, announced yesterday, disregarding protests from the Korean and Chinese sides, that he would hand over seventeen Rhee Syngman and Chiang Kai-shek special agents arrested for the murder of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war at the Dongjang-ri camp to the US side at 10:00 AM on February 18th.

The Korean and Chinese sides recently strongly protested the illegal decision to hand these murderers over to their American masters. General Li Sang-cho, in a letter to General Timayya, pointed out that such an action "is a complete violation of human justice" and "cannot but seriously damage the neutral stance of the neutral nations and the reputation of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself." General Li Sang-cho requested that "the executor of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission take measures to continue to hold these seventeen murderers and make a fair judgment based on their undeniable evidence of guilt."

General Timayya, in a letter to the US side (this letter has been published by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission), said: "As the United Nations Command knows, the murder incident undoubtedly occurred. Paragraphs 92 and 93 of the Commission's 'Interim Report', as well as paragraphs 8, 11, and 13 of the Swedish and Swiss Commissioners' 'Individual Reports', all prove these facts. In addition, the investigation conducted by the Commission has clearly established the seemingly conclusive evidence of the murder case unfavorable to these reports.

"In this case, the Commission has an obligation to ensure the implementation of due legal process and to allow justice to be served."

General Timayya said in his letter to the US side: "Any handling of these prisoners of war without completing due legal process will be tantamount to pardoning the alleged crime.

"As Chairman and Executor of the Commission and as the representative of India participating in the Commission, I must protest against the refusal of your Command to cooperate in upholding the principle of justice."

General Timayya expressed "hope" that the US side, which instigated these murders, would "not take any steps that would undermine justice and allow the criminals to escape the law." General Timayya warned: "Responsibility in this regard rests entirely with the United Nations Command."

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 17th: General Li Sang-cho, representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote a letter today to General Timayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, strongly protesting the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's handing over of seventeen criminals who murdered Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who demanded repatriation to the US side on the 18th.

General Li Sang-cho said in the letter: "To not punish the seventeen murderers with conclusive evidence of guilt, but instead hand them over to the United Nations forces who instructed them to commit murder, is a complete violation of the 'Terms of Reference' and the Geneva Conventions, which our side firmly opposes; it is also intolerable to human justice. I once again lodge a strong protest with you regarding this."

    蒂迈雅宣布将在今天把特务凶手交给美方
    我方再次向蒂迈雅提出严重抗议
    【新华社开城十七日电】中立国遣返委员会印度主席蒂迈雅将军不顾朝中方面的抗议，昨天宣布他将在二月十八日上午十时把因谋杀东场里营场的朝中战俘而被捕的十七名李承晚和蒋介石的特务移交给美方。
    朝中方面最近曾严重抗议关于把这些凶手移交给他们的美国主子的非法决定。李相朝将军在写给蒂迈雅将军的信中指出，这种行动“是完全违背人类的正义”的，并且“不能不严重地损害中立国家的立场和中立国遣返委员会本身的声誉”。李相朝将军要求“中立国遣返委员会执行人采取措施，继续看押这十七名杀人凶犯，并根据他们无可抵赖的罪证作严正的裁判”。
    蒂迈雅将军在他写给美方的信（这封信已由中立国遣返委员会发表）中说：“正如联合国军司令部所知道的，谋杀事件毫无疑问是发生了的。委员会的‘临时报告’的第九十二和第九十三段，以及瑞典和瑞士委员的‘个别报告’的第八、第十一和十三段都证明了这些事实。此外，委员会进行的调查已清楚地确定了不利于这些报告的看来是证据确凿的谋杀案。
    “在这种情况下，委员会有义务确保实施正当的法律程序，并使正义得以伸张。”
    蒂迈雅将军在他写给美方的信中说：“若不完成正当的法律程序而对这些战俘作任何处理，将等于是宽赦所说的罪行。
    “作为委员会的主席和执行人以及作为印度参加委员会的代表，我必须就你的司令部拒绝合作以维护正义的原则一点提出抗议。”
    蒂迈雅表示“希望”教唆这些谋杀事件的美方将“不采取任何会破坏正义并使罪犯能逃出法网的步骤”。蒂迈雅将军警告说：“关于这方面的责任，完全在于联合国军司令部。”
    【新华社开城十七日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝将军今天写信给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军，严重抗议中立国遣返委员会将在十八日把十七名杀害要求遣返的朝中战俘的罪犯送交美方。
    李相朝将军在信中说：“对于罪证确凿的十七名杀人凶犯不加惩处，反而将他们送交指使他们进行谋杀的联合国军，这是彻底违反‘职权范围’和日内瓦公约、为我方所坚决反对的；也是人类正义所不容的。对此我再次向你提出严重抗议。”
