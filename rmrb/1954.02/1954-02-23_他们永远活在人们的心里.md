    Comrade Zhao Yaohua's Ideal Has Been Realized
    Whenever we mention Yichun, the new city in the forest region of our motherland, we cannot help but think of the glorious name of Zhao Yaohua. Yichun is like a young seedling, and the soldier Comrade Zhao Yaohua was its cultivator. He nourished it with his blood, allowing it to grow, blossom, and bear fruit.
    One day in the winter of 1946, our cavalry unit was patrolling in the boundless forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains. During a rest break, soldiers Zhao Yaohua and Sun Yaoming were not idle for a moment, hugging the big trees one by one. Sun Yaoming said, "These trees must be hundreds of years old. How big do you think this forest is?" Zhao Yaohua said, "It's hard to say, but you won't reach the end even if you walk for a month." Sun Yaoming was very surprised and said, "That's amazing, so many trees! How many houses could be built with that many trees! If we settle down here, we won't have to worry about firewood at all." Zhao Yaohua had a different idea. He had worked in a factory since he was a child and knew the use of wood: "How can such good wood be used for burning! In the future, we will use it to build railways and many large factories!" Sun Yaoming was fascinated and asked, "Then how can we cut so many forests and transport them?" Zhao Yaohua replied, "That's easy. We will build a big factory here, use power saws and electric saws to cut down trees; build the railway into this mountain valley, and use trains to pull the wood!"
    Zhao Yaohua spoke vividly, and the soldiers listened with smiles on their faces. Just then, there was a soft sound of gun butts from outside the forest. This was a signal that something was happening. The soldiers immediately picked up their guns vigilantly and followed the instructor to the edge of the forest. The sentry reported, "The enemy is coming!" The instructor followed his hand and saw more than fifty enemies heading straight for them from the south. The enemy gradually approached, two hundred meters, one hundred and fifty meters... The soldiers aimed at the enemy and fired a burst of fierce shooting. The enemies were so frightened that they crawled on the ground, afraid to move.
    At this time, another group of enemies rushed over. The instructor felt that the disparity between the enemy and us was too great, and the situation was very serious. He said to the soldiers, "The enemy is trying to set fire to the mountain. Can we let them destroy this precious forest?" All the comrades in the class answered in unison: "No!" The instructor said again: "We occupy a favorable terrain, as long as we resist calmly, the enemy will not be able to attack for a while. The main force of our brothers will definitely come to support us when they hear the gunfire!" He observed the surrounding terrain and found a ditch on the east side. If the enemy controlled that ditch, it would be easy to approach the forest. The instructor explained the situation and asked, "Who will go to defend?" Comrade Zhao Yaohua took a step forward without hesitation and said, "I will go." Then Sun Yaoming and Zhang Shiying also rushed to sign up. They immediately ran to the designated location.
    The enemy began to attack. More than a dozen enemies approached the forest, and one of them was pouring oil on the trees with a bottle, trying to set fire. The instructor was anxious, raised his gun and fired, but missed. Just then, he suddenly saw a person struggling to stand up from the ground. Ah, it was Zhao Yaohua. He had been seriously injured, and he was still holding a grenade, staggering towards the enemy who was setting fire. There was a loud bang, and the grenade exploded in Comrade Zhao Yaohua's hand, in the midst of the enemy. The enemy was blown to pieces, and Comrade Zhao Yaohua gloriously sacrificed himself to protect the forest of the motherland.
    Comrade Zhao Yaohua's blood nurtured the forest of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, making it grow stronger and denser. Comrade Zhao Yaohua's ideal has also been realized. Today, in the forest area of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, a beautiful city - Yichun has been born. (Wang Ziying)

    The People's Excellent Son
    One day in August last year, after several days of heavy rain, the water level of the Yangliu River near Haicheng in Liaodong Province suddenly rose by several meters. Xinlitun Village in Henan Province was low-lying, and the houses of the residents were flooded. The elderly, children, and women were in danger of being washed away in the torrent. At this critical moment, the local garrison formed a rescue team and plunged into the torrent to rescue the victims, risking their lives. Telephone operator and Communist Youth League member Jiang Dakun and Lü Chengfang were in this brave rescue team. Before leaving for the rescue, Comrade Lü Chengfang was suffering from malaria, and Comrade Jiang Dakun could not go because of other official duties. But when they heard that the company had accepted the glorious task of rescuing the lives and property of the people, they immediately ran to the company commander and asked for permission to join the rescue. After receiving permission, they immediately prepared wires, rafts, shovels, and hoes with their comrades, encouraging everyone along the way. When they arrived at the river bank, they first plunged into the water, continuously traveling back and forth forty-one times from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., rescuing twenty-five victims. They were so frozen that their bodies were covered with blue and purple patches. At this time, they heard that in a distant place in the southeast of the village, there were two isolated houses, and the residents inside had not been rescued. So, they immediately asked the leaders to organize a swimming team to rescue them.
    The rescue team, headed by Comrades Jiang Dakun and Lü Chengfang, quickly swam to the east side of the village, where there were four or five houses. To the south was a sheet of water, and to the east were sorghum fields submerged in water. According to the direction told by the masses, the isolated house should be to the south, so Jiang Dakun swam south for forty or fifty meters, but there was still no sound of people ahead. The water was two people deep, and it became deeper and deeper to the south, and they couldn't see the edge, nor could they see the house. At this time, he discussed with other comrades and decided to swim eastward again. There could be no hesitation. The people in the isolated house were in danger of being submerged every minute and every second. Suddenly, Jiang Dakun saw a cyan roof in the gap of the sorghum stalks, and then he saw red walls, doors and windows, and vaguely heard people's voices. He shouted, "I see it! I see it!" When everyone heard his voice, it was like receiving a signal to advance on the battlefield. Regardless of anything, they swam over with all their might.
    It was about 4:00 p.m. At this time. Grandpa Liu Jiman saw the soldiers wearing white vests and yellow shorts swimming up, and then heard: "Folks! We are here, we guarantee to rescue you all to a safe area!" The comrades of the swimming team made rafts, carried people on their backs, and started rescuing together. Jiang Dakun, Lü Chengfang and platoon leader Sun Baotian carried an old lady out. When they turned back, the house was creaking due to being soaked in water for too long, but there were still two women and a child in the house who had not been rescued. Jiang Dakun immediately jumped into the house, and Lü Chengfang also climbed onto the window and stretched out his hand, shouting, "Come out from here!" Before he could finish speaking, with a crash, the house collapsed, and the two brave soldiers Jiang Dakun and Lü Chengfang gloriously sacrificed themselves.
    The next day, as soon as the water receded, the men, women, old, and young in the nearby area, stepped on the muddy roads, passed through the sorghum fields, and found the remains of the martyrs Jiang Dakun and Lü Chengfang under a corner of the collapsed house. Jiang Dakun was holding a four-year-old girl in his arms, and a woman was closely following behind him, making a gesture of running forward quickly. Everyone present was moved to tears when they saw the martyrs' remains.
    Martyrs Jiang and Lü are the excellent sons of the motherland and the heroic deeds of their love for the people will forever live in the hearts of the people! (Hu Rujun)

    The Warrior on the Ba River Bridge
    The Ba River Bridge is the main traffic route between Sichuan and Shaanxi. It was washed away by the torrential river water. A temporary single-plank bridge was erected next to it, but it obviously could not withstand heavy pressure.
    On the morning of August 7th last year, when the soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed here were eating breakfast, they saw an old man leading an ox, staggering and trying to cross the bridge. Li Shutang, the squad leader of the third squad and a probationary party member, was worried that the old man would lose his footing, and shouted loudly for him to stop. However, the old man couldn't hear and stepped onto the single-plank bridge with the ox. Li Shutang hurriedly put down his rice bowl and ran out, but when he ran to the head of the bridge, nothing was to be seen. Below the bridge was a surging torrent, which hit the rocks and splashed water several meters high. At the reefs, very deep whirlpools were stirred up. Suddenly, two hands struggling in the water reached out, waved once, and immediately sank, disappearing without a trace.
    In this critical moment, Li Shutang and deputy squad leader Zhang Youran jumped into the water regardless of everything, broke through the rapids and whirlpools, and rushed to the old man, sending him to the shore. After a while, the old man woke up. He looked at Li Shutang sitting next to him, and was so grateful that he didn't know what to say. After a while, he remembered the ox that had been washed away by the water. It was his lifeline, and his whole family depended on it. The more he thought about it, the sadder he became, and he hugged Li Shutang and cried. Li Shutang looked at the old man with white hair and felt really sad. He and deputy squad leader Zhang Youran jumped into the water, regardless of fatigue and dangerous waves.
    The ox was chased, but the ox couldn't walk. Li Shutang let Zhang Youran pull in front, and he drove behind. At this time, they were exhausted. Nearing the shore, Zhang Youran used his last strength, rushed through the whirlpool, and reached the shore. Li Shutang was pressed to the bottom of the water by a violent wave and finally sank.
    The people of Zhuyuguan Township, Wanyuan County, Sichuan Province, mourned the martyr Li Shutang, a people's warrior, with great sorrow. (Zhai Shutang)

    他们永远活在人们的心里
    赵耀华同志的理想实现了
    提起祖国森林区的新生的城市——伊春，我们便联想到赵耀华这个光荣的名字。伊春像一株幼小的嫩芽，战士赵耀华同志就是它的培植人。他用鲜血养育了它，使它生长、开花和结果。
   一九四六年冬天某日，我骑兵部队在小兴安岭无边无际的森林中巡逻。休息时，战士赵耀华和孙耀明一时也不闲着，他俩一棵一棵地搂抱大树。孙耀明说：“这些树准有几百年了。你说这个森林有多大呀？”赵耀华说：“那可说不准，反正你走一个月也走不到头。”孙耀明听了，十分惊奇地说：“真了不起，这么多的树木，能盖多少房子啊！要是在这里落户，烧柴一点也不费劲。”赵耀华和他的想法不一样，他从小就在工厂里做工，知道木材的用处：“这么好的木材怎能烧火呢！将来我们要用它来修铁路，盖很多的大厂房！”孙耀明听迷了，问道：“那末，这么多森林可怎么砍法，怎么运呢？”赵耀华回答：“那还不好办，就在这里建筑个大工厂，用火锯和电锯伐树；把铁路修到这山沟里来，用火车拉木料！”
    赵耀华说得有声有色，战士们听得眉开眼笑。正在这时，林外传来轻轻的枪托声。这是有情况的讯号，战士们马上机警地提着枪，随着指导员跑到树林边缘。放哨的战士报告说：“敌人来了！”指导员顺着他的手看去，正南面有五十多个敌人直奔而来。敌人渐渐接近了，二百公尺、一百五十公尺，……战士们瞄准了敌人，一阵猛烈的射击，敌人吓得都爬在地下，不敢动弹。
    这时，又赶来一股敌人，指导员感到敌我悬殊，情况非常严重，便向战士们说：“敌人企图放火烧山，我们能叫他们毁了这宝贵的森林吗？”全班同志一致答道：“不能！”指导员又说：“我们占着有利地形，只要沉着抵抗，敌人一时是攻不上来的，兄弟大部队听到枪声，一定来增援我们！”他观察一下周围的地形，发现东面有一条沟，如果敌人控制了那条沟就容易接近树林。指导员把情况一讲，问道：“谁去防守？”赵耀华同志毫不犹豫地向前迈了一步说：“我去。”接着孙耀明和张士英也争先报名。他们立刻跑步进入了指定地点。
    敌人开始进攻了。有十几个敌人接近了森林，其中有一个家伙拿着瓶子正往树上倒油，企图放火。指导员一着急，端起枪就放，可是没打中。正在这时，他忽然看见从地上挣扎着站起来一个人，啊，正是赵耀华。他已经受了重伤，手里还拿着手榴弹，摇摇晃晃向放火的敌人冲去。只听轰然一声，手榴弹在赵耀华同志手里，在敌人堆里爆炸了。敌人被炸得血肉横飞，赵耀华同志也为保卫祖国的森林而光荣牺牲了。
      赵耀华同志的鲜血培育了小兴安岭的森林，使它长得更加茁壮、茂密。赵耀华同志的理想也实现了。今天，在小兴安岭森林区，一座美丽的城市——伊春已经诞生了。　　　　　（王子英）
    人民的优秀儿子
    去年八月间的某天，下了几天大雨，辽东省海城附近的杨柳河水位猛然上涨了几公尺。河南新立屯地势较低，居民的房子都进了水，老人、孩子、妇女有被冲在急流里的危险。正在这万分危急的时候，当地驻军组成了抢救队，奋不顾身地投入急流中抢救灾民。电话员、青年团员蒋达坤和吕成方，就在这个勇敢的抢救队伍里。在出发抢救前，吕成方同志正患疟疾，蒋达坤同志因其他公务不能前去。但他们听到连里接受抢救人民生命财产的光荣任务后，便立刻跑到连长跟前，请求允许他们参加抢救。得到允许后，他俩马上和同志们准备了电线、木排、锹、镐，在路上一面走一面鼓动大家。到达河岸时，他俩首先投入水中，从上午八时到下午二时，在水中连续往返四十一次，救出灾民二十五人。他们冻得身上青一块、紫一块。正在这时，他们听说在村东南很远的地方，有两所孤房，里面的居民还没救出来。于是，他俩立刻向首长请求：组织泅水队去抢救。
    以蒋达坤、吕成方二同志为首的抢救队，迅速地游到村东边，这里有四五家民房。往南看是一片水，往东看是淹在水中的高粱地。根据群众告诉的方向，孤房应该在南面，于是蒋达坤又朝南游了四、五十公尺，但前面仍然没有人声。水有两人深，而且越往南越深，一眼看不到边，也看不到房子。这时他便和其他同志商量了一下，决定再往东游，不能有任何迟疑，孤房里的人每分每秒都有被淹没的危险。突然，蒋达坤在高粱棵子的缝隙中，远远的看到一个青色的屋顶，接着，又望见了红色的屋墙、门窗，隐约地听见了人声。他喊着：“看见啦！看见啦！”大家听到他的声音时，像在战场上得到前进的信号一样，什么也不顾，使劲游过去了。
    这时是下午四时左右。刘吉满老大爷看到穿着白背心、黄裤衩的战士们游上来，紧接着又听到：“老乡们！我们来了，保证全部救你们到安全地带！”泅水队的同志扎木排的扎木排，背人的背人，一齐开始抢救。蒋达坤、吕成方和排长孙宝田把一个老太太背出去，转身回来时，房子已因浸水过久，吱吱作响，但屋里还有两个妇女和一个小孩没有救出来。蒋达坤即踪身跳进屋里，吕成方也爬上窗口伸着手，喊着：“快从这里出来！”话声未落，轰然一声，房子塌了，蒋达坤和吕成方两个勇敢的战士光荣牺牲了。
    第二天，水刚刚落下去，附近的男女老少，踏着满是烂泥的道路，穿过高粱地，在倒坍的房屋的一个角落下，找到蒋达坤、吕成方两位烈士的遗体。蒋达坤怀抱着一个四岁的小女孩，一个妇女紧跟在他后边作向前急跑姿势。在场的人看到烈士的遗容，都感动得痛哭失声。
    蒋、吕两位烈士是祖国人民的优秀儿子，他们热爱人民的英雄事迹，将永远活在人民的心里！

    巴河桥上的勇士
    巴河桥是川陕间的交通要道，它被暴涨的河水冲垮了；在旁边架设了一座临时的独木桥，显然它是经不起重压的。
    去年八月七日早晨，驻守在这里的中国人民解放军某部战士们在吃早饭时，见一位老大爷蹒跚地牵着一头牛想要过桥。三班班长、候补党员李树堂耽心那老大爷失足，大声叫着，要他停下来。但是，老大爷听不见，他牵着牛踏上了独木桥。李树堂急忙丢下饭碗往外跑，等他跑到桥头时什么也不见了。桥下是汹涌的激流，它冲击着岩石，溅起丈高的水花；暗礁处，卷起很深的漩涡。突然间从水里挣扎着伸出两只手，挥舞了一下，瞬即沉下去，无影无踪了。
    在这紧急关头，李树堂和副班长张有然不顾一切地跳到水里，冲破了急流和漩涡，猛扑到老大爷那里，把他送到岸上。半晌，这位老大爷清醒过来，他望着坐在他旁边的李树堂，感激得不知说什么好。停了一会，他想起他那被水冲走的牛，它是他的命根子，一家老小全靠它。他越想越伤心，抱着李树堂哭起来。李树堂瞧着白发苍苍的老大爷，心里实在难受，他就和副班长张有然一道，不顾疲劳和险涛恶浪，跳进水里去。
    牛追着了，但是牛不能走。李树堂让张有然在前面拉，自己在后面赶。这时，他们已精疲力尽了。快到岸了，张有然用出最后的力量，冲过漩涡，到了岸上。李树堂却被一个猛浪压在水底，终于沉下去了。
    四川省万源县竹峪关乡的人民怀着沉痛的心情，追悼了人民战士李树堂烈士。　（翟树棠）
