Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The Soviet Union will produce 260 million more meters of cotton fabrics this year than last year, equivalent to the entire annual output of 10,000 Soviet-made looms. Silk fabrics will increase by 100 million meters, enough to circle the Earth twice and a half along the equator. High-quality wool fabrics will increase by 32.0 million meters; calculated at 3.5 meters per suit, the increased wool fabrics can make more than 9.4 million suits of clothes. This year, Soviet shoe factories will produce 260 million pairs of shoes, averaging more than one pair per Soviet citizen.

In 1954, the Soviet Union allocated twice as much funding for the construction of textile factories as last year. Eight hundred light industrial enterprises are being expanded, and approximately one hundred new, large-scale consumer goods manufacturing enterprises are under construction. The world's largest textile complex, being built near Kamyshin in the Russian Federation, will be completed this year. The factory will produce one million meters of high-quality linen, sateen, flannel, cotton velvet, and other textiles daily; the annual output could circle the Earth seven and a half times. The first section of the giant fine wool complex being built in Minsk, the capital of the Belorussian Republic, will also be completed this year. This factory will produce about ten million meters of high-quality wool fabrics annually. After the completion of a knitting mill and eight garment factories planned for the republic, clothing production will double. A large textile factory being built in Kherson, Ukrainian Republic, will be able to produce 100 million meters of wool and cotton fabrics annually. In Chernigov, a wool factory is under construction; the main workshop alone covers 180,000 square meters. In Armenia, a factory producing five million meters of silk fabrics annually is about to begin production. With the expansion of basic construction, production allocation is gradually being improved, and many new consumer goods manufacturing enterprises are being built directly in the raw material production areas. For example, leather and shoe factories are being built in the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic, Kazakhstan, and the livestock breeding areas of Turkmenistan. Woolen mills are being constructed in the southern Russian Federation, eastern Siberia, the Altai Territory, and the southern Ukrainian sheep-raising areas. Furniture factories are being built in the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine, and so on.

Mechanization and automation play a very important role in increasing production. In the years after the war, Soviet light industrial enterprises added more than 170,000 new machines. This year, the pace of adding new equipment to the textile industry will be even greater. This year, silk and wool factories will receive two to three times more machines than last year, while cotton and linen factories will receive twice as many. The new factories to be completed this year will receive more than 15,000 looms, nearly 500,000 spindles, and machinery for producing 20 million pairs of shoes annually. Many new types of textile machines have been designed and manufactured. The new machines that the wool factories will receive this year will be thirteen times that of last year; the cotton factories will receive more than 13,000 small but highly efficient latest machines, twice as many as last year. Taking the automatic looms added this year as an example, silk factories will increase by six times last year, linen factories will increase by 93 percent, and cotton factories will increase by 67 percent. The adoption of these machines will greatly promote the improvement of production. For example, the use of new spinning machines can increase labor productivity by 40 percent and reduce labor intensity. The use of new automatic looms will reduce the time required to produce each product by 50 percent. The automatic looms designed by Soviet designers for linen factories are five times more efficient than the old machines.

    苏联今年将增产更多的棉、丝、毛织品
    【新华社二十二日讯】苏联今年将比去年多生产二亿六千万公尺的棉织品，即等于增加一万台苏联制织布机整年开动的产量；丝织品将增加一亿公尺，增产的丝织品可沿赤道绕地球两周半；上等毛织品将增加三千二百万公尺，以每套三公尺五计算，增产的毛织品可作九百四十多万套衣服。今年苏联各鞋厂将生产两亿六千万双鞋，平均每个苏联人可得一双以上。
    一九五四年苏联为建筑纺织工厂所拨出的款项比去年大一倍。八百个轻工业企业正在扩大，约一百个新的巨型日用品制造企业正在建设中。在俄罗斯联邦卡米新城附近兴建的世界最大的纺织联合工厂将在今年落成，该厂每天将生产一百万公尺上等细麻布、沙丁布、法兰绒、棉天鹅绒和其他纺织品，一年中生产的纺织品能绕地球七周半。在白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克兴建的巨型细呢联合工厂的第一部分也将在今年落成，该厂每年将生产约一千万公尺上等毛织品。该共和国计划兴建的一座针织厂和八座缝纫工厂落成后，服装产量将增加一倍。在乌克兰共和国刻松市兴建的大型纺织厂，每年能生产一亿公尺毛织品和棉织品。切尔尼哥夫兴建的一座毛织厂，单是主要车间所占的地面就达十八万平方公尺。在亚美尼亚，一座每年生产五百万公尺丝织品的工厂即将投入生产。随着基本建设的扩大，生产配置正在逐步完善，许多新的日用品制造企业直接在原料产地建筑起来。例如，布利亚蒙古自治共和国、哈萨克和土库曼饲养牲畜的地区正在兴建制革和制鞋厂，俄罗斯联邦南部、西伯利亚东部、阿尔泰边疆区和乌克兰南部等牧羊区正在建设毛织厂，乌克兰外喀尔巴阡州正在建设家具工厂等。
    机械化和自动化在增加生产中占有很重要的地位。在战后几年中，苏联轻工业企业添置了十七万多台新式机器。今年纺织工业添置新型设备的速度将更大。今年丝织厂和毛织厂将得到比去年多两三倍的机器，棉织厂和麻织厂将得到比去年多一倍的机器。新建的工厂今年将得到一万五千多台织布机、将近五十万个纱锭以及每年生产二千万双鞋的机器。许多新式的纺织机器已经设计并制造出来。今年毛织厂得到的新式的机器将为去年的十三倍；各棉织厂将得到一万三千部体积小而效率高的最新机器，即为去年的两倍。以今年添置的自动织布机为例，丝织工厂将增为去年六倍，麻织厂将增加百分之九十三，棉织厂将增加百分之六十七。这些机器的采用将大大推动生产的提高。例如采用新式纺纱机就可以使劳动生产率提高百分之四十，并可以减轻劳动，采用新式自动织布机将减少生产每件产品所需时间的百分之五十。苏联设计师为麻织工厂设计的自动织布机，效能就为旧式机器的五倍。
