Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 31st: This correspondent reports: Among the more than 21,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war forcibly abducted by the US side, the vast majority of prisoners of war did not even have the opportunity to hear explanations, and a small number of prisoners of war, although they had heard explanations, were unable to freely express their desire to be repatriated. This is the result of the US side using various means to sabotage the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides.

One of the main means by which the US side sabotaged the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides was to instruct special agents to use violence to prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations. According to Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have returned after repatriation, the US side openly used radio receivers and special agent bosses installed in the US military's 64th Field Hospital to order the Chiang and Li special agents in the camp to prevent prisoners of war from listening to explanations. The special agents, carrying American-made bayonets and baseball bats, swaggered around the camp, guarding and patrolling, driving the prisoners of war into tents and preventing them from leaving the camp to listen to explanations. At the same time, special agents, posing as "prisoner of war representatives," threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, obstructing them from exercising their legitimate functions. Due to the obstruction and sabotage of the special agents, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides was forced to be interrupted five times since it began on October 15th last year. Two of these interruptions were because the special agents had not yet prepared the methods for sabotaging the explanation work, so they prevented the Korean People's Army prisoners of war from coming out to listen to explanations, causing the explanation work to be interrupted for fourteen days. The third pause was when the special agents opposed the Korean and Chinese sides conducting collective explanations for prisoners of war through broadcasting, causing the explanation work to be interrupted for two days. Subsequently, the special agents resisted the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's regulations on isolating explained and unexplained prisoners of war, causing the explanation work to be interrupted twice again, for a total loss of forty-four days. The special agents openly told the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that they did so because they were afraid of breaking up their special agent organizations, making it impossible for them to continue controlling the prisoners of war. Finally, the US side unilaterally announced the termination of the explanations, making it impossible for the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides to continue. Because the US side initially delayed the start of the explanation work on the issue of constructing explanation facilities, and then directed special agents to repeatedly prevent prisoners of war from listening to explanations, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides only lasted for ten days, a total of more than sixty hours, leaving more than 85 percent of the prisoners of war unable to hear a single explanation.

Another main means by which the US side sabotaged the explanation work was to instruct special agents to control and threaten prisoners of war with violence, so that they still could not dispel their doubts and dared not apply for repatriation when listening to explanations. The Chiang and Li special agents continued to murder and torture prisoners of war who revealed a desire for repatriation in the camp, forced prisoners of war to tattoo themselves, write blood letters, conduct exercises to sabotage the explanation work, and recite mantras such as "Return to Taiwan" and "No Repatriation". At the same time, the special agents tried their best not to let the prisoners of war know about the rights granted to them by the "Terms of Reference" to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation, and used their terrifying memories of the bloody "screening" on Geoje Island to scare the prisoners of war, saying that listening to explanations was exactly the same as undergoing "screening". The special agents also reorganized the prisoners of war and placed special agents among them to monitor them. When listening to explanations, the special agents openly posed as "prisoners of war" to listen to explanations, making a lot of noise in the tents, acting recklessly, attacking explanation representatives, and disrupting the progress of the explanation work.

The US side also sent Chiang and Li special agent bosses who had been persecuting prisoners of war in US prisoner of war camps for a long time to serve as "observer representatives", "detaining party representatives" and "translators". These special agents openly intimidated and threatened prisoners of war in the explanation tents, preventing them from requesting repatriation, and insulted the Neutral Nations personnel and our explanation representatives, using various excuses to disrupt and interrupt the progress of the explanation work. In addition, Swiss and Swedish representatives in the tents also constantly deliberately made trouble and interrupted the explanation work.

Due to the terrorist control and threats of the special agents, the prisoners of war were extremely nervous and afraid in the explanation tents, unable to listen to the explanations quietly, thereby dispelling their doubts and applying for repatriation. The situation in the explanation tents as fully demonstrated by many prisoners of war who have returned after repatriation. For example, Korean People's Army prisoner of war Kim Yun-hee did not dare to request repatriation when listening to the explanation on November 16th last year, but climbed out of the barbed wire fence on December 12th last year to request repatriation. He said that in the eyes of many prisoners of war, requesting repatriation in the explanation tent was more dangerous than climbing the barbed wire fence. He said that before he listened to the explanation, Baek Young-do, the special agent "security captain" in the 53rd camp, openly beat to death two prisoners of war, Choi Won-il and Park Do-won, who revealed a desire for repatriation, and threatened other prisoners of war that if they requested repatriation when listening to the explanation, they would be dragged back and beaten to death on the spot. The special agents also deceived them, saying that if they applied for repatriation, it would not take effect unless the Swiss and Swedish commissioners agreed, and they would be sent back to the original camp. Kim Yun-hee said that under the threats and intimidation of the special agents, as soon as he entered the explanation tent, he was covered in sweat, dizzy, and his heart was pounding. At the same time, the special agent serving as the US "representative" glared at him fiercely, and the special agents outside the tent also made a lot of noise, making him even more afraid. At that time, he could not hear a word of what the explanation representative said, and just hurriedly recited the words taught to him by the special agent: "Return to Taiwan". Kim Yun-hee said that at that time, he believed that requesting repatriation in the explanation tent was a dead end, so he hurriedly walked out of the tent and dared not request repatriation. This fact fully demonstrates that although less than 15 percent of the prisoners of war formally heard the explanation, they still were unable to freely exercise their right to be repatriated. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "interim report" also confirmed this. The "interim report" pointed out: Prisoners of war could not be spared even in individual explanations from "the use or threat of force from the prisoner of war camp organization and its leaders, and those closely related to the prisoner of war camp organization and its leaders." The prisoners of war "were instilled with such fear that although they longed to go home, they could not shake off those fears."

Despite the US side using various despicable and shameless means to sabotage the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides, it could not suppress the prisoners of war's desire for repatriation. Under the US side's violent control, there were still prisoners of war who had not heard the explanation who climbed out of the barbed wire fence to request repatriation, and prisoners of war who had been intimidated who boldly applied for repatriation when listening to the explanation, and even prisoners of war who dared not apply for repatriation when listening to the explanation escaped from the camp to request repatriation. If the prisoners of war continued to stay in the eastern camp and the explanation work continued, more prisoners of war would request repatriation, and the US aggressors would not even have the last bit of capital to brag about the so-called "victory" of their pitiful "psychological warfare". In order to grab this "propaganda capital" and to give Syngman Rhee and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang a batch of cannon fodder, the US side forcibly abducted more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. But this act just proves to the world the baseness and shamelessness of the US side, and there is no talk of the "victory" of "psychological warfare".

    美方破坏我方解释工作的两个主要手段
    【新华社开城三十一日电】本社特派记者报道：在被美方以武力劫走的二万一千多名朝中战俘中，绝大部分的战俘根本未能听取解释，而一小部分战俘虽然听过解释，但也未能自由地表达他们要求遣返的愿望。这是美方以种种手段破坏朝中方面的解释工作的结果。
    美方破坏朝中方面的解释工作的主要手段之一，就是指使特务分子用暴力阻止战俘出营场听取解释。据遣返归来的朝中战俘说，美方公然通过无线电收音机和安插在美军第六十四野战医院中的特务头子，命令营场里的蒋、李特务阻止战俘听取解释。特务们拿着美国造的刺刀和垒球棒子，大摇大摆地在营场里站岗放哨，把战俘驱赶到帐篷里去，不许他们出营场听解释。同时，特务分子冒充“战俘代表”，对中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队进行威胁，阻挠它们行使其合法的职权。由于特务分子的阻挠和破坏，朝中方面的解释工作从去年十月十五日开始以后，曾被迫中断五次。其中两次是特务分子因为破坏解释工作的办法尚未准备妥当，就阻止朝鲜人民军战俘出来听取解释，使得解释工作中断十四天。第三次停顿是特务分子反对朝中方面对战俘广播进行集体解释，使得解释工作中断两天。接着，特务分子又抗拒中立国遣返委员会隔离经过解释与未经解释的战俘的规定，使得解释工作又两次停顿，共损失四十四天。特务们公开告诉中立国遣返委员会说，他们这样做是因为害怕打散他们的特务组织，使他们不能继续控制战俘。最后美方又片面宣布终止解释，使朝中方面的解释工作无法继续进行。由于美方始而在修建解释设备的问题上拖延解释工作的开始，继而指挥特务一再阻止战俘听取解释，朝中方面的解释工作只进行了十天，共六十多个小时，使得百分之八十五以上的战俘未能听过一次解释。
    美方破坏解释工作的另一个主要手段是指使特务分子以暴力控制和威胁战俘，使得他们在听取解释时仍然不能打破疑虑，不敢申请遣返。蒋李特务在营场里继续对流露出遣返愿望的战俘加以谋杀和施以酷刑，强迫战俘刺字，写血书，进行破坏解释工作的演习，和背诵“回台湾”、“不遣返”之类的咒语。同时，特务分子想尽办法不让战俘知道“职权范围”所给予他们的听取解释和申请遣返的权利，并且利用他们对巨济岛血腥“甄别”的恐怖记忆，恐吓战俘说听解释就和受“甄别”一模一样。特务分子还把战俘重新编组，把特务分子安插到战俘中去监视战俘。在听取解释时，特务分子公然冒充“战俘”去听取解释，在帐篷里大吵大闹，胡作非为，袭击解释代表，捣乱解释工作的进行。
    美方还派遣了长期在美方战俘营内迫害战俘的蒋李特务头子充当“观察代表”、“拘留一方代表”和“翻译”。这些特务分子在解释帐篷里公然恫吓和威胁战俘不得要求遣返，谩骂和侮辱中立国人员和我方解释代表，用种种借口捣乱和中断解释工作的进行。此外，瑞士和瑞典代表在帐篷里也不断地故意无理取闹，中断解释工作。
    由于特务分子的恐怖控制和威胁，战俘在解释帐篷里精神上极度紧张和恐惧，不能安静地听取解释，从而消除疑虑，申请遣返。许多遣返归来的战俘在解释帐篷里的情形充分证明了这一点。例如，朝鲜人民军战俘金允熙在去年十一月十六日听取解释时不敢要求遣返，而是在去年十二月十二日爬出铁丝网要求遣返的。他说，在许多战俘看来，在解释帐篷里要求遣返比爬铁丝网更加危险。他说，在他听解释以前，第五十三号营场里的特务“警备队长”白永道公开把两个流露遣返愿望的战俘崔元一和朴道元打死，并且威胁其他战俘说，如果他们听取解释时要求遣返，当场拉回来打死。特务分子还欺骗他们说，如果他们申请遣返，只要瑞士、瑞典委员不同意，就不能生效，并且要把他们送回原来营场。金允熙说，在特务分子的威胁和恫吓之下，他一走进解释帐篷，就满头大汗，头昏眼花，心里怦怦乱跳。同时，充当美方“代表”的特务分子凶狠地瞪着眼睛威胁他，帐篷外的特务分子也大吵大闹，使得他更加害怕。当时，解释代表说的话，他一句也听不清楚，只是一口气喃喃地背诵特务教给他的话：“回台湾”。金允熙说，当时，他认为，在解释帐篷里要求遣返只有死路一条，因此，他就急急忙忙地走出了帐篷，不敢要求遣返。这个事实充分地说明了不到百分之十五的战俘虽然形式上听过解释，但是实际上仍然没有能够自由行使被遣返的权利。中立国遣返委员会“临时报告”也证实了这一点。“临时报告”指出：战俘甚至在个别解释中，也不能免于“来自战俘营组织与其领导的、并与战俘营组织与其领导有密切联系的武力或武力威胁”。战俘“心中被灌注了这样的恐惧，以致虽然渴望回家但又不能摆脱那些恐惧”。
    尽管美方用种种卑鄙无耻的手段破坏朝中方面的解释工作，却压抑不了战俘要求遣返的愿望。在美方暴力控制下，仍然有没有听过解释的战俘爬出铁丝网要求遣返了，受到恐吓的战俘在听解释时大胆申请遣返了，甚至在听解释时不敢申请遣返的战俘也有逃出了营场要求遣返的。如果战俘继续留在东场里，解释工作继续进行，就会有更多的战俘要求遣返，美国侵略者就会连吹嘘可怜的“心理战”的所谓“胜利”的最后一点本钱都没有了。为了捞住这笔“宣传资本”，为了给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮一批炮灰，美方竟用武力劫持了二万多名朝中战俘。但是这种行径正好向全世界证明了美方的卑劣和无耻，谈不到什么“心理战”的“胜利”。
