    The opening of the Kunlu (Kunming-Daluo) Highway to Cheli in Yunnan Province has brought new prosperity to the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region. A new transportation system centered on Cheli has begun to be established. Many trucks, fully loaded with industrial products from Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kunming, are constantly speeding to Cheli from the east bank of the Lancang River. At the same time, hundreds and thousands of mules, horses, and boats in Cheli transport goods to people of all ethnic groups living in the high mountains and along the national defense line. In the first month after the highway opened, the amount of supplies transported into the autonomous region from the interior increased more than four times the previous monthly average. The amount of salt transported in one month was close to half of last year's sales volume. Products such as tea, cotton, fat pigs, and rice from all parts of the autonomous region were also concentrated in Cheli in large quantities for transshipment to the interior.

    Motor vehicle transport has replaced animal power, greatly accelerating the speed of material circulation, and freight rates have been reduced by 73.5%. On January 23, the Xishuangbanna commercial departments reduced the listed prices of more than 240 kinds of commodities for the first time. The prices of industrial products were reduced by 2% to 30%, and the prices of local and special products were also relatively increased. The improvement of transportation conditions has brought unprecedented prosperity to Xishuangbanna. The Xishuangbanna State-owned Trading Company has newly opened two local product retail departments in Cheli. The Xishuangbanna Central Store of the China Department Store Company is operating in Cheli, with first-day sales reaching 50 million yuan, an increase of 21 times the average daily sales of state-owned trading units in the same period last year. In the gaps between market days, more than ten mobile teams patrol the mountainous areas on the border of the motherland to purchase local and special products and supply daily necessities to meet the needs of the people of all ethnic groups.

    昆洛公路通车到车里
    云南省昆（昆明）洛（打洛）公路通车到车里后，已给西双版纳傣族自治区带来了新的繁荣。以车里为中心的新交通系统，已经开始建立起来。许多辆汽车满载着上海、广州和昆明等地的工业品，不断地由澜沧江东岸飞驰车里；同时，在车里有成百成千头骡、马和船只，把物资运给居住在重山峻岭和国防线上的各族人民。通车后的第一个月，由内地运入自治区的物资已比过去每月平均数字增加了四倍多，运入的食盐在一个月内就接近去年半年的销售量；自治区各地茶叶、棉花、肥猪、大米等产品也大量向车里集中，转运内地。
    汽车代替了畜力运输，大大加快物资流转的速度，运费降低了百分之七十三点五。西双版纳商业部门在一月二十三日首次降低二百四十多种商品的牌价，工业品的价格降低了百分之二到三十，土特产品的价格也相对提高。交通运输条件的改善，使西双版纳出现了空前的繁荣景象。西双版纳国营贸易公司已在车里新辟两个土产门市部，中国百货公司西双版纳中心商店在车里营业，第一天销售额就达五千万元，比去年同时期国营贸易单位的平均日销量增加二十一倍。在街期的空隙中，十多个流动小组到祖国边境的山区巡回收购土产特产品和供应生活必需品，以满足各族人民的需要。（新华社）
