    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Greater Khingan Range forest area, under the protection of over 50,000 people of various ethnic groups, experienced no fires throughout the past year. This ensured the steady transportation of large quantities of timber to support capital construction in various regions. Last spring, before the launch of the forest fire prevention campaign, the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Bureau concentrated on training a large number of grassroots cadres, activists, and forest rangers. It organized propaganda teams and amateur theatrical troupes to educate the masses about the benefits of forest fire prevention. They distributed over 163,000 copies of promotional materials, ensuring that people of all ethnic groups in the forest area received widespread fire prevention education and increasing their enthusiasm for forest protection and fire prevention. In the forest area or near it, people of the Yakut, Oroqen, and Mongolian ethnic groups, combined hunting and various sideline productions with fire prevention tasks. In Alunetuoke (District) of Morin Dawa Banner, people of various ethnic groups combined fire prevention and forest protection work, collecting more than 15,000 jin of tree fungus in two months, worth 420 million yuan at the lowest price. In the seventh district of Keshiketeng Banner, people earned 610 million yuan from picking mushrooms and collecting apricot kernels, equivalent to enough millet to feed over 5,000 people for four months. After people of all ethnic groups understood the principle of "eating from the mountain and nurturing the mountain," they became more active in fire prevention and forest protection. According to statistics from seven counties and banners, more than 56,700 people have participated in forest fire prevention teams, and many model individuals have emerged. Recently, after the people of all ethnic groups in the forest area received publicity and education on the general line of the state's transition period, they further realized the importance of protecting forests for the country's socialist industrialization and are enthusiastically launching a spring fire prevention and forest protection campaign.

    内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区护林防火有成绩
    内蒙古自治区大兴安岭林区在五万多各族人民的防护下，去年全年没有发生火灾，保证了大量木材源源外运，支援各地的基本建设。去年春季，在护林防火运动展开以前，内蒙古森林工业管理局就集中训练了大批基层干部、积极分子和护林员，组织一些宣传队和业余剧团，向群众宣传护林防火的好处，并散发十六万三千多份宣传品，使林区各族群众普遍受到防火教育，提高了护林防火的积极性。在林区或接近林区的地方，雅库特族、鄂伦春族和蒙族的人们，结合着狩猎及各种副业生产担负了防火任务。莫力达瓦旗阿尔努图克（区）各族群众结合防火护林工作，两个月内采集了一万五千多斤木耳，按最低价格计算合四亿二千万元；克什克腾旗七区人民拣蘑菇、打杏核等，收入达六亿一千多万元，折合小米能供应五千多人食用四个月。各族人民明白了吃山养山的道理后，更积极防火护林，据七个县、旗的统计，参加护林防火队的已有五万六千七百多人，并涌现出不少模范人物。最近，林区各族人民经过国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育后，进一步体会到保护森林对国家的社会主义工业化的重要意义，正热情地展开春季防火护林运动。
