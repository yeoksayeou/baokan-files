    Noble Friendship
    —The Hungarian National Football Mixed Team in Beijing
    Cheng Zhi
    The Hungarian National Football Mixed Team (hereinafter referred to as the Hungarian football team), which came to China for a visit in mid-February, held four matches and one performance with various Chinese football teams in Beijing from the 14th. The Hungarian football team's strong strength and excellent skills displayed in the matches and performance aroused strong interest among the audience. During the breaks between matches, the Hungarian football team selflessly imparted their football training methods and tactics to Chinese athletes. This noble internationalist spirit deeply moved the sports workers in the capital.
    The Hungarian football team is composed of twenty-three young and middle-aged people from different professions. Among them are not only university students, commanders and soldiers of the Hungarian People's Army, and cadres of state trade organizations, but also skilled workers, clerks, and advanced producers from factories. Many of these excellent football players have been awarded the Republic Sports Medal. For example, Suza, the main force of the Hungarian football team's attack and center forward, who left a deep impression on the audience, has been awarded the gold Sports Medal for representing the Republic in visits to football teams around the world many times. Konya, the workshop director of the "Rakosi Factory" in Zabel and an outstanding defender, is also a recipient of the Republic Sports Medal and the title of outstanding athlete. Others, such as Poporczai, a commander of the People's Army and a strong left winger, Bagoly, a construction worker from the "Stalin Factory", Vadacsi, a strong central defender and draftsman from the "Capital Steel Factory", and Várnai, a clerk from the "Capital Assembly Electric Light Factory", and Kincses, a skilled worker, have all received national medals or the honorary title of outstanding athlete. Kovács, who comes from a textile factory, is a "Stakhanovite worker."
    The Hungarian football team enjoys a great reputation internationally. Although the team visiting China is not the most outstanding players who won the 15th International Olympic Championship and defeated the "football kingdom" and "ever-victorious" British professional football team on November 25 last year, the four matches and one performance fully demonstrated the dominant position of Hungarian football in the world. In every match, the Hungarian football team controlled the entire situation with a vigorous spirit of attack. Every player has great speed and excellent ball control skills, and they cooperate very well. Whether heading or passing, the ball often arrives where the person is. In addition, their flexible and unpredictable tactics make it difficult for the opponent to capture. For example, in a match against the China Railway Sports Association football team, in the tenth minute after the start of the match, center forward Suza quickly intercepted the opponent's incoming ball, and the left and right inner forwards and both wings immediately cut in, luring out the opponent's defenders. Suza used a clever feint, pretending to pass the ball, to avoid the interception of the opponent's center back Gao Baozheng, and powerfully shot the ball into the net from fifteen meters. This method of attack, using superior skills and flexible tactics, is one of the important reasons why the Hungarian football team wins every battle. In addition, the Hungarian football team not only organizes strongly and has great sprinting power in attack, but also often shoots continuously, giving the opponent no chance to breathe. In the match against the Central Institute of Physical Education football team, the three forwards and the left and right wings, assisted by the forwards, made five consecutive fierce shots, although they were all saved by the opponent's goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu, but this continuous spirit of attack is very valuable.
    Chinese football teams are inferior to the Hungarian football team in terms of physical strength, speed, cooperation, and skills. However, when facing this strong fraternal country's team, they also showed a willingness to learn humbly and a brave and tenacious fighting spirit. Although they adopted a defensive-oriented tactic, they did not relax their efforts to organize attacks at any time. In the match between the Northeast team and the Hungarian football team on the 17th, five minutes after the start of the match, the Northeast team scored a goal with precise short passes, with right inner forward Jin Chengnan shooting into the Hungarian football team's penalty area. The "August 1st" football team displayed the brave spirit of the troops even more in the match, often posing a serious threat to the opponent.
    The Hungarian football team's matches and performances in Beijing tell us that only in socialist and people's democratic countries where the working people are the masters of their own affairs is it possible for sports to develop rapidly, and only then can sports skills be continuously improved. Before liberation, sports in Hungary was only a privilege enjoyed by a few people. According to statistics in 1939, only 0.5% of the total population of Hungary could participate in sports. After liberation, with the recovery and development of the national economy, especially under the vigorous promotion of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Republic government, mass sports have taken on a completely new look. Many factories not only have sports committees, but also established sports clubs under the leadership of the trade unions. Rural youth have also gradually joined the ranks of sports in the cooperative movement. By 1953, one million sports enthusiasts had emerged throughout Hungary (equivalent to 10% of the total population).
    Based on this broad mass base, learning from the advanced theories and experiences of Soviet sports, Hungarian sports skills, especially football skills, have been rapidly improved. The winning rate of the football team in international competitions was 74% from 1945 to 1950, and reached 100% in 1951.
    The Hungarian national players, produced from mass sports and educated by the Working People's Party and the Republic government, not only have excellent sports skills, but also have a high degree of political consciousness. The internationalist spirit they showed in the matches and performances in Beijing embodies the close unity between the Chinese and Hungarian people and the friendly cooperation between Chinese and Hungarian athletes. In the tense breaks between matches, the Hungarian football team and Chinese football players gave a practice demonstration. From the team leader Adam József to every player, they explained in great detail to Chinese athletes their usual methods of practicing basic movements and the tactics used in matches. The entire sports field was filled with an atmosphere of friendship. At the technical seminars held after the end of the matches, the Hungarian football team always carefully analyzed our strengths and weaknesses and actively put forward suggestions for improvement. This intimate brotherly friendship has educated Chinese sports workers.
    The Hungarian football team's performances and matches in Beijing have left a deep impression on the people of the capital. The visit of the Hungarian football team will inevitably promote the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people and promote the further development of football in China. (Attached pictures)

    崇高的友谊
    ——匈牙利国家足球混合队在北京
    程执
    二月中旬来华访问的匈牙利国家足球混合队
  （以下简称匈牙利足球队），自十四日起在北京和我国各足球队举行了四场比赛和一场表演。匈牙利足球队在比赛和表演中显示出的雄厚实力与优秀技术，引起了观众们的浓厚兴趣。在比赛空隙，匈牙利足球队无私地把他们的足球训练方法和战术传授给我国运动员，这种崇高的国际主义精神，深深感动了首都的体育工作者。
    匈牙利足球队是由二十三个不同职业的青、壮年组成的。其中不仅有大学生、匈牙利人民军的指挥员和战斗员、国家贸易机关的干部，还有来自工厂的技术工人、职员和先进生产者。在这批优秀的足球选手中，许多人已荣获共和国运动勋章。如给观众留下深刻印象的匈牙利足球队进攻的主力、中锋苏查，就曾经多次代表共和国访问世界各国足球队而荣获金质运动勋章。扎倍尔地方“拉科西工厂”的车间主任、杰出的后卫孔尼亚，也是共和国运动勋章和杰出运动员称号的获得者。其它如人民军指挥员、强有力的左翼包波尔查伊，“斯大林工厂”的建筑工人巴戈利，矫健的中卫、“首都钢铁工厂”的绘图员瓦达奇和“首都集合电灯工厂”的职员瓦尔纳伊与技术工人金切什等，都曾获得国家奖章或优秀运动员的光荣称号。而来自纺织工厂的科瓦奇，则是一个“斯塔哈诺夫工作者”。
    匈牙利足球队在国际上享有极大的声誉。虽然来我国访问的并不是夺得第十五届国际奥林匹克冠军，和在去年十一月二十五日打败“足球王国”
  “常胜不败”的英国职业足球队的最优秀的选手，但从四场比赛和一场表演中，也充分地显露出了匈牙利的足球运动在全世界的优势地位。每场比赛匈牙利足球队都以旺盛的进攻精神控制着整个局势。任何一个队员，都有很高的速度和很好的控球技术，而且合作得也很好，无论头顶、脚传，常常是人到球到；再加上灵活的变化莫测的战术，使对方很难捕捉。如在对我国火车头体育协会足球队的一场比赛中，开赛后第十分钟，中锋苏查迅速地截获对方的来球，左、右内锋和两翼立即切进，诱出对方后卫；苏查以巧妙的佯攻，佯以传球的动作躲过对方中坚高保正的拦截，在十五公尺处猛力射球入网。这种运用优势技术和灵活战术的进攻方法，就是匈牙利足球队每战必捷的重要原因之一。而匈牙利足球队在进攻中不仅组织坚强、冲刺力大，同时常常是连续射门，不给对方以喘息的机会。在和中央体育学院足球队比赛中，三前锋与左、右翼得前卫的协助，曾连续五次猛烈地射门，虽然都被对方的守门员张俊秀救出，但这种连续的攻击精神，是非常可贵的。
    我国各足球队无论在体力、速度、合作和技术等方面，都不及匈牙利足球队。但在迎战这支强大的兄弟国家的选手队时，也表现了虚心学习和勇敢、顽强的战斗意志。他们虽然采取了以守为主的战术，但并未放松随时组织进攻。十七日东北队与匈牙利足球队比赛，开赛后五分钟，东北队即以精确的短传，右内锋金成男在匈牙利足球队禁区内射进一球。“八一”足球队在比赛中更发挥了部队的勇敢精神，常常给对方以严重的威胁。
    匈牙利足球队在京的比赛和表演告诉我们：只有在劳动人民当家作主的社会主义国家和人民民主国家内，体育运动才有可能迅速地开展，运动技术也才会不断提高。解放前，匈牙利的体育运动只是少数人享有的特权。据一九三九年的统计，全匈牙利能参加体育运动的仅占全国人口的百分之零点五。解放后，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，特别是在匈牙利劳动人民党和共和国政府的大力提倡下，群众性的体育运动有了全新的面貌。许多工厂不仅有体育运动委员会的组织，在工会的领导下还建立起了体育俱乐部。农村青年在合作化运动中，也逐渐地参加了体育运动的行列。到一九五三年，全匈牙利涌现出了一百万体育运动积极分子（相当于全国人口的百分之十）。
    就在这个广泛的群众性的基础上，学习苏联体育运动的先进理论和经验，匈牙利的体育运动技术，尤其是足球运动技术有了迅速的提高，足球队在国际比赛的获胜率，一九四五年至一九五○年间为百分之七十四，一九五一年则达到百分之百。
    由群众性体育运动中产生的、劳动人民党和共和国政府教养出来的匈牙利国家选手，不但有着优秀的运动技术，而且有着高度的政治觉悟。他们在北京比赛和表演中表现出的国际主义精神，体现了中、匈两国人民的亲密团结和中、匈两国体育运动员的友好合作。在紧张的比赛空隙中，匈牙利足球队和我国足球运动员作了一次练习示范，从领队阿达姆·约瑟夫到每一个队员，都将他们平时练习基本动作的方法和在比赛中的战术，十分详尽地告诉我国运动员。整个运动场上，洋溢着友爱的气氛。而在比赛终了后举行的技术座谈会上，匈牙利足球队总是很周详地分析我们的优缺点，并积极提出改进意见。这种亲密无间的兄弟之情，教育了我国的体育工作者。
    匈牙利足球队在北京的表演和比赛，已在首都人民中留下深刻的印象。匈牙利足球队的来访，必然会促进中、匈两国人民的友谊，推动我国足球运动的进一步发展。（附图片）
