Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 18th: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference continued its discussion of the second item on the agenda on the 17th at the Soviet High Commissioner's Office in Germany, with Eden as chairman.

As is known, during the discussion of the second item on the agenda, the Soviet delegation presented the conference with many specific proposals for resolving the German question and guaranteeing European security. The Soviet delegation also put forward a number of measures to reduce Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war. However, the foreign ministers of the three Western powers rejected the Soviet proposals, but failed to put forward any constructive suggestions to ensure the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. On February 15, the foreign ministers of the three Western powers rejected the Soviet delegation's proposal on "Guaranteeing European Security" and the proposal to conclude an "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security." This proves that they do not actually want to quickly resolve the German question, eliminate the division of Germany and Europe, or establish a European collective security system.

At the meeting on the 17th, Molotov spoke first, expressing some views on the discussion of the second item on the agenda on February 15. He said: Our first opinion concerns the Soviet proposal on "Guaranteeing European Security." The Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to once again urge everyone to pay attention to the possibility of withdrawing the occupying forces from Germany as soon as possible. This decision would help ease international tensions and improve the situation of the German people. Molotov pointed out that the North Atlantic Group plans to build 160 airfields in Western Europe, 34 of which will be built in West Germany. This policy line will never reassure the people of European countries. Only the Soviet proposal, that is, withdrawing the occupying forces from Germany, and that the four countries immediately seek to ease international tensions and resolve the German question, will help consolidate European peace.

Molotov said: The second opinion concerns the Soviet proposal on an "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security." In response to Bidault's question as to whether the Soviet delegation believed that the "North Atlantic Treaty" and the "All-European Treaty" were compatible, he said: The "All-European Treaty" is intended to replace the "European Defence Community" treaty. As for whether the "North Atlantic Treaty" is compatible with the "All-European Treaty," it must not be forgotten that there are various opinions on the "North Atlantic Treaty." Eden and Bidault have both said that this treaty is defensive in nature, but the Soviet Union believes it is something of a different nature. This shows that a detailed answer to this question should be studied jointly by the four countries.

Molotov then referred to Dulles' statement at the last meeting that the United States advocated world collective security. Molotov said: Dulles' statement may mean that world collective security and European collective security are two different things. However, European collective security does not contradict world collective security. From this point of view, the draft submitted by the Soviet government at this meeting should be studied and specific opinions should be put forward on it.

Molotov added: The third opinion concerns Bidault's statement at the last meeting that the People's Police of the German Democratic Republic is actually an army. Molotov pointed out that Bidault's speech was based on an unobjective investigation. He said: The Soviet delegation believes that it should be pointed out that the Soviet government has materials on the number of police in West Germany, the types and nature of their weapons. According to these materials, West Germany is actually laying the foundation for the establishment of a German army. This situation cannot but attract our attention. Messages from East and West Germany must be given the same due attention. If the current meeting takes the necessary measures, this problem can be solved. Therefore, the Soviet delegation submits the following proposal for review by the conference: "France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union believe that the four countries should reach an agreement on the issue of police in East and West Germany, including the number of police and various weapons."

Subsequently, Dulles spoke. He once again opposed the Soviet proposal to withdraw occupying forces from East and West Germany within six months, falsely claiming that the people of West Germany wanted to maintain the occupation system that burdened them. Dulles cited figures on East Germany's "armed forces" out of thin air, but they were inconsistent with what Bidault said. He also avoided mentioning the Soviet delegation's proposal that the four countries reach an agreement on the issue of police in East and West Germany.

In his speech, Bidault repeated his past unconvincing arguments in defense of Eden's plan. He did not directly respond to the Soviet proposal that the four countries reach an agreement on the issue of police in East and West Germany.

In his speech, Eden also refused to answer the Soviet proposal, only saying that he would consider it. He also once again rejected the Soviet proposal to withdraw occupying forces from Germany within six months. He insisted on his plan, which could not satisfactorily resolve the German question, and said that continuing the discussion of the second item on the agenda did not seem to make any sense.

Molotov spoke again, pointing out that the police force in West Germany, as well as the semi-police, semi-military German units, totaled 368,000 people. Molotov added: We have not yet been able to bring our views closer on the German question, which shows that we have not made enough efforts. The Soviet government believes that it is necessary to continue to work hard to satisfactorily resolve the German question in accordance with the interests of European peace and security, and the governments of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom should also adopt the same attitude. We believe that we should try to resolve various major issues of the German question as soon as possible. But it would be inappropriate to abandon the resolution of several practical issues regarding the promotion of economic and cultural rapprochement between the two parts of Germany. To this end, the Soviet delegation submitted the following proposal to the conference for review:

"In view of the great significance of promoting and expanding economic relations between West and East Germany for Germany, and the need to create more favourable conditions for the development of German national culture, it is recommended that the relevant institutions in West and East Germany:

1. Establish an all-German committee responsible for coordinating and allocating trade, financial settlements, transportation, borders and other issues related to economic relations;

2. Establish an all-German committee responsible for developing cultural, scientific and sports contacts, and eliminating existing obstacles hindering the development of German national culture."

Dulles said that he would not be able to study the Soviet proposal until tomorrow. Bidault and Eden then said that they would study the Soviet proposal. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation hoped to reach an agreement on the two proposals put forward by the Soviet Union today at the meeting on the 18th. Dulles said that the second Soviet proposal required careful study, and he suggested that consultations on this and other issues should continue through diplomatic channels. Eden added that the four countries' high commissioners in Germany could also assist in this consultation. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believed it was necessary to consider the Soviet proposal at the meeting on the 18th. If the foreign ministers of the four countries did not have time to discuss these proposals on the 18th, then they could agree on the next steps.

Eden, who was the chairman, announced that the meeting on the 18th would begin with a discussion of the Austrian issue. In addition, a closed-door meeting on the first item on the agenda would be held in the morning.

    莫洛托夫在十七日四外长会议上
    建议促进东西德的经济文化关系
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林十八日讯：四国外长会议于十七日在苏联驻德高级专员公署继续讨论第二项议程，由艾登担任主席。
    大家知道：在第二项议程讨论过程中，苏联代表团曾向会议提出了解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的许多具体建议，苏联代表团还提出了若干关于减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政与经济义务的措施。但是西方三国外长拒绝了苏联的建议，可是又没有提出任何建设性的建议，来保证缔结对德和约与在和平、民主的基础上恢复德国的统一。西方三国外长又在二月十五日拒绝了苏联代表团提出的关于“保障欧洲安全”的建议和关于缔结“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议。这证明他们实际上并不想迅速解决德国问题，不想消除德国和欧洲的分裂，也不想建立欧洲集体安全体系。
    在十七日的会议上，莫洛托夫首先发言，他对二月十五日第二项议程的讨论表示了一些意见。他说：我们的第一个意见是关于苏联的“保障欧洲安全”的建议。苏联代表团认为有必要再次促请大家注意关于从速撤退驻德占领军的可能性的问题，这一决定会有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，会改善德国人民的处境。莫洛托夫指出：北大西洋集团计划在西欧建筑一百六十个飞机场，其中有三十四个将建筑在西德。这种方针路线决不会使欧洲各国人民安宁。而苏联的建议，即撤退驻德占领军，四国立即设法缓和国际紧张局势并解决德国问题，才是有助于巩固欧洲和平的。
    莫洛托夫说：第二个意见是关于苏联的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议。他回答皮杜尔提出的苏联代表团是否认为“北大西洋公约”和“全欧条约”相容这个问题时说：“全欧条约”是用来代替“欧洲防务集团”条约的，至于谈到“北大西洋公约”是否与“全欧条约”相容，不能忘记，对“北大西洋公约”有着各种不同的意见。艾登和皮杜尔都说过这一公约是带有防御性质的，苏联却认为它是另一种性质的东西。这就说明：对这一问题详尽的回答，应当由四国共同来研究。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到杜勒斯在上次会议上说美国主张世界集体安全这一点，莫洛托夫说：杜勒斯说这句话的意思可能是：世界集体安全和欧洲集体安全是两种不同的东西。但是，欧洲集体安全是和世界集体安全不矛盾的，从这个观点出发，就应该研究苏联政府在这次会议上提出的草案，并对它提出具体意见。
    莫洛托夫又说：第三个意见是关于皮杜尔上次会议上所谓德意志民主共和国的人民警察实际上是军队的说法。莫洛托夫指出：皮杜尔发言根据的是不客观的调查。他说：苏联代表团认为应该指出，苏联政府拥有关于西德警察的人数、他们的武器种类和性质的材料。根据这些材料，西德实际上正在为成立德国军队打下基础，这种情况不能不引起我们注意，从东德和西德来的消息必需予以同样的应有的注意。如果目前的会议采取必要措施，这个问题是能够解决的。因而，苏联代表团提出下列建议交会议审查：“法国、联合王国、美国和苏联认为：四国应就东西德的警察问题，包括警察的人数和各种武器在内，达成协议。”
    随后杜勒斯发言。他再次反对苏联主张在六个月内撤退东西德占领军的建议，他硬把事情说成好像西德人民希望维持使他们负着重担的占领制度。杜勒斯信口援引关于东德“武装力量”的数字，但是又和皮杜尔说的不一致。他对苏联代表团希望四国就东西德警察问题达成协议的建议也避而不谈。
    皮杜尔在发言中重弹他过去为艾登计划辩护时所提出的丝毫不能令人信服的论点，他对苏联提出的希望四国就东西德警察问题达成协议的建议没有作直接的答复。
    艾登在发言中也拒绝回答苏联的建议，只是说要考虑这个建议。他并再一次拒绝苏联关于在六个月内从德国撤退占领军的建议，他坚持他那不能使德国问题得到圆满解决的计划，他说，继续讨论第二项议程看不出有什么意义。
    莫洛托夫再次发言，他指出，西德的警察部队以及半警察、半军队式的德国部队共有三十六万八千人。莫洛托夫又说：在德国问题上，我们还不能使我们的观点接近，这说明我们大家作的努力还不够。苏联政府认为必需继续努力以求依照欧洲和平与安全的利益圆满解决德国问题，美、法、英三国政府也应采取同样的态度。我们认为，我们应该设法从速解决德国问题的各种主要问题。但如果放弃了关于促进德国两部分在经济和文化上接近的若干实际问题的解决，那是不适当的，为此，苏联代表团将下列建议提交会议审查：
    “鉴于促进和扩展西德和东德之间的经济关系对德国具有重要意义，以及必需为发展德国的民族文化创造更有利的条件，建议西德和东德有关机构：
    一、成立一个全德委员会负责调整和调配贸易、财务结账、运输、边界及经济关系方面的其他问题；
    二、成立一个全德委员会负责发展文化、科学和体育方面的联系，并消除现有的妨碍德国的民族文化的发展的障碍。”
    杜勒斯表示要到明天才能研究苏联的建议，皮杜尔和艾登接着也说：他们将研究苏联的建议。莫洛托夫表示苏联代表团希望在十八日的会议上对苏联今天提出的两个建议达成协议。杜勒斯说：苏联第二个建议需要仔细研究，他建议通过外交途径继续就这个问题和其他问题进行协商。艾登补充说：四国驻德高级专员也可以协助这种协商。莫洛托夫说：苏联代表认为必需在十八日的会议上考虑苏联的建议，如果四国外长在十八日来不及讨论完这些建议，那么可以商定下一步如何做。
    担任主席的艾登宣布，十八日会议从讨论奥地利问题开始，此外，在上午就第一项议程举行秘密会议。
