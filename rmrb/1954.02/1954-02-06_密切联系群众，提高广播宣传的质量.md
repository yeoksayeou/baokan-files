    Closely Connect with the Masses, Improve the Quality of Radio Propaganda
    Yi Mengchun
    In the past four years, China's radio broadcasting industry has played a significant role in raising the people's level of political awareness, promoting the country's construction, and fighting against imperialism and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Radio broadcasting, due to its inherent characteristics, has achieved propaganda effects that other propaganda tools cannot replace and has become increasingly closely linked to people's lives.
    The radio broadcasting that the working people idealize is one that is useful to listen to, enjoyable to listen to, and convenient to listen to. These are the three major principles for radio workers to connect with the masses. "Useful to listen to" refers to whether the content is rich; "enjoyable to listen to" refers to whether the form and language of the broadcast are liked by the masses. Therefore, whether radio broadcasting can connect well with the masses mainly depends on the quality of the broadcast programs.
    What is the current status of China's radio programs? Not all broadcast programs are rich in content and interesting. That is not the case. Many broadcast scripts have a narrow thematic scope, are dull in content, and rarely offer new things from various aspects that can educate and inspire people. It is also difficult for people to know the overall picture of the current international situation and domestic construction from radio broadcasting in a timely manner. In some local broadcasts, not enough emphasis is placed on current affairs propaganda. They one-sidedly understand the principle of "serving production" and ignore the role of political and current affairs education in promoting production, so that workers react: it's machines and screws every day! Farmers say: always accumulating fertilizer and catching insects, we're tired of listening. The masses expressed dissatisfaction with this kind of broadcast program that cannot broaden their horizons. Broadcast scripts also lack themes rich in local characteristics. Both the Central Station and local stations rarely broadcast news from remote areas and ethnic minority areas.
    Radio broadcasting is also not concerned enough about the growing learning needs of the vast number of people in our country. Although the Central People's Broadcasting Station has held three "Social Science Lectures" with more than 500,000 listeners, this kind of easy-to-understand lecture has not been continued for a long time. Some lectures that are still being broadcast on local radio are difficult for ordinary working people to accept because they are not popular enough.
    The guiding nature of broadcast programs is very insufficient. For example, we have not made the regular and timely promotion of advanced experiences, advanced figures, and advanced ideas as an important content of radio propaganda. Some radio workers know that broadcasting should emphasize agitation, but they forget that the ultimate purpose of agitation is to constantly point out the direction forward for people. Therefore, they mechanically separate guidance and agitation, thinking that broadcasting cannot introduce advanced experiences. This view is obviously wrong.
    Many broadcast scripts adopt the old style of writing and form in expressing the theme, and the language is not popular, even stiff and chaotic. Some broadcast scripts give the impression of simply shouting slogans, instead of using vivid images to make people instantly feel the fresh atmosphere of the country's vigorous development. Some local broadcasts also have too many long articles and speeches.
    What are the reasons for these situations?
    The fundamental reason is that radio workers are unfamiliar with the lives of the masses, do not understand the needs of the masses, and do not know how much the masses care about current affairs issues and the construction of the motherland, and do not understand the urgent need of the masses to learn.
    The reason also lies in not being good at grasping and using the characteristics of broadcasting. Broadcasting and newspapers are both powerful propaganda tools of the Party, but broadcasting and newspapers are different: newspapers are for people to see (and of course also read to people), relying on people's vision; broadcasting is for people to listen to, relying entirely on hearing. Therefore, how to use sound to infect the audience is a question that radio editors should always care about and consider. Starting from here, the broadcast scripts we require are: short, specific, vivid, diverse, and the language should be popular. However, the current radio broadcasting is still very insufficient in this regard, and even blindly follows major newspapers, seeking completeness and bigness.
    Another reason is the lack of a clear understanding of the direction of broadcasting development. Concentrated listening and hard-selling a long and boring thing are obviously not suitable for the characteristics of broadcasting, and therefore not the direction of broadcasting development (broadcasting conferences are only a form of propaganda suitable for large-scale movements under certain listening conditions). The direction of broadcasting development should be to make broadcasting the most ideal tool for propaganda for every family and every individual. After a day of intense labor, when the masses turn on the radio, if there is light and pleasant music that can inspire confidence, short news and speeches, and popular learning lectures that are needed and accepted by the people, people will have a strong interest in surrounding the radio.
    When talking about broadcast programs, people will not forget broadcast literature and art. In the Soviet Union, music programs account for no less than half of the time in the entire radio broadcast. The role of radio in music promotion is also valued by the masses and musicians. People run to the cinema, music concerts, and theaters, which can only accommodate hundreds to thousands of people; while radio broadcasts of literary and artistic programs can be transmitted to the eardrums of countless people at the same time, and are therefore called "air theaters". Because of this, people's requirements for broadcast literature and art, both in terms of quality and quantity, are extremely strict, and broadcast literature and art workers should devote great energy to arranging excellent literary and artistic programs, and regard enlivening people's cultural and entertainment life as their glorious and important task; also because of the wide influence of broadcast literature and art among the masses, it often plays a leading role in the entire literary and artistic work. In the Soviet Union, many of the best literary and artistic programs are first broadcast on the radio.
    However, the program of China's broadcast literature and art is still quite monotonous. First, there are too few programs, and the same recordings and records are played over and over again. There are even fewer performance programs. This inevitably leads to too much repetition. Second, the form is not diversified, especially the lack of small-scale storytelling and singing that is loved by workers and peasants. Third, existing programs also have a tendency to be formulaic and conceptual. In a word, the current broadcast literature and art, whether in quantity or quality, cannot meet the needs of the people.
    Can this situation be improved? Absolutely. First, there are favorable conditions here. China's literary and art workers believe that being able to choose their own excellent works or broadcast them to millions of listeners on the radio is a glorious and unshirkable duty; the broadcast literary and art circles also have a considerable number of members. Unfortunately, these conditions have not been well utilized. We have not made every effort to attract musicians, dramatists, writers, and folk art performers from all over the country to serve our listeners around radio broadcasting. The Central Station has also failed to organize the scattered broadcast literary and art workers in various places to strengthen their leadership and give full play to their role; it has also failed to concentrate the existing literary and artistic programs scattered in various places through recording and record production to build a material base for broadcast literature and art. In short, the organizational work of literary and artistic programs is too poor.
    Radio broadcasting should play a great role in the popularization of literature and art. However, we rarely hear workers' creations and performances, and peasants' simple mountain songs and ditties on the radio now. This is inseparable from the erroneous views and practices remaining in the minds of some broadcast literary and art workers who believe that workers' and peasants' literature and art are crude and therefore do not actively organize, cultivate, and improve them. The literary and art group of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station said in their own summary that they have a higher mood for singing large-scale and complex works than for singing small-scale works by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, many literary and artistic programs they broadcast are actually only suitable for the tastes of intellectuals, and few short, concise, and easy-to-understand storytelling programs are welcomed by workers, peasants, and soldiers. Here, we want to talk about Soviet music and Western classical music. It is undeniable that these programs are distant from the current life and appreciation level of the Chinese people, especially the workers and peasants. Therefore, they are not as easily accepted and loved by the majority of listeners as folk art. However, with the development of China's cultural and economic life, people are increasing their multi-faceted interests and improving their appreciation level. Therefore, Soviet music and Western classical music can and should be introduced on the radio (of course, it is wrong for individual places not to strictly distinguish classical music from the decadent music of the Western bourgeoisie), but they cannot account for too large a proportion in the entire broadcast literature and art. In addition, we must also compile popular introductions and broadcast them at the same time as the foreign music and drama being introduced to help listeners understand.
    Another important link for radio broadcasting to connect with the masses is to make the audience feel "convenient to listen to". Here, the main problem is the listening equipment. Without listening equipment, people have no relationship with radio broadcasting. Helping the masses solve the problem of listening equipment as much as possible is one of the important tasks for radio workers to connect with the masses. At present, it is impossible for our country to carry out a large-scale amateur radio movement like the Soviet Union, because the masses, especially the largest number of farmers, generally do not have the surplus capacity to buy radios, even crystal radios. Therefore, we should try our best to make the existing listening equipment fully functional. However, due to the unclear working principles, the organization is not solid and sound, and the working methods are not many and good, at least half of the function of the current radio stations and wired broadcasting stations has not been brought into play.
    In addition, whether the broadcast machine and transmitting power are large, and whether the sound quality is good, affects whether the audience can hear clearly and pleasantly, and is also related to whether the audience is willing to continue listening. Therefore, we should regard machine work as one of the important conditions for connecting with the masses.
    The matter is very clear: if the masses find that there are programs with rich content in the broadcast, and these programs are broadcast in a form and language that they love, and listening is very convenient, radio broadcasting will attract more and more listeners, and will make more and more people cultivate an interest in listening to the radio. Therefore, in the final analysis, the primary condition for connecting with the masses is to improve the quality of radio propaganda.
    How to improve the quality of radio propaganda?
    First, all radio workers must clearly recognize some policy issues, such as what programs local radio stations should run well (that is, mainly for rural areas or urban industrial and mining areas), how programs should truly face the masses, whether the direction of radio listening is collective or dispersed, and how broadcasting and newspapers should divide the work (essentially, how to develop the characteristics of broadcasting). These problems can be solved, but because the entire radio workers have not been consciously guided to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions, the understanding of these problems is still not unified, and there are often disputes, which has become an important factor hindering the progress of the work.
    Second, the work of the radio editing department must be improved. At present, the radio editing departments are mostly limited to the circle of revising, reviewing, and singing the manuscripts. They have not guaranteed that the work faces the masses to the maximum extent in terms of organizational structure, system, and working methods, and have not carried out regular, extensive, and in-depth activities among the masses. For example, some comrades are singing the tune that radio stations should not engage in communications work, and for example, the literary and art group of a people's radio station in an individual city has not broadcast literary and artistic broadcasts to workers for as long as three years, and rarely contacted workers. Obviously, the radio editing work must be based on its own extensive mass work. Without a group of special radio writers, literary and art workers, and trained radio correspondents as pillars, it is difficult to obtain broadcast manuscripts and literary and artistic programs with diverse themes, vivid language, and diverse forms. A few editors are powerless. Therefore, in addition to expanding its own interview institutions, it must also seriously rely on activists outside the editorial department. It goes without saying that in the method of communication work, the radio station should be different from the newspaper office in order to suit the characteristics of the radio and better meet the needs of the radio.
    The editorial department must also quickly change the intolerable attitude towards listeners' letters. At present, the number of listeners' letters received by various radio stations is still very small, but some radio stations have also adopted a perfunctory attitude towards these listeners' letters. In this way, the radio station has not fulfilled its responsibility in strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses because it has handled the listeners' letters, and has not seriously absorbed opinions from the letters to improve its work.
    Third, the Party committee must strengthen its leadership over radio work. The fundamental reason why China's radio broadcasting industry has been able to continuously develop is due to the strong leadership of the Party. However, the fact that the quality of radio propaganda is not high at present has not attracted the attention of all local Party committees and industrial and mining Party committees. This situation should be changed. For all of us radio workers, only by striving to improve the quality of propaganda can we better fulfill our glorious mission.

    密切联系群众，提高广播宣传的质量
    易孟醇
    我国的无线电广播事业，在过去四年中，无论在提高人民的政治觉悟程度方面，在推动祖国的建设事业方面，在向帝国主义和国民党反动派的残余势力进行斗争方面，都发挥了很大的作用。无线电广播由于它本身的特点而收到了其他宣传工具所不能代替的宣传效果，并和人民生活发生了日益密切的联系。
    劳动人民所理想的无线电广播，乃是：听了有用，听得有味，要听也很方便。这也就是广播工作者联系群众的三大准则。所谓听了有用，就是内容是否丰富的问题；所谓听得有味，就是广播的形式和语言是否为群众所喜爱的问题。因此，无线电广播能否很好地联系群众，主要依据于广播节目的质量。
    我国广播节目的现状如何呢？还不是所有广播节目都是内容丰富和饶有趣味的。不是这样。有不少广播稿的主题范围很窄狭，内容枯燥，很少从多方面提出新鲜的、能教育人和感染人的新东西来。人们也还很难从无线电广播中及时知道当前国际形势和国内建设的全貌。在某些地方广播中，对时事宣传的重视是很不够的，他们片面地理解“为生产服务”的方针，忽略了政治时事教育对生产的推动作用，以致工人反应：天天是机器、螺丝！农民说：老是积肥捕虫，听腻了。群众对这种不能扩展他们眼界的广播节目，表示不满。广播稿也还缺乏富于地方特色的主题，不论中央台和地方台都还很少播送边远地区和少数民族地区的新闻。
    无线电广播对于我国广大人民日益增长的学习要求也是不够关心的。中央人民广播电台虽曾举办过三次“社会科学讲座”，听众达到了五十多万，但这种通俗易懂的讲座已经很久没有继续举办了。某些地方广播中还在播送的那些讲座，因为不够通俗，很难为一般劳动人民所接受。
    广播节目的指导性是很不够的。例如，我们还没有把经常地及时地宣传先进经验、先进人物和宣传先进思想作为广播宣传的重要内容。某些广播工作者虽然知道广播应该强调鼓动性，但是，忘记了鼓动的最终目的正是为人们不断指出前进的方向，因而把指导性和鼓动性机械分开，认为广播不能介绍先进经验，这种看法显然是不对的。
    许多广播稿在表达主题上，采取了老一套的笔调和形式，语言也不大众化，甚至是生硬的、混乱的。有些广播稿给人以光喊口号的印象，而不是通过生动的图景，使人们一下便可感染到国家蓬勃发展的新鲜气氛。有些地方广播，还有过多的长篇文章和讲演。
    造成这些情况的原因在那里呢？
    根本的原因是广播工作者对于群众的生活是生疏的，对群众的需要不摸底，不大了解群众对时事问题、祖国建设是多么关心，不大了解群众对学习的迫切要求。
    原因还在于不善于掌握和运用广播的特点。广播和报纸同样是党的有力的宣传工具，但广播和报纸是有区别的：报纸，是给人看的（当然也读给人听），依靠人的视觉；广播则是给人听的，完全依靠听觉。因此，如何用声音来感染听众，乃是广播编辑者应该经常关心和考虑的问题。从这里出发，我们要求的广播稿是：短小具体、生动多样、语言大众化。而现在的无线电广播，在这方面做得还是很不够的，甚至还一味追随大报纸，求全求大。
    还有一个原因是，没有明确认识广播的发展方向。集中收听、硬灌一套长篇而枯燥的东西，显然不适合广播的特点，因而不是广播的发展方向（广播大会只是在一定的收听条件下、适宜于在大规模运动中进行宣传的一种形式）。广播的发展方向应当是，使广播成为对每一个家庭和每一个人进行宣传的最理想的工具。群众在一天紧张劳动之后，打开收音机，如果这里有轻松愉快、能鼓舞信心的音乐，有简短的新闻和讲演，有为人们所需要又为人们所能接受的通俗的学习讲座，人们便会有浓厚的兴趣围绕在收音机的周围。
    谈及广播节目时，人们不会忘记广播文艺。在苏联，音乐节目在整个无线电广播中，占有不少于一半的时间。无线电在音乐宣传中的作用，也是为广大群众和音乐家们所重视的。人们跑到电影院去，音乐晚会上去，剧场去，这里只能容纳几百人到几千人；而无线电广播的文艺节目却可在同一时间内传送到无数人的耳膜中去，因而被称为“空中的大戏院”。由于这样，人们对广播文艺的要求，无论从质和量方面说，都是极其严格的，而广播文艺工作者便应该以很大精力致力于编排出优秀的文艺节目，把活跃人们的文化娱乐生活作为自己光荣而重大的任务；也正由于广播文艺在群众中的影响的广泛，所以它经常在整个文艺工作中起着倡导作用，在苏联，最优秀的文艺节目有许多是首先在无线电广播中播送出去的。
    可是，我国广播文艺的节目还是相当单调的。第一、节目太少，放来放去是这几套录音，这几张唱片。演奏节目则更少。因而必然形成过多的重复。第二、形式不是多样化的，特别是缺乏为工农所爱好的小型说唱。第三、现有节目又存在着公式化、概念化的倾向。一句话，当前的广播文艺，无论在量上、在质上，都还不能满足人民的需要。
    这种情况是不是可以改进呢？完全可以。首先是因为这里有着有利条件。我国的文学艺术工作者都认为，能选择自己的优秀作品或者自己在无线电中向千百万听众广播，乃是光荣的和义不容辞的事；广播文艺界也拥有数目不算少的成员。可惜，这些条件并未很好地加以利用。我们没有竭尽全力罗致全国的音乐家、戏剧家、作家和民间文艺演唱者，围绕在无线电广播的周围，来为我们的听众服务。中央台也没有把分散在各地的广播文艺工作者很好地组织起来，加强其领导，使之充分发挥作用；也没有把分散在各地的现有文艺节目，通过录音和灌唱片的办法集中起来，建设广播文艺的材料库。总起来说，就是文艺节目的组织工作做得太差。
    无线电广播对于文艺的普及工作应起很大的作用。但是，我们现在也很少在广播中听到工人们的创作和演奏，农民们的朴质的山歌和小调。这是和某些广播文艺工作者思想上残存着的、认为工农文艺粗糙，因而不积极加以整理、培养和提高的错误观点和做法是分不开的。上海人民广播电台文艺组在他们自己的总结中说，演唱大型的、节拍复杂的作品要比演唱小型的、工农兵的作品情绪高，因而，他们播送的许多文艺节目实际上只适合于知识分子的胃口，很少为工农兵所欢迎的短小精悍、通俗易懂的说唱节目。这里要谈到苏联音乐和西洋古典音乐问题。不可否认，这些节目和我国人民特别是工农群众当前的生活和欣赏水平是有距离的，因而比起民间文艺来，它们就不容易为广大的听众接受和爱好。但是，随着我国文化、经济生活的发展，人们正在增长着多方面的兴趣和提高着自己的欣赏水平，因此，广播中可以而且应该介绍苏联音乐和西洋古典音乐（自然，个别地方没有把古典音乐和西洋资产阶级的腐朽的音乐严格区别开来是不对的），但它们在整个广播文艺中不能占太大的比例。此外，我们还要编写通俗的介绍词，和被介绍的外国音乐、戏剧同时播送，以帮助听众理解。
    无线电广播联系群众的另外一个重要环节是，要使听众觉得“要听也很方便”。这里，主要的问题是收听设备问题。没有收听设备，人们与无线电广播是无缘的。尽可能地帮助群众解决收听设备，乃是广播工作者联系群众的重要工作之一。目前我国还不可能和苏联一样开展大规模的业余无线电运动，因为群众特别是数量最大的农民一般地还没有余力购买收音机，即使是矿石机。因此，应该尽量使现有收听设备充分发挥作用。可是，由于工作方针还不够明确，组织也不够巩固和健全，工作方法也不够多和好，现在的收音站和有线广播站至少还有一半的作用没有发挥出来。
    此外，广播机和发射能力是否大，音质是否好，影响着听众是否听得清晰、悦耳，也关系着听众是否愿意听下去。因此，应该把机务工作看作是联系群众的重要条件之一。
    事情是很明白的：如果群众发现广播中有内容丰富的节目，而且是用他们所爱好的形式和语言来播送这些节目，收听又很方便，无线电广播便会吸引更多更多的听众，会使更多更多的人培养起收听广播的兴趣。因此，归根结底，联系群众的首要条件是提高广播宣传的质量。
    怎样提高广播宣传的质量呢？
    第一、必须使所有广播工作者明确认识一些方针问题，比如地方广播应办好那些节目（即主要是对农村呢还是对城市工矿的问题），节目应如何真正面向群众的问题，广播收音的方向是集体还是分散的问题，广播和报纸怎样分工（实质上是怎样发扬广播的特点）的问题等。这些问题是可以解决的，但由于没有有意识地引导全体广播工作者进行广泛深入的讨论，以致目前对于这些问题的认识仍未统一，时有争论，成为阻碍工作前进的重要因素。
    第二、必须改进广播编辑部的工作。目前，广播编辑部大都限于就稿改稿、审稿和演唱的圈子里，没有从组织机构上、制度上以及工作方法上保证在最大限度内使工作面向群众，没有在群众中进行经常的、广泛而深入的活动。比如有些同志在高唱广播电台不应搞通讯工作的论调，又比如个别城市的人民广播电台的文艺组，竟在长达三年的时间内一直没有播送对工人的文艺广播，也很少和工人联系。很显然，广播编辑工作必须以自己广泛的群众工作为基础，如果没有一批特约广播撰稿人、文艺工作者和经过训练的广播通讯员作为支柱，是很难获得多方面的主题、语言生动、形式多样的广播稿件和文艺节目的。少数编辑人员是无能为力的。因此，除了扩大自己的采访机构之外，还必须认真依靠编辑部以外的积极分子。在通讯工作的方法上，广播电台应该和报社有所区别，以便适合于广播的特点和更好地满足广播的需要，这是不消说的。
    编辑部也必须迅速改变对于听众来信的难以容忍的态度。目前，各广播电台接到的听众来信都还是很少的，但有些广播电台对这些听众来信也采取了敷衍塞责的态度。这样，广播电台便没有因处理听众来信而在加强党和群众之间的联系上尽到自己的责任，也没有从来信中认真吸取意见以改进自己的工作。
    第三、必须加强党委对广播工作的领导。我国广播事业所以能够不断发展，根本原因是由于党的坚强领导。但是，目前广播宣传质量不高这一事实，并未引起所有地方党委和工矿党委的重视，这种状况是应当改变的。对于我们全体广播工作者来说，则只有努力提高宣传质量，才能更好地履行自己的光荣任务。
