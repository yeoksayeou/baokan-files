    Guangzhou Paper Mill to be Expanded into Large-Scale Newsprint Manufacturing Plant
    Capable of Producing 50,000 Tons of Newsprint and Over 10,000 Tons of Commodity Chemical Wood Pulp Annually
    The state-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill will be expanded into the largest automated and semi-automated newsprint manufacturing plant in our country. Upon completion of the expansion in 1956, this plant will annually produce 50,000 tons of newsprint, approximately five times the amount produced in 1953; in addition, it will annually produce over 10,000 tons of commodity chemical wood pulp to supply other paper mills as raw material.
    The expansion of this plant began last year. The entire expansion project includes: factory buildings with a construction area of over 60,000 square meters, the installation of one paper machine, seven to eight grinders, and many other pieces of equipment. According to its design capacity, the paper machine can produce enough paper to print more than four million newspapers daily. The expansion project is being carried out in two phases. The first phase includes the expansion of the mechanical wood pulp workshop, the installation of two grinders, and the bricklaying of chemical wood pulp digesters. Construction on these projects began in November of last year and is expected to be completed in May of this year. By that time, the plant will be able to change the original state of wood pulp production equipment being lower than the paper-making equipment, and therefore, the plant's output this year will increase by more than half compared to last year. The second phase of the project will mostly be carried out from 1955 to 1956. After the entire expansion project is completed, the plant will be several times larger than it is now, and the production process, from raw wood processing to grinding into wood pulp to making newsprint, will be continuous, automated, and semi-automated. Transportation and dock unloading work will also be mechanized to meet the need to handle thousands of tons of raw materials, fuel, and finished products daily.
    South China has abundant wood for paper making. A large amount of wood can reach the plant's wharf directly along the Pearl River. The plant also has no shortage of water, fuel, electricity, and pyrite needed to manufacture calcium sulfite solution for digesting chemical wood pulp. The plant's products can be transported and sold throughout the country via the Yuehan Railway and inland rivers. (Xinhua News Agency)

    广州纸厂将扩建成大规模的新闻纸制造厂
    可年产新闻纸五万吨和商品化学木浆一万多吨
    国营广州造纸厂将扩建成为我国规模最大的自动化和半自动化的新闻纸制造厂。这个厂到一九五六年扩建完成后将年产新闻纸五万吨，约为一九五三年的五倍；另外年产商品化学木浆一万多吨，供给其他造纸厂作原料。
    这个厂的扩建是从去年开始的。它的全部扩建工程包括：建筑面积达六万多平方公尺的厂房，安装一部造纸机、七部到八部磨木机和其他许多设备。造纸机按照它的设计能力，每天生产的纸能印四百多万份报纸。扩建工程分两期进行，第一期有机械木浆车间的扩建工程、两部磨木机的安装工程，和化学木浆蒸煮锅的砌砖工程。这些工程在去年十一月开始施工，预计今年五月全部完成。到那时，这个厂就可以改变原来木浆生产设备低于抄纸设备的状态，因而，今年该厂的产量将比去年增加一半以上。第二期工程大部要在一九五五年到一九五六年进行。这个厂的扩建工程全部完工后，规模要比现在大几倍，生产过程从原木处理到磨成木浆，到制成新闻纸，将是连续性和自动化、半自动化的。运输和码头起卸工作也将机械化，以适应每天吞吐几千吨原料、燃料和成品的需要。
    华南地区有丰富的造纸木材。大量木材可以顺珠江直达该厂码头。该厂造纸所需的水源、燃料、电力和制造亚硫酸钙药液以供蒸煮化学木浆之用的硫铁矿也不缺乏。该厂的产品可以经粤汉铁路和内河运销全国。（新华社）
