Heroic Troops on the Production and Construction Front

    Building the Oil City
    To meet the needs of national industrial construction, a unit of the People's Liberation Army crossed the Tianshan Mountains last year and went to the oil mine construction site.
    The biggest difficulty for the soldiers when they first arrived here was the lack of technology. However, under the guidance of Soviet comrades, they learned and explored, and quickly mastered various complex engineering technologies. They built steel pipe stations, mud plants, tractor stations, reservoirs, culverts, various oil, tap water, and drainage pipe trenches, as well as bridges and mine traffic roads.
    The Fu Jianwei squad demonstrated the spirit of collective creation, completed its task ahead of schedule, and saved the country more than 400 tons of fuel in brick burning. The whole squad was awarded the Second Class Merit. After completing the brick-burning task, they began to build a reservoir in the oil production area. They encountered new difficulties: the reservoir was built with concrete, requiring a large amount of sand and gravel and water for washing the sand and gravel, but the tap water on the construction site was only available for drilling during the day and at night. It was already October, and the ground had begun to freeze. Under the leadership of the Communist Party member and squad leader Fu Jianwei, the soldiers dug sand and gravel during the day and washed sand barefoot in the muddy water at night. Although the cold wind blowing from the Gobi Desert pierced the soldiers' clothes like needles, when they saw the towering oil derricks in front of them and the beautiful night scene at the foot of the mountain, and when they thought that they were creating the artery of the country's industrial construction, the biting cold wind lost its power. They persisted in their work, and in less than twenty days, they completed the task ten days ahead of schedule, saving one hundred and forty-six working days.
    There is also a famous Li Meiqun paint team here. This team consists of eight female comrades who were initially responsible for painting. At first, like other civil structure teams, they knew nothing about technology, and each person could paint at most four doors a day. They actively studied, mastered the painting technology, and increased their work efficiency to sixteen doors per person per day.
    Currently, the soldiers are actively preparing, and as soon as spring arrives, they will be plunged into a tense construction wave. (Wu Yingtang)

    The Transport Fleet on the Yangtze River
    Last summer, a fleet of the East China Military Region Navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army received a glorious and arduous task—to transport grain and industrial construction materials to the Yangtze River basin. Sailing on the vast ocean of the motherland is different from sailing on the Yangtze River. The soldiers had to learn how to navigate shoals, drive piles, tow, and load and unload on the Yangtze River; and prevent the warship's machinery from malfunctioning when sailing in shallow water.
    The fleet set off. The people on both sides of the Yangtze River prepared the necessary equipment and delivered a large amount of fresh food to the ships in a timely manner; they also selected experienced navigators, helmsmen, sailors, and other personnel to help with the work on the ships.
    As soon as the fleet entered Sichuan Province, the difficulties began to increase. The waterway was very dangerous: there were the perilous Three Gorges and the dangerous ?doukou. Sometimes the fog was so thick that the waterway could not be seen clearly. The steep cliffs stood tall on both sides, and the cliffs covered the sky. A cluster of rocks stood on the curved and narrow river, and many reefs and shoals were hidden under the rapid water. The climate was also particularly hot. Clusters of white clouds clung to the mountainside and the river surface, and the deck of the warship was too hot to stand on.
    The engine soldiers persisted in working in the engine room with a temperature of one hundred and twenty degrees every day, and their clothes were soaked in sweat day and night. Because the temperature was too high, some machines needed to be constantly poured with cold water to cool them down. One day, a pump on a ship broke, and another pump had to be replaced to continue sailing, but no one had any experience in installing it. If they went to find a technician, it would delay the time and affect the completion of the transportation plan. The Communist Party member Jia Jinlin crawled into the bottom of the cabin and tried to do this work that he had never done before. The bottom of the cabin was stuffy and hot, and he could not turn around. He persisted in working for ten hours and finally completed the installation work.
    Every time they arrived at the loading and unloading point, the soldiers enthusiastically launched the "fast loading, fast transportation, fast unloading" campaign. They enthusiastically helped the worker brothers to carry goods, and warmly received and comforted the porters. They prepared clean towels and herbal tea for the worker comrades, and also prepared short and small entertainment programs. After the loading and unloading work was completed, the ship's loudspeakers broadcast pleasant and relaxing songs, and the sailors and workers happily sang and danced together on the wharf. Due to the close unity of the soldiers and workers, the loading and unloading efficiency was generally improved, and the loading and unloading time was shortened.
    When this People's Navy fleet victoriously completed its task ahead of schedule and returned to the coastal defense front, it was warmly consoled by the people on both sides of the Yangtze River, and a large number of flowers, banners, and plaques were sent to the ships. When passing through Wanxian, Sichuan, the people of Wanxian held a welcome meeting. Local people's representatives excitedly accused the imperialist warships of bombing Wanxian and massacring the people in 1926. After recounting the bloody crimes, they said: "Now, we have our own powerful navy, protecting our happy life. We can't express how happy we are!"
(Gu Yong, Xu Ran)

    Fighting in the Boshan Gorge
    The winter in the Funiu Mountain area is cold, but the enthusiasm of the soldiers of a certain water conservancy project unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army for building the Boshan Reservoir is like a raging fire.
    At the Boshan Reservoir construction site, many commanders and combatants are working hard to learn production technology. Among the ten soldiers in one squad of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, eight people learned to use air compressors and two people learned to use air drills within five days. A soldier named Zhai Yushi in the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion quickly learned to use water pumps after he came here. In the work of excavating the dam foundation and intercepting the water channel, tens of thousands of people were waiting for the water pump to drain the river. One day, the cylinder gasket of a water pump suddenly broke. Seeing the river water rising and the water could not be pumped out, at this critical moment, Zhai Yushi disassembled the parts, replaced them with a new gasket, and the water pump immediately started rumbling again. Just as this water pump was repaired, another water pump went wrong; Zhai Yushi didn't say a word, took off his cotton coat, and jumped into the icy water to repair it.
    The soldiers fully demonstrated a high degree of responsibility in their work. Once, just as the tunneling project of the water diversion channel was in full swing, a soldier using an air drill could not exert his strength when drilling high stone eyes because he was short. The blasting squad leader and Communist Party member Wang Guangcheng went over and grabbed the air drill on his shoulder and said, "Huang Jiguang blocked the enemy's machine gun with his body in Korea. Can't my shoulders bear an air drill!" In an instant, the machine started, and the air drill made a deafening roar on the stone. Wang Guangcheng closed his eyes tightly, gritted his teeth, and the splashing gravel choked him, but he persisted for more than two hours and completed the task of drilling the eyes.
    The people's soldiers understand that a needle, a thread, and a small screw are all the property of the people. Therefore, they pay attention to saving wealth for the motherland everywhere. Platoon leader Sun Yanhua was in charge of blasting in the water diversion channel project. Because some detonators failed, he often set off "duds," which delayed work and wasted the country's wealth. The personnel in charge of technical guidance told him to install two detonators in each shot hole, and the "dud" phenomenon was avoided, but the detonators were wasted by a full amount. Sun Yanhua often couldn't sleep well at night because of this, and he thought back and forth: "I can't watch the country's wealth being wasted like this!" He began to study the reasons why the detonators did not explode and found that the tungsten wire inside the tube was cut off and the current was not flowing. But lacking a "continuity tester," how to check it? Once, he put the positive and negative wires of the detonator on the copper head of a dry battery and licked it with his tongue to test it. He suddenly felt numbness all over his body, and he realized the principle of electrical conduction. After many experiments, he used dry batteries, copper wires, light bulbs, and wooden boards to make a "continuity tester" for testing detonators. This creation of his saved a lot of wealth for the country.
    In just over a year, the face of Boshan Gorge has changed. Millions of people near the reservoir will forever remember the creators of a happy life—the heroic troops who built the Boshan Reservoir.

    在生产建设战线上的英雄部队
    把石油城建设起来
    为了适应国家工业建设的需要，人民解放军某部去年越过天山转到油矿建设工地。
    战士们刚来到这里时最大的困难是缺乏技术。但在苏联同志的指导下，他们一边学习一边摸索，很快就掌握了各种复杂的工程技术。他们建筑起了钢管站、泥浆厂、拖拉机站、水库、涵洞，各种输油、自来水、排水的管沟，以及桥梁、矿区交通马路。
    傅建伟班发挥了集体创造的精神，提前完成任务，并在烧砖时为国家节约了四百多吨油料，全班立了二等功。完成烧砖任务后，即开始修建采油区水库。他们又遇到了新的困难：水库是用混凝土修的，需要大量的沙石和淘洗沙石的水，可是工地上的自来水，白天只供钻井用，夜里才可以得到。这时已是十月天气，地已经开始结冻。战士们在共产党员傅建伟班长的带头下，白天挖沙石，夜里光着腿在泥水里淘洗沙子。虽然从戈壁上吹来的寒风，像针一样穿透了战士们的衣服，但当他们看到面前那高耸的油塔以及山脚下美丽的夜景，当他们想到自己正在缔造祖国工业建设的动脉时，那刺骨的寒风便失去了威力。他们坚持工作，不到二十天，便提前十天完成了任务，节省了一百四十六个工作日。
    这里还有一个闻名的李美群油漆小组。这个小组一共有八个女同志，她们最初担任油漆工作。一开始，她们也和其他土木结构小组一样，对技术一窍不通，每人一天顶多油漆四扇门。她们便积极学习，掌握了油漆技术，工作效率提高到每人一天漆十六扇门。
    目前，战士们正积极准备着，春天一来到，他们又将卷入紧张的建设浪潮中。　（吴映堂）
    长江上的运输舰队
    去年夏天，中国人民解放军华东军区海军某舰队接受了一项光荣而艰巨的任务——到长江流域调运粮食和工业建设器材。在辽阔的祖国海洋上航行和在长江上航行是不一样的，战士们必须学会在长江上过滩、打桩、拖带和装卸技术；使军舰机件在浅水中航行时不发生故障。
    舰队出发了。长江两岸人民给准备了必要的器材，并及时地把大批新鲜食物送到舰上；还选派经验丰富的领江、舵工、水手等人员，到舰上帮助工作。
    舰队一进入四川省境，困难开始多起来。航道十分艰险：有天险的三峡和?都口险道。有时雾气弥漫，看不清航道。两岸陡壁屹立，悬崖蔽空，弯曲而狭窄的江面上矗立着一丛丛岩石，湍急的水流底下隐藏着许多礁滩。气候又特别炎热，一团团白云贴在山腰上和江面上，军舰的甲板烫得站不住脚。
    轮机兵们每天在一百二十度高温的轮机房里坚持工作，他们的衣服日夜被汗水湿透。因为气温太高，有的机器需要不断用冷水灌浇，使它冷却。一天，某舰的一个抽水机坏了，必须换上另一个抽水机才能继续航行，但大家都没有安装的经验。如果去找技术工人，就要耽搁时间，影响运输计划的完成。共产党员贾锦林便钻进舱底，试着做这个从未做过的工作。舱底又闷又热，不能转身，他一直坚持工作了十小时，终于完成了安装工作。
    每到装、卸地点，战士们便热烈地展开了“快装、快运、快卸”运动。他们热情地帮助工人兄弟搬运，并亲切招待和慰问搬运工人。他们为工人同志准备了清洁的毛巾和凉茶，还准备了短小的文娱节目。装卸工作完成后，舰上的扩音器播出愉快轻松的歌声，水兵们和工人们就在码头上欢乐地共同唱起歌、跳起舞来。由于战士和工人们的亲密团结，普遍提高了装卸效率，缩短了装卸时间。
    当这支人民海军舰队胜利地提前完成任务返回海防前线的时候，又受到长江两岸人民热烈的慰问，鲜花、锦旗和方匾大批地送到舰上。经过四川万县的时候，万县人民举行了欢迎大会，当地人民代表激动地向人民海军同志们控诉了一九二六年帝国主义军舰炮轰万县、屠杀人民的血腥罪行之后说：“现在，我们有了自己的强大的海军，保卫着我们的幸福生活，我们心里说不出有多么快乐！”
                              （顾勇、徐然）
    战斗在薄山峡谷里
    伏牛山区的冬天是寒冷的，可是中国人民解放军水利工程某部的战士们建设薄山水库的热情，却像烈火一样。
    在薄山水库工地上，许多指挥员、战斗员，努力学习着生产技术。某部五连一个班的十个战士中，在五天内就有八个人学会了使用空气压缩机，两个人学会了使用风钻。三营九连有一个名叫翟玉石的战士，他来到这里以后，很快地学会了使用抽水机。在挖掘坝基、截水槽的工作中，成千上万的人都等待着抽水机把河水抽干。一天，一架抽水机的汽缸垫子突然坏了，眼看着河水上涨，而水又抽不上来，在这紧要关头，翟玉石把零件卸开，换上一个新的垫子，抽水机立刻又隆隆地开动了。当这架抽水机刚修好，另一架抽水机又出了岔子；翟玉石一句话也没说，脱掉棉衣，扑通一声跳进冰冷的水里，把它修好。
    战士们在劳动中充分地表现了高度的负责精神。一次，正当输水道开凿工程紧张进行的时候，
  一个打风钻的战士，因为个子矮，打高处的石眼时使不上劲，爆破班长、共产党员王广成便走过去一把抓住风钻放在自己的肩头上，说：“黄继光在朝鲜用自己的肉体堵住了敌人的机枪眼，咱的肩膀还抗不住个风钻！”刹时间机器开动了，风钻打在石头上发出震耳的吼声。王广成紧闭着眼睛，咬紧牙关，飞溅的碎石沫呛得他透不过气来，他坚持了两个多小时，完成了打眼的任务。
    人民的战士懂得，一根针、一条线、一个小螺丝钉都是人民的财产，因此，他们处处注意为祖国节省财富。排长孙延华在开凿输水道工程中担任爆破任务。因为有些雷管失效，他常常放“瞎炮”，既耽误了工作，又浪费了祖国的财富。担任技术指导的人员便叫他在每个炮眼里安两个雷管，“瞎炮”现象就避免了，可是雷管凭空多浪费了一倍。孙延华为了这件事，夜里常常睡不好觉，翻来覆去地想：“我不能眼看着祖国的财富这样浪费掉啊！”他开始研究雷管不响的原因，发现管内的钨丝截断，电流不通。但是缺乏“导通试验器”，怎么检查呢？有一次，他拿雷管的阴阳线放在干电池的铜头上，用舌头舐着试验，突然感到全身麻木，他才了解到电通的道理。经过多次试验，他用干电池、铜丝、灯泡和木板等制成了一个试验雷管的“导通试验器”。他这一个创造，给国家节省了大量的财富。
    仅仅经过一年多的时间，薄山峡谷的面貌就已经改变了。水库附近的千百万人民，将永远记着幸福生活的创造者——修建薄山水库的英雄部队。
                            （孙景瑞、刘家树）
