Xinhua News Agency, February 20th – The extremely profound impression that the recently concluded Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference has left on the world is the Soviet Union's attitude of sincerely negotiating and patiently seeking to resolve international disputes at this conference.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov attended the conference with a sincere desire to ease international tensions and consolidate peace. During the conference, the Soviet Union put forward many comprehensive, realistic, and specific proposals that could effectively solve problems based on the interests of peace and security. The Soviet Union proposed convening a meeting of the five major foreign ministers to discuss easing international tensions. The Soviet Union also put forward comprehensive proposals for the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the unification of Germany. After these proposals were rejected by the United States, and Britain and France who followed behind, the Soviet Union proposed suggestions to guarantee European security and establish a European collective security system, and suggestions to promote economic and cultural relations between East and West Germany. According to a report by Agence France-Presse, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov repeatedly asked the foreign ministers of the Western countries at the conference table not to simply reject the Soviet proposals, but to put forward constructive opinions. In order to reduce the differences between the Soviet Union and the three Western countries and seek an agreement, the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to consider the opinions of the three Western countries to discuss and amend certain points in the Soviet proposal for the establishment of a European collective security system. The Soviet Union also took into account the objections of the three Western countries and revised its proposal for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Austria. Despite these efforts by the Soviet Union, the conference was still unable to reach an agreement on the German issue, the European security issue, and the Austrian issue due to the obstruction of the United States, Britain, and France. Later, at the closing meeting, the Soviet Union put forward two more proposals, suggesting that the four countries continue their efforts to satisfactorily resolve the German issue, and that the four countries conduct negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty through diplomatic channels. After these two proposals by the Soviet Union were rejected by the three Western countries, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov still expressed the hope to strive to solve the German issue and the Austrian peace treaty issue in his closing speech.

The Soviet Union's sincere negotiating attitude has won widespread international praise. Even Western news agency reporters and even official figures have had to admit this. Reuters reporter Stanley Priddle said: "Mr. Molotov showed a friendly and reasonable attitude at the conference table." According to a report by Agence France-Presse, people in the American delegation also admitted on January 31: "Molotov's attitude is conciliatory and friendly." The French newspaper "Libération" said: "People who understand diplomatic activities particularly appreciate the demeanor of the Soviet Foreign Minister."

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speeches and proposals at the conference were always the focus of discussion at the conference and the focus of attention from public opinion in various countries. The Soviet proposals have always been the focus of comments in Western European newspapers. According to a report by Reuters reporter Rankin from Washington at the end of January, "Most of the headlines in American newspapers reporting on the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference carried news about Molotov. Generally speaking, the situation is: Molotov took the initiative and made suggestions at the conference, while the West rejected, criticized, or ignored these suggestions." Agence France-Presse reporter Ellery said: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov enjoyed "the freedom to use initiative...He can use his special talents of improvisation and quick replies, and these replies are always just right...His impromptu speeches have an amazing effect." The French newspaper "Le Figaro" said: Molotov "is in some respects a model of diplomacy."

At the Berlin Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' performance was in sharp contrast to that of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Dulles was unreasonable and refused to negotiate at the conference table. Dulles did not offer any convincing arguments to oppose the Soviet proposals, but only distorted or avoided talking about the Soviet proposals. Dulles' speeches always used lies and abuse and slander to cover up his unreasonable attitude. This behavior of Dulles was criticized by British Labor MP Thomas Driberg, who said: "Mr. Dulles is the contemporary embodiment of the disgusting image of the hypocritical Pharisee - he only reviles his neighbor, but says nothing about his own sins. The powder on this hypocrite's face is getting thinner and thinner."

The whole world saw two completely different diplomatic attitudes from the Berlin Conference: that of the Soviet Union and that of the United States.

    柏林四国外长会议的整个进程表明
    苏联一贯真诚协商耐心谋求解决国际争端
    【新华社二十日讯】已经闭幕的柏林四国外长会议给全世界留下的极为深刻的印象，就是苏联在这次会议上真诚协商、耐心谋求解决国际争端的态度。
    苏联外长莫洛托夫是带着争取缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的真诚愿望参加这次会议的。苏联在会议中提出了许多全面的、实事求是的、能够根据和平与安全利益有效解决问题的具体建议。苏联提出了召开五大国外长会议以讨论缓和国际紧张局势问题的建议。苏联还提出了迅速缔结对德和约、统一德国的全面建议。在这些建议被美国及跟在后面的英国和法国拒绝后，苏联又提出了保障欧洲安全和建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，提出了促进目前东西德间经济与文化关系的建议等。据法新社的报道，苏联外长莫洛托夫在会议桌上一再要求西方三国外长不要一味拒绝苏联的建议，而要提出建设性的意见。为了减少苏联与西方三国间的分歧，谋求达成协议，苏联表示愿意考虑西方三国的意见，来讨论和修正苏联提出的建立欧洲集体安全体系建议中的若干点。苏联并且考虑到西方三国的反对意见，对它所提出的缔结对奥和约建议作了修正。苏联作了这些努力，但会议在美、英、法三国的阻挠下，仍然无法在德国问题、欧洲安全问题、奥地利问题上达成协议。以后，苏联在闭幕会议上又提出两项建议，建议四国继续努力以求圆满解决德国问题，以及四国通过外交途径进行对奥和约的谈判。在苏联这两项建议又为西方三国所拒绝后，苏联外长莫洛托夫在会议闭幕发言中仍然希望今后能争取解决德国问题及对奥和约问题。
    苏联这种真诚协商的态度，获得了国际上普遍的赞誉。连西方通讯社记者以至官方人士都不得不承认这一点。路透社记者斯坦莱·普里德尔说：“莫洛托夫先生在会议桌上表现了友好的讲理态度”。据法国新闻社报道，美国代表团的人士在一月三十一日也承认：“莫洛托夫的态度是和解的、友好的”。法国“解放了的巴黎人报”说：“洞悉外交活动的人士特别欣赏苏联外长的风度”。
    苏联外长莫洛托夫在会议上的发言和建议，自始至终是会议讨论的中心和世界各国舆论注意的焦点。苏联的建议一直是西欧国家报纸评论的中心。据路透社记者兰金一月底自华盛顿报道，“美国报纸在报道四大国外长会议的消息中，大部分标题都载着有关莫洛托夫的消息。一般说来，情况是：莫洛托夫在会议上操着主动并且提出建议，而西方则是拒绝、批评或不理睬这些建议。”法国新闻社记者艾勒里说：苏联外长莫洛托夫在会议上享有“能自由运用的主动权。……他能运用他的随机应变和迅速对答的特殊才能，而这种对答总是恰到好处的。……他的临时发言有惊人的效果。”法国“费加罗报”说：莫洛托夫“在某些方面是外交界的典范”。
    在柏林会议上，和苏联外长莫洛托夫成为鲜明对照的，是美国国务卿杜勒斯的表现。杜勒斯在会议桌上不讲道理，拒绝协商。杜勒斯没有提出任何令人信服的论据来反对苏联的建议，只是歪曲或避不谈论苏联的建议。杜勒斯的发言总是用撒谎和谩骂、诽谤来掩饰他的无理态度。杜勒斯这种作为，曾遭到了英国工党议员托马斯·德里柏的抨击，他说：“杜勒斯先生是伪善的法利赛人这个可厌恶的形象的当代典型——他只痛骂他的邻居，而对自己的罪恶却不置一词。这个伪君子脸上的粉已经越来越薄了。”
    全世界从柏林会议中看到了苏联和美国两种截然不同的外交态度。
