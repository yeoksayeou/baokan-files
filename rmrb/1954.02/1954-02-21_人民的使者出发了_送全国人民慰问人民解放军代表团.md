    The People's Envoys Set Off
    —Seeing Off the National People's Delegation to Console the People's Liberation Army
    Zang Kejia
    The eagle soars in the high sky, its shadow cast upon the earth,
    People's warriors, thousands of miles away, the people embrace you tightly!
    Looking up at the motherland's sky, the sky serenely shrouds the beautiful land,
    As we look up at it, we also see the bright eyes of the heroes in the sky.
    The fleet in the sea, the Great Wall on the water, guards the gate for the great motherland,
    The sentry's eyes are watching the enemy, and the people's eyes are watching you.
    The towering figure standing on the distant frontier, the sound of footsteps breaking through the cold night of the Tianshan Mountains,
    Dear warriors, we have seen and heard it, using not only our ears and eyes.
    The people have sent their own representatives to comfort the people closest to their hearts,
    It is you who have single-handedly renewed the color of the world,
    It is your hard work that has brewed the warmth of our lives.
    The people have sent their own representatives to the sandstorm-swept northern desert,
    To the evergreen Jiangnan,
    Excited footsteps will lead the representatives to the East China Sea coast,
    The Tibetan plateau is also slowly moving into view.
    The people's representatives come from different places,
    From different ethnic groups,
    From different posts,
    In clothes of different styles,
    They contain the same fiery hearts.
    Some hands still have the smell of machine oil,
    Some lapels are mixed with the scent of soil,
    Volunteers from the Korean front,
    Their faces still carry the winds and clouds of the Yalu River.
    Bring the people's respect, the people's comfort, to the people closest to their hearts,
    Pin every golden commemorative medal on every soldier's chest.
    It is like the sun, it is like a star, it is the radiant heart of the people.
    Gun barrels and wheat ears are crossed in the heart,
    Tiananmen Square stands majestically in the heart.
    Let the air force take it, and fly even more nimbly,
    Let the navy take it, and be even more energetic in braving the wind and waves,
    Let the army take it, and take even more upright steps,
    500 million compatriots are advancing with you.

    人民的使者出发了
    ——送全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团
    臧克家鸷鹰在高空里翱翔，影子投射在大地上，人民的战士啊，千里万里，人民用心紧紧拥抱你！抬头仰望祖国的天空，天空宁静地笼罩着美丽的河山，在我们仰望它的同时，也望到了空中英雄们炯炯的两眼。海里的舰队，水上的长城，替伟大的祖国把守着大门，哨兵的眼睛在注视着敌人，人民的眼睛在注视着你们。遥远边疆耸立的身影，踏破天山寒夜的脚步声，亲爱的战士啊，我们看到了也听到了，用的不仅是耳朵和眼睛。人民派出了自己的代表，去慰问自己心上的人，是你们一手翻新了天地的颜色，是你们的辛苦酿造了我们生活的温馨。人民派出了自己的代表，到风沙扑人的漠北，到四季皆春的江南，兴奋的脚步将把代表们领到东海滨，西藏高原也慢慢地移向眼前。人民的代表来自不同的地方，来自不同的民族，不同的岗位上，不同式样的衣服里，包括着同样火热的心肠。有的手上残留着机器的油味，有的衣襟上杂有泥土的气息，来自朝鲜前线的志愿军，脸上还带着鸭绿江上的风云。把人民的敬意，人民的慰问，带给人民心上的人，把每一颗金色的纪念章，佩上每一个战士的胸襟。它像太阳，它像星，它是光辉四射的人民的心。心上交叉起枪杆和麦穗，心上巍然耸立着天安门。空军带上它，飞得更轻捷，海军带上它，冲风破浪更起劲，陆军带上它，步子迈得更挺拔，五万万同胞和你们一起行进。（附图片）
