Comrade Dong, Head of the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army, all representatives, comrades:
    The National People's Delegation to Comfort the Chinese People's Liberation Army is about to depart to various parts of the country, representing the people of the whole country in extending their regards to the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, special forces, public security forces, railway forces, construction engineering reclamation forces, as well as all the comrades of the PLA wounded and sick soldiers and veterans who are defending the national defense and national construction of the motherland. Today, we are holding a farewell meeting here to bid farewell to all the comrades of the delegation. I, on behalf of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Chinese People's Resist America and Aid Korea General Association, extend a warm farewell to Comrade Dong Biwu, the head of the delegation, and all the representatives, and wish the delegation a successful completion of this glorious and important mission.
    Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the people of the whole country, has achieved a great victory in the Chinese revolution through more than 20 years of heroic fighting and arduous struggle, established the People's Republic of China, and opened up the road for our country to move towards socialism. In the four years since the founding of the country, the People's Liberation Army has wiped out the Kuomintang remnant forces on the mainland, suppressed bandits, crushed the harassment of the Kuomintang bandits against our coastal areas, and safeguarded the security of our national defense and social stability. At the same time, it has united the people of the whole country and actively participated in the country's various huge construction projects, enabling our great motherland to smoothly enter the stage of planned construction. These facts show that without the People's Liberation Army, there would be no New China, no security of the motherland, and no happiness for the people. Therefore, the people of the whole country always care about and love our People's Liberation Army, and have boundless respect and gratitude for the People's Liberation Army. This time, the people of the whole country have organized a delegation of comfort, including representatives from all democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, fraternal nationalities, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, precisely to express the profound meaning of our people's respect and love for the People's Liberation Army through the delegation's condolences.
    This delegation of comfort is carrying out its work at a time when the general line and general task of the transition period are being vigorously promoted throughout the country. Chairman Mao instructed us that the general line during the transition period is to gradually realize socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce over a fairly long period of time, so as to build our country into a great socialist country. This is a great plan to completely change the face of our country, which requires the people's army and the working people of the whole country to unite and work hard to realize it. Therefore, we hope that the delegation of comfort, while extending condolences, must also widely convey to the People's Liberation Army the great achievements of the motherland's economic construction in the past four years, publicize the general line and general task of the country in the transition period, as well as the bright and happy prospects of the motherland, in order to boost the morale and fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army. Encourage the People's Liberation Army to continue to heighten vigilance and consolidate national defense, further strengthen the close unity between the army and the people across the country, and jointly strive to complete the task of the motherland's socialist construction. The people of the whole country deeply know that their army—the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers—is the protector of the people and the people's own country. Everyone sees that after the Korean armistice was realized, the US imperialists are still continuing to maintain and create tension in the Far East and the world. Recently, they openly forced the detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and sent them to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, and continue to invade our country's territory of Taiwan, instigating Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to harass our coastal areas. At the same time, they are also trying their best to support Japanese militarism and stubbornly implement the policy of splitting Germany, reviving the remnants of Nazi forces in West Germany. All these facts prove that our country continues to suffer from the threat of aggression by US imperialism. Therefore, we cannot but maintain vigilance and preparedness at all times to strictly guard against any provocations and aggression by the enemy. The people of the whole country hope that all the People's Liberation Army, in this historical period when the imperialist system still exists in the world, will constantly heighten vigilance, take the great Soviet army as an example, and strive to improve their military, political, and cultural level, and strive to master modern military science and technology and build a modernized land, sea, and air force. Our people of the whole country will certainly take the spirit of hard struggle, heroic sacrifice, close unity, observance of discipline, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance of the People's Liberation Army as an example, follow the general line of the country during the transition period, and actively build the motherland, and support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions. We firmly believe that with the leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the protection of the powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army, our people's cause of building socialism and defending peace in the Far East and the world will surely achieve victory. At the same time, we believe that this delegation of the people of the whole country to comfort the People's Liberation Army will certainly live up to the trust of the people of the whole country and complete the glorious task of comforting the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Finally, let me respectfully wish all the comrades of the delegation good health.
Long live the heroic and powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army!
Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    政协全国委员会副主席、抗美援朝总会主席
    郭沫若的欢送词全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团董总团长，全体代表，各位同志：
    全国人民慰问中国人民解放军代表团，即将出发到全国各地，代表全国人民向保卫着祖国国防和国家建设的中国人民解放军陆、海、空军，特种部队，公安部队，铁道部队，建设工程屯垦部队以及解放军伤病员和荣誉军人全体同志们进行慰问。今天我们在这里举行欢送大会，欢送代表团全体同志，我谨代表中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和中国人民抗美援朝总会向代表团董必武总团长以及全体代表表示热烈的欢送，并预祝代表团胜利完成这一光荣的、重大的使命。
    中国人民解放军在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，与全国人民在一起，经过二十多年的英勇作战和艰苦奋斗，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，开拓了我国走向社会主义的道路。建国四年来，人民解放军消灭了大陆上国民党残余部队、肃清了土匪、粉碎了国民党残匪对我国沿海的骚扰，保卫了我国国防的安全和社会的安定，同时团结了全国人民，积极参加了国家各项巨大的建设工作，使我们伟大的祖国顺利地进入有计划的建设阶段。这些事实说明没有人民解放军，便没有新中国，便没有祖国的安全，便没有人民的幸福。因此，全国人民总是时刻关怀着、热爱着我们的人民解放军，对人民解放军怀着无限的崇敬和感激的心情。这次全国人民组织了慰问代表团，包括全国各民主阶级，各民主党派，各人民团体，各兄弟民族和中国人民志愿军的代表，正是为了要通过代表团的慰问，来表达我们人民对于解放军的崇敬和爱戴的深意。
    这次慰问代表团是在全国大张旗鼓宣传过渡时期总路线总任务的时候进行工作的。毛主席指示我们，过渡时期的总路线就是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，以便把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。这是彻底改变我国面貌的伟大计划，须要人民的军队和全国劳动人民团结一致、努力奋斗才能实现。因此我们希望慰问代表团在慰问的同时，还须得向人民解放军广泛传达祖国四年来经济建设的伟大成就，宣传国家在过渡时期总路线总任务以及祖国光明幸福的远景，以鼓舞人民解放军的士气和斗志。鼓舞人民解放军继续提高警惕巩固国防，进一步加强全国军民的亲密团结，共同为完成祖国社会主义建设的任务而奋斗。全国人民深深地知道自己的军队——中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军是人民和人民自己的国家的保卫者。大家都看到，朝鲜停战实现后，美帝国主义者还在继续保持和制造远东和世界的紧张局势，最近又公然强迫扣留朝中被俘人员分送给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮，并继续侵占我国领土台湾，指使蒋介石匪徒滋扰我国沿海，同时还竭力扶植日本军国主义，并顽强地执行着分裂德国的政策，在西部德国复活纳粹的残余势力。这一切事实证明我国继续遭受着美帝国主义的侵略威胁。因此我们不能不时刻保持警惕和戒备，严防敌人的任何挑衅和侵略。全国人民希望全体人民解放军，在世界上还存在着帝国主义制度的这个历史时期里，不断提高警惕，以伟大苏联军队为榜样，努力提高自己的军事、政治、文化水平，为掌握现代军事科学技术、建设现代化的陆、海、空军而努力。我们全国人民必将以人民解放军艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、亲密团结、遵守纪律、克服困难、坚忍不拔的精神为榜样，遵循国家过渡时期的总路线，积极建设祖国，以实际行动来支援人民解放军。我们坚决相信，有了伟大共产党和毛主席的领导，有了强大的中国人民解放军的保卫，我国人民建设社会主义和保卫远东及世界和平的事业，一定会取得胜利。我们同时相信，这次全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团，一定不会辜负全国人民的委托，完成慰问中国人民解放军的光荣任务。最后，让我敬祝代表团诸位同志身体健康。英勇的强大的中国人民解放军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
