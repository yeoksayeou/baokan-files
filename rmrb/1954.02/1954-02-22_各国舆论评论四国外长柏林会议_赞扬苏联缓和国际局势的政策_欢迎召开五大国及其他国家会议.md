Xinhua News Agency
Berlin, February 20th - According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin on the 19th: Berlin's democratic newspapers published news about the closing meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on the front page with large headlines. The focus of attention for the newspapers was the conference communique and the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the closing meeting.

    The editorial in "Neues Deutschland" pointed out that at this conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward proposals that would help ease international tensions, peacefully resolve the German question, and guarantee European security. The newspaper continued by saying that financial oligarchs and monopoly capitalists hope to exacerbate international tensions in order to lead to an arms race and military conflicts, thereby obtaining maximum profits. Imperialism needs war, not peace. They want the German people to be divided and enslaved, and do not want a unified, independent, and democratic Germany. They are willing to conclude military treaties but unwilling to conclude a peace treaty with Germany. They prefer militarism and fascist dictatorship to seeing true democracy. The newspaper pointed out that the reason the three Western powers agreed to participate in the Berlin Conference was not because they were prepared to reach an agreement, but only because of the consistent peace policy of the Soviet Union and the pressure of the will of the people of the world that they had no choice but to do so. The newspaper, in discussing the Berlin Conference's discussion of the German question, pointed out that the Soviet delegation's constructive suggestions were warmly supported by German public opinion. The newspaper said that the representatives of the three Western powers, disregarding the will of the German people, rejected all these suggestions of the Soviet delegation in order to favor the militarization of West Germany and drag it into an aggressive bloc. The newspaper severely criticized the policies of the Bonn government, which opposed the just demands of the German people during the Berlin Conference. The newspaper concluded by saying that the German people thank the Soviet government for upholding the views of the German people at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Thousands upon thousands of letters, telegrams, and resolutions expressing gratitude, as well as numerous meetings and marches held by patriots in the German Democratic Republic and West Germany, demonstrate this gratitude.

    The editorial in "Berliner Zeitung" wrote that after the conclusion of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, it is even more obvious that the revival of German militarism is incompatible with the security of the people of European countries and makes the reunification of Germany impossible.

    "Berliner Morgenpost" praised the attitude of the Soviet delegation. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet delegation put forward "positive, constructive, and very practical suggestions" that pointed the way to solving the German question. At the same time, the newspaper strongly condemned the representatives of the three Western powers for rejecting the suggestions of the Soviet delegation, pointing out that this showed that they disregarded the vital interests of the German people.

    Berlin's democratic newspapers called on the German people to intensify their efforts to peacefully resolve the German question in accordance with the suggestions of the Soviet government and the government of the German Democratic Republic.

Poland

    Xinhua News Agency, February 21st - According to a TASS dispatch from Warsaw on the 20th: The Polish newspaper "Trybuna Ludu" published an editorial commenting on the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, saying: Although the Berlin Conference did not resolve all the issues on the agenda, it nevertheless demonstrated that cooperation between major powers is necessary and possible, and that such cooperation can promote the easing of international tensions. Those who spread "pessimistic propaganda" and those who saw the convening of the conference itself as a disaster and hoped for its failure are disappointed by this fact. And the people of all countries are satisfied to welcome the agreements reached by the Four Foreign Ministers. The achievement of these agreements is due to the tireless efforts of the Soviet delegation. Every suggestion by Molotov has garnered a wide response in the hearts of hundreds of millions of people.

    "Trybuna Ludu" pointed out: "The great achievement of the principle of international cooperation is that the great China, along with other major powers, will occupy its place at the Geneva conference table, despite all the possible means used by the United States to obstruct it."

    "Trybuna Ludu" concluded: "The fact that the Berlin Conference was unable to resolve certain issues, especially the German question, which is of great significance for European security, is the responsibility of the Foreign Ministers of the Western countries."

    The newspaper "Głos Pracy" pointed out: The discussion of the Soviet proposals at the Berlin Conference once again convinced the people of the world that it is not the Soviet Union that threatens peace and European security, but the forces that divide Europe with all kinds of blocs.

France

    Xinhua News Agency, February 20th - According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 20th: When commenting on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, Parisian newspapers particularly emphasized that the agreement reached at the conference to convene a meeting in Geneva on April 26th with the participation of the People's Republic of China and other relevant countries to discuss the Korean and Indochina issues is of great significance.

    Roger Massip, a reporter for the bourgeois newspaper "Le Figaro," wrote: "French public opinion will be very satisfied to hear that the four major powers have already agreed in principle to convene a conference in Geneva." Massip summarized the results of the conference by saying: "Although agreements were reached on only a few issues, there was no breakdown."

    The Socialist Party's right-wing newspaper "Le Populaire" believes that the conference "contributed somewhat to the cause of peace."

    "L'Intransigeant" published a commentary by Charles Ronsac, saying: The most important achievement of the conference is that the negotiations between East and West, which were interrupted five years ago, will now continue, and China will also participate.

    "Libération" published an editorial entitled "Hope," saying: The results achieved in the first contact after years of disputes and exchanges of notes are encouraging. Agreements have been reached on several issues, and negotiations on the urgent issues in Asia will be held in the near future. Anyone who paid attention to the progress of the conference will not doubt the Soviet Union's desire to reach an agreement. No politician will believe the "threat" of Soviet "aggression" any more. All the new proposals and new reconciliation methods were put forward by Molotov. The decision to convene the Geneva conference was the result of discussing Molotov's proposal. Molotov suggested holding a broad conference with the participation of China, but Dulles was even unwilling to discuss this suggestion.

    "Libération" then pointed out: The Four Foreign Ministers could not reach an agreement on the German question entirely because the Western delegations planned to establish the notorious "European Defence Community" and arm former Nazi generals.

    "Libération" concluded: "The first step has been taken. After a long time, the door to consultation has been opened again. The achievements gained in these three weeks are greater than the results of exchanging notes for four years. Consultation is possible and can bring important results. What prompted the Four-Power Conference was the will of the people of all countries."

    Xinhua News Agency: The French newspaper "L'Humanité" welcomed the agreement reached at the Berlin Conference on convening the Geneva Conference and urged the French government to end the Indochina War. "L'Humanité" said: "How can it be considered reasonable to continue this war? ... Since it has been agreed to convene the Geneva Conference, the Indochina issue should be resolved peacefully. Then why continue this war?"

    Marcel Friat wrote an article in "Libération," requesting the French government to take measures to cease fire in Indochina before the convening of the Geneva Conference. He said: "A ceasefire should be the result of the Berlin Conference. But this depends entirely on our government. There are sixty-seven days left before the Geneva Conference, which is enough for us to stop the sound of cannons!"

    "Le Monde" said that the Berlin Conference "took a step forward." The newspaper went on to write: "Although the agreement reached on Asian issues is only procedural in nature, it is a stage of development in the development of world politics. Because, on the one hand, it breaks the deadlock in the Korean political conference, and on the other hand, it opens the door to negotiations on Indochina." The newspaper emphasized that in Asia, especially in Indochina, it is time to negotiate.

    A reporter for "Paris Presse" wrote that the Berlin Conference paved the way for China to enter the international community, making it possible to ease the situation in the Far East and allowing everyone to exchange opinions on disarmament again.

    A reporter for "France-Soir" wrote that the day after the Berlin Conference ended, many French, British, and Americans asserted that the conference had, after all, brought about a very significant easing in diplomacy. At the Berlin Conference, the four foreign ministers made practical contact, and this contact had been severed for many years.

Britain

    Xinhua News Agency, February 21st - According to a TASS dispatch from London on the 20th: Many British newspapers commented on the results of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    "The Daily Worker" said: The conference has opened the way for further negotiations leading to the cessation of the Cold War.

    The weekly "Socialist Tribune" wrote in an editorial: The Berlin talks failed to peacefully reunify Germany because the Western countries were determined to drag West Germany into a war alliance headed by the United States against the Soviet Union. Now, in the workers' movement, this undeniable fact has been almost universally recognized. ... The responsibility for failing to reunify Germany should be borne by Dulles, Eden, and Bidault. The Soviet Union's proposal to end the occupation within six months was opposed by the three Western diplomats because they wanted to use Germany as their base for aircraft and atomic bombs and as a military springboard for the anti-Soviet war.

    The weekly "Tribune" criticized the Labour Party leadership's stance on the German question and demanded that Labour Party leaders put forward a policy to oppose Dulles-Eden's policy aimed at arming West Germany.

    An article in the weekly "New Statesman and Nation" said: If the United States had not obstructed it, a peace treaty with Austria could have been signed. The magazine's reporter quoted Kornhuber, a member of the Austrian delegation, as saying that Molotov and Figl "could have resolved the Austrian issue in an hour. But, according to reliable sources who attended the conference, any compromise on the peace treaty with Austria was obstructed by Dulles. It is said that Dulles hinted to Figl that no matter how tempting the signing of the peace treaty with Austria was, achieving such a climax at the Berlin Conference would make Adenauer feel very embarrassed and might threaten the opportunity to pass the "European Defence Community" treaty; because the final success at the conference would lead millions of Europeans to conclude that we can "do business" with the Russians after all.

    "The Daily Mail" said in an editorial: "Although the Berlin Conference failed in its main purpose, it did not explode into pieces or sink without a trace. Contact has been restored, and this contact will continue when the five major powers meet in April to discuss events in the Far East."

    "The Daily Herald" pointed out in an editorial: "The first step to normalizing the situation in the Far East is for the United States to recognize the existence of Communist China... This sole achievement of the Berlin Conference at least fosters hope."

Italy

    Xinhua News Agency: The Italian newspaper "L'Unità" published an article on the results of the Berlin Conference, saying: "For many years, Washington and other Western European capitalist countries that follow it have asserted that it is impossible for representatives of the world's two major camps to negotiate, and they even said that it is dangerous to negotiate. But we have now conducted consultations, and at the same time, we can understand that it is not only possible to conduct consultations, but also that such consultations are beneficial, because at least it can open a path for improving international relations."

Norway

    Xinhua News Agency: The Norwegian newspaper "Friheten" published an editorial on the results of the Berlin Conference, saying: "The Berlin Conference did not reach a positive agreement on the German issue and the Austrian issue, which is entirely due to the attitude of US Secretary of State Dulles. In order to cause an open breakdown of the conference, he used disruptive methods so that he could say later that there was no hope of negotiating with the Russians." The newspaper went on to say: "Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward many practical and constructive suggestions, but all these good suggestions were rejected by the Foreign Ministers of the Western countries, except for two."

    各国舆论评论四国外长柏林会议
    赞扬苏联缓和国际局势的政策
    欢迎召开五大国及其他国家会议
    民主德国
   【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林十九日讯：柏林各民主报纸在第一页用大字标题登载了有关四国外长会议闭幕会议的消息。各报注意的中心是会议公报和苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫在闭幕会议上的发言。
    “新德意志报”的社论指出，在这次会议上，苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫提出了有助于缓和国际紧张局势、和平解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的建议。该报接着说，金融寡头、垄断资本家希望加剧国际紧张局势，以导致军备竞赛和军事冲突，从而取得最大利润。帝国主义需要的是战争，不是和平。他们希望德国人民分裂和遭受奴役，而不喜欢有一个统一、独立、民主的德国。他们愿意缔结军事条约而不愿缔结对德和约。他们喜欢军国主义和法西斯独裁，而不愿看见真正的民主。该报指出，西方三国之所以同意参加柏林会议，并不是因为他们准备来达成协议，而只是由于苏联一贯执行和平政策和世界各国人民意志的压力，才不得不这样做。该报在谈到柏林会议对德国问题的讨论时指出，苏联代表团的各项建设性的建议，受到德国舆论的热烈拥护。该报说，但是西方三国代表不顾德国人民的意志，为了有利于西德的军国主义化并把它拖入侵略集团，拒绝了苏联代表团的这一切建议。该报严厉抨击波恩政府的政策，波恩政府在柏林会议期间反对德国人民正义的要求。该报最后说，德国人民感谢苏联政府，因为它在外长会议上维护了德国人民的观点。成千成万表示感谢的信件、电报、决议以及德意志民主共和国和西德爱国人士举行的许多会议和游行，就表现了这种感谢。
    “柏林日报”的社论写道，四国外长会议闭幕后，可以更加明显地看出：德国军国主义的复活，和欧洲各国人民的安全不相容，并使德国恢复统一成为不可能。
    “晨报”赞扬苏联代表团的态度。该报指出，苏联代表团提出了“积极的、建设性的和非常切实可行的建议”，这些建议指出了解决德国问题的道路。同时，该报严厉谴责西方三国代表拒绝苏联代表团的建议，指出这表明他们不顾德国人民的切身利益。
    柏林各民主报纸号召德国人民加紧努力，争取根据苏联政府及德意志民主共和国政府的建议和平地解决德国问题。
    波兰
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社华沙二十日讯：波兰“人民论坛报”发表社论，评论四国外长会议说：虽然柏林会议没有解决列入议程的所有问题，但是，它毕竟说明了：大国的合作是必要的和可能的，这种合作能促进国际紧张局势的缓和。散布“悲观宣传”的人和那些把召开会议本身看作是灾祸，并希望会议失败的人，对这个事实是感到失望的。而各国人民则满意地欢迎四国外长达成的协议。这些协议的达成是由于苏联代表团的不倦的努力。莫洛托夫的每一个建议，都在亿万人民的心中获得了广泛的反应。
    “人民论坛报”指出：“国际合作主张的巨大成就是：伟大的中国和其他的大国一起将在日内瓦会议桌上占有自己的席位，尽管美国采取了一切可能的手段来加以阻挠”。
    “人民论坛报”最后说：“柏林会议对某些问题，首先是对欧洲安全具有重大意义的德国问题没有能够解决，这应由西方国家的外长负责。”
    “劳动之声”报指出：柏林会议上对苏联建议的讨论，又一次使世界各国人民相信：并不是苏联威胁着和平与欧洲的安全，而是以各种各样的集团来分裂欧洲的那些力量威胁着和平与欧洲的安全。
    法国
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十日讯：巴黎各报评论柏林四国外长会议的结果时，特别强调指出：会上协议于四月二十六日在日内瓦召开有中华人民共和国及其他有关国家参加的会议，以讨论朝鲜和印度支那问题，这个协议具有重大意义。
    资产阶级报纸“费加罗报”的记者罗歇·马西普写道：“法国舆论听到四大国已经在原则上同意在日内瓦召开会议，会感到很满意。”马西普总结会议的成果说：“虽然是在少数问题上取得了协议，但是并没有发生破裂。”
    右翼社会党的“巴黎人民报”认为会议“对于和平事业多少有点贡献”。
    “义勇军报”发表夏尔·隆沙克的评论说：会议最重要的成果是：五年以前就中断的东西方之间的谈判，现在将继续下去，而且中国也参加进来了。
    “解放报”以“希望”为题发表社论说：经过数年争执和照会往来之后的第一次接触所取得的成果，是令人鼓舞的。在几项问题上取得了协议，在最近的将来还要进而就亚洲的迫切问题举行谈判。凡是注意会议进展的，没有人会怀疑苏联想达成协议的愿望。没有一个政治家会再相信苏联“侵略”的“威胁”这种说法。所有新的主张，新的和解办法，都是莫洛托夫提出来的。召开日内瓦会议的决定，就是讨论莫洛托夫的建议的结果。莫洛托夫建议举行有中国参加的广泛的会议，杜勒斯甚至不愿意讨论这个建议。
    “解放报”接着指出：四国外长不能在德国问题上达成协议，完全是因为西方代表团计划成立臭名远扬的“欧洲防务集团”，并且武装前纳粹将领。
      “解放报”最后说：“已经走了第一步。经过了很长的时间以后，协商之门又开了。这三个星期中得到的成就比四年来交换照会的结果还要大。协商是可能的，并且能带来重要的结果。促使四国会议召开的，是各国人民的意志。”
     “人道报”在“协商精神的胜利”的标题下，刊载了特派记者皮埃尔·古达德的通讯。他综述柏林会议的经过说：“柏林会议以通过关于讨论亚洲问题的决定结束，这是协商精神的胜利，苏联代表团始终无限耐心地表现了这种精神。”古达德着重指出：爱好和平的国家与世界各国人民当前还有许多任务。古达德最后说：“柏林会议后，‘欧洲军’计划以及武装复仇主义的德国这类计划已经被揭发，大家看到了这是和平的障碍。为了扫清道路，必须摧毁这些计划。”
    据新华社讯：法国“人道报”欢迎柏林会议就召开日内瓦会议所取得的协议，并敦促法国政府结束印度支那战争。“人道报”说：“如何能认为继续这个战争是合理的呢？……既然同意召开日内瓦会议，就应当使印度支那问题和平解决。那为什么还要继续这种战争呢？” 
    马赛尔·弗里埃在“解放报”著文，要求法国政府在召开日内瓦会议以前，就采取措施在印度支那停战。他说：“停战应当是柏林会议的结果。但是，这完全要看我们政府了。离日内瓦会议还有六十七天，这足够使我们来停止大炮的响声！”
    “世界报”说，柏林会议“向前迈进了一步”。该报接着写道：“虽然在亚洲问题上所达成的协议只是程序性质的，但这在世界政治的发展中却是一个发展阶段。因为，一方面它打破了朝鲜政治会议的谈判僵局，另一方面它为印度支那的谈判打开了大门。”该报强调说，在亚洲，特别是在印度支那，是进行谈判的时候了。
    “巴黎急进新闻”的记者写道，柏林会议为中国打通了走进国际社会的道路，使远东局势有可能缓和，使大家可以重新就裁军问题交换意见。
    “法兰西晚报”的记者写道，柏林会议结束后的第二天就有不少的法国人、英国人以及美国人断言，这次会议毕竟使得在外交上有了十分显著的缓和。在柏林会议上四国外长们进行了实际的接触，而这种接触已断绝了好几年。
    英国
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦二十日讯：英国许多报刊评论四国外长会议的结果。
    “工人日报”说：会议已为导向停止冷战的进一步的谈判开辟了道路。
    “社会主义展望”周刊在社论中写道：柏林谈判未能使德国和平地重归统一，这是因为西方国家决心要把西德拖进以美国为首的、反对苏联的战争联盟。现在，在工人运动中，这个不可否认的事实，差不多已得到了普遍的承认。……未能重新统一德国的责任应该由杜勒斯、艾登和皮杜尔来担负。苏联在六个月内结束占领的建议遭到了三个西方外交官的反对，因为他们要把德国当作他们的飞机、原子弹的基地、当作反苏战争的军事跳板。
    “论坛”周刊批评了工党领导方面在德国问题上采取的立场，并要求工党领袖们提出一个政策来反对杜勒斯—艾登的旨在武装西德的政策。
    “新政治家与民族”周刊刊载的一篇通讯说：如果美国不阻挠的话，对奥和约本来是可以签字的。该刊记者引用奥地利代表团团员科恩胡伯尔的话说莫洛托夫和费格尔“本来可以在一小时内解决奥地利问题的。但是，据参加会议的可靠人士说，任何关于对奥和约的折衷办法都被杜勒斯所阻挠。据说杜勒斯曾向费格尔暗示，无论对奥和约的签订具有怎样大的诱惑力，在柏林会议上达到这样一个高潮将使阿登纳感到非常为难，并可能威胁到通过“欧洲防务集团”条约的机会；因为会议上最后的成功将使千百万欧洲人得出结论说：我们毕竟是可以和俄国人“打成交道”的。
    “每日邮报”在社论中说：“虽然柏林会议在主要目的上是失败了，但是并没有爆炸得粉碎或者沉没得无影无踪。接触已经恢复，而且，五大国在四月间集会讨论远东事件的时候，这种接触还要继续下去。”
    “每日先驱报”在社论中指出：“远东局势正常的第一个步骤是需要美国承认共产党中国的存在……柏林会议这个唯一的成绩至少助长了希望。”
    意大利
    据新华社讯：意大利“团结报”就柏林会议的结果发表文章说：“许多年来，华盛顿以及跟在它后面的其他西欧资本主义国家都断言：世界两大阵营的代表不可能进行协商，他们甚至说进行协商是危险的。但是我们现在已经进行了协商，同时可以了解，不仅可能进行协商，而且这种协商是有益的，因为至少它可以为改善国际关系开辟一条道路。”
    挪威
    据新华社讯：挪威“自由报”就柏林会议的结果发表社论说：“柏林会议在德国问题和奥地利问题上没有达成肯定的协议，这完全是由于美国国务卿杜勒斯的态度。他为了使会议发生公开的破裂，使用了捣乱的手段，以便以后说，跟俄国人进行谈判是没有希望的。”该报接着说：“苏联外长莫洛托夫提出了许多切实可行的、建设性的建议，但是，除了两个建议以外，所有这些良好的建议都被西方国家的外长拒绝了。”
