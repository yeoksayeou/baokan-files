Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, February 17th: Vietnamese newspapers are enthusiastically supporting the Soviet Union's position at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

    The "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, recently commented on Molotov's proposal for a five-power foreign ministers conference and a peaceful resolution of the German question, saying: Molotov's proposals at the Berlin Conference clearly reflect the progressive humanity's love of peace. If the United States, Britain, and France stubbornly continue to disagree with the Soviet Union's correct position, they will expose their true colors of sabotaging peace before the whole world.
    The "Salvation Daily," the organ of the Vietnam National United Front, wrote: The Vietnamese people warmly support Molotov's proposals. Only by correctly implementing the Soviet Union's proposals and recognizing the important role of the People's Republic of China in the international arena, will it be possible to peacefully resolve disputes in Asia and around the world and ease international tensions in accordance with the interests of peace and the security of all mankind.

    越南报纸支持苏联在四外长会议上的立场
    【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社北越十七日讯：越南报纸热烈支持苏联在四国外长会议上的立场。
    越南劳动党机关报“人民报”最近谈到莫洛托夫关于召开五大国外长会议以及和平解决德国问题的建议说：莫洛托夫在柏林会议上提出的建议，清楚地反映了进步人类对和平的热爱。如果美、英、法三国继续顽固地不同意苏联的正确立场，他们将在全世界面前暴露出他们破坏和平的真正面目。
    越南国民联合战线机关报“救国报”写道：越南人民热烈拥护莫洛托夫所提出的建议。只有正确地实行苏联的建议，承认中华人民共和国在国际上的重要作用，才有可能根据和平和全人类安全的利益，来和平解决亚洲和全世界的争端，缓和国际紧张局势。
