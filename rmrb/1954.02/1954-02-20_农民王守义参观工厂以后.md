    Farmer Wang Shouyi After Visiting a Factory
    Fu Dong
    Unwilling to Farm Peacefully

    In the eastern suburbs of Beijing, there is a village called Dahuangzhuang, where a young farmer named Wang Shouyi lives. This young man is strong and capable in all kinds of field work, but he is unwilling to farm. He saw the factory chimneys increasing day by day, and the young men in the village running to the factories one by one, which made him extremely envious. His neighbor, a worker named Ding Shaoquan, had only been in the factory for a few years, but he was already riding a shiny bicycle, wearing clean and neat clothes, with sweaters and long johns, and he was quite knowledgeable when discussing issues. Wang Shouyi thought about himself, working in the fields all year round, his back aching with fatigue, and the crops he harvested were not even enough to feed his family. If he encountered a flood or drought year, all his efforts would be in vain. Wang Shouyi was most distressed that he couldn't learn to read and write while working in the fields. So he often said to people, "There's no future in farming." He was constantly thinking about getting into a factory.

    Last May, when the Dongjiao Brewery was building houses, Wang Shouyi found an opportunity to work as a laborer. Once he entered the factory, he forgot all about the mutual aid team. When the members of the mutual aid team came to talk to him after work, he was too lazy to answer. A team member, Wang Rui, said, "You 'backbones' are all going to work in the factory, leaving us to farm for you. Even though we get paid, it's not as much as you earn in the factory. Only a fool would do this kind of job." He clamored to withdraw from the team. The leader of the mutual aid team was also dispirited and couldn't muster any enthusiasm. A good mutual aid team fell apart like this, and everyone went back to working on their own.

    "Without Grain, How Can the Machines Move?"

    In December, the district committee organized the villagers to visit the factories. Wang Shouyi went to the Dongjiao Flour Mill. As soon as he entered the workshop, Wang Shouyi felt that his eyes were not enough to see everything. The machines were spinning so fast! It made people's eyes dizzy. The workers told him that the factory, with just over fifty workers, produced more than 11,000 bags of flour every day. Wang Shouyi thought that in the village, grinding flour with a donkey could only produce fifty or sixty jin a day. Calculating it, the production of a hundred people, a hundred donkeys, and a hundred millstones in a day was only equivalent to the production of twenty-five workers in the factory in a day. The more Wang Shouyi saw, the more he felt that industry was important, and he couldn't wait to stand next to the machine and start working. He learned in detail about the factory's development. This factory only started production in December 1950, when it produced just over 4,000 bags of flour a day. The second year, it increased to 7,000 to 8,000 bags a day, and now it can produce more than 10,000 bags a day. The worker who introduced him to the factory enthusiastically held his hands and said, "The factory has developed so fast, and this is inseparable from your hard work in producing good wheat to supply us. Otherwise, how can our machines move?" Wang Shouyi's face turned red. Little did they know what was on his mind.

    After seeing the machines, everyone sat down to chat. A worker enthusiastically ran over to find Wang Shouyi. The first thing he asked was, "How are the spring plowing preparations going?" Then he asked, "Have you joined a mutual aid team?" "Has the mutual aid team made a production plan?" He asked so many questions! He asked about the harvest of the previous year and the year before. He also asked whether they had adopted the Soviet Union's advanced farming experience. It was all about production. Before leaving, the worker repeatedly urged Wang Shouyi to go back and reorganize the mutual aid team, and plant more good wheat to supply the factory. The worker said that if the factory received good wheat, then the factory could become bigger and bigger, and there would be more and more of them, and the village could use machines for farming sooner.

    "We Can't Just Watch Others Row the Boat"

    After visiting the factory, one day, Wang Shouyi passed by the Shuangqiao State Farm and saw a young woman driving a tractor to practice plowing. The tractor was very big, with seven plows attached to the back. As it moved, it turned up several furrows in the ground, a foot deep. The girl sat on the tractor, humming the song "We Workers Have Strength," and didn't seem to be exerting any effort at all. Wang Shouyi was stunned. He thought, "Isn't this also farming? What's the difference between these farmers and workers? Why do I always feel that there's no future in farming? The workers are so busy with production, why am I still being confused and emotional? How shortsighted!" He couldn't help but blame himself.

    Wang Shouyi began to think about the mutual aid team. He said to the people in the team, "We've already boarded the socialist ship, we can't just watch others row the boat while we do nothing!" Everyone gathered together and recalled that when they were working individually, each mu of land could only yield 180 to 200 jin of corn, but the year before, when they joined the mutual aid team, each mu of land yielded 300 jin. The more they talked, the more they felt that mutual aid was good. One team member said, "I heard that Wu Yushu's production cooperative has already yielded 480 jin of corn per mu." Wang Shouyi seized the opportunity to say to the people in the team, "As long as everyone reorganizes the mutual aid team well, if you're willing, you can organize a production cooperative. If we work harder, we can even use tractors for farming! Then we can live a beautiful life like in the Soviet movie 'A Happy Life'!" The people in the mutual aid team had seen many movies about the lives of Soviet farmers. When they heard that as long as they worked hard, they could live such a sweet life, they were all overjoyed. After meetings, big and small, and individual talks, the four households that wanted to withdraw from the team no longer wanted to withdraw. One team member had a mule, but in the past, he didn't think there was much point in being in the mutual aid team, so he went out to haul bricks all day long. Wang Shouyi talked to him several times, and he was also willing to use the mule to plow the land for the mutual aid team. Several families in the village saw that their mutual aid team was improving and asked to join. The mutual aid team's transformation was so fast that even Wang Shouyi himself didn't expect it. A few days ago, he went around the whole village and saw that the team members were all busy preparing fertilizer, and the seeds had already been selected. Wang Shouyi said excitedly, "Thinking about my earlier thoughts, it's really funny! After seeing the factory, I realized that the factory is a 'machine factory,' and we are a 'grain factory.' No one can do without the other!" He also told me, "The team members' thinking has now been straightened out! When the government called for the sale of surplus grain, the eight households in the whole team sold 3,500 jin of grain. Everyone said that they would grow more grain to support national construction and build socialism together with the workers!"

    农民王守义参观工厂以后
    傅冬
    不安心种庄稼
    北京东郊有个大黄庄，庄里有个青年农民名叫王守义。这个小伙子身强力壮，地里活样样能干，可他偏偏不愿种庄稼。他看见工厂的烟囱一天比一天多，村里的年青小伙子一个个往工厂跑，眼热的了不得。隔壁那个叫丁少权的工人，进厂才几年，就骑上了雪亮的自行车，身上穿的干净利爽，又是毛衣又是毛裤，谈起问题来，也很有一套。王守义想到自己整年在地里转，累得腰酸腿疼，打下的庄稼还不一定够一家子吃，碰上个涝、旱年，还扑一场空。王守义最苦恼的是下地不能学文化。所以他常常对人说：“种庄稼没出息。”成天寻思着进工厂。
    去年五月东郊酿酒厂盖房子，王守义找到一个机会去作小工，一进工厂，他就把互助组的事忘得干干净净。下工回来，互助组的组员来找他谈问题，他都懒得答腔。组员王瑞说：“你们这些‘骨干’都去作工，叫我们给你们种地，虽说给钱，但比不上你们作工拿的钱多，傻子才干这份差事。”吵着要退组。互助组的组长也无精打彩，提不起劲，好好一个互助组，就这样四分五裂，又变成各干各的。
    “没有粮食，机器怎么能动”
    十二月中，区委组织村里的人去参观工厂。王守义去的是东郊面粉厂。一进车间的门，王守义就感到自己的眼睛不够使唤了，那机器转得好快呀！看得人眼睛都发花了。工人告诉他，厂里五十多个工人，每天生产一万一千多袋面粉。王守义想在村里用驴子磨面，一天才能磨五、六十斤。算下来：村里一百个人，一百头驴和一百个磨一天的生产才顶工厂二十五个工人一天的生产。王守义越看越觉得工业重要，恨不得当下就站到机器旁动手干起来。他详细了解了一下工厂的发展情况。这个工厂在一九五零年十二月才开工生产，那时一天才出四千多袋面，第二年升到一天七八千袋，现在一天已能出一万多袋了。给王守义介绍的那位工人说到这里热情地握着他的双手说：“工厂发展得这样快，这是和你们努力生产供给我们好麦子的功劳分不开的。要不，我们的机器怎么能动？”说得王守义满脸通红，他们那里知道他心里的病呢？
    看完机器以后，大伙坐下来谈天。一位工人热情地跑过来找王守义。见面头一句话就问：“春耕准备得怎样了？”接着就打听“有没有参加互助组？”“互助组有没有订生产计划？”他提的问题真多，他问了前年的收成，又问去年的。还问有没有采用苏联的先进经验种地？净是生产上的事儿。临别的时候，那个工人再三嘱咐王守义，回去好好把互助组整顿整顿，多种些好的小麦，供应工厂。工人说：如果送给厂的都是好麦子，那么工厂就可越开越大，越开越多，乡里也就可早日用机器种地。
    “不能光看着别人划船”
    参观工厂以后，有一天，王守义有事经过双桥国营农场，他看见一个年纪轻轻的女同志驾驶着一个拖拉机在练习耕地。那个拖拉机很大，后面挂着七个犁刀，一走过去，地下就翻起几条沟，足足有一尺深。那个女孩子坐在机车上，嘴里哼着“咱们工人有力量”的歌子，看样子一点也不用力。王守义看得发呆了，他想：“这不也是耕地吗？这样的农民和工人有什么区别？为什么自己老觉得种庄稼没出息？工人同志那样紧张地生产，为什么自己还糊里糊涂闹情绪？多么近视啊！”他不由得埋怨起自己来。
      王守义开始想互助组里的事。他对组里的人说：“我们已经坐上了社会主义的大船，我们不能光看着别人划船，自己不动手呀！”大伙聚在一起回忆了一下：单干的那阵，一亩地只能打一百八十斤到二百斤玉米，前年参加了互助组每亩地就打到三百斤。大伙越谈越觉得互助起来好，一个组员说：“听人家说，吴玉书生产合作社一亩地已经打到四百八十斤玉米了。”王守义趁热对组里的人说：“只要大伙把互助组整好，如果愿意，就可以组织生产合作社，再努一把力，还可以用拖拉机耕地呢！那时就可以过像苏联电影‘幸福的生活’那样的美好日子了！”互助组的人看过不少写苏联农民生活的电影片子，一听说只要自己使把劲，就能过那样的甜日子，都乐开了。经过大会、小会个别谈话，那四户要退组的也不退组了。一个组员有头骡子过去他觉得干互助组没啥意思，就整天出去拉砖，王守义找他谈了几次，他也乐意用骡子给互助组耕地了。村里有几家看见他们这个互助组有起色，也要求加入。互助组转变得这样快，连王守义自己都没想到。前些天，他到全村跑了一圈，看见组员都在忙着准备肥料，种子都早已选好了。王守义谈到这里兴奋地说：“想起我早先的思想真是好笑！看了工厂，才知道，工厂是‘机器工厂’，我们是‘粮食工厂’，谁也离不开谁！”他又告诉我：“互助组组员的思想，现在都搞通啦！政府号召卖余粮的时候，全组八户就卖了三千五百斤粮。大伙都说要多打粮食，支援国家建设，和工人一道建设社会主义呢！”
