The rural preferential treatment work in 1953 achieved great success. Various localities have attached greater importance to organizing the families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in agricultural and sideline production. Especially in areas with a foundation for mutual aid and cooperation organizations, attention has generally been paid to educating and organizing the families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In 1953, Hebei Province regarded the process of rectifying substitute farming as a process of organizing the families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in production, which achieved certain results. According to statistics from four counties including Handan and Jize, the proportion of families of martyrs and military personnel participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations increased from 50% in 1952 to over 70%. In 1953, the Northwest Region, based on the different situations of new and old areas, focused on strengthening the education of "labor is glorious" for the families of martyrs and military personnel in new areas, and absorbed them into production teams and cooperatives; for the families of martyrs and military personnel in old areas lacking production materials, they were helped to solve difficulties such as plowing livestock and farm tools, and thus the number of participants in production continued to increase. According to surveys in some areas of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia and other provinces, the proportion of families of martyrs and military personnel participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations reached about 60%. In many areas of Gansu Province, after the families of martyrs and military personnel participated in production and mutual aid and cooperation organizations, their enthusiasm for production greatly increased, which not only solved the difficulty of insufficient labor in their production, but also enabled them to carry out sideline production such as weaving straw hats and digging licorice with surplus labor. Many families of martyrs and military personnel in various localities have become production activists and labor models.

Many regions have purposefully used preferential treatment funds to concentrate on helping families of martyrs and military personnel establish their own households. The Northeast and Northwest regions have made great achievements in this regard. Last year, the Northeast Region concentrated 56 billion yuan of preferential treatment funds to help families of martyrs and military personnel produce and establish their own households. Many families of martyrs and military personnel added vehicles and bought horses to improve their living and production conditions, and automatically declined substitute farming and material subsidies. According to statistics from ten counties in Gansu Province, such as Xigu and Huanxian, the government used preferential treatment funds to help 3,989 poor families of martyrs and military personnel establish their own households, accounting for more than 38% of the total number of families of martyrs and military personnel. In Yanchi County, Ningxia Province, due to the concentrated use of preferential treatment funds, 70% of the families of martyrs and military personnel established their own households. Experience has shown that in areas that do not do this, although the government distributes a lot of funds, the living difficulties of poor families of martyrs and military personnel cannot be completely resolved.

Some unreasonable phenomena in the substitute farming work were further corrected last year, making the situation of enjoying substitute farming and bearing substitute farming more reasonable. In 1952, the area of land substitute farming for families of martyrs and military personnel in Shaanxi Province reached about 40%. Last year, some unreasonable phenomena such as the inversion of families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers, failure to substitute farm when it should be, and substitute farming when it should not be were corrected in some areas, so that the average substitute farming area in the province was reduced to about 25%. Due to the appropriate reduction of the substitute farming area, not only was the burden on the masses reduced, but also the land of the families of martyrs and military personnel who were truly lacking in labor and poor was effectively taken care of. In areas that have been rectified, the labor force generally bearing duty has expanded to about 85% of the total labor force, and in individual districts and townships it has expanded to more than 90%, correcting the past bias of concentrating the substitute farming burden on some farmers. For example, in Qinyang County, Henan Province, the duty exemption area was very large in 1952, with as many as 80 people being exempt from duty from the village head to the team leader in each village, and at least 30 people, with each labor force bearing an average of 6 workdays. After rectification, each labor force only bears 2.2 workdays.

The organizational form of substitute farming also improved further last year. In areas with a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the substitute farming method combining substitute farming with mutual aid and cooperation organizations has become the basic organizational form. About 80% of the substitute farming land in Heilongjiang Province last year was substitute farmed by production mutual aid groups. In seven counties including Xuanhua in Hebei Province, about 70% were substitute farmed by mutual aid groups and cooperatives. More than half of the counties in Jiangxi Province have also begun to focus on promoting this method. Fujian Province, adapted to the characteristics of scattered land in mountainous areas, adopted the method of contracting farming by plots and hills, that is, when the substitute farming land of families of martyrs and military personnel is scattered, several mutual aid groups contract farming by plots. This method is welcomed by the masses. Due to the improvement and enhancement of the organizational form of substitute farming, the collective strength has been better exerted, the substitute farming system has been further improved, and the sense of responsibility of the substitute farmers has been strengthened. The substitute farming farmers in most areas have formulated substitute farming plans and substitute farming covenants, so that "families of military personnel come first before oneself". Therefore, the land substitute farmed in these areas can be cultivated intensively, yield more grain, and the lives of the families of martyrs and military personnel have also been improved. At the same time as improving the organizational form of substitute farming, some areas have cleared up substitute farming wages. Last year, Hebei and Shanxi provinces implemented the substitute farming method of "mainly substitute farming with labor, combined with the adjustment of financial resources throughout the province", which basically corrected the phenomenon of uneven substitute farming burdens between regions.

Many regions regard preferential treatment work as part of the entire agricultural production work, and arrange and inspect it at the same time as production work, so that preferential treatment work has become a regular work. The People's Government of the Eleventh District of Yishui County, Shandong Province, arranges, inspects, and summarizes substitute farming work at the same time as it arranges, inspects, and summarizes agricultural production work. In Wusheng, Yuechi, Yingshan and other counties in Sichuan Province, substitute farming policies are also explained at the same time as autumn production policies are explained; the production and substitute farming of families of martyrs and military personnel are also checked at the same time as the autumn plowing and autumn planting are checked and the autumn requisition reduction and exemption are evaluated; and agricultural labor models are also selected at the same time as the production models of families of martyrs and military personnel and the outstanding substitute farming models are selected. Some areas even include substitute farming work as one of the contents of district and township cadre meetings. This ensures that the substitute farming land can be cultivated, planted, and harvested in a timely manner, and the shortcomings in the substitute farming work can be corrected in a timely manner. In Shexian County, Hebei Province, during the inspection, it was found that the land of more than 100 families of martyrs and military personnel should have been substitute farmed but was not, and adjustments were made twice according to actual needs. Haidian District, Beijing, adopted the method of joint inspection teams (jointly formed by two or three nearby townships) to inspect substitute farming work during the "August 1st" Army Day. The staff went to the fields of military families, the masses, and substitute farming groups to check the crops, compare and observe the good and bad of substitute farming, which had a great effect on promoting preferential treatment work.

However, the rural preferential treatment work in 1953 still had many problems that need to be solved in the future. First of all, there are still many families of martyrs and military personnel who are able to participate in production but have not yet participated in production. For example, in three villages in Mishan and Jixi counties in Songjiang Province, there are 19 families of martyrs and military personnel who are able to work, but only 13 people participated in production. In Tianwangsi Township, Xuchang County, Henan Province, there is a family member of a soldier, and the masses are substitute farming for him, but he is idle. Even individual families of martyrs and military personnel do not engage in production at all, selling land and living off their assets. The main reason why families of martyrs and military personnel who are able to produce and have production conditions have not fully participated in production is that some working cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity of organizing families of martyrs and military personnel to participate in production, and have not seriously carried out education on the glory of labor for them, and helped them solve the difficulties in production.

Secondly, there are still some unreasonable phenomena in the substitute farming work. In some areas, the substitute farming area is still too wide or too narrow, resulting in some families of martyrs and military personnel who should enjoy substitute farming failing to enjoy it. In terms of bearing substitute farming duties, some places do not have complete workdays, do not keep accounts, and are in arrears for a long time, causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

Thirdly, the form of combining substitute farming with mutual aid and cooperation organizations has not yet attracted universal attention in various localities, and many cadres do not understand the benefits and necessity of doing so. Some people regard "fixed substitute farming" as a "fixed and unchangeable" form. In some places, mutual aid and cooperation organizations overlap with substitute farming organizations, causing contradictions in production.

Based on the above situation, in the future preferential treatment work, all localities must, in accordance with the spirit of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, earnestly mobilize and organize families of martyrs and military personnel to engage in labor production on the basis of the 1953 preferential treatment work, help them solve their production difficulties, and gradually establish their own households to achieve self-sufficiency in production; in particular, they must guide families of martyrs and military personnel to take the road of organization along with the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In addition, all localities should further rectify substitute farming organizations during the Spring Festival, mobilize the masses to earnestly do a good job in substitute farming, and combine it with mutual aid and cooperation organizations to ensure the output of substitute farmed land this year.

    一九五三年组织烈属、军属参加农业生产和代耕工作的情况和问题
    中央人民政府内务部优抚司
    一九五三年的农村优抚工作获得了很大的成绩。各地更加重视了组织烈属、军属参加农业和副业生产。特别是在互助合作组织有基础的地区，大都注意了教育和组织烈属、军属参加互助合作组织。河北省一九五三年把整顿代耕的过程当作组织烈属、军属参加生产的过程，收到了一定的成效。据邯郸、鸡泽等四个县的统计，烈属、军属参加互助合作组织的已由一九五二年的百分之五十增至百分之七十以上。西北区一九五三年根据新区、老区的不同情况，对新区烈属、军属着重加强“劳动光荣”的教育，吸收他们入组、入社生产；对缺乏生产资料的老区烈属、军属，则有重点地帮助他们解决耕畜、农具等困难，因而参加生产的不断增多。据陕西、甘肃、宁夏等省部分地区的调查，烈属、军属参加互助合作组织的已达百分之六十左右。甘肃省不少地区的烈属、军属参加生产和互助合作组织后，生产积极性大大提高，不仅解决了他们生产中劳动力不足的困难，且能以剩余劳力进行编草帽、挖甘草等副业生产。各地有许多烈属、军属已成为生产积极分子和劳动模范。
    许多地区有目的地使用了优抚事业费，把优抚事业费集中使用于帮助烈属、军属建立家务。东北和西北地区在这方面做出很大成绩。东北区去年集中抽出优抚事业费五百六十亿元帮助烈属、军属生产和建立家务。很多烈属、军属添车买马改善了生活和生产条件，自动谢绝了代耕和实物补助。据甘肃省西固、环县等十县统计，政府用优抚事业费帮助三千九百八十九户贫苦烈属、军属建立了家务，占烈属、军属总数的百分之三十八强。宁夏省盐池县由于集中使用优抚事业费，使百分之七十的烈、军属都建立了家务。经验证明，凡是不这样做的地区，政府虽然发放很多款项，贫困烈属、军属的生活困难仍不能获得完满解决。
    代耕工作中的某些不合理现象在去年得到进一步的纠正，使享受代耕与负担代耕的状况更趋合理。一九五二年，陕西全省烈属、军属土地代耕面达百分之四十左右，去年纠正了部分地区存在的烈属、军属、工属倒置、应代耕而未代耕、不应代耕反而代耕等不合理现象，使全省代耕面平均降低到百分之二十五左右。由于代耕面的适当缩小，不但减轻了群众的负担，且使真正缺乏劳动力而又贫苦的烈属、军属的土地，受到切实的照顾。凡是经过整顿的地区，一般负担勤务的劳动力已扩大到总劳动力的百分之八十五左右，个别区、乡扩大到百分之九十以上，纠正了过去把代耕负担集中在部分农民身上的偏向。如河南省沁阳县一九五二年免勤面很大，每村上至村长下至组长免勤者多达八十余人，少者三十余人，群众每个劳力平均负担六个工，经过整顿，每个劳力只负担二点二个工。
    代耕组织形式在去年也有了进一步的提高。凡是互助合作组织基础较好的地区，代耕与互助合作组织相结合的代耕办法已成为基本的组织形式。黑龙江省去年代耕地约有百分之八十是生产互助组代耕的。河北省宣化等七县由互助组、合作社代耕的达百分之七十左右。江西省也有半数以上的县开始重点推行这一办法。福建省适应山区土地分散的特点，采取了分块分丘的包耕办法，即烈属、军属代耕土地较分散的，由几个互助组分块包耕。这一方式受到群众的欢迎。由于代耕组织形式的改进和提高，就更好地发挥了集体的力量，进一步健全了代耕制度和加强了代耕者的责任心。大部地区的代耕农民都订立了代耕计划和代耕公约，做到“先军属后自己”。这些地区被代耕的土地因而能精耕细作、多打粮食，烈属、军属的生活也得到改善。与改进代耕组织形式同时，有些地区清理了代耕工资。河北、山西两省去年实行“以劳力代耕为主，结合全省财力调剂”的代耕方法，基本上纠正了地区间代耕负担畸轻畸重的现象。
    许多地区把优抚工作作为整个农业生产工作中一部分，与生产工作同时布置和检查，使优抚工作变成了经常性的工作。山东省沂水县十一区人民政府每逢布置、检查、总结农业生产工作时，就同时布置、检查、总结代耕工作。四川省武胜、岳池、营山等县在交代秋季生产政策时，也同时交代代耕政策；检查秋耕秋种和评定秋征减免，也同时检查烈属、军属的生产和代耕情况；评选农业劳动模范时，也评选烈属、军属生产模范和优属代耕模范。有些地区更把代耕工作作为区、乡干部会议的内容之一。这样就保证了代耕地能够及时地耕种收割，并能及时地纠正代耕工作中的缺点。河北省涉县在检查中发现有一百多户烈属、军属的土地应代耕而未代耕，即根据实际需要作了两次调整。北京市海淀区在“八一”建军节时采取了联合检查组（由附近两三个乡联合组成）的办法检查代耕工作，工作人员到军属、群众、代耕组的地里察看庄稼，评比、观摩代耕的好坏，对于推动优抚工作发生很大作用。
    但一九五三年的农村优抚工作还存在着不少问题，需要在今后加以解决。首先是还有不少能够参加生产的烈属、军属还没有参加生产。如松江省密山、鸡西两县三个村有十九个能够劳动的烈属、军属，只有十三人参加了生产。河南省许昌县天王寺乡有一个军属，群众给他代耕，他自己却游手好闲。甚至有个别烈属、军属根本不事生产，出卖土地坐吃山空。能够生产和有生产条件的烈属、军属所以没有全部参加生产的主要原因，是有些工作干部对组织烈属、军属参加生产的必要性认识不足，没有认真对他们进行劳动光荣的教育，和帮助他们解决生产上的困难。
    其次，代耕工作中还存在着一些不合理的现象。某些地区代耕面仍有过宽或过窄的偏向，致有的应该享受代耕的烈属、军属未能享受。在负担代耕勤务方面，有些地方不齐工、不算账、拖欠甚久，招致群众不满。
    第三，代耕与互助合作组织相结合的形式，还没有引起各地普遍重视，许多干部还不明白这样作的好处与必要。有些人把“固定代耕”看成“固定不变”的形式。有的地方互助合作组织与代耕组织重叠，在生产上发生矛盾。
    根据上述情况，各地在今后的优抚工作中，必须按照第二次全国民政会议的精神，在一九五三年优抚工作的基础上认真发动和组织烈属、军属从事劳动生产，帮助他们解决在生产上的困难，使其逐步建立家务，达到生产自给；特别是要随着互助合作组织的发展，引导烈属、军属走组织起来的道路。此外，各地应该在春节期间进一步整顿代耕组织，发动群众切实做好代耕工作，并使之与互助合作组织相结合，以保证今年代耕的土地的产量。
