The Relationship Between Exporting Native and Special Products and National Industrialization
Zhang Weiqi, Hu Ming

Currently, the entire nation is striving to achieve the great task of national socialist industrialization. To gradually realize national socialist industrialization, it is essential to develop heavy industry. However, due to our country's relatively backward economy, we cannot yet manufacture many modern industrial equipment and various heavy and precision machines ourselves. We must first import them from abroad, especially from fraternal countries. To import, we must organize exports. For example, the Soviet Union is helping our country build and renovate 141 large-scale projects, including iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, oil processing plants, machine manufacturing factories, automobile factories, tractor manufacturing factories, power stations, etc. The equipment for these factories and mines is obtained through trade, in exchange for our country's agricultural products, native and special products, and mineral products. Therefore, developing state-owned foreign trade and fulfilling the state's import and export plans play a significant role in promoting the realization of national socialist industrialization.

Our country has many types of commodities available for export, and many sell well in the international market. Just to look at the value of a few exported native and special products:

Exporting one ton of tea can be exchanged for ten tons of thick steel plates. Exporting one ton of sunflower seeds can be exchanged for two tons of fertilizer. One ton of pork can be exchanged for five tons of thick steel plates. Ten tons of pork can be exchanged for a tractor. Nineteen tons of oranges can be exchanged for a truck with a carrying capacity of 12,000 catties. More than two thousand catties of dried eggs (dried egg powder made from fresh eggs) can be exchanged for 60,000 catties of gasoline. More than 19,000 tons of peanuts can be exchanged for a thermal power plant with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts, capable of supplying electricity to a city of 800,000 to 1.2 million people. More than 10,000 tons of flue-cured tobacco can be exchanged for a complete set of machinery and equipment of the same scale as the seamless steel tube plant of Anshan Iron and Steel (excluding domestic basic construction, civil engineering, etc.). One ton of raw silk can be exchanged for steel rails to lay one kilometer of track. Exporting more than 500 tons of raw silk can exchange for enough steel rails to lay a railway as long as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.

From this, we can understand the close relationship between exports and national industrialization: exporting is to ensure importing; more exports mean more imports, fewer exports mean fewer imports, and no exports mean no imports. To ensure the gradual realization of national industrialization and the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to ensure the timely import of various machines, industrial raw materials, and complete sets of equipment. To this end, we should, based on the principle of combining domestic and foreign sales and overall consideration, strive to complete export tasks while appropriately meeting the needs of the domestic people. Comrade Stalin taught: "We cannot say, as in the old days: 'Even if we don't have enough to eat ourselves, we must export.' We cannot say this, because workers and peasants must eat like human beings, and we fully support them in this. But we can still, without harming the people's consumption, take all measures to increase our country's exports so that the state can maintain a certain foreign exchange reserve" (Report on the Work of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to Activists of the Leningrad Party Organization on April 13, 1926, Concerning the Soviet Economic Situation and the Party's Policies). To implement the principle of combining domestic and foreign sales, for commodities that are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, in addition to actively and systematically increasing production and appropriately supplying domestic needs, we must also try every means to squeeze out a portion for export; for commodities that are of lesser importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, we should actively organize exports; for some commodities (such as meat and peanuts), domestic consumption can be appropriately reduced to meet export needs. Failure to actively improve work and organize exports will hinder our industrial construction. However, on the other hand, if we only care about foreign sales and ignore domestic sales, affecting the domestic market supply, it would also be incorrect, so we must take overall consideration.

Looking at several products exported by our country in 1953, the proportion of exports to production is not large, and increasing exports is definitely possible. According to statistics, the export of frozen pork in 1953 accounted for only 1.52% of the total number of pigs raised nationwide throughout the year, and 2.15% of the total slaughter volume (i.e., the amount available for consumption); egg exports accounted for approximately 7% of the total annual output nationwide; flue-cured tobacco exports were relatively high, but they only accounted for 18.71% of the total annual production. Furthermore, the export of many products such as silk, tea, and peanuts has not yet exceeded pre-war export levels, and some are still far behind.

In order to gradually realize national socialist industrialization, it is necessary to promote the relationship between import and export and national industrialization to the broad masses, and educate the masses to actively increase production, improve quality, and sell surplus products to the state according to the state's plan. This is consistent with the current and long-term interests of the masses, and it is beneficial to both individuals and the country. Just a few calculations can illustrate this point. In 1953, the gross pigs sold by farmers to state-owned companies were worth approximately 18 trillion yuan, the eggs sold to state-owned companies were worth approximately 460 billion yuan, and the fruits sold to state-owned companies (only calculating apples, oranges, and bananas) were worth approximately 190 billion yuan (the purchases by local state-owned companies and cooperatives are not included). The increase in income for farmers has a great impact on improving their lives and developing production. However, if we do not pay attention to systematically increasing production and do not mobilize the masses to sell their products to the state, many valuable things will be consumed piecemeal, not only reducing the income of the masses but also reducing the source of exports for the state, thus affecting the completion of import tasks, which is very detrimental to the country's industrial construction.

We believe that as long as everyone can actively and systematically lead the masses to increase production, conserve consumption, and do a good job of purchasing at reasonable prices, our country's export sources will not decrease but will continue to increase. At the same time, if we can continuously improve product quality, reduce losses, practice strict economy, and reduce costs in the operational links of purchasing, processing, storage, and transportation, and fully utilize the potential strength of our people, the state's export tasks can certainly be completed, and the various machines, industrial raw materials, and complete sets of equipment needed for national industrialization can certainly be guaranteed for import.

    出口土产特产和国家工业化的关系
    张维奇　胡明
    目前全国人民都在为实现国家社会主义工业化这个伟大的任务而奋斗着。要逐步地实现国家社会主义工业化，就必须发展重工业。但是，由于我国的经济还较落后，许多近代化的工业设备及各种重型的精密的机器自己还不能制造，必须从国外首先由兄弟国家进口。为了进口就必须组织出口，如苏联帮助我国新建与改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，其中包括钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿、石油加工工厂、机器制造厂、汽车厂、拖拉机制造厂、电力站等等，这些厂矿的设备，都是通过贸易方式，用输出我国的农产品、土特产品及矿产品来换取的。因此，发展国营对外贸易、完成国家的进出口计划，对促进国家社会主义工业化的实现，是有重大作用的。
    我国可供出口的商品种类是很多的，不少商品在国际市场上销路很好。仅举几种出口土特产品的价值来看：
    出口一吨茶叶可换十吨厚钢板，出口一吨葵花子能换两吨肥田粉，一吨猪肉可换五吨厚钢板，十吨猪肉可换一部拖拉机，十九吨桔柑可换一部载重一万二千斤的运货汽车，二千多斤干蛋（鲜蛋加工制成的干蛋粉）可换六万斤汽油，一万九千多吨花生仁可换一个容量两万五千瓩，能供应八十万到一百二十万人口城市用电的火力发电厂，一万多吨烤烟可换一个像鞍钢无缝钢管厂同样规模的全套机器设备（不包括国内基本建设施工、土木工程等部分），一吨生丝可换铺一公里长的钢轨，出口五百多吨生丝，换回的钢轨就可铺成一条和成渝铁路一样长的铁路。
    从此，我们就可以了解到出口与国家工业化的密切关系：出口是为了保证进口，多出口就能多进口，少出口就少进口，不出口就不能进口。为了保证国家工业化的逐步实现，保证第一个五年计划的胜利完成，就必须保证各种机器、工业原料及成套设备的及时进口。为此，就应该根据内外销结合、统筹兼顾的原则，在适当满足国内人民需要的条件下，努力完成出口任务。斯大林同志教导过：“我们不能像旧时那样地说：‘自己吃不饱，也得要输出’。我们不能这样说，因为工人和农民要像人样地吃饭，而我们在这一点上是完全支持他们的。但是我们仍然可以在对人民消费无损的条件下，采取一切办法，使我国输出增加，使国家手中能保持一定的外汇准备金”（论苏联经济状况和党底政策，一九二六年四月十三日给列宁格勒党组织积极分子作的关于联共（布）中央全会工作的报告）。为了实现内外销兼顾的原则，凡对国计民生关系重大的商品，除积极地有计划地进行增产并适当供应国内需要外，还必须想尽一切办法挤出一部分以供出口；凡对国计民生关系较小的商品，应该积极组织出口；有些商品（如肉类、花生），可适当节减国内消费，以满足出口需要。不积极改进工作，不积极组织出口，就会妨碍我们的工业建设。但是，另一方面，如果只顾外销不顾内销，影响国内市场供应，也是不对的，所以要统筹兼顾。
    从一九五三年我国出口的几种产品来看，出口数量占生产量的比重是不大的，增加出口肯定是有可能的。据统计一九五三年出口冻猪肉仅占全年全国养猪量的百分之一点五二，占全年屠宰量（即可供食用量）百分之二点一五；出口鸡蛋约占全国全年产量百分之七点多；出口烤烟比较多，但也只不过占到全年生产量的百分之十八点七一。再如丝绸，茶叶，花生等等许多产品的出口，都还没有超过战前的出口数量，其中有的还相差很远。
    为了逐步地实现国家社会主义工业化，必须向广大群众宣传进出口与国家工业化的关系，教育群众要按照国家的计划积极地增加生产，改进品质，并把多余产品卖给国家。这对群众的目前利益和长远利益是一致的，对个人和对国家都有好处。只算几笔账就可说明这个道理。在一九五三年全国农民卖给国营公司的毛猪约值一万八千多亿元，卖给国营公司的鸡蛋约值四千六百多亿元，卖给国营公司的水果（只计算苹果、橘柑、香蕉三种）约值一千九百多亿元（地方国营公司及合作社收购数未计算在内），农民增加这么多收入，对生活上的改善与生产的发展是有很大作用的。但是，如果不注意有计划地增加生产，不动员群众将产品卖给国家，许多宝贵的东西就会被零零星星的消耗掉，不但使群众减少了收入，也使国家减少出口货源，以致影响进口任务的完成，对祖国工业建设是非常不利的。
    我们相信，只要大家能积极地、有计划地领导群众增加生产、节约消耗，并按合理价格作好收购工作，我国的出口货源是不会减少而会不断增多的。同时，在收购、加工、储运等经营环节中，如能不断地提高产品质量，减少损耗，厉行节约，降低成本，充分地发挥我国人民的潜在力量，国家的出口任务一定可以完成，国家工业化所需要的各种机器、工业原料及成套设备，也一定可以保证进口。
