    Developing Fish Farming in Waters Under the Jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality

    Editor's Note: In October 1953, this newspaper received letters from Beijing readers Lu Fu, Fan Yihua, and others, suggesting the development of fish farming in Beijing. We studied these letters and believed that the readers' suggestions were worthy of attention, so we contacted the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and jointly conducted an investigation. After inquiring with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, the Garden Management Office, the Administration of Industry and Commerce, and farmers who originally had the habit of raising fish, it was proven that developing freshwater fish farming in the waters under the jurisdiction of Beijing Municipality is not only urgently needed to solve the current fish supply problem in the city, but also has sufficient conditions in terms of water surface area. Now we are publishing the two letters from the readers and the joint investigation results of this newspaper and the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture. We hope that the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry will take effective measures to develop fish farming in the city's waters to meet the needs of the citizens.

    Reader Lu Fu's Letter

    Reader Lu Fu writes: I work in the Market Management Section of the Beijing Municipal Administration of Industry and Commerce. Citizens often reflect to us that fish in Beijing is too expensive, even more expensive than a pound of pork. Indeed, in Beijing, fresh fish has almost become a precious food. On the one hand, this is because the living standards of the broad masses of people are constantly improving, and the sales volume of fish is increasing daily. On the other hand, the main reason is that the vast majority of fish in this city relies on supplies from other places. Private merchants from Hankou, Baotou, Shanghai, and other places transport fish to Beijing, while many lakes and swamps in this city have not been fully utilized, and the fish production is extremely low, unable to play a regulatory role in the market. Therefore, during holidays, many difficulties will arise in the fish supply work and market management work. For example, before the Dragon Boat Festival in 1952, private merchants raised fish prices by almost a quarter; later, fishmongers from other places flocked in after hearing the news, resulting in a sharp drop in fish prices. I suggest that the relevant departments in Beijing Municipality make full use of the waters under their jurisdiction to develop fish farming. This will enable the regular supply of cheaper and fresher fish as a non-staple food for citizens, and also allow for the planned satisfaction of the citizens' increased needs during holidays.

    Reader Fan Yihua's Letter

    Reader Fan Yihua writes: In September 1951, I worked at the former Yenching University Farm. In order to utilize the water surface in the campus, we released about 90,000 fish fry transported from Hankou into a fish fry pond of more than two mu. In 1952, the original Yenching University Farm was transferred to the Xiyuan Ranch of the Beijing Cooperative General Office (later the Xiyuan Ranch was under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry). During this period, I had already left the farm. Because I felt that freshwater fish farming was a nascent production enterprise in Beijing, with small investment, high returns, and broad development prospects, I repeatedly suggested to the Xiyuan Ranch and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry to pay attention to this work. However, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry rejected my suggestions, citing "no technical personnel and management agency for fish farming." Originally, the fish fry in the fish fry pond should have been moved into the large pool on the former Yenching University campus in April 1952, but it was not until August that the former farm workers automatically moved the fish fry in. Last Mid-Autumn Festival, farm workers tried fishing once and harvested 6,000 jin of fresh fish. The large fish weighed up to three jin each, and the small ones weighed more than one jin each. It is estimated that there are still 70,000 to 80,000 fish in the pool. In the past year or so, these fish have only had one fish farming worker who collects some weeds for feeding every day. The fish feed is insufficient, the density is too high, and no one cares about it or solves the problem.

    Developing fish farming can create a large amount of wealth for the country. Taking the above example, the initial investment was only 50 million yuan, and the 6,000 jin of fish caught during the trial fishing last Mid-Autumn Festival sold for 30 million yuan. The value of the existing fish exceeds the investment several times over. At the same time, doing this work well can also supply citizens with a large amount of fresh and delicious fish. I believe that the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry should give sufficient attention to fish farming.

### 利用北京市所辖水面发展养鱼事业

专栏：读者来信摘要

    利用北京市所辖水面发展养鱼事业
    编者按：一九五三年十月，本报收到北京市读者鲁夫、范翊华等的来信，建议在北京市发展养鱼事业。我们研究了这些来信，认为读者的建议是值得重视的，就和中央农业部水产管理总局联系后共同进行了调查。经先后向北京市农林局、园林处、工商管理局等部门及原来有养鱼习惯的农民进行了解，证明在北京市所辖水面发展淡水养鱼业，不但在解决目前市内鱼类供应问题上有迫切需要，而且在水面情况方面也有充分条件。现在我们将读者的两封来信及本报和中央农业部水产管理总局共同调查的结果刊载于后，希望北京市农林局采取有效措施，利用市内水面发展养鱼事业，供应市民需要。
    读者鲁夫的来信
    读者鲁夫来信：我在北京市人民政府工商管理局市场管理科工作。市民经常向我们反映，北京市的鱼太贵了，比一斤猪肉价还高。的确，在北京，鲜鱼简直已成为一种珍贵的食品。这一方面是因为广大人民生活水平不断提高，鱼类销售量逐日增长。另一方面，主要原因还是本市鱼类绝大部分依靠外地供应，汉口、包头、上海等地私商都向北京贩运鱼类，而本市许多湖沼没有被充分利用，产鱼量极少，不能在市场起调剂作用。因此，逢年过节时，鱼类的供应工作及市场管理工作都会发生许多困难。像一九五二年端午节前，私商抬高鱼价几乎达四分之一；以后外地鱼贩闻讯蜂拥而来，又造成鱼价暴跌的情况。我建议北京市有关部门充分利用所辖水面，发展养鱼事业。这样就可以经常供应市民更廉价更鲜美的鱼类副食，也能在过节时有计划地满足市民骤增的需要。
    读者范翊华的来信
    读者范翊华来信：一九五一年九月，我在前燕京大学农场工作。为了利用校园中的水面，我们把从汉口运来的约九万尾鱼苗放养在一个二亩多大的鱼苗池中。一九五二年，原燕京大学农场移交给北京市合作总社西苑牧场（后西苑牧场改属北京市农林局领导）。在这期间，我已离开该场。因为我觉得淡水养鱼在北京是一个新生的生产事业，投资小、收益大，有广阔的发展前途，就屡次向西苑牧场和北京市农林局建议注意这一工作。但是，北京市农林局却以“没有养鱼的技术人才及主管机构”为词，对我的建议置之不理。本来鱼苗池中的鱼苗应在一九五二年四月移入前燕京大学校园大水池中，但迟至八月，才由原农场工人自动把鱼苗迁入。去年中秋节，农场工人试捕一次，即获鲜鱼六千斤，大鱼每尾达三斤，小的每尾也有一斤多。估计池中现存鱼类仍有七、八万尾。这些鱼类在最近一年多，只有一个养鱼工人每天搜集些杂草饲养。鱼的饲料不够，密度太大，都没有人过问和解决。
    发展养鱼事业，可以为国家创造大量财富。就拿上面所说的例子来看，开始时投资只五千万元，去年中秋节试捕的六千斤鱼就卖了三千万元，现存鱼类的价值更超过投资数的数倍。同时，做好这个工作又能给市民供应大量鲜美的鱼类。我认为北京市农林局应该对养鱼业给予足够的重视。
