    Eighty State-Owned and Locally State-Owned Factories in Tianjin Complete and Exceed January Production Plans
    Eighty state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Tianjin have completed and exceeded their January production plans. Among them, Tianjin Steel Plant completed 100.7% of its plan, Tianjin Bicycle Factory completed 106.07% of its plan, and Tianjin Paper Mill completed 113.66% of its plan. All factories under the North China Textile Administration Bureau exceeded their plans. Cotton yarn, calculated by equivalent value, completed 101.36% of the plan, and cotton cloth completed 100.02%. Among the 160 products of the factories under the Local Industry Bureau, 132 products completed and exceeded their January production plans. The completion of state-owned and locally state-owned industrial plans in Tianjin in January was better than the best performance in December of last year.
    The quality of products in various factories has also greatly improved. According to statistics from the Local Industry Bureau on 110 major products, 88 products met the national product quality standards. Many factories have completed their production plans on a daily basis, achieving balanced production.
    The reason why state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Tianjin have been able to complete their plans so well is mainly because they have carried out the general line education more extensively and deeply, and the workers' consciousness has been raised. In previous years, the attendance rate would decrease compared to usual around the New Year and Spring Festival; this year, the attendance rate of each factory in January has greatly increased. For example, the Textile Machinery Factory reached 97.58%, and the Textile Factory No. 1 reached 96.18%. Due to the increased awareness and high enthusiasm for labor among employees after studying the general line, many factories made more adequate preparations for this year's January production before the new year. Many factories also thoroughly overhauled their machines and strengthened inspection during the production process. Employees of the local state-owned Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory also established a daily inspection system, which effectively guaranteed the completion and exceeding of national production plans on a daily and balanced basis.

    天津市八十个国营和地方国营工厂
    完成和超额完成一月份生产计划
    天津市八十个国营、地方国营工厂，完成和超额完成一月份生产计划。其中天津钢厂完成计划百分之一百点七，天津自行车厂完成计划百分之一零六点零七，天津造纸厂完成计划百分之一一三点六六。华北纺织管理局所属各厂，都超额完成了计划，棉纱按折合值数完成计划百分之一零一点三六，棉布完成百分之一零零点零二。地方工业局所属各厂的一六零种产品，有一三二种产品完成和超额完成了一月份的生产计划。天津市国营和地方国营工业一月份完成计划的情况，都比去年完成国家计划最好的十二月份为好。
    各厂产品质量也大有提高。据地方工业局的一一零种主要产品统计，有八十八种产品完成国家产品质量指标。有不少工厂按日完成了生产计划，达到均衡生产。
    天津市国营、地方国营工厂所以能够这样好的完成计划，主要是因为较广泛深入地进行了总路线的教育，工人觉悟提高了。往年，每到新年和春节前后，出勤率就比平常降低；今年一月份各厂的出勤率都大大提高了。如纺织机械厂达到百分之九十七点五八，纺织一厂达到九六点一八。由于学习总路线后，职工觉悟提高，劳动积极性高涨，许多工厂在年前都对今年一月份的生产作了较充分的准备工作，好多厂还比较彻底地检修了机器，且在生产过程中加强了检查工作。地方国营的天津印染厂职工，还建立了每天检查制度，有力地保证了按日地、均衡地完成和超额完成国家生产计划。　（石英）
