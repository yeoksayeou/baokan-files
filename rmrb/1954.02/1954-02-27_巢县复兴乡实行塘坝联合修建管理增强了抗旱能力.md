How Joint Construction and Management Developed

    Fuxing Township, in Zhongmiao District of Chao County, Anhui Province, is located near the northern shore of Chaohu Lake, with undulating hilly terrain. The farmland is ten to twenty or thirty meters above Chaohu Lake. The township consists of four administrative villages: Zhangbei, Junliu, Shanhua, and Tongyin. The total cultivated land area of the township is 7,185 mu, of which 4,200 mu are paddy fields (including 2,298 mu of double-cropping rice and wheat fields), accounting for slightly more than 58% of the total cultivated land area. Paddy field irrigation is mainly based on ponds and dams. There are a total of 122 ponds and dams of various sizes in the township, but most have been in disrepair for years. Small ponds are filled with silt, and large ponds are shallow. The average water storage capacity of all ponds is only enough for about two irrigations. However, all paddy fields, after transplanting seedlings, require seven or eight irrigations to achieve a harvest if there is no rain. In the past, under the circumstance of a lack of unified management of ponds and dams, water grabbing and competition occurred whenever there was a drought, increasing water consumption. At the same time, the masses here lacked unified organization in the past, so even when repairing ponds, the labor force was dispersed, large ponds could not be dug deeper, and small ponds could not be expanded. In recent years, although construction has been carried out under the strong leadership of the government, due to the long-term disrepair of the ponds and dams, the projects were large but the manpower was small, and the results were not significant.

    Due to the disrepair of water conservancy, from 1950 to 1952, most villages in the township suffered droughts of varying degrees every year. Moreover, due to three consecutive years of water hauling for drought resistance, many farmers were exhausted. For example, in Zhangbei Village, as many as 80% of poor farmers had to sell quilts for food in 1951 due to drought resistance. However, Liujiatuan Village in the township, because some ponds and dams implemented joint construction management and unified water use, overcame the drought and guaranteed a good harvest. This made many farmers deeply realize that "drought resistance is not as good as repairing ponds" and "praying to heaven is not as good as digging the ground."

    During the winter repair in 1952, the masses in the township, because of the drought resistance experience of the past three years, coupled with the in-depth mobilization of cadres, universally established joint pond and dam construction and management organizations in the township. By the winter of 1953, 101 out of 122 ponds and dams in the township had been joined together to form 29 joint construction and management offices. The joint construction and management office is elected by the beneficiary households, including a director, a deputy director, and several members in charge of planning, work evaluation and recording, hoeing, and inspection. The work evaluation and recording member is responsible for allocating labor, evaluating work points, and settling work accounts. The hoeing member is responsible for water release and storage, etc. The inspection member is responsible for inspecting whether labor contribution, construction, and water use are reasonable. The construction and management office also has grassroots organizations of beneficiary households. Each joint construction and management office manages a minimum of three or four ponds and a maximum of more than a dozen ponds. Each joint construction and management office manages the irrigation of a minimum of thirty or forty mu of farmland, and a maximum of more than four hundred mu, with a total area of 2,810.8 mu, accounting for slightly more than 66% of the paddy field area of the township. There are 892 joint pond households, accounting for 72.5% of the total number of farm households in the township.

    Burden Sharing Methods and Water Use System in Joint Construction Management

    I. The burden sharing method is based on the benefited farmland area. If the benefits are not significantly different, labor is contributed equally per mu. If the benefits are larger, the labor must be doubled in the first year of participating in joint construction management according to the actual situation. Labor for dry land water use is reduced by half. Revolutionary armymen, families of martyrs, and widowed and lonely poor farmers who lack labor are given appropriate care after discussion and agreement by the masses based on their actual ability to bear. In order to save pond water, water hauling from Chaohu Lake for drought resistance, or water hauling from bottom ponds or idle water to irrigate fields in order to regulate water use, the labor required for these water haulings is contributed by the beneficiary households of the joint construction management office per mu. The evaluation of work points for labor is mainly based on flexible evaluation rather than fixed evaluation (based on the strength of the labor), and a day's work for cattle is generally equivalent to one day's work for a person, and a waterwheel is counted as one day's work. If a household is unable to contribute the number of workdays they are supposed to due to a large number of workdays, those participating in mutual aid teams will have the mutual aid team contribute the labor on their behalf, and they will repay the labor within the team later. Single households can also voluntarily combine mutual aid to contribute labor on each other's behalf, and make up for the work or pay later. The wage standard for pond work is generally calculated according to the idle labor standard within the mutual aid team, with a wage of four jin of rice per workday.

    II. The water use system is basically a dedicated water release system. The water release within each repair and management office is the responsibility of the hoeing member. The water volume of each pond is uniformly adjusted, with low-lying ponds being released first, followed by high-lying ponds. Active water ponds are used first, followed by dead water ponds. The irrigation sequence is generally to irrigate high fields first, followed by low fields. In case of drought, in areas close to Chaohu Lake, the joint construction management office mobilizes all beneficiary households to haul water collectively to irrigate low fields in order to save pond water for irrigating high fields. In areas where water hauling is not possible, if the drought is severe and the pond water is not abundant, the joint construction management office may temporarily convene beneficiary households to discuss the irrigation problem democratically. For example, in Liujiatuan Village, in the summer of 1953, before the rice was bundled, there was no rain, and all but five or six mu of the 130 mu of benefited fields near the pond had been cut off from water. At that time, there was less than two irrigations of water stored in the pond. Fearing that it would not rain after the water was released, and that there would be no water during the rice heading stage, the beneficiaries jointly discussed and unanimously agreed to temporarily not release the water, but to bake the rice fields (the local people are not used to baking fields), and then release the water when the rice is heading to ensure the harvest.

    Advantages of Joint Construction Management

    I. It overcame the difficulty of insufficient labor in decentralized construction and management in the past. For example, the Xiaoyin Pond in Liujiatuan Village had not been renovated for over a hundred years. The pond body was silted and shallow, and the pond dyke had more than ten leaks. In the early days of liberation, only three or four mu of the nineteen mu of benefited fields could be planted with seedlings each year. During the winter repair in 1952, the joint construction management office organized the beneficiary households of this pond and six other ponds, including Xinhua and Xiaoyao, to collectively repair the pond, using more than 1,700 workdays to completely renovate the pond. If the renovation had been carried out solely by the beneficiary households of this pond, then each mu of benefited farmland would have had to contribute 90 workdays, which generally could not be done.

    II. It achieved reasonable water storage and reasonable water use. For example, among the three ponds of the Datang Joint Construction Management Office in Liujiatuan Village, one large pond had a large surface area, but insufficient water sources. Since 1931, it had never been filled with water. However, the two adjacent small ponds, because of large water sources, were small and could not hold the water, and the pond water often overflowed the dykes and flooded the fields. After joint construction management, collection ditches were jointly opened to divert water into the large pond, and the small ponds were also deepened. This increased the water source of the large pond and also expanded the water storage capacity of the small ponds, achieving two benefits at once. In terms of water use, it was able to achieve mutual adjustment and reasonable allocation of water storage, turning the water hauling fields of the past into water releasing fields, and turning the fields that were far from the water supply in the past into nearby fields. At the same time, in order to store more pond water, the fields that could have used pond water but could also use river water were changed to using river water as much as possible.

    III. After joint construction and management, most ponds and dams, due to being deepened and expanded, with increased water volume, and reasonable water use, enhanced drought resistance capacity, and ensured the good harvest of agricultural production in the township. In 1952, the average yield of rice per mu in the township was 451 jin. After the implementation of joint pond and dam construction management, in 1953, the average yield per mu was 563 jin. At the same time, the paddy field area of the township also expanded. In Liujiatuan Village, the total rice planting area in 1951 was 868 mu, and a small number of fields were lost due to lack of water. In 1953, the rice planting area totaled 943 mu, an increase of 9% in the paddy field area in two years. Zhangbei Village also increased its paddy fields by 70 mu.

    巢县复兴乡实行塘坝联合修建管理增强了抗旱能力
    安徽省人民政府农林厅水利局
    联合修建管理是怎样发展的
    安徽省巢县中庙区复兴乡，地近巢湖北岸，地势丘陵起伏，田地高于巢湖十数公尺到二、三十公尺不等。全乡有张北、军刘、山黄、桐荫四个行政村。全乡耕地面积有七千一百八十五亩，其中水稻田四千二百亩（包括稻麦两季的田二千二百九十八亩），占耕地总面积的百分之五十八强。水田灌溉以塘坝为主。全乡共有大小塘坝一百二十二处，但多数年久失修，小塘淤满，大塘淤浅，大小塘蓄水量平均只有两浇水左右；而全部水稻田，在插秧后，如遇天旱不雨，就需要浇灌七、八次才能有收。过去在塘坝缺乏统一管理的情况下，每逢干旱即发生抢水、拼水，增大了水量消耗。同时这里的群众过去因为缺乏统一组织，即使修塘，也因劳力分散，大塘不能挖深，小塘无法扩大。近几年来，虽在政府大力领导下进行兴修，但由于塘坝年久失修，工程大而人力少，收效不大。
    由于水利失修，自一九五○年到一九五二年的三年中，该乡大部分村每年都遭受了轻重不同的旱灾，而且由于连续三年的车水抗旱，不少农民被累得筋疲力竭，如张北村的贫苦农民，在一九五一年因抗旱卖被絮糊口的就达百分之八十。可是该乡的刘家疃村因为有的塘坝实行了联合修建管理和统一用水，战胜了干旱，保证了丰收。这样就使许多农民深深体会到“抗旱不如修塘”、“求天不如掘地”。
    一九五二年冬修时，该乡群众因为有了过去三年的抗旱经验，再加上干部的深入动员，该乡的联合修建管理塘坝组织就普遍建立起来了。到一九五三年冬天，全乡一百二十二处塘坝中，已有一百零一处联合起来，组成了二十九个联合修建管理处。联合修建管理处是由受益户选举正副主任和计划、评工记工、执锹、检查等委员数人，评工记工委员负责调配劳力，评工记分，及结清工账。执锹委员负责放水蓄水等事项；检查委员负责检查出工兴修用水是否合理。修建管理处下面还设有受益户的基层组织。每个联合修建管理处所管的塘坝最少的三、四处、最多的十几处；每个联合修建管理处所管的塘坝灌溉的田亩少的三、四十亩，多的四百多亩，总面积是二千八百一十点八亩，占全乡水稻田面积百分之六十六强。联塘户有八百九十二户，占全乡总农户的百分之七十二点五。
    联合修建管理中的负担办法和用水制度
    一、负担办法是按受益田亩分工。受益相差不大的，按亩平均出工。受益较大的，在参加联合修建管理的第一个年度中，须按实际情况加倍出工。旱地用水减半出工。缺乏劳动力的革命军人、烈士家属及鳏寡孤独等贫苦农民，则根据实际负担能力，经群众讨论同意后，予以适当照顾。为了节省塘水，车巢湖水抗旱，或为了调节用水，车底塘水或闲水灌田的时候，这些车水需要的工，由联合修建管理处受益户按亩负担出工。评工记分劳力以死分活评为主（根据劳力强弱来评），牛工一般一工抵一工，水车用一天算一工。如因负担工数较多，以致出不到应修工数的户，参加互助组的由互助组代为出工，日后在组内还工，单干户也可以自愿结合互助代替出工，日后补工或给资。工资标准，塘工一般是按照互助组内闲工标准计算，每工给工资米四斤。
    二、用水制度基本上是专人负责放水制。每一修管处内放水由执锹委员负责，各塘水量统一调剂，先放低塘水、后放高塘水，先用活水塘，后用死水塘。灌田次序一般是先灌溉高田。后灌溉低田，遇天旱时，靠近巢湖的地区，由联合修建管理处发动各受益户，集体车水，灌溉低田，以节省塘水灌溉高田。在无法车水的地区，如旱情较重，塘水又不多时，可由联合修建管理处临时召集受益户，民主讨论存水的灌溉问题。如刘家疃村大塘，在一九五三年夏季，水稻打包以前，天旱不雨，受益田一百三十亩中除近塘的五、六亩田外，都已断水。当时塘里储存不到二浇水，恐怕放水后不雨，在水稻抽穗时，无水不能收稻，经受益户共同商量，一致主张暂不放水，把水稻田烤一下（该地群众不习惯烤田），待抽穗时再行放水，以保证收成。
    联合修建管理的好处
    一、克服了过去分散修建管理劳力不足的困难。如刘家疃村的小银塘，有百余年未曾翻修，塘身淤浅，塘埂漏洞十余处，解放初期十九亩受益田中每年只有三、四亩田能插秧。一九五二年冬修时，联合修建管理处组织这口塘和新华、小窑等六塘的受益户集体兴修，用了一千七百多工，把这口塘完全翻修好了。如果单由这口塘的受益户兴修，那么每亩受益田便须出九十个工，这样一般是兴修不起来的。
    二、做到了合理蓄水，合理用水。如刘家疃村大塘联合修建管理处的三口塘中，有一口大塘塘面很大，但是水源不足，从一九三一年以来，就没有蓄满过水，但是邻近两口小塘则因水源大，塘小不能容纳，塘水时常漫埂淹田。联合修建管理以后，共同开了可以引水入大塘的集水沟渠，同时也挖深了小塘，这样增加了大塘的水源，也扩大了小塘的蓄水量，一举两得。在用水方面，能够做到相互调剂，合理分配蓄水，使过去的车水田变为放水田，使过去输水距离远的田变为近田。同时为了多积存塘水，把原来可以用塘水也可以用河水的田，改为尽量使用河水。
    三、多数塘坝在联合修建管理以后，由于挖深扩大，水量增加，再加合理用水，增强了抗旱能力，保证了该乡农业生产的丰收。一九五二年全乡每亩稻子平均产四百五十一斤，实行塘坝联合修建管理以后，一九五三年每亩平均收了五百六十三斤。同时全乡水田面积也有扩大，刘家疃村一九五一年栽稻面积共八百六十八亩，还有少数田亩因缺水失收，
  一九五三年栽稻面积共九百四十三亩，两年间扩大水稻面积百分之九。张北村也增加水稻田七十亩。
