Cultural Briefs:

The East China People's Fine Arts Publishing House and New Fine Arts Publishing House recently published sixty-nine kinds of propaganda paintings, comic strips, wall charts, and photo collections related to the General Line, with a total print run of more than 2.25 million copies, which have now been distributed throughout the country.

Many of these works are relatively good, such as the propaganda paintings "Harvest Carefully and Obtain More Grain" created by Zhao Yannian, a Shanghai art worker, and "Increase Production and Practice Economy, Starting with Major Aspects and Minor Details" created by Ding Hao; the photo collection "Chen Yongkang Mutual Aid Group" taken by Zhu Ke and others from the Fine Arts Studio of the Jiangsu Provincial Culture Bureau after immersing themselves in the rural life of Songjiang County; "The Motherland's First Collective Farm" created by teachers and students of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts; and the comic strip "Old Sun Returns to the Cooperative" created by Yang Zhaolin and others after immersing themselves in the Litianying Agricultural Production Cooperative of Sanliushu, Guangrao County, Shandong Province, all of which have great educational significance.

After these pictures were released, they were welcomed by the broad masses of people. The Shanghai branch of Xinhua Bookstore has successively received letters from cultural departments in Suiyuan, Guangdong, Anhui and other places ordering them. Many workers in Shanghai who returned to their hometowns for the Spring Festival bought these pictures to take back as gifts for the peasants.

    华东人民美术出版社等大量出版宣传总路线的图画
    华东人民美术出版社和新美术出版社最近出版了六十九种有关总路线的宣传画、连环画、挂图、摄影集，共印行二百二十五万余份，现在已经发行到全国各地。
    这些作品，有许多是较好的，如上海美术工作者赵延年创作的“丰收细打多收粮食”，丁浩创作的“增产节约要从大处着眼小处入手”等宣传画，江苏省文化局美术工作室朱克可等深入松江县农村体验生活后拍摄的“陈永康互助组”摄影集，中央美术学院华东分院师生创作的“祖国第一个集体农庄”，以及杨兆麟等深入山东省广饶县三柳树李田英农业生产合作社后创作的“老孙归社”等连环画，都具有很大的教育意义。
    这些图画发行后，已受到广大人民的欢迎，新华书店上海分店陆续收到绥远、广东、安徽等地文化部门订购的来信。上海很多春节回乡的工人们买了这些图画带回去，作为送给农民的礼物。
