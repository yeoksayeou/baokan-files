Xinhua News Agency, Vientiane, February 17th: The Lao Resistance Government issued a communique on the 16th stating that on February 13th, the Lao People's Liberation Army attacked the French military stronghold of Ban Na, located eight kilometers north of Luang Prabang, the capital of Luang Prabang Province in northern Laos. After a ten-minute battle, the Lao People's Liberation Army annihilated a Lao puppet army paratrooper company and one platoon each of enemy forces belonging to the Foreign Legion and puppet troops composed of Thai ethnic minorities. The Lao People's Liberation Army seized a large quantity of enemy weapons and ammunition. The remaining enemy troops fled in panic, and the Lao People's Liberation Army immediately pursued them, capturing 13 enemy soldiers during the pursuit, including one lieutenant.

In addition, the Lao People's Liberation Army recently annihilated the enemy forces in Borikhane. Borikhane is an important French military stronghold located twenty kilometers north of Bechan, northeast of Vientiane Province in northern Laos.

Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: A military commentator from the Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the 16th, reviewing the significant victories achieved by the Lao People's Liberation Army at the beginning of this year.

The commentator said: Following the great victories achieved in Thakhek and Route 9 in the winter of 1953, the Lao People's Liberation Army has recently achieved brilliant victories in northern and southern Laos. Within five days, the Lao People's Liberation Army annihilated and routed approximately 3,200 enemy troops, including the Second Battalion of the Foreign Legion, and liberated the Nam Ou River basin in northern Laos and the southeastern region of the Bolovens Plateau in southern Laos. Including the areas liberated in the spring and winter of 1953, namely, Sam Neua Province in northern Laos and areas in central Laos, the total area now liberated in Laos is approximately 100,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately one million. These liberated areas, along with the vast liberated areas of Vietnam—the Northwest region of Vietnam and the Fourth and Fifth Interzones of central and northern Vietnam—are now connected. This does not include the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines. Due to the impact of the aforementioned victories, the guerrilla areas are now gradually expanding.

The commentator continued: The victories of the Lao People's Liberation Army at the beginning of this year have isolated the enemy forces entrenched in Phongsaly and Houei Sai Province (i.e., Upper Mekong Province) in northern Laos. Therefore, the enemy in central and southern Laos has had to disperse its troops along long defense lines along Route 13 and the Mekong River. At the same time, in order to cope with this critical situation, the French colonialists have not only been forced to transfer many European, African, and Foreign Legion mobile units from North and South Vietnam to Laos, but also hurriedly sent many Vietnamese and Cambodian puppet troops to Laos, including the 3rd Paratrooper Battalion of the Vietnamese puppet army, the 17th Battalion of the Vietnamese puppet army, and the 2nd Battalion of the Cambodian puppet army.

The commentator pointed out: In the future, the enemy will intensify the expansion of the Lao and Cambodian puppet armies and retake important areas and transportation lines. However, we firmly believe that the Lao army and people will continue to expand their victories.

The commentator concluded by saying that the victory of the Lao people is also the victory of the Vietnamese and Cambodian people. Because the Lao army and people have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy and tied down more than twenty enemy mobile battalions, providing favorable conditions for the Vietnamese and Cambodian armies and people to annihilate the enemy.

    寮国解放军在北部主动出击连续获得胜利
    寮国百万人口、十万平方公里国土已获解放
     【新华社十七日讯】据越南通讯社寮国讯：寮国抗战政府十六日发表公报说，二月十三日，寮国人民解放军攻击位于寮国北部琅勃剌邦省省会以北八公里的法军据点邦那。经过十分钟战斗，寮国人民解放军歼灭寮国伪军伞兵一个连以及属于外籍军团的敌军和由泰族少数民族组成的伪军各一排；缴获敌军大量武器和弹药。残敌仓皇逃窜，寮国人民解放军立即跟踪追击；在追击中俘掳敌军十三名，其中包括中尉一名。
      另外，寮国人民解放军最近歼灭了博里克汉的敌军。博里克汉是位于寮国北部万象省东北部的北汕以北二十公里的一个法军重要据点。
       【新华社十七日讯】越南通讯社军事评论员十六日发表评论，评述寮国人民解放军今年年初所取得的重大胜利。
    评论员说：寮国人民解放军继一九五三年冬季在他曲和第九号公路取得巨大战绩后，最近又在寮国北部和南部取得了辉煌的胜利。寮国人民解放军在五天内共歼灭和击溃了约三千二百名敌军，其中包括外籍军团第二营；解放了寮国北部南乌江流域和寮国南部波罗芬高原的东南部地区。加上一九五三年春季和冬季所解放的寮国北部桑怒省和寮国中部的地区在内，寮国全国现在已经解放的地区共约十万平方公里，人口约一百万。这些已获解放的地区与越南广大的解放区——越南西北地区以及中越的第四和第五联区，已经连成一片。这还不包括敌后的游击区。由于上述胜利的影响，游击区现在也逐渐扩大了。
    评论员接着说：寮国人民解放军今年年初的胜利，已使盘踞在寮国北部封萨里和会晒省（即上湄公省）的敌军陷于孤立了。因此，寮国中部和南部的敌人不得不把军队分散在沿着第十三号公路和湄公河的很长的防线上。同时，法国殖民者为了应付这个危急的局面，不仅被迫从北越和南越抽调许多欧非籍机动部队调往寮国，而且还匆匆派了许多越南和高棉的伪军到寮国去，其中有越南伪军第三伞兵营、越南伪军第十七营和高棉伪军第二营等。
    评论员指出：今后敌人还会加紧扩充寮国和高棉的伪军，重新夺取重要地区和交通线。但是，我们坚信，寮国军民将会继续扩大他们的胜利。
    评论员最后说，寮国人民的胜利也是越南和高棉人民的胜利。因为寮国军民使敌军蒙受惨重的损失，并牵制住二十多个敌军机动营，为越南和高棉军民提供了有利的歼敌条件。
