Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 5th: According to TASS, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), at its meeting, unanimously passed a resolution on the government statement made by Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl. The resolution states: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic fully supports the memorandum of the government of the German Democratic Republic to the four foreign ministers on January 30, 1954, and unanimously supports the statement made by Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl at the People's Chamber meeting on February 3, 1954, regarding issues related to the German question discussed at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

The resolution states that the People's Chamber supports the proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic, advocating that German representatives participate in discussions on all issues related to the German question, and believes that the participation of German representatives in the entire process of negotiations on the German question is necessary. In view of the fact that the entire German people are very concerned about disarmament, the People's Chamber supports the following proposal: to convene a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China, the country with the largest population in the world, to ease international tensions and limit armaments.

The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic declares: The conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is the main desire of the German people. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic believes that the Bonn and Paris Treaties signed by the Adenauer government hinder the peaceful resolution of the German question. Therefore, the People's Chamber supports the proposal of the government of the German Democratic Republic to hold a nationwide referendum on the Bonn and Paris military treaties throughout Germany. The resolution points out that the specific plan for concluding a peace treaty with Germany proposed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference fully conforms to the national interests of the German people in all respects. The People's Chamber expresses its sincerest gratitude to the Soviet government for its strong support for the German people's struggle for peace, unity, and freedom.

    民主德国人民议院赞成举行全德公民投票
   【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林四日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院会议就奥托·格罗提渥总理所作的政府声明一致通过一项决议，决议指出：德意志民主共和国人民议院完全拥护德意志民主共和国政府一九五四年一月三十日致四国外长的备忘录，同时一致拥护奥托·格罗提渥总理一九五四年二月三日在人民议院会议上所作的德意志民主共和国政府关于与柏林四外长会议上所讨论的德国问题有关的问题的声明。
    决议说，人民议院拥护德意志民主共和国政府的主张，主张德国代表参与讨论一切与德国问题有关的问题，并认为德国代表参加德国问题商谈的整个过程是必要的。鉴于全德国人民都十分关心裁减军备，人民议院拥护下列建议：召开有世界上人口最多的国家中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议，以缓和国际紧张局势和限制军备。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院声明：缔结对德和约是德国人民的主要愿望。德意志民主共和国人民议院认为：阿登纳政府所签订的波恩与巴黎条约阻挠着德国问题的和平解决。因此人民议院拥护德意志民主共和国政府关于在全德对波恩与巴黎军事条约进行全民投票的建议。决议指出，苏联外长莫洛托夫在四外长会议上提出的关于缔结对德和约的具体计划，在各方面都是符合德国人民的民族利益的。人民议院对苏联政府这样大力支持德国人民争取和平、统一与自由的斗争表示最真挚的谢意。
