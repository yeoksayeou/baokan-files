    Zhuxi Township, Yandun District, Feixi County, Anhui Province, powered by the general line propaganda, successfully completed the basic-level elections, and many leaders and core members of mutual aid teams were elected as people's representatives. Through the election, the basic-level government has been further consolidated, the people's political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have been greatly enhanced, providing many favorable conditions for further implementing the general line.

    In December of last year, Zhuxi Township carried out propaganda on the general line of the state during the transition period. Through propaganda, cadres and the masses initially recognized the bright future of socialist society and the great significance of carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture, and sold surplus grain to the state to support national construction. The election work was launched on the basis of carrying out the general line propaganda and raising the political awareness of the masses. After the election work began, the leading cadres of the township, due to a clear understanding of the relationship between the general election and the general line, continued to publicize and implement the general line on the basis of the achievements already made in the general line propaganda, and organically combined this propaganda with each step of the election work, making it a driving force for promoting the election work. For example, in the general election propaganda, in addition to explaining to the masses the great significance of the general election and its relationship to the people's vital interests, it was also particularly emphasized that doing a good job in the election and further consolidating the people's democratic power would have a significant impact on national construction; in the population census and voter registration, on the one hand, the methods of investigation and registration and the issues that should be paid attention to were explained, and various specific organizational tasks were carried out, and on the other hand, it was also explained that a population census could indeed enable the country to carry out construction in a more planned way; in the stage of deliberation and discussion of representative candidates, "being able to take the lead and willing to take the socialist road" was taken as an important condition for representatives, and voters were guided to conduct serious and responsible discussions; when convening the election meeting, a resounding slogan was put forward: "Actively participate in the election meeting to elect representatives who are satisfactory to ourselves and take the lead in taking the socialist road," which inspired the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the election.

    Under the encouragement of the general election's democratic education and the general line propaganda, the political enthusiasm of the masses in the township has been significantly improved. In order to elect good representatives to lead the people to a happy and prosperous socialist society as soon as possible, the voters actively and enthusiastically participated in various election activities. During the general election propaganda, the weather was severely cold, with continuous cloudy and rainy days, and the roads were muddy, but many grass-roots cadres disregarded these difficulties and often used their spare time at night to carry out propaganda to the masses. When the election meeting was convened, the enthusiasm of the masses was even higher. The vast majority of voters attended the election meeting with excitement and exercised their solemn electoral rights. Wu Xuebing, a blind man in his sixties from the Zhuxi constituency, rarely left his house on weekdays, but on the day of the election meeting, he was led to the venue early in the morning. Many voters in the Lidian constituency had finished the rice they had made the night before and arrived at the venue early to wait for the election. In the election, outstanding Communist Party members and activists in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and in the general line propaganda were unanimously trusted and loved by the voters. Among the thirty-five people's representatives elected in the township, apart from three township cadres who were detached from production, thirteen were mutual aid team leaders, and the rest were mostly core members of mutual aid teams. All two Communist Party members in the township were elected as representatives.

    Because Zhuxi Township's election work was carried out with the general line propaganda as the driving force, the general election work vigorously promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement and various production tasks. During the election, many mutual aid teams discussed spring plowing and production, and formulated specific production plans; some mutual aid teams with a good foundation studied ways to further consolidate and improve in the future, and actively prepared conditions for establishing production cooperatives; mutual aid teams with shortcomings examined their shortcomings and were determined to improve the mutual aid teams; many individual farmers put forward requests to join mutual aid teams. After the people's representatives were elected, the masses' enthusiasm for production and mutual aid and cooperation was even higher. They all used practical actions to further improve production and strengthen mutual aid and cooperation organizations to show their determination to take the socialist road under the leadership of the People's Congress and the Township People's Government. For example, after the Chen Yongshun mutual aid team in Lidian constituency held an election meeting, it held a meeting of all members to settle the work point accounts for the past year and discuss the production plan for this spring. The Peng Dajin mutual aid team in Xichong constituency formulated specific production plans for spring weeding, manure accumulation, and pond repair, and made a reasonable division of labor to ensure a 10% to 20% increase in production this year. The people's representatives played a leading role in these tasks, responding to the voters' trust in them. Zhang Rongfu, the leader of the Feixi County Third-Class Model Mutual Aid Team in Laogang constituency, convened a meeting of mutual aid team members on the afternoon of the day he was elected as a people's representative to formulate a production plan and discuss the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative. Under his influence, the Zhang Jiacai mutual aid team also held a meeting to discuss production and expressed that they would learn from the Zhang Rongfu mutual aid team and make the mutual aid team better. Wu Chuande, an individual farmer from the Zhuxi constituency, was elected as a people's representative and united four individual farmers around him to discuss organizing a mutual aid team. Wu Chuande said with confidence: "After our mutual aid team is organized, we will discuss production and formulate a plan to ensure that it is done well!"

    安徽省肥西县竹西乡胜利完成基层选举
    许多互助组的骨干当选人民代表
    安徽省肥西县烟墩区竹西乡以总路线宣传为动力，胜利地完成了基层选举工作，许多互助组的组长和骨干分子都当选为人民代表。经过选举，基层政权更加巩固，人民政治积极性和生产积极性大大提高，给进一步贯彻总路线提供了许多有利条件。
    竹西乡在去年十二月份进行了国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传。经过宣传，干部和群众初步认识了社会主义社会的光明前途和对农业实行社会主义改造的重要意义，并纷纷把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设。选举工作就是在进行了总路线宣传和提高了群众政治觉悟的基础上展开的。选举工作开始后，该乡领导干部由于明确认识到普选与总路线的关系，所以在总路线宣传已获成绩的基础上，继续进行宣传贯彻，并使这一宣传和选举工作的每个步骤有机地结合起来，成为推动选举工作的动力。如在普选宣传中，除向群众讲解普选的重大意义及与人民切身利益的关系外，还特别强调地说明做好选举工作，进一步巩固人民民主政权对于国家建设的重大作用；在人口调查和选民登记时，一方面讲解调查登记方法和应注意的问题，进行各种具体的组织工作，一方面也说明人口调查确实可以使国家更有计划地进行建设；在酝酿和讨论代表候选人阶段，把“能够带头和愿意走社会主义道路”作为代表的重要条件，引导选民们认真负责地进行讨论；在召开选举大会时，提出“为选出自己满意的人当代表带头走社会主义道路，积极参加选举大会”的响亮口号，启发了群众参加选举的热情。
    在普选的民主教育和总路线宣传的鼓舞下，全乡群众的政治积极性有了显著提高。选民们为了选好代表带领人民早日走到美满幸福的社会主义社会，积极热情地参加了各项选举活动。在普选宣传时，天气严寒，连日阴雨，道路泥泞，但是很多基层干部不顾这些，常常利用晚上空闲时间向群众进行宣传。召开选举大会时，群众热情更加高涨。极大多数选民都怀着兴奋的心情参加了选举大会，行使了庄严的选举权利。竹西选区六十多岁的盲人吴学炳，平日很少出大门，开选举大会那天，请人领着很早就赶到会场。里店选区许多选民天刚亮就吃罢头天晚上做好的饭，早到会场等候选举。选举中，优秀的共产党员和互助合作运动中、总路线宣传中的积极分子受到了选民们的一致信任和爱戴。在全乡选出的三十五名人民代表中，除三名是脱离生产的乡干部外，有十三名是互助组长，其余也多是互助组中的骨干。全乡两个共产党员都被选为代表。
    竹西乡的选举工作由于是以总路线的宣传为动力来进行的，因而普选工作有力地推动了互助合作运动和各项生产工作。在选举期间，许多互助组讨论了春耕生产，订出了具体的生产计划；部分基础较好的互助组，研究了今后继续巩固和提高的办法，积极准备创办生产合作社的条件；有缺点的互助组检查了缺点，决心把互助组搞好；不少单干农民则提出了参加互助组的要求。当人民代表选出后，群众生产积极性和互助合作的积极性更加提高。他们都以进一步搞好生产和加强互助合作组织的实际行动，来表示自己在人民代表大会和乡人民政府领导下走社会主义道路的决心。如里店选区陈永顺互助组在开过选举大会后，接着开了一次全体组员会议，结算去年工分账目，讨论今春生产计划。西冲选区彭大进互助组订出了春锄、积肥、修塘等具体的生产计划，并对劳力作了合理分工，保证今年增产一成至二成。人民代表在这些工作中起了带头作用，回答了选民对自己的信任。老岗选区的肥西县三等模范互助组组长张荣富，在当选为人民代表的当天下午就召集互助组员开会，制订生产计划，酝酿创办农业生产合作社。在他的影响下，张家财互助组也开会讨论了生产，并表示要向张荣富互助组学习，把互助组搞得更好。竹西选区的单干农民吴传德被选为人民代表后，团结周围四户单干农民酝酿组织互助组。吴传德很有信心地说：“我们这个互助组组织起来以后，就讨论生产，制订计划，保证把它办好！”
