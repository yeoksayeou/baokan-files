    The People Fighting on the Banks of the Hao Liang River
    Liu Yingqiao
    In winter, the long and winding Hao Liang River is covered with thick ice. One ten-wheeled truck after another, loaded with thick red pines and larches, travels ceaselessly along the riverbank. Going upriver, past several small mountain ranges, one reaches Mao’er Mountain in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. On the flat mountainside at the edge of the forest, neatly arranged rows of plank houses stand – the workers’ dormitories of the Hao Liang River Forest Area. More than a thousand forestry workers live here, and like workers in other forest areas, they are working selflessly in the face of severe cold to produce large quantities of timber to support national construction.

    In the morning, while the stars are still emitting their last faint glow, lumberjacks, axe and curved-handled saw in hand, are already setting out on the ice road towards the lumberyard. Amidst the tense “ding-ding” and “swish-swish” sounds of axes and saws, there are also constant booming sounds as tree after tree is felled by the workers. After the trees are felled, the workers prepare the logs, cutting them to the required length, ready for the farmers with their ox-carts to haul them away. At the same time, they clear the forest, making way for saplings to grow. Teams and groups in each lumberyard are enthusiastically carrying out labor competitions, all wanting to contribute a little more to national construction. Li Zhijiu, who had just joined the mountain crew, initially failed to meet the production quota. After half a month of hard work, he is now exceeding the quota by an average of 20 percent.

    Hundreds of ox-cart teams are dispatched. On the logging roads in every mountain gully, there are many strong oxen dragging their harnesses, transporting logs down the mountains. This year, the lack of snow has created many difficulties for logging and transportation, but the farmers have put forward the slogan of overcoming nature and ensuring the completion of timber hauling tasks. When it doesn't snow, they water the ice roads themselves and strive to complete the task ahead of schedule. Where does this strength come from? Li Chunhe, a farmer from Yichun County, answered this question. He said, “I have been going up the mountains to haul logs every year, but this year I feel different than in previous years. In the past, I went up the mountains to earn money, and if I didn't earn enough money, I would come down the mountains without finishing the work. This year, after hearing the propaganda about the General Line, I understood that transporting timber is participating in national construction, and hauling one more log adds more strength to building socialism. How can I not be enthusiastic about working? I don't think about anything else now, I just think about hauling more logs all day long.” According to the production record book of the work team, Li Chunhe hauls three to four cubic meters of timber every day, with a record of more than nine cubic meters, exceeding the material quota by three times. Yang Zhengchun, a veteran who transferred to civilian work, bought a large horse after selling surplus grain and came from Hulan County, more than 700 miles away, to participate in the timber hauling work. The dry land made it impossible to pull the sled, so he and the cart drivers carefully studied and adopted "rush watering rush transport" and "supplementary watering supplementary transport" operation methods according to the different conditions of the forest roads. As a result, they not only reached the quota but also were confident of completing the task ahead of schedule.

    In the winter forest, it gets dark earlier. The clock has just struck four, and it is already impossible to see the person across from you outside. At this time, in order to complete the task ahead of schedule, the drivers drive their trucks back to try to transport another load. The loading workers also hurry to load the timber by the light of kerosene lamps.

    In the final lumberyard, large stacks of logs, as high as mountains, are piled up layer upon layer. Every day, many trains transport timber from here to all parts of the country.

    战斗在浩良河畔的人们
    刘英翘
    冬天，漫长而弯曲的浩良河已经结起了厚厚的冰层。一辆接着一辆的十轮大卡车，满载着粗长的红松、落叶松，沿着河畔川流不息地奔驰着。沿河上行，越过几层小山岭，就到了小兴安岭的帽儿山，在那林缘平坦的山腰上，排列着整齐的板房，这就是浩良河林区的工人宿舍。这里住着的一千多名林业工人，他们和其他林区的工人一样——为了生产大批木材支持国家建设，正在冒着严寒而忘我地劳动着。
    早晨，满天的星星还在放射着最后的微光，伐木工人已经拿着板斧和弯把锯踏上冰道，向林场出发了。在紧张的“丁丁”“刷刷”的斧锯声中，还不断发出轰隆的巨响，一棵棵的大树被工人们伐倒了。树木伐倒以后，工人们一面把原木吊好卯，截成需要的长度，留待倒套子的农民搬运，一面就清理好了林场，以便幼树生长起来。各林场的队与队、组与组都热烈地开展着劳动竞赛，谁都要为国家建设多出一点力量。新入山的李志久开始时生产还达不到定额标准，经过半个月的努力，现在平均已超过定额百分之二十。
    几百付牛套子出动了，在每条山沟的集材道上，都有许多健壮的犍牛拖着倒挂子，把原木从山上运下来。今年雪少给集材和运输带来了不少困难，但是农民们提出了战胜自然，保证完成木材搬运任务的口号。天不下雪，他们就自己浇冰道运搬，并要争取提前完成任务。这是那里来的力量呢？伊春县农民李春和回答了这个问题。他说：“我年年都上山倒套子，可是今年心里跟往年不一样。往年上山为的是赚钱，赚钱少了活没干完就下山，今年听到总路线宣传我可明白了，运搬木材就是参加国家建设，多拉一根木头就给建设社会主义多添一份力量，你说干活能不积极吗？我现在啥都不想，整天就盘算着多拉木头。”在工队的生产纪录簿上可以看到，李春和每天都要拉三、四立方公尺的木材，最高纪录达到九立方公尺多，超过集材定额三倍。转业军人杨正春卖余粮后买了一匹大马，从七百多里外的呼兰县赶来参加木材搬运工作。旱地拉不动爬犁，他和套户们细心研究，按林道不同情况采取“抢浇抢运”、“补浇补运”的作业方法，结果不但达到定额，还有把握提前完成任务。
    冬天的森林里，天黑得更早些，时钟刚打过四下，外面已经对面不见人了。这时，司机们为了要提前完成任务，还把汽车开回来争取再运一趟。装车工人们也借着煤油灯光赶装着木材。
    最终楞场里，山一样高的大木垛一层一层地叠起来。每天都有许多的火车，从这里把木材运到全国各地去。
