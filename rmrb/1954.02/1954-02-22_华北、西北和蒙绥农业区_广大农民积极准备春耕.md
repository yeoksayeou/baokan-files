    North China, Northwest and Mengsui Agricultural Areas
    Vast Number of Farmers Actively Preparing for Spring Ploughing
   [By Our Correspondent] Farmers in North China, Northwest and Mengsui regions, under the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels, are actively preparing for spring ploughing and production, striving to produce more grain, cotton and oil crops this year to support national industrial construction and meet the needs of the people's lives.
    All regions have formulated practical and feasible production increase plans this year based on the needs of the country and the possibility of local production increases. Farmers in the North China region will produce 14.4 percent more grain and 29 percent more cotton this year than last year. Among them, Hebei Province plans to increase grain production by 28.1 percent, cotton production by 39.1 percent, and peanut production by 76.5 percent based on last year. The entire Northwest region plans to increase grain production by 6.53 percent, cotton production by 7.25 percent, and oilseed production by 26.9 percent compared to last year. All provinces in the Northwest have convened agricultural production meetings to formulate and propose this year's production guidelines and tasks. Shaanxi Province, the region with the highest grain production in the Northwest, planted more than 68 million mu of grain crops last year, producing more than 9.1 billion jin of grain, reaching the highest record in history. This year, the planned sowing area and total output of grain crops will remain above last year's level. The cotton field will maintain last year's sowing area of more than 4 million mu, and the total output will increase by 6.4 percent compared to last year. This year, it is also planned to plant more than 2 million mu of oil crops, with a total output increase of 3 percent compared to last year.
    Natural disasters, especially drought and insect pests, in these regions have a great impact on agricultural production increases, and all regions attach particular importance to this. Winter irrigation has been widely carried out in areas with water conservancy conditions in the Northwest and Mengsui, and the winter irrigation area has generally increased compared to previous years. The winter irrigation area in the Northwest region has expanded by 50 percent compared to the previous year. The winter irrigation area of five state-owned channels, such as Huangyang and Huanghui in Gansu Province, has increased by 64 percent. The 3 million mu of cultivated land to be sown this spring in the Hexi Corridor region has been irrigated with winter water. Kashgar Prefecture in Xinjiang Province winter-irrigated more than 1.1 million mu, accounting for more than 90 percent of the wheat field area. Northwest farmers have completed a total of more than 6.6 million mu of winter irrigation tasks and are currently repairing canals in preparation for spring irrigation. Last winter snow was scarce in parts of North China and Mengsui, and farmers in all regions conscientiously carried out water conservancy construction, water storage and ice conservation, and soil preparation to conserve soil moisture and prevent drought. The farmland water conservancy projects built in the North China region this year will expand the irrigation area by more than 1.4 million mu. After completing the 5 million cubic meters of drainage projects in Hebei Province, 3 million mu of land will be free from waterlogging. At present, farmers in various regions are preparing the land to conserve soil moisture. Hebei Province plans to ensure that 85 percent of the province's dry land can be sown in a timely manner despite the spring's low rainfall. In order to prevent wheat smut disease, the Northwest provinces have sent 1.7 million tons of Ceresan to the countryside, and farmers in more than 5 million mu of spring wheat areas are actively carrying out seed dressing. In order to prevent locusts, Xinjiang Province also transported more than 70 tons of "666" pesticide powder purchased in Tianjin back to Urumqi in January.
    All regions also attach great importance to the preparation of fertilizers, seeds, draught cattle, and farm implements for spring ploughing. According to statistics from more than 50 counties in Pindin and Hongdong in Shanxi Province, Anping and Fengrun in Hebei Province, more than 20 billion jin of fertilizer has been accumulated. The amount of fertilizer applied to 37 million mu of winter wheat in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces has increased compared to the past. Many places have inspected spring sowing seeds and mobilized farmers to reserve and exchange sufficient good seeds. In order to support spring sowing in disaster areas, Tianjin Prefecture in Hebei Province is transporting more than 5 million jin of wheat seeds to disaster areas and has issued 5 billion yuan in loans to farming households with difficulties in spring ploughing to ensure that farmers throughout the region smoothly complete the sowing task of 1 million mu of spring wheat. Farmers in various regions have also purchased a lot of draught animals and farm implements after selling surplus grain. According to the unprecedented development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement this year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have paid special attention to the supply of new-style farm implements. Fengzhen County in Suiyuan Province has purchased more than 500 walking plows from other places to supply the needs of farmers. Kulun Banner, Buteha Banner, Naiman Banner in Inner Mongolia, and Qingshuihe County in Suiyuan Province have also prepared a large number of new-style farm implements such as seeders, rollers, combined shovel plows, disc harrows, and waterwheels.
    In terms of technical guidance, Shaanxi Province has determined that it will universally promote technologies such as close planting this year, reducing the seedling deficiency rate from 20 to 30 percent in the past to 10 to 20 percent, which can increase the province's grain output by about 10 percent. Currently, more than 1,000 technical cadres have completed winter training and gone to the countryside to help farmers prepare for spring ploughing. Agricultural technology promotion stations and farms in Turpan, Kuqa, Yili and other counties in Xinjiang Province have taught more than 2,000 farmers of all ethnic groups the cultivation techniques of major crops such as wheat and cotton. North China will focus on promoting experiences such as close planting with full seedlings, meticulous harvesting and threshing, and drought prevention and resistance this year, and will send more scientific and technical personnel to conduct in-depth investigations and research in rural areas, in order to improve the farming technical level of farmers one step further on the existing basis.

    华北、西北和蒙绥农业区
    广大农民积极准备春耕
   【本报讯】华北、西北和蒙绥等地农民在各级党政机关领导下，积极准备春耕生产，争取今年生产更多的粮食、棉花和油料作物，支持国家工业建设和供应人民生活的需要。
    各地今年都根据国家的需要和当地增产的可能，拟定了切实可行的增产计划。华北区农民今年将比去年多生产百分之十四点四的粮食和百分之二十九的棉花，其中河北省计划在去年基础上增产粮食百分之二十八点一，增产棉花百分之三十九点一，增产花生百分之七十六点五。西北全区计划要求粮食比去年增产百分之六点五三，棉花增产百分之七点二五，油籽增产百分之二十六点九。西北各省都召开了农业生产会议，制订和提出了今年的生产方针和任务。西北产粮最多地区陕西省，去年播种粮食作物六千八百多万亩，产粮九十一亿多斤，达到历史上最高纪录。今年计划粮食作物的播种面积和总产量仍保持在去年水平以上，棉田仍保持去年四百多万亩的播种面积，总产量将比去年增加百分之六点四，今年还计划播种油料作物二百多万亩，总产量比去年增加百分之三。
    这些地区的自然灾害尤其是旱、虫灾害对农业增产有很大影响，各地对此特别重视。西北和蒙绥等有水利条件地区普遍进行了冬灌，冬灌面积大都比往年增加。西北地区冬灌面积比前年扩大了百分之五十，甘肃省黄羊、湟惠等五个国营渠道冬灌面积增加了百分之六十四，河西走廊地区今春将要播种的三百万亩耕地都已灌上了冬水。新疆省喀什专区冬浇一百一十多万亩，占麦田面积百分之九十以上。西北农民总计已完成六百六十多万亩冬灌任务，目前正在修理渠道准备春灌。华北和蒙绥部分地区去年冬雪较少，各地农民都认真地进行了兴修水利、积水养冰和整地保墒等防旱抗旱工作。华北区今年兴修的农田水利工程，将扩大灌溉面积一百四十多万亩。河北省完成五百万公方的排水工程后，将免除三百万亩土地的涝灾。目前各地农民正在整地保墒，河北省计划在春季少雨的情况下争取占全省耕地面积百分之八十五的旱田也能适时播种。为了防治小麦腥黑穗病，西北各省已将一百七十万吨赛力散送到农村，五百多万亩春麦地区的农民都在积极进行药剂拌种。新疆省为了防治蝗虫，在天津定购的七十多吨“六六六”药粉，也在一月间运回乌鲁木齐市。
    各地对春耕中的肥料、种籽和耕牛、农具等准备工作也很重视。据山西省的平定、洪洞，河北省的安平、丰润等五十多个县的统计，已积肥二百多亿斤。甘肃、宁夏、青海三省三千七百多万亩冬麦的施肥量都比过去增加。很多地方对春播种籽进行了检查，并动员农民保留和调换足够的良种。河北省天津专区为了支持灾区春播，正把五百多万斤麦种向灾区调运，并对春耕有困难的农户发放了五十亿元的贷款，保证全区农民顺利完成一百万亩春麦的播种任务。各地农民在出售余粮后，还买进了很多耕畜和农具。各地供销合作社根据今年农村互助合作运动空前发展的特点，特别注意了新式农具的供应。绥远省丰镇县已由外埠购进了五百多张步犁，供给农民需要。内蒙的库伦旗、布特哈旗、奈曼旗和绥远省的清水河县等地也都准备了大批的播种机、镇压器、综合号铲?机、圆盘耙和水车等新式农具。
    在技术指导方面，陕西省确定今年普遍推广密植等技术，把缺苗率由过去百分之二十到三十减少至百分之十到二十，这样可使全省的粮食产量增加百分之十左右。目前已有一千多名技术干部冬训完毕，下乡帮助农民准备春耕。新疆省吐鲁番、库车、伊犁等县的农业技术推广站和农场已向两千多名各族农民传授了麦、棉等主要作物的栽培技术。华北今年要全力推广密植全苗、精收细打、防旱抗旱等经验，并将派出更多的科学技术人员，深入农村进行调查研究，以便在现有基础上把农民耕作技术水平提高一步。
