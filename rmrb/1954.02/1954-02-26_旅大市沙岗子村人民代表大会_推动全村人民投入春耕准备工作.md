The People's Congress of Shagangzi Village, Yingchengzi District, Lüda City

Promotes Spring Ploughing Preparation Work Among All Villagers

The People's Congress of Shagangzi Village, Yingchengzi District, Lüda City, held its fourth session on February 11th to discuss the current spring ploughing preparation work. Thanks to the clear thinking and thorough preparation of the Party and government leading cadres in the village, and the promotion of democracy, this meeting was a great success and spurred the entire village's preparations for spring farming.

Before the meeting, some farmers in Shagangzi Village believed that "the spring is long, so there's no need to rush," and had not actively prepared for spring ploughing; some farmers had not yet delivered their winter manure to the fields, and the amount of manure was insufficient, with 40% of the village's land lacking fertilizer. After grasping the above situation, the Party branch and village government conducted conscientious and serious research and proposed specific solutions. In order to extensively mobilize the masses to do a good job in preparing for spring production, the village government decided to convene a People's Congress to discuss this major issue that affects the interests of all villagers.

The fourth People's Congress, held on February 11th, decided to mobilize all villagers to take active action and, on the basis of consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, to do a good job in the annual production and preparation plan for spring ploughing: accumulating and delivering manure from various sources; tidying up vegetable gardens, preparing warm beds and straw screens for raising vegetable seedlings, digging more than 30 wells before the end of February; ploughing the land immediately after thawing; and sorting out and preparing farm tools for spring ploughing and doing a good job in exchanging fine seeds.

At the meeting, all the representatives had a heated discussion on these issues and put forward concrete solutions. These methods are: First, to further carry out the publicity and education of the general line, so as to raise the socialist consciousness of the peasants, and while carrying out publicity, to combine it with the work of improving the reasonable work point system and labor discipline within the production cooperatives; the mutual aid groups should be further consolidated, a democratic management system should be formulated, and the annual production plan and preparation plan for each cooperative (group) should be generally discussed and formulated. Second, in order to increase production, it is necessary to mobilize farmers to apply more fertilizer, requiring that the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of land be increased from 25 heaps last year to 30 heaps, and to educate the masses to actively go to Dalian to pull manure. Mobilize the masses to build more kang and accumulate manure from various sources to ensure this year's increased production. Third, in order to do a good job in preparing for spring ploughing, it is necessary to further mobilize women to participate in production, organizing them to participate in labor such as tidying up vegetable gardens, leveling cellars, and repairing Chinese cabbage, so as to save male labor for pulling manure, digging wells, and so on.

After the meeting, the village people's government immediately organized representatives and cadres to widely publicize the resolutions of the People's Congress to the peasants. In addition to convening voters' meetings in their respective electoral districts to convey the resolutions, the representatives also organized seminars in their own production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, leading everyone with their own active actions. An Xingsheng, a people's representative of the Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, and the director of the cooperative, organized all the members to discuss and revise the various systems within the cooperative and specifically formulated a spring ploughing preparation plan. For more than 180 mu of land in the whole cooperative, it was determined that more than 30 heaps of fertilizer should be applied per mu. At present, there is still a shortage of more than 70 cartloads of manure, so they sent three carts to Dalian early and late to pull manure. They also built 25 warm beds for raising vegetable seedlings in three days, and organized nine members to make 72 straw screens in four days. Men Zhaoquan, director of the Jin Xing Agricultural Production Cooperative and a people's representative, organized the members to discuss and revise the annual production plan. Now, members Zhou Chuanzhong, Liu Fuyu, and others are actively repairing ploughs, preparing to completely plough all the land immediately after thawing. The peasants saw that the representatives were actively pulling and delivering manure and tidying up vegetable gardens, and they also took action. After the meeting, in addition to 15 carts going to Dalian every day to pull manure, there were more than 30 carts delivering manure to the fields every day. Liu Maoju and other two mutual aid groups have started to dig wells. A wave of enthusiasm for spring ploughing preparation work has been set off throughout the village.

    旅大市沙岗子村人民代表大会
    推动全村人民投入春耕准备工作
    旅大市营城子区沙岗子村在二月十一日召开了第四次人民代表大会，讨论了当前的春耕准备工作。由于该村党政领导干部思想明确，准备充分，发扬了民主，这次大会开得很好，推动了全村的备耕工作。
    在举行大会之前，沙岗子村部分农民认为“春脖子挺长，不着忙”，没有积极做好春耕的准备工作；有些农民的冬粪还没有送到地里，而且粪肥也不足，全村百分之四十的土地缺少肥料。党支部和村政府掌握了上述情况以后，切实认真地进行了研究，并提出了具体的解决方法。为了深入广泛地发动群众作好备耕生产工作，村政府决定召开人民代表大会讨论这一关系全村人民利益的重大事情。
    二月十一日召开的第四次人民代表大会，决定发动全村人民积极行动起来，在巩固与发展互助合作组织的基础上，作好全年生产和备耕计划：从多方面积肥、送粪；整理菜园，打好烤菜苗的温床和草扇子，在二月底前打好三十多眼井；在解冻后马上把地耕完；另外整理和准备春耕生产的农具和作好串换优良籽种的工作。
    会上全体代表们对这些问题展开了热烈的讨论，并提出了具体解决办法。这些办法是：一、进一步进行总路线的宣传教育，以提高农民的社会主义觉悟，并在进行宣传同时，结合进行健全生产合作社内部的合理计工制度和劳动纪律的工作；互助组要进一步巩固，制订民主管理制度，并普遍讨论订出各社（组）的全年生产计划和备耕计划。二、为了增加生产，必须发动农民多施肥，要求每亩地的施肥量由去年的二十五堆增加到三十堆，教育群众积极到大连拉粪。动员群众多打炕，从多方面积肥，以保证今年的增产。三、为了做好备耕工作，必须进一步发动妇女参加生产，组织她们参加整菜园、平菜窖、修理白菜等劳动，以省出男劳动力来拉粪、打井等等。
    会后，村人民政府立即组织了代表、干部广泛地向农民宣传了人民代表大会的决议。代表们除在自己的选区里召开选民会议进行了传达外，并在自己的生产合作社、互助组里，组织了座谈会，以自己的积极行动带动大家。明星农业生产合作社人民代表安兴盛和社主任组织全体社员讨论修改了社内的各项制度，具体订出了备耕计划。全社一百八十多亩地，确定每亩施肥三十堆以上。目前还缺少七十多车大粪，他们就派出三辆大车起早贪黑地到大连拉粪。他们并在三天内打好了二十五个烤菜苗的温床，组织了九名社员在四天内打好了七十二个草扇子。金星农业生产合作社主任、人民代表门兆全组织社员们讨论修正了全年的生产计划。现在社员周传忠、刘福玉等人正积极修理犁杖，准备解冻后马上把地全部耢完。农民们看到代表们积极拉粪、送粪，整理菜园，也都行动起来。会后全村每天除有十五辆大车到大连去拉粪外，每天还有三十多辆大车往地里送粪。刘茂举等两个互助组已动工打井。全村掀起了春耕准备工作的热潮。
