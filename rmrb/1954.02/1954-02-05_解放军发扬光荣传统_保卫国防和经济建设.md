Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: In the first year of the motherland's first five-year construction plan, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army vigilantly safeguards the motherland's national defense and economic construction.

	Over the past year, the People's Liberation Army has worked tirelessly day and night, guarding the motherland's long border and coastline, thwarting the disruptive activities of U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and resolutely eliminating enemies invading our country's borders. In mid-July of last year, the People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 3,300 remnant Chiang bandits who had infiltrated Dongshan Island in Fujian Province, causing the conspiracy painstakingly planned by U.S. imperialism for four months to fail. The People's Liberation Army also cleared the Chiang bandits from the coastal islands. In the past year, it recovered twelve islands including Dalushan (including Xiaolushan), Jiguan Mountain, Yangyu, Toumen Mountain, Tian'ao Island, Jiang'er'ao, Xiyang, Fuying, Beishuang, Kuishan, Machi, and Jigu Mountain along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, making the motherland's coastal defense even more solid.

	The People's Liberation Army strictly protected the security of the motherland's borders. They fought in the primitive forests and brambles of the border areas, searching for imperialist agents and bandits attempting to infiltrate our country's borders.

	From January to September last year, the People's Liberation Army eliminated more than 13,000 remnant Chiang bandits and bandits.

	The People's Liberation Army stationed on the border and coastal defense lines correctly implemented the country's various policies and received enthusiastic support from the people of all ethnic groups in the border areas and the people along the coast. People of all ethnic minorities in the border areas established joint defense teams, and fishermen and farmers along the coast organized reconnaissance teams and armed work teams to guard the motherland's gate together with the People's Liberation Army soldiers, resolutely eliminating enemies who came to harass them. For example, the militiamen and farmers of Dongshan Island joined the People's Liberation Army in extinguishing the Chiang bandit paratroopers who had landed, captured fleeing bandits, and enthusiastically cooked and delivered food and water for the People's Liberation Army, transported the wounded and ammunition, and helped the People's Liberation Army quickly crush the harassment of the remnant bandits.

	In the past year, the People's Liberation Army also wiped out the bandits on the mainland, making social order unprecedentedly stable. From March to June last year, the People's Liberation Army wiped out the bandits who had been lurking in the Tibetan areas of Gansu and Qinghai for a long time, and completely annihilated more than 1,300 people including the bandit leader Ma Yuanxiang, causing the conspiracy of the U.S. and Chiang bandits to fail completely. When the People's Liberation Army suppressed bandits in Tibet, they correctly implemented ethnic policies and won the enthusiastic support of the Tibetan people. They automatically served as guides for the People's Liberation Army, reported bandit information, persuaded bandits to surrender, and captured scattered bandits, enabling the People's Liberation Army to completely eliminate this group of bandits.

	The People's Liberation Army also effectively protects the safety of the motherland's important factories, mines, transportation lines, and urban and rural people, protects the motherland's large forests and grasslands, prevents and cracks down on the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and ensures that the motherland's various construction undertakings are carried out safely.

	In the struggle to defend the security of the motherland, the People's Liberation Army, like in the war to liberate the whole country, carried forward a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism. They not only overcame various difficulties to build the motherland's national defense into an impregnable wall, but also unhesitatingly contributed their most precious lives when necessary. Zhang Xuedong, the immortal warrior who blocked the enemy's firing points with his own body in the Battle of Dongshan Island, is one of the glorious figures of the people's soldiers who dedicated themselves to defending the motherland's socialist cause.

    解放军发扬光荣传统
    保卫国防和经济建设
    【新华社四日讯】在祖国进行第一个五年建设计划的第一年中，英雄的中国人民解放军警惕地保卫着祖国的国防和祖国的经济建设。
    一年来，人民解放军日夜辛劳地守卫在祖国漫长的边疆和海防线上，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的侵扰活动，坚决消灭了侵袭我们国境的敌人。去年七月中，人民解放军歼灭了窜犯福建省东山岛的残余蒋匪军三千三百多人，使美帝国主义苦心筹划了四个月的阴谋归于失败。人民解放军还清剿了沿海岛屿上的蒋匪，去年一年中，共在浙江和福建省沿海收复了大鹿山（含小鹿山）、鸡冠山、羊屿、头门山、田岙岛、蒋儿岙、西洋、浮鹰、北霜、魁山、马赤、积谷山等十二个岛屿，使祖国海防更加巩固。
    人民解放军严密保卫了祖国边疆的安全。他们在边疆的原始森林和荆棘丛中奋斗着，搜捕着企图潜入我国国境的帝国主义特务分子和土匪。
    去年一月至九月，人民解放军共消灭残余蒋匪和土匪一万三千多人。
    驻守在边疆和海防线上的人民解放军正确地执行着国家的各项政策，得到了边疆各族人民和沿海人民的热烈拥护和支援。在边疆地区的各少数民族人民建立了联防队，沿海的渔民和农民组织了侦察队、武工队，和人民解放军战士共同守卫着祖国的大门，坚决消灭前来骚扰的敌人。如东山岛的民兵和农民曾和人民解放军一起扑灭了空降的蒋匪伞兵，捕捉溃散的匪兵，同时热情地为人民解放军做饭送水、运送伤员和弹药物资，帮助解放军迅速地粉碎了残匪的骚扰。
    去年一年中，人民解放军还肃清了大陆上的土匪，使社会秩序空前安定。去年三月至六月间，人民解放军肃清了长期潜伏在甘肃和青海境藏区的土匪，将匪首马元祥以下一千三百多人全部歼灭，使美、蒋匪帮的阴谋彻底失败。人民解放军在藏区剿匪时，正确地执行民族政策，获得了藏族人民的热烈拥护。他们自动给解放军充当向导，报告匪情，劝匪投降，捕捉散匪，使解放军彻底地消灭了这股土匪。
    人民解放军还有效地保护着祖国的重要工厂、矿山、交通线和城乡人民的安全，保护着祖国的大森林和草原，防止和破获了反革命分子的破坏活动，使祖国的各项建设事业安全地进行。
    在保卫祖国安全的斗争中，人民解放军像在解放全国的战争中一样，发扬了高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神。他们不仅克服了各种困难，把祖国国防建设成铜墙铁壁，而且在必要的时候，毫不犹疑地贡献出自己最宝贵的生命。在东山岛战斗中以自己的身体堵塞敌人的火力点的不朽的战士张学栋，就是为保卫祖国的社会主义事业而献身的人民战士中的光辉形象之一。
