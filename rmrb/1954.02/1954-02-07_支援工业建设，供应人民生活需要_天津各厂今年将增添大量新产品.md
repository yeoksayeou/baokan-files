    To support basic construction and supply the growing material, cultural, and livelihood needs of industrial production and the urban and rural people, state-owned and local state-owned factories in Tianjin will add a large number of new products this year.
    The state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory will mass-produce single-process, three-drawing roving frames and doublers, which have never been manufactured in China before, to supply existing and newly built textile factories in the country. Under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant is preparing to produce boiling steel and cast larger steel ingots this year. The plant successfully trial-produced flat steel last year, and will also mass-produce it this year for use in basic construction projects such as transportation departments. The state-owned Tianjin Power Machinery Factory is preparing to trial-produce 120-horsepower medium-speed diesel engines this year. This type of diesel engine has a wide range of uses in China, and can be used as power for basic construction projects, mines, and small-scale power generation for lighting in small cities. The Tianjin Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau's steel rolling mill and other factories will produce converter steel, steel window materials, cranes, hoists and crane control equipment, roofing felt, red lead powder, steam road roller boilers and other new products this year to supply basic construction and industrial production. The state-owned Tianjin Dye Factory successfully trial-produced acid pickling corrosion inhibitors last year and will formally produce them this year. This acid pickling corrosion inhibitor has the ability to resist acid corrosion on the human body, and will greatly help the labor protection of steel workers engaged in acid pickling work. The local state-owned Tianjin Oil Factory plans to mass-produce stearin butter, original grease butter, and alkaline grease butter needed for train locomotives this year to supply the needs of thirteen railway administrations and various locomotive depots in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
    In order to meet the growing living needs of urban and rural people, the Tianjin cotton mills under the North China Textile Administration will add new products such as poplin, khaki, venetian, colored poplin, colored khaki, and patterned venetian this year. The factories under the Textile Industry Administration Office of the Local State-Owned Industrial Bureau are preparing to add new products such as woolen serge, seersucker, pure Indigo gray twill, and gray gabardine; the factories under the bureau will produce daily necessities such as washbasins and oilcloth, as well as canned duck, canned fish, and canned jam. Many factories have improved the style of their products based on people's preferences. The local state-owned Rubber Factory No. 1 is preparing to produce more than 50,000 pairs of zippered rain boots for both men and women to supply the market this year. The local state-owned Tianjin Knitting Factory will also make some improvements in the color and style of knitwear according to the preferences of the people.
    With the development of cultural, educational, and health undertakings in urban and rural areas, factories will also supply new supplies accordingly. The state-owned Tianjin People's Ink Factory will mass-produce rotary ink this year for use by newspapers in various places to print newspapers. The local state-owned Red Star Factory is preparing to produce hand-cranked mimeograph machines and cloth-patterned mimeograph stencils to supply market needs. The local state-owned Jinan Tannery, the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Musical Instrument Factory, and others will increase the production of a large number of footballs, basketballs, pianos, organs, three-tube and five-tube radios, and portable sterilizers and other medical devices.
