The preferential treatment work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province has achieved great results, and 400 models of preferential treatment have emerged in various places. Over the past four years, the CCP committees and people's governments at all levels in the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region have actively mobilized and organized revolutionary martyr's families, families of servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers with labor power to engage in various productions. In rural areas, those households of martyrs' families and servicemen's families who lack labor power or draught animals were provided with substitute cultivation and were assisted in gradually creating conditions to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Now, those participating in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations account for more than 50% of the total number of households. Last year, in the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin in Inner Mongolia, 928 households of martyrs' families and servicemen's families participated in various production mutual aid teams in eleven districts. The Zhong Guilan mutual aid team, a model serviceman's family in Linxi County, has developed into an agricultural production cooperative. In pastoral areas, martyrs' families and servicemen's families without labor power or lacking labor power have also received care in the form of substitute herding or livestock loans, and their lives have improved. Shuang Xi, a demobilized soldier from Zhalute Banner, not only actively engaged in production but also enthusiastically participated in rural construction work, receiving an award banner for his work in road construction and the title of "Model Forester" for his work in forest protection. According to statistics from eight counties in Suiyuan Province, including Fengzhen, over the years, more than 300 outstanding martyrs' families, servicemen's families, and demobilized and transferred soldiers have been elected as representatives to the county people's congresses.

In the cities, the preferential treatment work has implemented the principle of "organizing production and introducing employment as the main focus, supplemented by material subsidies." Various towns and cities have organized military families to form sack factories, sewing departments, brick and tile factories, wool spinning groups, cooperatives, etc., based on their actual conditions. Last year alone, 13 production units were established in GuiSui and Baotou cities and Fengzhen County in Suiyuan Province, accommodating more than 1,000 martyrs' families and servicemen's families for production. Revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers in various places have also participated in production or learning. Children of martyrs' families and servicemen's families also enjoy preferential treatment such as free tuition or scholarships when attending school; in some towns and cities, the enrollment rate of children of martyrs' families and servicemen's families has reached more than 90% of school-age children.

    蒙绥地区的优抚工作有很大成绩
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省的优抚工作有很大成绩，各地已涌现了四百个优抚模范。四年来，蒙绥地区各级中共党委和人民政府曾积极发动和组织有劳动力的革命烈士家属、军人家属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人从事各种生产。在农村中，对无劳畜力或缺劳畜力户予以代耕，并帮助他们逐步创造条件参加互助合作组织。现在，参加农业生产互助合作组织的已占总户数百分之五十以上。去年，内蒙古科尔沁左翼中旗十一个区有九百二十八户烈士家属和军人家属参加了各种生产互助组。林西县模范军属钟桂兰互助组，已发展为农业生产合作社。在牧业区，无劳动力或缺乏劳动力的烈士家属、军人家属也都得到代牧或贷畜的照顾，生活都有了改善。扎赉特旗转业军人双喜不但积极生产，并热情地参加农村建设工作，在修筑公路中得到奖旗，在护林工作中又获得“护林模范”的称号。据绥远省丰镇等八个县的统计，历年来有三百多个优秀的烈士家属、军人家属和复员转业军人被选为县人民代表会议的代表。
    在城市里，优抚工作贯彻了“组织生产、介绍职业为主，实物补助为辅”的方针。各城镇根据实际情况，分别组织了军属麻袋厂、缝纫部、砖瓦厂、纺毛小组、合作社等。去年仅绥远省归绥、包头两市和丰镇县就组成十三个生产单位，容纳了一千多烈士家属、军人家属进行生产。各地革命残废军人和复员转业军人也都参加了生产或学习。烈士家属、军人家属的子女入学也享受免费或助学金的优待；有些城镇烈士家属、军人家属的子女，入学的已达学龄儿童百分之九十以上。　（新华社）
