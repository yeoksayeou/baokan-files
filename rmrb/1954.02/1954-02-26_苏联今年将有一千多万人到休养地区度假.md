Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th: According to TASS, more than 11 million people in the Soviet Union will vacation in resort areas this year. This number is approximately equal to the total population of Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg combined. To meet the vacation needs of the Soviet working people, in addition to the existing more than 2,000 sanatoriums, several thousand rest homes, travel camps, and children's summer camps, 7,500 more health facilities will be added this year. The Soviet Union will allocate 1.77 billion rubles from the state social insurance fund alone for sanatorium expenses this year. Tens of millions of rubles will be used to build many new sanatoriums and rest homes.

The expansion of the Soviet sanatorium network is very rapid. For example, the number of sanatoriums and rest homes in the Riga seaside area of the Latvian Republic has increased sixteenfold in the years after the war compared to before the war. New children's rest homes and sanatoriums are still under construction in this area. In recent years, the Karelo-Finnish Republic has established fourteen sanatoriums, more than thirty rest homes, and several travel camps. This year, the state will allocate several million rubles to build new health facilities there. In the pine forest areas in the southern Urals, on high mountains and by lakes, many rest homes and two large-scale sanatoriums have been built for metallurgical workers, railway workers, and miners. These new health facilities are equipped with the latest facilities for hydrotherapy and mud therapy. The most scenic Caucasian and Crimean resorts in the Soviet Union are also being expanded. In the famous Tskhaltubo resort in the Georgian Republic, a new sanatorium capable of accommodating 250 people has been built for railway workers; in addition, several other new sanatoriums have been started. Because the mineral springs of Tskhaltubo have high medicinal value, the Republic government has formulated plans and allocated huge sums of money to build more health facilities here.

    苏联今年将有一千多万人到休养地区度假
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联今年将有一千一百多万人到休养地区度假，这个数字约等于瑞士、丹麦、荷兰和卢森堡四个国家人口的总和。为了满足苏联劳动人民休假生活的需要，除了现有的两千多个疗养院、几千个休养所、旅行营和儿童夏令营外，今年还将增加七千五百个疗养机构。苏联今年单从国家社会保险费中就将拨出十七亿七千万卢布作为疗养院的经费。将有数千万卢布用来建设许多新的疗养院和休养所。
    苏联疗养机构分布网的扩大是很快的。例如拉脱维亚共和国里加海滨区疗养院和休养所的数目，在战后几年中就增加到战前十六倍。现在这个地区还在兴建新的儿童休养所和疗养所。卡累利阿—芬兰共和国最近几年来就设立了十四个疗养院、三十多个休养所，还有若干旅行营。今年国家还将拨出几百万卢布在那里修建新的疗养机构。在乌拉尔南部松林地区在高山上和湖边，已为冶金工人、铁路工人和矿工建筑了许多休养所和两个规模巨大的疗养院。这些新的疗养机构都备有实行水疗法和泥疗法的最新设备。苏联风景最优美的高加索和克里米亚休养地也在扩建中。在格鲁吉亚共和国有名的茨哈杜博休养地，已为铁路工人建成了一所能容纳二百五十人的新疗养院；另外还有几个新的疗养院已经动工兴建。由于茨哈杜博的矿泉有很高的医疗价值，共和国政府已拟订计划并拨出巨款要在这里修建更多的疗养机构。
