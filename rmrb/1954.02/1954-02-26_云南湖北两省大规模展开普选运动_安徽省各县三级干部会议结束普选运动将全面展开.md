    Large-scale Universal Suffrage Movement Unfolds in Yunnan and Hubei Provinces
    Anhui Province's County-Level Three-Tier Cadre Meetings Conclude, Universal Suffrage Movement to Fully Unfold

    The universal suffrage movement in Yunnan and Hubei provinces is unfolding on a massive scale. In Yunnan Province, with the exception of the Mianning Special District, which is not conducting universal suffrage, the remaining eleven special districts have fully launched the universal suffrage movement. According to incomplete statistics from the province up to mid-February, 327 townships covering approximately 1.5 million people have completed grassroots elections. The election in Gejiu City concluded in mid-February, and Kunming City is expected to complete all grassroots elections before the end of February. In other areas of the province, including many border and remote mountainous regions, the universal suffrage movement is proceeding enthusiastically.

    In Hubei Province, universal suffrage work has begun in batches in vast urban and rural areas. Huanggang and Yichang special districts, and Shashi, launched the first batch of grassroots elections in the early and mid parts of this month, respectively. Most of the more than 1,200 townships in Huanggang Special District that are conducting the universal suffrage movement have entered the stage of recommending candidates. The second batch of grassroots elections in this special district will also fully unfold in late February. In addition to conducting key pilot projects, other special districts and counties are actively training cadres to fully prepare for the upcoming comprehensive universal suffrage movement.

    The county-district-township three-level cadre meetings convened by various counties in Anhui Province to deploy the comprehensive launch of the grassroots election movement have concluded. Currently, a large number of universal suffrage work cadres have gone to the countryside, and the universal suffrage movement is about to fully unfold throughout the province.

    The county-district-township three-level cadre meetings convened by various counties in Anhui Province focused on resolving the issue of combining universal suffrage with production. Some counties paid particular attention to strengthening the unified leadership of universal suffrage and production. The counties under the Wuhu Special District organized production and universal suffrage work teams (groups) to go to the countryside, and the county-level leading organs established a special production and universal suffrage office. Many counties also paid attention to studying specific methods of combining universal suffrage with production. After three to five days of discussions, the counties reversed the view of some cadres that universal suffrage and production were difficult to combine. After the conclusion of the meetings, a large number of trained universal suffrage work cadres went to the grassroots universal suffrage units. More than 1,200 universal suffrage work cadres who arrived in the revolutionary old base areas of Jinzhai and three other counties in Anhui Province have enthusiastically joined the universal suffrage movement.

    云南湖北两省大规模展开普选运动
    安徽省各县三级干部会议结束普选运动将全面展开
    云南、湖北两省的普选运动正以巨大的规模向全面展开。云南省除缅宁专区不进行普选以外，其余十一个专区已全面展开了普选运动。该省到二月中旬的不完全统计，已有三百二十七个乡约一百五十万人口的地区完成基层选举。个旧市的选举已在本月中旬结束，昆明市在二月底以前也将全部结束基层选举。该省其他地区包括许多边疆和辽远的山区地带，普选运动正在热烈进行。
    湖北省普选工作已在广大城镇和乡村中开始分批进行。该省黄冈、宜昌两专区和沙市已先后在本月上旬和中旬展开了第一批基层选举工作。黄冈专区正在进行普选运动的一千二百多乡大部分已进入推选候选人阶段，二月下旬该专区的第二批基层选举工作也将全面展开。其他专区各县除正在进行重点试办工作以外，并在积极训练干部为即将全面展开的普选运动作充分准备。　（新华社）
    安徽省各县为部署全面展开基层选举运动而召开的县区乡三级干部会议已经结束。目前大批普选工作干部已经下乡，普选运动即将在全省范围内全面展开。
    安徽省各县召开的县区乡三级干部会议，着重解决了普选和生产结合的问题。有些县特别注意加强普选和生产的统一领导。芜湖专区所属各县组织生产普选工作队（组）下乡，县一级领导机关并专门成立了生产普选办公室。许多县并注意研究了普选结合生产的具体作法。各县经过三天到五天会议的讨论以后，扭转了部分干部认为普选和生产不好结合的看法。会议结束以后，经过训练的大批普选工作干部已纷纷到达基层普选单位。到达安徽省革命老根据地金寨等四个县的一千二百多名普选工作干部，已经热情地投入了普选运动。（新华社）
