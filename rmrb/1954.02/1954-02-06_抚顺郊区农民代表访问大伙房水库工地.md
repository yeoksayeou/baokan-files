On January 18th, under the organization and leadership of the Fushun Municipal People's Government Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry and the Fushun Suburban District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, more than 500 representatives from the Fushun suburban mutual aid and cooperation conference, district and village cadres, and farmer representatives who had suffered from the Hun River flood, visited and toured the Dahuofang Reservoir construction site. After the representatives arrived at the construction site, the reservoir workers held a welcoming meeting at the construction site club. Liu Peng, Director of the Reservoir Engineering Bureau, delivered a welcome speech, explaining that the construction of the Dahuofang Reservoir is a concrete manifestation of the worker-peasant alliance. The main purpose of the reservoir project is to relieve the Hun River flood and reduce flooding in the lower reaches of the Liao River, so that agricultural production will no longer be harmed by floods. After the reservoir is completed, it can also irrigate 30,000 hectares of paddy fields and help farmers increase production. He also gave a brief introduction to the construction plan of the reservoir. After the report, the farmer representatives visited the main construction sites and factory buildings such as the water diversion tunnel project under construction, various construction machinery, air compressor plant, and pile driving factory.

　　The farmers visited the water diversion tunnel project of the reservoir under construction, and when they saw the rock drilling team workers working tensely day and night in the ice-cold mountain cave, they cordially expressed their gratitude to them. Guo Yuzhang, director of the Yuanda Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yingshou Village, Funan District, said with emotion: "In the past, I didn't understand the work of the workers, and always thought they were more leisurely than the farmers. I never thought that they worked much harder than us!"

　　When the farmers visited the construction machinery, the workers specially started the excavators, bulldozers, and self-unloading trucks for the farmers to see. The commentator and drivers kindly told the farmers that a large part of the reservoir project would be done by machinery. Just building a dam requires twenty-one kinds of machines, 735 pieces in all. The efficiency of each machine is more than ten to hundreds of times greater than that of hand tools. The farmers personally witnessed the benefits of mechanization and specifically realized the importance of the country's implementation of socialist industrialization and the primary development of heavy industry. Only when the country is industrialized can the countryside use machines to replace human labor, liberate human labor, and improve labor efficiency, like the Dahuofang Reservoir project, so that farmers can become prosperous.

　　After the visit, the farmers and workers held a discussion. They reported each other's production achievements in 1953. The farmers expressed their determination to respond to the call of the Party and the government, actively carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and guarantee to produce five more liters of grain per mu in 1954, and plant a large number of vegetables and raise pigs, sheep, and chickens to actively support the staff and workers of the Dahuofang Reservoir. The workers also expressed that in order to respond to the care of the peasant brothers, they must work hard to study technology and work hard to complete the Dahuofang Reservoir project ahead of schedule. Zhu Xiucheng, the leader of the "March 8th" drilling team, a worker representative who had participated in the Huai River project and won the title of Huai River Model, said: "When I first participated in the Huai River project, I was a little skeptical, wondering how such a large project could be built? But with the support of the people of the whole country, many projects in the Huai River project have been completed! As soon as I came here, I saw farmers often sending vegetables and helping to build bridges in the cold weather. Thinking of this, the enthusiasm for building the reservoir has increased." Wang Shijun, director of the Taishan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fuxi District, said: "Seeing the old worker brothers helping us build the reservoir without complaint, we are all indescribably grateful. In addition to actively leading the cooperative well, I will also mobilize the whole cooperative to plant more than 100 mu of vegetables to supply you." The discussion was conducted in an atmosphere full of close unity. The workers and farmers talked freely with each other like brothers who had been separated for a long time, and exchanged mailing addresses and signatures. After the discussion, Li Ying, Director of the Fushun Municipal People's Government Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, and Yu Yunqing, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Suburban District Committee, on behalf of the visiting farmers, presented letters of condolence, flags, and superior varieties of various crops to all the staff and workers of the Dahuofang Reservoir. Lu Yun, Deputy Director of the Dahuofang Reservoir Engineering Bureau, also presented a silk banner to the representatives of the farmers in the suburbs on behalf of the staff and workers. At 7 p.m., the representatives of the farmers in the suburbs and the staff and workers of the Reservoir Engineering Bureau held a joint celebration party.

    抚顺郊区农民代表访问大伙房水库工地
    一月十八日，在抚顺市人民政府农林局和中共抚顺市郊区党委的组织领导下，抚顺郊区互助合作会议的代表，区村干部，以及受过浑河水害的农民代表五百多人，到大伙房水库工地访问和参观。代表们到达工地后，水库工人在工地俱乐部举行了欢迎会。水库工程局刘鹏局长致欢迎词，他说明兴修大伙房水库是工农联盟的具体表现，水库工程的主要目的是解除浑河泛滥和减轻辽河下游水患，使农业生产不再受洪水的危害。水库修成后还可以灌溉三万垧稻田，帮助农民增加生产。同时对于水库的修建计划做了扼要的介绍。报告后农民代表就参观了正在施工中的输水道工程，各种施工机械，空气压缩机场，压钎子厂等主要工地和厂房。
    农民们参观正在施工中的水库输水道工程，看到凿岩队工人在滴水结冰的山洞中，夜以继日地紧张劳动的情况，便亲切地向他们表示感谢。抚南区英守村远大农业生产合作社主任郭玉章感动地说：“过去不明白工人的事，总以为他们比农民清闲，哪想到人家做活比咱们勤苦多了！”
    农民参观施工机械时，工人们特地开动挖土机，推土机以及自卸运土汽车给农民看。说明员和驾驶员并亲切地告诉农民，水库的工程将有很大一部分要用机械来做，只是修一条坝，就需用二十一种，七百三十五件机器，每一件机器的效能都要比手工工具大十几倍到几百倍。农民们亲眼看到机械化的好处，具体体会到国家实行社会主义工业化和首先发展重工业的重要性；只有国家工业化了，农村才能像大伙房水库工程那样用机器代替人作活，解放人的劳动力和提高劳动效能，使农民走向富裕。
    参观以后，农民和工人们又举行座谈会。互相报告了一九五三年生产上的成就，农民们纷纷表示保证响应党和政府的号召，积极开展互助合作运动，在一九五四年保证每亩地多打五升粮食，并大量种植蔬菜和饲养猪、羊、鸡积极支援大伙房水库的职工。工人也表示为了回答农民兄弟的关怀，一定努力钻研技术和工作，争取提前完成大伙房水库的工程。曾经参加治淮工程荣膺治淮模范的工人代表“三八”钻机组长朱秀成说：“在我初参加治淮工作时，还有些怀疑，觉得那样大的工程怎么修呢？可是在全国人民支援下，治淮工程中许多工程完成了！我一来到这里以后，就看到农民们经常送来蔬菜，又在冷天里帮助搭桥，想到这些，修好水库的劲头就提高了。”抚西区台山村农业生产合作社主任王士俊说：“看到工人老大哥不辞辛苦帮助我们修水库，我们都有说不出的感激。我除了积极把合作社领导好，还要动员全社种一百多亩蔬菜供给你们。”座谈会始终在充满亲密团结的气氛中进行着，工人和农民们像久别了的兄弟似的互相畅谈，并交换了通信地址和签名。座谈以后由抚顺市人民政府农林局局长李英、郊区党委宣传部部长于云卿代表参观的农民向大伙房水库全体职工献慰问信、献旗和各种农作物的优良品种。大伙房水库工程局副局长路云也代表职工献给市郊农民代表一面锦旗。晚七时，市郊农民代表和水库工程局职工举行了联欢晚会。
