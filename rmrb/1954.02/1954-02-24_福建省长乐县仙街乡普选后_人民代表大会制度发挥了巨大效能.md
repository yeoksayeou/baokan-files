After the popular election in Xianjie Township, Second District, Changle County, Fujian Province, in August of last year, the political power organization has become more sound and consolidated, and the People's Congress system has demonstrated great effectiveness. The township, through the People's Congress, publicized and implemented the national general line, mobilized farmers to sell surplus grain, participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and carry out winter production campaigns, achieving great success.

After the popular election, the seven specialized committees under the Xianjie Township People's Government made clear divisions of labor, established regular meeting systems, and fully utilized the role of each committee member. Previously, matters large and small were handled by a few key township cadres. A small number of township cadres were overwhelmed, while members of various committees had no work to do, and the work was still not done well. Now, each committee member has a job and power, sharing a certain amount of work tasks. General civil disputes in the township are directly handled by the mediation committee members of the electoral district. Only cases that the mediation committee members cannot solve alone are submitted to the mediation committee for research and handling. This resolves problems quickly, in no more than ten days. Eleven disputes that had been backlogged for a long time were resolved within three days after the popular election. In the past six months, the township has mediated 192 civil disputes, of which 150 were directly handled by the mediation committee members of each electoral district, thus making the masses more at ease with production and strengthening unity. Township government committee members are also able to free up more time to lead production. In addition to clarifying the division of labor, each committee has also paid attention to combining departmental work with central work, serving the central work. For example, the Civil Affairs Committee, in last year's summer harvest, combined the evaluation of production with the inspection of tilling work. When it was discovered that there were weeds in the late rice field of military family member Chen Huoming, it immediately urged the tilling group to remove the weeds. In the autumn harvest, it also combined and did a good job in the clearing of labor and accounting for the tilling. The Cultural and Educational Committee combined fertilizer accumulation with sanitation work in September of last year. The Public Security Committee actively collected materials and exposed the destructive activities of unscrupulous merchants in the grain purchasing work. The speculative grain merchant Chen Ximing was exposed by the Public Security Committee member Chen Zhangceng for hoarding grain. After the surplus grain was put into storage, the Armed Forces Committee immediately organized the militia to protect the grain and guard the warehouse. Much work was done proactively and in a timely manner.

In the past six months, the Xianjie Township People's Congress has held five meetings. Major township work has been discussed and decided by the congress, and then the representatives have implemented it among the masses. The fifth meeting of the first Xianjie Township People's Congress focused on discussing the publicity of the general line and the grain purchasing work. The representatives realized the benefits the general line brought to farmers from calculating accounts and comparisons. They guaranteed to deeply publicize and implement the general line and take the lead in selling surplus grain to the state. Chen Miguan and five other representatives guaranteed on the spot to sell 13,000 catties of surplus grain. Worker representatives Lin Shanchu and Lin Renzhu expressed that they would monitor the destructive activities of speculative grain merchants. After the meeting, the representatives went to the electoral districts to convey the message to the masses. Representative Dai Guiyue actively reflected the opinions and demands of the masses, educated rich peasant Dai Keqing to sell 4,900 catties of surplus grain, and mobilized women to carry grain for the masses who had no labor force. Worker representative Lin Shanchu also organized nine workers to help three mutual aid groups carry surplus grain to sell to the state. The active publicity and mobilization of the representatives made the township's grain purchasing plan a successful completion.

After the cadres and representatives actively publicized the general line, the masses' socialist consciousness has greatly increased, and their enthusiasm for participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and winter production has been unprecedentedly high. The two collapsed mutual aid groups have been reorganized, and the four mutual aid groups that were about to collapse have been consolidated after rectification, and a credit cooperative has been organized. Wang Tiedian's mutual aid group used to be a mutual aid group in name only, and all seven members of the group went into business. Now they have automatically corrected this, formulated a production plan, and concentrated their efforts on production. In the past month or so, a total of one agricultural production cooperative and twenty-six mutual aid groups in the township have formulated production plans. At present, 569 mu of land in the township have been planted with winter crops, and the winter planting area has expanded by 60 percent compared with last year. Moreover, more than 60 people go out to collect animal manure and accumulate fertilizer every day. (Teng Jian, Chen Kang)

    福建省长乐县仙街乡普选后
    人民代表大会制度发挥了巨大效能
    福建省长乐县第二区仙街乡自去年八月完成普选后，政权组织更加健全和巩固，人民代表大会制度发挥了巨大的效能。该乡通过人民代表大会宣传贯彻国家总路线，动员农民出卖余粮、参加互助合作组织和开展冬季生产运动，获得很大成绩。
    普选后，仙街乡人民政府所属七个专门委员会作了明确的分工，建立经常的会议制度，充分发挥了每个委员的作用。从前，事无大小都归乡里几个主要干部处理，少数乡干部忙得不可开交，各委员会的委员却没有工作做，而工作还做不好。现在每个委员都有职有权，分担一定的工作任务。乡里一般民事纠纷都由本选区调解委员直接处理，只有调解委员单独不能解决的案件才交到调解委员会去研究处理。这样解决问题很快，最多不超过十天；从前积压了很久的十一件纠纷，普选后三天就解决了。半年来全乡调解了民事纠纷一百九十二件，其中由各选区调解委员直接处理的就有一百五十件，因而使群众更加安心生产，加强了团结。乡政府委员也能够抽出更多的时间领导生产。各个委员会除了明确分工外，并都注意到部门工作结合中心工作，为中心工作服务。如民政委员会在去年夏收中，结合丰产评比运动检查了代耕工作，当发现军属陈伙明的晚稻田里有杂草时，马上督促代耕组去除草；秋收中并结合作好了代耕的清工算账。文教委员会在去年九月份结合积肥，搞好了卫生工作。治安委员会在购粮工作中，积极收集材料，揭发奸商的破坏活动；投机粮商陈细命囤积粮食，就被治安委员陈章层检举出来。余粮入仓后，武装委员会马上组织民兵保粮护仓。许多工作做得又主动又及时。
    半年来，仙街乡人民代表大会召开过五次会议，乡里重大工作都经大会讨论决定，然后由代表贯彻到群众中去。该乡第一届人民代表大会第五次会议，集中讨论了宣传总路线和购粮工作，代表们从算账、对比中认识到总路线给农民带来的好处，纷纷保证要深入宣传贯彻总路线，带头把余粮卖给国家。陈密官等五个代表当场保证卖出余粮一万三千斤。工人代表林善楚、林仁柱表示要监视投机粮商的破坏活动。会后，代表们分头深入选区向群众进行传达。代表戴桂月积极反映群众的意见和要求，教育富农戴可清卖出余粮四千九百斤，并发动妇女替没有劳动力的群众挑粮。工人代表林善楚也组织了九个工人帮助三个互助组挑余粮卖给国家。代表们的积极宣传动员，使全乡购粮计划胜利完成。
    干部和代表积极宣传总路线后，群众的社会主义觉悟有了很大提高，参加互助合作组织和冬季生产的积极性空前高涨。两个垮台的互助组已经重新组织起来，四个将要垮台的互助组经过整顿也巩固下来，并组织了一个信用合作社。王铁殿互助组过去是挂个互助组的名，全组七户组员都去做生意，现在也已经自动纠正过来，订了生产计划，全组集中力量进行生产。近一个多月来，全乡已有一个农业生产合作社、二十六个互助组订出生产计划。目前，全乡有五百六十九亩地已种上冬季作物，冬种面积比去年扩大了百分之六十。而且每天有六十多人出外拾畜粪积肥。　（滕健、陈康）
