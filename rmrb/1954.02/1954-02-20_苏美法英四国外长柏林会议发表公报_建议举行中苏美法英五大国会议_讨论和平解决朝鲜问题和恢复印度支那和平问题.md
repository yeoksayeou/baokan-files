    The Foreign Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, V.M. Molotov, J.F. Dulles, G. Bidault, and A. Eden, met in Berlin from January 25 to February 18, 1954. They reached the following agreement:
    I、 The Foreign Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States, France and the the United Kingdom meeting in Berlin, bearing in mind that the establishment of a unified and independent Korea by peaceful means would be an important factor in easing international tension and restoring peace in other parts of Asia;
    Suggest that representatives of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and other countries with armed forces participating in the Korean War and willing to attend the conference, meet in Geneva on April 26, 1954, with a view to achieving a peaceful settlement of the Korean question;
    Agree that the issue of restoring peace in Indochina shall also be discussed at that conference, at which time representatives of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries will be invited to participate;
    It is understood that neither the invitation to, nor the holding of, the above-mentioned meeting shall be deemed to imply diplomatic recognition in any case where it has not hitherto been accorded.
    II、The Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, France, and the United Kingdom, are convinced that an agreement on the question of disarmament, or at least on a substantial reduction in armaments, would greatly contribute to the settlement of international disputes necessary for the establishment of lasting peace;
    In the future, they will exchange views with each other in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the United Nations Resolution of November 28, 1953, in order to promote a smooth resolution of this issue.
    The Four Foreign Ministers have fully exchanged views on the German question, the European security question, and the Austrian question, but they have failed to reach an agreement on these issues.
