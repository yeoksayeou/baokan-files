    Fudan University Physics Department Successfully Develops Hot-Cathode X-ray Tube with Embedded Tungsten Target
    The X-ray tube research laboratory of the Physics Department of Fudan University has successfully developed a hot-cathode X-ray tube with an embedded tungsten target. This type of X-ray tube has very stable performance, can withstand high voltages of over 90,000 volts, and can reach a current of up to 10 milliamperes. After trial use, the high vacuum inside the tube can be maintained completely, and the emitted X-rays are very strong. The laboratory has used the successfully trial-produced tube to take several chest X-rays of human bodies. The photos are clear and can be used for reliable diagnosis of medical conditions.
    As an important medical device, X-ray machines, except for the X-ray tube, can already be manufactured by the Shanghai Precision Medical Equipment Factory. Chinese experts have tried to manufacture X-ray tubes using oxygen-free copper steel, but this is the first time using a tungsten target. Tungsten has a high melting point, a high volatilization point, and a radiation wavelength that has a very good effect on medical fluoroscopy. China has abundant tungsten production, and using tungsten to manufacture X-ray tubes is inexpensive. Currently, the X-ray tube research laboratory of the Physics Department of Fudan University is conducting further research in order to simplify procedures and create reliable standard technical procedures to provide technical data for trial production by the Shanghai Precision Medical Equipment Factory.

    复旦大学物理系研制嵌有钨靶的热电子式爱克斯光管成功
    复旦大学物理系爱克斯光管研制实验室研制嵌有钨靶的热电子式爱克斯光管成功。这种爱克斯光管，性能十分稳定，能耐高电压九万伏以上，电流可达十毫安。经过试用，管内高真空度完全能够保持，发出的爱克斯光很强。实验室曾用试制成功的管子拍摄过几张人体胸部的照片。照片清晰，可供医疗上作可靠的病情诊断。
    作为医疗上重要器械的爱克斯光机，除其中爱克斯光管外，上海精密医疗器械厂已能制造。我国专家曾试用无氧铜钢制造过爱克斯光管，但采用钨靶这还是第一次。钨靶熔点高，挥发点高，辐射波长，对医疗透视效果很好。我国钨的出产丰富，用钨制造爱克斯光管，成本低廉。现在，复旦大学物理系爱克斯光管研制实验室正在作进一步的研究，以便简化手续，作出可靠的标准技术程序，为上海精密医疗器械厂提供试制生产的技术资料。
