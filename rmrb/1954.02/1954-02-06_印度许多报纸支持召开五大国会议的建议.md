Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, February 5th: Indian newspapers support the proposal to convene a five-power conference with China's participation and criticize the United States' position of obstructing a five-power conference at the four-power foreign ministers' meeting.

	The "Assam Tribune," published in Assam, believes that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China is "completely justified." The newspaper called Dulles' position at the Berlin conference "bad diplomacy." The "National Herald" criticized the United States' position at the Berlin conference and expressed full support for the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-power conference, considering it a "measure to further ease international tensions."

	The "Amrita Bazar Patrika," the West Bengal provincial government's newspaper, sharply criticized Dulles' attacks on the People's Republic of China at the Berlin conference. The newspaper believes that the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, the European Defense Community, and the so-called "release" of prisoners of war in Korea and the sabotage of the Korean political conference are all examples of the US ruling clique's aggressive policies.

	The independent newspaper "The Land" commented on the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a five-power conference in an editorial titled "Major Issues": "The US Secretary of State not only opposed this proposal, but he also attacked the Chinese Foreign Minister with rude words." The newspaper wrote: "The actions of the US ruling clique prove their intention to maintain international tensions."

	The editorial of the official newspaper "Rashtra Doot," published in Jaipur, wrote: Molotov's proposal to convene a five-power conference proves that the Soviet Union hopes to resolve not only European issues but all international issues, in order to clear away the war clouds looming over the international political stage. It is quite obvious that such problems cannot be solved if Asia's largest country, the People's Republic of China, is ignored. The editorial said: Who is hindering the establishment of peace? Which country is trying to push the world into the abyss of war? A careful analysis of international events proves that the United States is opposing the establishment of peace.

    印度许多报纸支持召开五大国会议的建议
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社德里讯：印度报纸支持召开有中国参加的五大国会议并批评美国在四国外长会议上阻挠五大国会议的立场。
    在阿萨姆出版的“阿萨姆论坛报”认为，苏联关于召开有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议的建议是“完全有根据的”。该报把杜勒斯在柏林会议上的立场称做是“不好的外交”。“国民先驱报”指责美国在柏林会议上的立场，并表示完全支持苏联关于召开五大国会议的建议，认为这是“进一步缓和国际紧张局势的措施”。
    印度西孟加拉省政府机关报“划时代报”尖锐抨击杜勒斯在柏林会议上对中华人民共和国的攻击，该报认为，北大西洋侵略集团，欧洲防务集团，以及所谓“释放”在朝鲜的战俘和破坏朝鲜政治会议，都是美国统治集团侵略政策的实例。
    独立报纸“大地报”在题为“主要问题”的社论中评论苏联关于召开五大国会议的建议说：“美国国务卿不仅反对这个建议，他还对中国外交部部长用粗暴的话进行攻击。”该报写道：“美国统治集团的行动证明了它们打算保持国际紧张局势。”
    在斋浦尔出版的官方报纸“拉斯特拉杜特报”的社论写道：莫洛托夫的召开五大国会议的建议，证明了苏联希望解决的不仅是欧洲问题，而且是所有的国际问题，以期廓清弥漫在国际政治舞台上的战争云雾。十分明显，如果忽视亚洲最大的国家中华人民共和国，这类问题是不能解决的。社论说：试问是谁在阻碍建立和平呢？哪一个国家竭力把世界推向战争的深渊呢？仔细地分析一下国际事件，就证明是美国在反对建立和平。
