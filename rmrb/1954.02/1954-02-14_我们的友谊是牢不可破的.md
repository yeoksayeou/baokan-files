    Our Friendship is Unbreakable
    By Xie Bushuyev, Lathe Operator, Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory
    Stalin Prize Winner
    Not long ago, our workshop received a letter from China with my name on it. Chinese comrades sent me New Year's greetings in the letter and wished me new achievements in my work.

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent me a gift: a 1954 diary.

    I recall those days in People's China. I remember how warmly we, members of the Soviet trade union delegation, were received wherever we went. In Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, and Nanjing, we were treated as the closest of friends. While visiting a machine manufacturing plant in Shenyang, the workers asked me to demonstrate my operating methods on a lathe. I was very happy to do this.

    I gave a demonstration on a Soviet lathe produced by our "Red Proletarian" factory. With the help of a translator, I explained and answered questions from the workers. When I finished my operation, it was found that the production efficiency was ten to fifteen times faster than the original quota. The workers immediately picked up the cutting tool, measured it, and drew it.

    I met many Chinese lathe operators. They told me about the changes that had taken place in their lives since the establishment of the People's Government.

    An advanced producer from Shenyang said to me: "Now we are the creators of a happy life, and we are building a strong national industry with the fraternal help of the Soviet Union. We will live a happier and richer life."

    When I returned from China, my comrades asked me in detail about the construction of a new life in the People's Republic of China, and they were all happy for the achievements of the working people in our brother country. I brought back to our factory a banner and a silk portrait of Comrade Mao Zedong, which were gifts from the workers in Shenyang. A dove of peace, carefully carved from coal by a Chinese master, was passed from one person to another.

    In answering the workers' many questions about China, I looked at my diary, recalled the scenes of meeting with Chinese workers and engineers, and talked about the enthusiastic life of the People's China, which is striding towards its bright future. The workers in our workshop listened with great interest to my introduction of the large-scale construction projects in People's China. I personally witnessed the construction project of national significance in the Huai River basin. I saw how hard tens of thousands of builders, conquering nature, were working there. Responding to the call of their beloved Communist Party, they came to work there from almost every corner of the country.

    Soviet workers listened with great concern to the narration of the labor achievements of the great Chinese people.

    Last summer, I met Ma Minghe, a lathe operator from Shenyang, at the Moscow Exhibition of the People's Republic of China's Industry and Agriculture. I met him in China, and it was so gratifying to see that he had mastered the high-speed metal cutting method very well! His cutting speed had reached 1,500 meters per minute. At the exhibition, Ma Minghe demonstrated on a state-of-the-art lathe produced by the Chinese machine manufacturing industry. My friend Ma Minghe wanted me to try this lathe as well. I confirmed that it was a truly excellent lathe. Chinese lathe manufacturers have achieved great success in making such good lathes.

    Ma Minghe visited our factory and came to the machine repair shop where I work. My old friend and I met again.

    Ma Minghe said: "Do you remember when you gave me your cutting tool as a gift? Now I am grinding high-speed cutting tools in our factory myself. The rapid multi-blade cutting method, first adopted by Soviet workers, is also becoming increasingly popular in other factories in China."

    We, the Soviet people, are excitedly watching how the Chinese people are building their national industry. We are very happy about the smooth construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the newborn of China's automobile manufacturing industry. We are very willing to exchange experiences with our Chinese comrades and give them the necessary technical assistance.

    Many future leaders of the machine repair shop of the automobile manufacturing plant being built in China are now doing production internships in our machine repair shop. Wang Daxun, the director of the workshop, Liu Qingyue, the foreman of the technical department, Qin Qinghua, the foreman, and other comrades are learning to apply the advanced experience accumulated by our collective work over the years.

    Liu Qingyue studies advanced methods of repairing lathes and understands the operation process of new equipment production. Mikhail Vasilyevich Dodorov, the leader of the major machine repair team, provides Comrade Liu Qingyue with a lot of technical assistance.

    Foreman Qin Qinghua has successfully repaired many complex lathes, including six-spindle semi-automatic lathes.

    Foreman Niu Renhai is working confidently on lathes, boring machines, and turret lathes while apprenticing, and is manufacturing many parts for large presses. There is no doubt that he will work very smoothly in the new automobile manufacturing plant in his own country in the future.

    Chinese experts are conducting production internships in Soviet enterprises in a friendly atmosphere. Our workers are doing everything possible to help their Chinese comrades and pass on their rich experience to them. This is also a clear proof of the great friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union.

    We know that Chinese workers and engineers are very willing to learn from the experience of Soviet comrades, so we are happy to impart this experience to enrich the knowledge of Chinese comrades and help them better exert production efficiency, develop industry, and transform agriculture. The friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people is eternal, and no one can destroy this friendship.

    我们的友谊是牢不可破的
    莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂镟工
    斯大林奖金获得者  谢·布舒耶夫
    不久以前，我们车间收到了一封从中国寄来的信，信上写着我的名字。中国的同志们在信里向我祝贺新年，并预祝我在劳动中获得新的成就。
    中华全国总工会给我寄来了一份礼物：一本一九五四年的记事日历。
    我回想起自己在人民中国的那些日子。我记得，我们苏联工会代表团团员无论到什么地方，人们都是如何殷勤地接待我们。在北京，在沈阳，在上海，在南京，处处都把我们当作最亲密的朋友来款待。在沈阳参观一个机器制造厂时，工人们要求我在镟床上表演我的操作方法。这是我很乐意做的。
    我在我们的“红色无产者”工厂出产的苏联镟床上，进行了示范表演。靠着翻译同志的帮助，我作了解说，并答复了工人们提出的问题。当我的操作结束时，发现生产效率要比原来的定额快十倍到十五倍。工人们立刻拿起切削刀，量它，把它画下来。
    我会见了很多中国镟工。他们向我叙述了人民政权建立以后在生活上发生的那些变化。
    沈阳的一个先进生产者向我说：“现在我们是幸福生活的创造者，我们在苏联的兄弟般的帮助下建设着强大的本国的工业。我们将生活得更加幸福和富裕。”
    当我从中国回来时，同志们都向我仔细打听在中华人民共和国建设新的生活的情况，都为兄弟国家劳动人民的成就感到高兴。我给我们工厂带回了一面锦旗和一幅丝织的毛泽东同志的肖像，这是沈阳工人给我们的礼物。一个由中国的名手用石炭精心雕制的和平鸽，从这个人的手里传到那个人的手里。
    在回答工人们关于中国的许多问题时，我看着自己的日记，回忆着与中国的工人和工程师会晤的情景，谈到正在向自己的光明前途迈进的人民中国的那种热情澎湃的生活情形。我们车间的工人极感兴趣地听我介绍人民中国的大规模建设工程。我曾亲眼看见淮河流域的具有全民意义的建筑工程。我看见成千成万征服自然的建设者在那里多么努力地工作着。他们响应自己敬爱的共产党的号召，几乎是从全国各个角落到那儿来工作的。
    苏联工人极其关怀地倾听了关于伟大的中国人民的劳动功绩的叙述。
    去年夏天，我在莫斯科中华人民共和国工农业展览会上遇见了沈阳的镟工马鸣贺。我在中国结识了他，现在看见他已经很好地掌握了高速金属切削法，这是多么令人高兴啊！他的切削速度已经达到了每分钟一千五百公尺。展览会上，马鸣贺在一台中国机器制造业出产的最新式的车床上表演。我的朋友马鸣贺要我也在这台车床上试一下。我证实了这是真正优良的车床。中国的车床制造者获得了巨大的成就，造出了这样好的车床。
    马鸣贺访问了我们的工厂，到我所工作的机械修配车间来。我们老朋友又见面了。
    马鸣贺说：“你还记得你把自己的切削刀送给我作为礼物的事吗？现在我自己正在我们的工厂里磨制高速切削刀。苏联工人首先采用的快速多刃切削法，也在中国的其他工厂得到了日益普遍的推广。”
    我们，苏联人民，都很兴奋地注视着中国人民是在怎样建设着本国的工业。中国汽车制造业的初生儿——第一汽车制造厂的顺利建设，很使我们高兴，我们很愿意与中国的同志们交流经验，给他们以必要的技术帮助。
    正在中国建设着的汽车制造厂的机械修配车间的许多未来的领导者，现在正在我们的机械修配车间进行生产实习。车间主任王达训、技术部领班刘清岳、工长秦庆华和其他一些同志，都正在学会运用我们多年来集体工作所积累的先进经验。
    刘清岳研究修配车床的先进方法，了解新装备品生产的操作过程。机械大修小组组长麦哈依尔·瓦西里也维奇·多道罗夫给予刘清岳同志以很多的技术帮助。
    工长秦庆华成功地修配了许多复杂的车床，包括六个主轴的半自动车床在内。
    工长牛仁海一面见习，一面在镟床、镗床、转塔车床上很有把握地工作着，并制造了大型压榨机的许多零件。毫无疑问，他将来在自己祖国的新的汽车制造厂中也会工作得很顺利的。
    中国专家们在苏联企业里在友好的气氛中进行着生产实习。我国工人想尽一切方法帮助中国的同志们，把自己丰富的经验传授给他们。这也是中苏两大民族伟大友谊的一个明证。
    我们知道，中国工人和工程师很愿意学习苏联同志的经验，因此我们也乐于传授这种经验，来充实中国同志的知识，帮助他们更好地发挥生产效能，发展工业，改造农业。苏联人民和中国人民的友谊是永恒的，任何人都不能破坏这种友谊。
