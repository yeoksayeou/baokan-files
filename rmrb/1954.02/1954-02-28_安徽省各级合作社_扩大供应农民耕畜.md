    Cooperatives at All Levels in Anhui Province
    Expand Supply of Draught Animals to Farmers
    Cooperatives at all levels in Anhui Province have expanded the supply of draught animals to farmers this year. According to statistics from the six districts of Lu'an and Huizhou and three counties of Chuxian district, supply and marketing cooperatives are planning to supply more than 5,200 draught cattle to farmers this year. The Feixi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative is preparing to supply 500 draught cattle, and more than 100 have already been pre-sold to farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives in the Huaibei area, which breeds more draught animals, are preparing to help farmers sell the draught animals they need to sell.
    Many supply and marketing cooperatives in Anhui Province paid attention to the management of draught animals last year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Jinzhai, Huoqiu, and Shou County purchased 1,200 draught cattle for farmers from both inside and outside the province in the third quarter of last year. The Jieshou County (formerly a city) Supply and Marketing Cooperative, a distribution center for draught animals, purchased and sold more than 31,000 draught animals on behalf of farmers in the twenty months of the year before last and last year. These draught animals were subject to 280 million yuan less exploitation than if farmers had bought and sold them from private livestock dealers.

    安徽省各级合作社
    扩大供应农民耕畜
    安徽省各级供销合作社今年扩大了对农民的耕畜供应工作。据六安、徽州两专区和滁县专区三个县的统计，今年供销合作社有计划地供应给农民的耕牛达五千二百多头。现在肥西县的供销合作社准备供应的五百头耕牛，已经向农民预售了一百多头。繁殖耕畜较多的淮北地区供销合作社准备帮助农民把需要出售的耕畜卖出去。
    安徽省有许多供销合作社在去年就注意了耕畜的经营。金寨、霍邱和寿县等三个供销合作社，在去年第三季度曾为农民从省内外购进了一千二百头耕牛。耕畜集散地的界首县（原为市）供销合作社，在前年和去年的二十个月中，为农民代购代销了三万一千多头耕畜。这些耕畜比农民从贩卖牲口的私商手里买进卖出，要少受二亿八千多万元的剥削。
