    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th: Former US President Truman, speaking at the "Americans for Democratic Action" on the evening of the 5th, admitted that the US economy has begun a comprehensive "recession." He said: "The recession that occurred in agriculture last spring has now spread to the cities... a depression will occur similarly." In his speech, Truman mocked the "miracle" promised by the Republicans, and said: "What surprises me is that the President's economic report actually says that there is no real recession at present..."
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: TASS, Washington, 6th: US Secretary of Agriculture Benson, speaking at a joint meeting of the two houses of Congress' Economic Committee on the 4th, said that the decline of American agriculture "is serious enough to once again cause the fear that a comprehensive depression is forming."
    Due to the high prices set by monopoly capital, the inventory of agricultural products that cannot be sold continues to increase.
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th: London dispatch: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler recently said in the House of Commons that the so-called US trade "recession" has begun. Butler pointed out that the US industrial production index has fallen from 137 in July last year to 128 in December. He said: "I hope you will draw the following conclusions from the impact of these figures on our exports and various index numbers: In fact, the so-called recession has begun, and we are already in the process."

    美国统治集团承认美国经济已开始“衰退”
    【新华社十一日讯】纽约消息：美国前任总统杜鲁门五日晚上在“美国人民主行动协会”上发表演说时，承认美国经济已开始全面“衰退”。他说：“去年春天在农业中发生的衰退目前已经蔓延到城市，……萧条将同样发生。”杜鲁门在演说中嘲笑共和党所诺许的“奇迹”，并且说：“使我奇怪的是，总统的经济报告竟说目前并没有真正的衰退……”
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿六日讯：美国政府农业部长本逊四日在国会两院联合经济委员会会议上发言时说，美国农业的下降“已严重到足以再一次引起这样的恐惧，即：一次全面的萧条正在形成中”。
    由于垄断资本规定高昂的价格，推销不出去的农产品存货在继续增加。
    【新华社十一日讯】伦敦消息：英国财政大臣巴特勒最近在下院说，所谓美国的贸易“衰退”已经开始。巴特勒指出，美国工业生产指数已经从去年七月份的一百三十七降至十二月份的一百二十八。他说：“我希望你们从这些数字对我们的出口和各种指数数字的影响得出如下结论：事实上，所谓衰退已经开始，而我们已经在这个过程中了。”
