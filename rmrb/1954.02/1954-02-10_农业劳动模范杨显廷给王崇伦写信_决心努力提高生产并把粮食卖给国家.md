    Agricultural Labor Model Yang Xianting Writes to Wang Chonglun, Resolves to Strive to Improve Production and Sell Grain to the State
    Comrade Wang Chonglun:
    When all of our cooperative members were studying the general line of the state during the transition period, we saw your model deeds in the newspaper of completing three to four years' worth of work in one year and creating huge amounts of wealth for the country. Your spirit of selfless labor for the country's socialist industrialization has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of all our cooperative members. In order to support the country's industrial construction, all our cooperative members sold all of our surplus grain, more than 100,000 jin, to the state.
    In recent years, we have deeply realized from our actual lives that only when our country's industry develops can it improve the production and life of farmers. The worker comrades have manufactured all the horse-drawn farm implements for our production cooperative: in the spring, we use horse-drawn rakes to rake firewood, sowing is done with seeders, summer weeding is done with cultivators, wheat is harvested with harvesters, and threshing is done with threshers. These machines have reduced a lot of our heavy labor and have also greatly improved our production. We understand that when the country's industry develops, it can produce more, better, and cheaper agricultural machinery and daily necessities, which can further improve farmers' production and make their lives richer and more fulfilling. We are determined to work hard to improve production and sell grain to the state to support our worker elder brothers and the country's industrial construction.
    In 1952, I gloriously participated in the Chinese Farmers' Delegation to the Soviet Union and personally saw how happy and joyful the lives of the great Soviet people are. I saw the Lenin Collective Farm in Ukraine, which uses machines for all production. Farmers drive tractors and combines and work happily. Because of the high yield and high income, the farmers all live a prosperous life. I know that their happy life today is the result of long-term hard work. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. We must learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard work and active production and advance towards the socialist road. Our production cooperative has added carts and horses in the winter, selected seeds, and accumulated more manure, making preparations for increasing grain production this year.
    I and all our cooperative members are determined to learn from your spirit of working wholeheartedly for the country's construction cause, actively produce, and join hands with our worker elder brothers to work together for the country's industrialization and for the early arrival of a socialist society!

    农业劳动模范杨显廷给王崇伦写信
    决心努力提高生产并把粮食卖给国家
    王崇伦同志：
    当我们全体社员学习国家过渡时期的总路线的时候，在报纸上看到了您一年完成三、四年工作量、为国家创造巨量财富的模范事迹。您为国家社会主义工业化而忘我劳动的精神，大大鼓舞了我们全体社员的生产情绪。为了支持国家工业建设，我们全体社员把余粮十万余斤全部卖给国家。
    几年来，我们从实际生活中深深体会到，只有我们国家工业发展了，才能提高农民的生产和生活。工人同志们给我们生产合作社制造了全部马拉农具：我们春天搂柴使上了马拉搂柴机，播种使上了播种机，夏锄使上了铲趟机，割麦子使上了收割机，打麦子使上了脱谷机。这些机械减轻我们很多繁重的劳动，还使我们大大提高了生产。我们懂得国家的工业发展了，就能生产更多更好更便宜的农业机器和日用品，才能使农民的生产更提高，生活过得更富裕、更美满。我们决心努力提高生产，并把粮食卖给国家，支援工人老大哥和国家的工业建设。
    一九五二年我光荣地参加了中国农民访苏代表团，亲眼看到了伟大的苏联人民的生活是多么幸福愉快。我看到了乌克兰的列宁集体农庄，全部使用机器进行生产，农民驾驶着拖拉机和康拜因，愉快地劳动着；因为产量高，收入多，农民都过着富裕的生活。我知道，他们今天的幸福生活，是长期艰苦努力所换来的。苏联的今天正是我们的明天，我们一定学习苏联人民艰苦努力、积极生产的精神，向着社会主义道路前进。我们生产合作社在冬季增添了车马，挑好了种子，多攒粪肥，为今年增产粮食作好了准备工作。
    我和我们全体社员决心学习您全心全意为国家建设事业而努力的精神，积极生产，和工人老大哥携起手来，共同为国家工业化，为社会主义社会早日到来而奋斗！
