    In the Tianqiao district, where the working people of Beijing live, a magnificent new building has recently been added. The national flags of China and the Soviet Union fly on its roof. This is the new site of the Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital.

    The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital was established in June 1952 in our country by the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union. It embodies the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. Soviet experts in the hospital use the most advanced medical technology to treat our people and disseminate advanced Soviet medical science and technology, cultivating new-style medical personnel for our country. Most of the medical equipment and medicines used in the hospital are also supplied by the Union of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the Soviet Union.

    The new hospital building is built entirely according to the specifications of the latest Soviet hospitals. The main building of the hospital is a three-story "出"-shaped building. The entire building is magnificent and clean, with more than 600 spacious rooms. On the highest floor of the front of the building, there is an inscription by Chairman Mao, the great leader of our people: "Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital". Four huge columns made of natural marble stand in front of the main entrance. The walls above the window frames on each floor are engraved with the "lintels" commonly found in ancient Chinese buildings, which are very beautiful.

    The entire architectural structure and installation of the hospital are permeated with advanced Soviet medical ideas, full of meticulous care and attention for the patients. Upon entering the main entrance, there is a large waiting hall that can accommodate 400 people at the same time. A cross-shaped sofa is placed in the center of the hall, and sofas are arranged alternately around the corners and pillars for patients to rest. The walls, pillars, and floors of the hall are made of terrazzo in reddish-brown and light yellow, giving the entire hall a soft and comfortable atmosphere. The registration office, dispensary, medical department, and information desk are all located in the waiting hall. Patients can complete registration and medicine collection without having to run back and forth. There are also comfortable small waiting rooms near the various clinics. In the waiting rooms and registration offices for pediatrics and dermatology/venereology, patients with infectious diseases are strictly separated from other patients. The pediatrics clinic is located on the west side of the main building, and the dermatology/venereology clinic is located on the east side. Both clinics have separate entrances and exits to avoid infection.

    The wards are located on the south side of the rear building, where there is plenty of sunshine. The entire south wall of the ward is made of transparent floor-to-ceiling glass windows, hung with light green silk curtains. The walls inside the room are light blue or light green, making the entire ward have soft and comfortable lighting. Pushing open the glass window, there is a narrow sun porch where patients can rest and sunbathe. The hospital plans to build a garden in the large area below the sun porch. Each ward usually has only two or three beds, and the largest ward has only six beds. Each bed is equipped with headphones for listening to the radio and a signal button for calling doctors or nurses. One patient listening to the radio will not disturb the rest of other patients. Each department's ward has a dining room. Next to the dining room is a spacious lounge. The lounge is equipped with various recreational equipment and pictorials for patients to pass the time. There is a library and a patient club on the third floor, and a platform and patient solarium on the roof. Patients living in such a comfortable environment will not feel lonely or bored. There is also an auditorium on the third floor that can accommodate 600 people. This is not only a place for hospital staff to gather, but also a place for Soviet experts to systematically impart advanced Soviet medical experience to our country's medical workers.

    The west end of the main building is the patient's kitchen. It is about 100 meters away from the main building, and the interior is entirely terrazzo flooring and white tile walls. The kitchen is divided into a Chinese food stove and a Western food stove, and a Soviet nutrition expert is responsible for formulating the meals for each patient according to their condition. The patient's meals are delivered to the dining room and wards by insulated carts. The cooked food and uncooked food are stored separately on the upper floor and in the basement of the kitchen. In order to maintain cleanliness, the cleaning and hygiene processes of these two parts are strictly separated. The leftover food and tableware that have been eaten are not mixed with the clean food and tableware, but are sent to the kitchen's disinfection room through a certain entrance. The basement also has a special bathroom for kitchen staff to take a bath and change into work clothes before going to work every day. Implementing such a sanitary and scientifically sound nutritional system in the kitchen will ensure that diseases are not transmitted and that patients are provided with nutritious, clean, and palatable meals, playing a great role in nutritional therapy and helping patients recover their health as soon as possible.

    The hospital has all departments except obstetrics and gynecology. Each department has Soviet experts, and the medical equipment and instruments are very complete. At present, there are nearly 60 Soviet medical experts in the hospital, all of whom have high medical theory and rich clinical experience. The physical therapy, hydrotherapy, and sports therapy clinics set up in the hospital, and the sleep therapy ward made of special soundproof wood, use the most advanced Soviet medical methods—X-ray therapy, electrotherapy, hydrotherapy, mud therapy, wax therapy, sports therapy, etc.—to treat various complex diseases. The hospital alone has seven X-ray machines, each with different uses. The four-tank hydrotherapy pool in the physiotherapy department is also the latest equipment in the world and can treat rheumatism, neuralgia, arthritis, and other diseases. After increasing equipment in the ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and stomatology departments, more complex operations can be performed.

    The Beijing Soviet Red Cross Hospital began outpatient service about a week after the opening of its new site and gradually admitted inpatients. The number of outpatients will increase from more than 400 per day in the past to 800 (excluding adjunctive therapy), and the number of beds will increase from 80 to more than 200. In order to disseminate advanced Soviet medical experience and help train our country's medical personnel, the hospital will continue to hold lectures and will also organize medical personnel from various places to visit once or twice a week to introduce all the facilities and systems of the hospital. Every year, medical personnel from medical units across the country will be recruited to the hospital for rotation, further study, or internships. In addition, the number of Chinese staff working in the hospital has increased from more than 300 to more than 700, of which more than 200 are medical personnel. They will work in this brand-new hospital, assisting Soviet medical experts and learning advanced Soviet medical technology at the same time.

    北京苏联红十字医院
    在北京劳动人民聚居的天桥地区，最近新添了一幢宏伟壮丽的建筑物。它的屋顶上飘扬着中苏两国的国旗。这就是北京苏联红十字医院的新址。
    北京苏联红十字医院是一九五二年六月由苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会在我国设立的。它体现了中苏两国人民的深厚友谊。院内的苏联专家用最先进的医疗技术给我国人民治病，并传播苏联医学方面的先进科学技术，为我国培养新型的医务人员。医院所用的大部分医疗设备和药品，也是由苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会供给的。
    医院的新建筑物是完全依照苏联最新式医院的规格建筑的。医院主楼是一座“出”字形的三层大厦。整个大厦壮丽洁净，拥有六百多间宽大的房间。大厦正面最高一层的墙壁上，镶砌着我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席题的“北京苏联红十字医院”。大厦正门前矗立着四个巨大的天然大理石砌成的柱子。每层楼房窗格上端的墙壁都刻着我国古建筑物常有的“额枋”，十分美观。
    整个医院的建筑结构和装设，都贯穿着苏联先进的医学思想，充满着对病人体贴入微的关怀和照顾。一进正门，便是宽大的可以同时容纳四百人的候诊大厅。大厅正中安设了十字形的大沙发，墙角和柱子周围都交错地布置着沙发，供病人休息。大厅的墙壁、柱子和地面，都是土红、淡黄色的水磨石，使得整个大厅充满着柔和与舒畅的气氛。挂号室、取药处、医务科和问询室都设在候诊大厅里。病人不用来回跑路，就能把挂号、取药等手续办好。各科诊疗室附近还设有舒适的小候诊室。在小儿科、皮肤花柳科候诊室和挂号处，还把有传染性的病人和其他病人严格分开。小儿科的门诊处设在主楼的西面，皮肤花柳科门诊处设在东面。两个门诊处都有单独的入口和出口，避免传染。
    病房设在主楼后层南面阳光最充足的地方。病房的南壁全部是通明透亮的落地玻璃窗，挂着淡绿色的绸质窗帘，房内墙壁呈淡蓝色或淡绿色，使得整个病房光线柔和、舒适。推开玻璃窗，外面是一条狭长的晒廊，病人可以在那里休息、晒太阳。晒廊下面的宽大地方，医院已计划布置一个花园。每个病房一般只放两三张病床，最大的病房也只有六张病床。每一张病床都装置有听无线电收音机的耳机和叫唤医生或护士的信号电钮。一个病人收听广播，不会扰乱其他病人的休息。每个科的病房都有餐厅。餐厅的旁边就是宽敞的休息室。休息室设有各种文娱用具和画报供病人消遣。三层楼上设有图书室和病人俱乐部，屋顶上有平台和病人日光室。病人生活在这样舒适的环境里，将不会感到寂寞和枯燥。三层楼上还有一个可容六百人的礼堂。这里不仅是医院工作人员集会的地方，也将是苏联专家系统地把苏联先进医学经验传授给我国医务工作者的场所。
    主楼西端是病人的厨房。它离主楼约有一百公尺，室内一律是水磨石地面和洁白的磁砖墙。厨房分中餐灶和西餐灶，专有一位苏联营养专家负责根据病情配制每个病人的饭食。病人的饭食由保温的小车送到餐厅和病房。已制成的熟食品和未制的生食品分别放在厨房的上层和地下室。为了保持清洁，这两部分的清洁卫生处理过程严格地分开。已吃过的残食和碗筷，不和干净的食品、碗筷混在一起，由一定的入口处送到厨房的消毒室。地下室还有专设的浴室，是给厨房工作人员在每天上班以前洗澡、换工作服用的。推行这样一个合乎卫生科学的营养制度的厨房，将保证不传染疾病并供给病人营养丰富的清洁可口的饭食，发挥极大的营养治疗作用，帮助病人早日恢复健康。
    医院除妇产科外，其他各科都有。每一个科里都有苏联专家，医疗设备和器械很齐全。目前，院内有近六十位苏联医学专家，他们都具有很高的医学理论和丰富的临床经验。院内设置的理疗、水疗、体育治疗等诊疗室，和特殊的隔音木料制成的睡眠疗法病房，用苏联最先进的医疗方法——爱克斯光治疗、电疗、水疗、泥疗、腊疗、体育疗法等，治疗各类比较复杂的病症。院内单是爱克斯光机就有七台，每台都有不同的用途。理疗科的四槽水池，也是世界上最新的设备，可以治疗风湿、神经痛、关节炎等疾病。眼科、耳鼻喉科及口腔科等增加设备后，可以进行更多的复杂手术。
    北京苏联红十字医院新址开幕后一星期左右就开始门诊，逐渐接收住院病人。门诊人数将由过去每天四百多人增加到八百人（辅助治疗除外），病床由八十张增加到二百多张。为了传播苏联先进医学经验和帮助培养我国医务人员，该院今后除继续举办讲座外，每周将有组织地招待各地医务人员参观一次或两次，介绍该院的一切设施制度。每年并将从全国各医疗单位吸收医务人员到院轮流进修或实习。此外，在该院工作的我国工作人员已由三百多人增加到七百多人，其中医务人员已有二百多人。他们将在这所崭新的医院里，一面协助苏联医学专家工作，一面学习苏联先进医疗技术。
