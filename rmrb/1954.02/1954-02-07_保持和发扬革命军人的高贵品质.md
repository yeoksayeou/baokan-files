Maintain and Carry Forward the Noble Qualities of Revolutionary Soldiers

"To be able to do something is my greatest joy!"

Liu Changmin is from Yichuan Kuan Village, Guanli Township, 13th District, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province. He is a Communist Party member and a specially honored disabled soldier. He joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1945. In the army, he was a brave and skilled soldier, wounded many times, and made many contributions to the people. In 1949, he was wounded in battle, losing his sight and breaking his left arm.

Diligent study is Comrade Liu Changmin's greatest strength. He says, "Learning is a joyful thing." He often asks people to read newspapers to him or discuss issues. He subscribed to "Wendeng Mass" and a propagandist's handbook as his regular study materials. Since last spring, he has studied pamphlets about mutual aid and cooperation and the introduction of production experience. He also finished reading "How Steel Was Tempered" and "Report from the Gallows" – two famous works. He was greatly encouraged by these books. He said, "If Fuchik persisted in the revolutionary struggle under such difficult conditions, what is my situation?" He not only studies diligently but also leads the young people in the village to organize a study group.

Love of labor is also one of his strengths. Comrade Liu Changmin mobilized his whole family to participate in the mutual aid team. He is very concerned about the work of the mutual aid team, discussing matters with everyone and jointly solving problems within the team. Last spring, the mutual aid team expanded from six households to ten households. He discussed with all the team members, readjusted the labor force, and established three production groups, adopting the method of "big jobs done collectively by the whole team, small jobs done by groups." All team members were very satisfied. Seeing the lack of livestock and farm tools in the team, he bought a cow and a new-style walking plow according to the needs of the team members. On weekdays, he often goes to understand the thoughts of the team members and educates them, so the team is very united. Last spring, when planting corn, he saw that the team members had concerns, so he tried planting it on his own land.

"To be able to do something is my greatest joy," he often says to people. Comrade Liu Changmin always tries his best to participate in any labor he can. In addition to feeding pigs and livestock, he also does other work. Last winter, he shelled more than a thousand catties of raw rice by hand; during the wheat harvest, he helped the team members chop wheat stubble.

Comrade Liu Changmin can always protect the interests of the masses and care about their lives. Once, the county asked him to attend a meeting, and the district and village cadres prepared to send him by livestock. He said, "My legs are not broken, as long as someone leads me, that's enough!" Another time, he received disability benefits, and his mother planned to make clothes for the family. However, when he thought about the lack of feed in the mutual aid team, he convinced the whole family to lend the money for buying clothes to the mutual aid team. He said, "I will only be happy when everyone's life is better." Therefore, the masses in the whole village love and care for him. When he walks down the street, people come over to talk to him intimately or greet him.

In daily work, whenever he encounters people who boast about their achievements, complain a lot, or are negative and lazy, Comrade Liu Changmin always says, "Our achievements should be attributed to the Party and the people"; "This little achievement is nothing." He consistently obeys the leadership of the Party branch. Whenever he is notified of a meeting, he always attends the Party meetings on time. He said, "Only by participating in Party meetings can I receive the Party's education, improve myself, and do my job well." Once, the township held a meeting, and someone told him not to go to take care of him. He said, "I have no difficulty. If I don't participate in the Party meeting and don't understand the Party's central work, how can I work for the Party?"

Is a Hero Who Kills the Enemy, and an Excellent Teacher

Guo Zhidong is a revolutionary disabled soldier and a people's teacher - the director of teaching affairs at Chengguan Elementary School in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province. In the past, in battles, he risked his life to kill the enemy and was called a hero who kills the enemy; now, in the rear, he is dedicating himself to elementary education for the beautiful future of the motherland. He was rated as an outstanding elementary school teacher in Lingchuan County.

Guo Zhidong is from Luoyang, Henan. At the age of thirteen - in 1939, he joined the revolutionary army. In the arduous battles, he was wounded seven times and received the glorious title of "Hero Who Kills the Enemy." Once, in a battle with Japanese and puppet troops in Qinyang County, Henan, after his right leg was blown off, he left his beloved army and retired to Sanquan Village, Lingchuan, Shanxi in 1945.

Although the war made him lose his leg, it could not frustrate his fighting will. He devoted himself to another front - the cultural and educational front. He said, "Children are the precious wealth of the motherland, and I want to contribute everything to them."

Before joining the revolution, he had attended half a year of higher primary school. He knew that using his limited cultural knowledge to nourish the children was far from enough. He began to study hard, learning and teaching at the same time. Therefore, the teaching performance at Jishan Village Elementary School was very good. When the government transferred him to Chengguan Elementary School in 1953, the masses and students were reluctant to let him go.

Chengguan Elementary School in Lingchuan County was building school buildings in August 1953. Comrade Guo Zhidong and all the teachers and students participated in the labor together in their spare time. When he worked, he was like fighting a battle, he didn't care about anything. The students advised him to rest, but he always refused. He teaches history to Class 15, and the classroom for Class 15 is upstairs. Seeing that it was inconvenient for him to go upstairs with crutches, others told him not to go, but he said, "Don't bow your head to difficulties, let the difficulties worry about us." Once, he accidentally stepped into the air while going upstairs and fell down. The students helped him back to the dormitory. He rested for two days, and his legs and buttocks were still painful, but he went to class again. The teachers and students advised him to rest, but he said, "It's nothing, I can work." The Chengguan Elementary School site is divided into two places. When he was recruiting students in July 1953, he finished class in Xiguan and went to Beiguan to participate in the enrollment work. On the day of marking the papers, it suddenly rained heavily, and after the rain, there was more than a foot of water in the city. He still went to Xiguan on time with two wooden crutches.

He is modest and cautious with the teachers and actively helps them improve their teaching work. Yang Shirong teaches arithmetic. One day, when preparing a lesson, he encountered a problem and asked Comrade Guo Zhidong to study it until twelve o'clock in the evening. Afterwards, he said to people, "Director Guo helped me without sleeping in the middle of the night. His spirit of not fearing difficulties and being patient is worth learning from us." Guo Zhidong not only helps the teachers prepare lessons before class, but also listens to classes with the principal and checks the classroom teaching of each teacher. When Teacher Yao Jingan taught Class 17 the Chinese lesson "A Chicken," because he was not well prepared before class, he only drew the picture in class, and the students became impatient, and the classroom order became chaotic. After class, Comrade Guo Zhidong pointed out to him: drawing teaching is good and should be continued, but the picture should be drawn before class to avoid rushing in class and distracting the students' attention. When Teacher Zhang Xianhe taught arithmetic, he used the cramming method, taught a lot and fast, and the effect was not great. After Comrade Guo Zhidong listened to the class, he solicited the opinions of the students and gave Zhang Xianhe his opinions, asking him to pay attention to guiding the students to think, and not to only care about his own teaching, greedy for more and quicker.

    保持和发扬革命军人的高贵品质
    “能干点活，就是我最大的快乐！”
    刘长珉是山东荣成县十三区观里乡益川夼村人，共产党员，特等荣军。一九四五年他参加了中国人民解放军。在部队里他是个英勇善战的战士，负过多次伤，为人民立下了很多功劳。一九四九年在一次战斗中，他负了伤，双目失明，折断了左臂。
    努力学习是刘长珉同志的最大优点。他说：“学习是一件快乐的事。”他经常请人读书报给他听，或是研究问题。他订了“文登大众”和宣传员手册各一份，作为经常的学习材料。去年春季以来，他学习了关于互助合作及介绍生产经验的小册子。他还学完了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”和“绞索套着脖子时的报告”两部名著。他从这些书里得到了很大鼓舞。他说：“伏契克在那样困难的情况下还坚持着革命斗争，我这算得了什么？”他不但认真学习，还领导村中的青年人组织了一个学习小组。
    热爱劳动，也是他的优点。刘长珉同志动员全家参加了互助组。他十分关心互助组的工作，有事和大家商量，共同解决组内问题。去年春天，互助组由六户扩大到十户，他和全组组员商量，重新调整了劳动力，成立三个生产小组，采取“大活全组集体干，小活分组干”的办法，全体组员都很满意。他看到组内畜力、农具缺乏，又根据组员的要求买了一头牛和一部新式步犁。平日，他经常去了解组员的思想，向他们进行教育，因此，组内很团结。去年春天播种苞米时，他看到组员有顾虑，便在自己的地里试种。
    “能干点活，就是我最大的快乐。”他常常对人这样说。凡是能参加的劳动，刘长珉同志总是尽力参加。除喂猪和牲口之外，他还做些其他劳动。去年冬天，他用手扒了一千多斤生米；麦收中，他帮助组员铡麦头。
    刘长珉同志能处处爱护群众利益，关心群众生活。有一次县里请他去开会，区、村干部准备用牲口送他，他说：“我的腿没有坏，只要有人领我就可以了！”又有一次，他领了残废金，他母亲打算给家里人做衣服。但是，他一想到互助组缺乏饲料，便打通了全家人的思想，将买衣服的钱借给互助组。他说：“只要大家生活都好了，我才高兴。”因此，全村群众都爱戴他，关怀他。他在街上走过时，人们都走过来和他亲热地交谈或向他问好。
    在日常工作中有时碰到一些居功自夸、牢骚满腹、消极疲沓的人，刘长珉同志总是说：“我们的功劳应该归于党和人民”；“这点功劳算得什么”。他一贯服从党支部的领导，开会只要通知他，他总是按时出席党的会议。他说：“只有参加党的会议，才能得到党对自己的教育，提高自己，做好工作。”有一次乡里开会，有人为了照顾他，叫他不要去，他说：“我没有困难，不参加党的会议，不了解党的中心工作，怎么能为党工作呢？”

    是杀敌英雄，又是优秀教师
    郭志栋是一个革命残废军人，又是一个人民教师——山西陵川县城关高小的教导主任。过去在战斗里，他舍身杀敌，被称为杀敌英雄；现在在后方，他正为祖国美好的未来，献身小学教育事业。他被评为陵川县优秀小学教师。
    郭志栋是河南洛阳人。十三岁那年——一九三九年，他参加了革命部队。在艰苦的战斗里，他曾负了七次伤，得到“杀敌英雄”的光荣称号。有一次在河南沁阳县和日伪军的战斗中，他的右腿被炸掉后，就离开了他心爱的部队，在一九四五年退休到山西陵川三泉村。
    虽然战争使他失去了腿，但没有能挫折他战斗的意志，他投入了另一条战线——文化教育战线。他说：“儿童是祖国的宝贵财产，我要把一切贡献给儿童。”
    在参加革命前，他上过半年高小，他知道拿自己这点文化知识去滋养孩子们，是远远不够的。他开始努力学习着，一边学，一边教。因而在积善村小学的教学成绩很好。一九五三年政府调他往城关高小时，群众、学生都舍不得让他走。
    陵川县城关高小在一九五三年八月间修建校舍，郭志栋同志和全校师生在课余一起参加劳动。他劳动起来就和打仗一样，啥也顾不得了。同学们劝他休息，他总不肯。他教的是十五班的历史课，而十五班的教室是在楼上。旁人见他拄着双拐不便上楼，不叫他去，他说：“不要向困难低头，要叫困难见咱发愁。”有一次他上楼时不小心踏了空，摔下楼来。同学们把他扶回宿舍，他休养了两天，腿和臀部还痛哩，就又去上课。老师和同学们劝他休息，他说：“没有啥，能工作。”城关高小的校址分在两处，一九五三年七月间招生时，他在西关上完课又去北关参加招生工作。阅卷那天，忽然下大雨，雨后城内积水有一尺多深，他仍然拄着两个木拐按时去到西关。
    他对教师们谦虚谨慎，积极帮助他们改进教学工作。杨世荣教的是算术课，有一天在备课时遇到了问题，找郭志栋同志研究，一直到晚上十二点。事后他对人们说：“郭主任为了帮助我，半夜不睡觉，他这种不怕困难、耐心的精神，值得我们学习。”郭志栋不仅在课前帮助教师们备课，还和校长一起听课，检查每个教师的课堂教学。教师姚静安给十七班讲国语“一只鸡”一课时，因课前准备不够充足，到堂上才画图，同学们都不耐烦起来，课堂秩序就乱起来了。下课后，郭志栋同志给他指出：画图教学是好的，应继续发扬，但课前应把图画好，以免到堂上急抓，使同学们的注意力涣散。教师张先和讲算术课时，用填鸭式的方法，讲的又多又快，收效不大。郭志栋同志听了课，征求了同学的意见，给张先和同志提出了意见，要他注意引导学生思考，不可只顾自己讲，贪多求快。（靳启发）
