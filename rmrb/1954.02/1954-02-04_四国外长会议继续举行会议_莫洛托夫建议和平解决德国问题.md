Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 3rd: On February 1st, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference convened at the Soviet High Commissioner's Office in Germany on Unter den Linden, with Molotov serving as chairman. The four foreign ministers continued to discuss the second item on the agenda: "The German Question and the Task of Ensuring European Security."

	Bidault presented his preliminary views on this issue. He reiterated his agreement with the main points of the plan proposed by Eden at the January 29th meeting. He believed that this plan could serve as a basis for discussion, while reserving the right to propose additional opinions during the discussion process.

	Bidault commented on the composition of the supervisory committee, as stipulated in Eden's plan, for supervising the all-German elections. He advocated that the supervisory committee should include representatives from neutral countries, which, according to him, would facilitate the application of the majority principle when the committee passes resolutions.

	Bidault then spoke about Molotov's speech at the January 30th meeting. He said: He believes that Molotov's emphasis in his speech on the importance of holding free all-German elections is a "positive factor." At the same time, Bidault attempted to create the impression that genuine free elections could be guaranteed based on Eden's proposal.

	Bidault then addressed the Soviet government's proposition that, after the all-German elections, Germany should have genuine freedom to pursue its own domestic and foreign policies. This point, as Molotov made clear in his January 30th speech, cannot be achieved by Eden's plan. However, Bidault insisted that the requirement put forward by the Soviet delegation was in line with the arguments made by Western countries in their recent notes to the Soviet Union over the past two years. He also said that France does not advocate making Germany's participation in the "European Defense Community" a condition for German reunification, but on the other hand, does not consider it possible to prohibit Germany from doing so.

	Disregarding the facts, Bidault defended the Bonn Treaty, insisting that it was intended to accelerate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. However, everyone knows that this treaty stipulates that the United States, Britain, and France will enjoy the rights of occupying powers in West Germany for a long time to come.

	Eden then spoke, expressing full agreement with linking the German question to the issue of ensuring European security. He said that the solution to the German question should guarantee European security. We all have a responsibility to give the German people the opportunity to live free and democratic lives, so that they can join the ranks of the freedom-loving people of the world. This principle is included in the Potsdam Agreement, but that does not mean that all the clauses of the Potsdam Agreement can be applied now.

	Eden agreed on the need to provide guarantees to prevent the resurgence of German aggression. He insisted that the Western countries intend to absorb Germany into the ranks of peace-loving countries, and that the establishment of the "European Defense Community" can achieve this goal. Summarizing the position of the Western three countries, he said that the three countries would not return to the four-power control system stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement, and believed that it was more reasonable to unite Germany with other European countries.

	Eden said that he does not intend to require the all-German government to accept the "European Defense Community" treaty or any other international obligations in advance. However, he went on to say that the Western countries believe that the all-German government "would be willing to do so."

	Eden addressed Molotov's remarks that the British plan lacked trust in the democratic forces in Germany with regard to the all-German elections. On this point, he still insisted that the all-German elections should be prepared and held under the supervision of the occupying powers, and he attempted to prove that such elections could truly reflect the will of the German people.

	Then, Molotov spoke on the agenda item "The German Question and the Task of Ensuring European Security." Molotov first pointed out that the assessment of this conference will mainly depend on the outcome of the discussion of the German question. Only by making decisions on the German question that conform to the interests of safeguarding peace and European security will it be of great significance to the people of all European countries, including the German people. Today, anyone who is helping the revival of German militarism will bear the most serious responsibility for the fate of the world, first and foremost for the fate of the people of all European countries.

	Molotov pointed out that the Soviet Union's position on the German question is that the four countries, France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, should abide by the basic principles of those common agreements that have been adopted in the past. These principles state that peace must be guaranteed and the possibility of a resurgence of German aggression must be prevented. The German people are equally concerned about this. Under the current circumstances, launching another world war would also cause the danger of Germans killing each other. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that the mistakes that have been made must be corrected, and that the opinions of representatives from East and West Germany should be heard at future meetings, even if only on the most important specific issues within the German question.

	Molotov said: If the four countries take joint action and do not attempt to use a part of Germany to turn some European countries against other European countries, then we will be able to successfully resolve the German question. The plan to establish the so-called "European Defense Community" pushes Germany onto another path. The political significance of these plans is that the United States, Britain, and France are attempting to collude with the current officials in West Germany to form a military bloc against the Soviet Union. It cannot be ignored that even the French government is implementing this policy. It must be admitted that if France and the Soviet Union maintain good relations and jointly seek reliable ways to safeguard their external security, then under the current circumstances, no one would dare to undermine European peace, and European security could be guaranteed. France and the Soviet Union should not pursue policies of mutual isolation, but should strive to continuously strengthen Franco-Soviet relations, and strive to create conditions for normal cooperation between the Soviet Union, France, and Germany, so that German militarists and revanchists will be isolated in Europe and within Germany. At the same time, such a policy will inevitably receive the support of the broadest masses of the German people.

	Molotov then pointed out that the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty are in fact only part of a huge American military plan. The Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty turn West Germany into the main bridgehead and main military base for planning new wars in Europe. However, West Germany is not the only military base; it merely expands the network of American military bases distributed in Europe, North Africa, the Near East, the Middle East, and many islands in the Atlantic. All of this is aimed at opposing the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. In addition to this, the United States also promulgated a "Common Security Act" in 1951 to carry out sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

	Molotov said that it is obvious that some people are attempting to replace a peace treaty with Germany with the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. According to these treaties, West Germany will be a semi-occupied country deprived of national sovereignty and diplomatic independence for the next fifty years. Even the Treaty of Versailles did not so rudely deprive the German people of their rights. No one can believe that Germans living in West Germany will endure this situation for an indefinitely long period of time. If some officials in West Germany agree to this situation today, it is certainly not because they, in their current state of forced submission, seriously consider the possibility of maintaining this situation for decades. Therefore, the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty are built on sand and cannot last long. If West Germany participates in the "European Defense Community," it will openly embark on the road of reviving German militarism. The peace-loving German Democratic Republic will not take this path. It can be seen that the implementation of these two treaties would become an insurmountable obstacle to a unified Germany. We believe that the fate of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty will not be better than that of the Treaty of Versailles. Either the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty will not be realized and will miscarry, or at the same time as the beginning of the implementation of these treaties, the system of international relations on which these treaties are based will also begin to disintegrate. The planners of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty apparently did not take into account that they are living in the mid-twentieth century. They have drafted plans that do not conform to modern realities.

	Molotov pointed out: If we agree not to allow German militarism to revive, the way out is not difficult to find. It is precisely for this reason that the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany must be resolved. As early as two years ago, the Soviet government submitted a draft on the principles of a peace treaty with Germany to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States. However, until now, the Western three countries have not expressed their attitude towards this draft, nor have they put forward any suggestions regarding a peace treaty with Germany. Such an attitude will not help to solve this important problem. According to the draft principles of the peace treaty with Germany that we have put forward, Germany should be restored as a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful country. The armed forces of the occupying countries should be completely withdrawn from Germany no later than one year after the entry into force of the peace treaty. We believe that the following point must be added to the "Political Clauses" of our previously proposed draft: "Germany shall not be forced to assume any obligations of a political or military nature stipulated in the various treaties and agreements concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the reunification of Germany."

	Stipulating the improvement of the financial and economic situation in the treaty is of great significance to Germany. Regarding this, we believe that it is best to add the following clause to our draft: "Germany shall be completely exempted from its postwar national debts owed to the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, except for payments due under trade obligations." The draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Union stipulates that Democratic Germany may maintain the national armed forces necessary for defense. In order to make this more precise, we make the following addition to the "Military Clauses," namely: "The number of these armed forces shall be limited to the needs of internal security, border defense, and air defense." This clause should be in line with the clauses of some corresponding treaties that have already been signed by the governments of our countries.

	Molotov said that it goes without saying that only an all-German government formed by a parliament elected on the basis of free elections can sign the peace treaty. One of our main obligations is to promote the holding of these free elections. However, this certainly does not mean that prolonged disputes over this issue should become a reason for refusing to prepare a peace treaty. The Soviet government advocates that German representatives should be widely involved in all stages of preparing the peace treaty. The Soviet government believes that, before the establishment of an all-German government, representatives from East and West Germany can be involved in preparing the peace treaty. The final review and adoption of the peace treaty should be held with the participation of the all-German government elected by all-German elections, and the peace treaty should be ratified by the all-German parliament. It can be seen that the Soviet government's suggestion is to immediately begin drafting a peace treaty with Germany, while the suggestions of the United States, Britain, and France are to continue to delay the resolution of this issue. Starting to prepare a peace treaty would in itself prove that we have entered a new and very important stage in the common work of solving the German question, in the process of which we are able to overcome the differences that exist in some disputed issues. This will also promote the rapprochement between East and West Germany and the resolution of some individual issues related to the German question, including the establishment of an all-German government and the conduct of all-German elections. According to these suggestions, the Soviet delegation submitted its revised draft of the principles of a peace treaty with Germany and a draft of "Preparing a Peace Treaty with Germany and Convening a Peace Conference on a Peace Treaty with Germany" to this conference. The Soviet delegation hopes that the ministers and ministers of France, Britain, and the United States present will express their opinions on these suggestions.

	Molotov finally stated that the Soviet delegation would also put forward its own suggestions on some other issues concerning the German question.

	After Molotov's speech, he handed the two suggestions, "Draft of the Soviet Government's Peace Treaty with Germany" and "Preparing a Peace Treaty with Germany and Convening a Peace Conference on a Peace Treaty with Germany," to the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the United States.

	The meeting was adjourned at this point.

### 四国外长会议继续举行会议  莫洛托夫建议和平解决德国问题

    四国外长会议继续举行会议
    莫洛托夫建议和平解决德国问题
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社柏林二日电：二月一日，四国外长会议在菩提树下街苏联驻德高级专员公署开会，莫洛托夫担任会议主席。四国外长继续讨论第二项议程：“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”。
    皮杜尔就这个问题提出了他的初步意见。他再次表示，他同意艾登在一月二十九日会议上提出的计划的主要各点。他认为，这个计划可以作为讨论的基础，他并保留在讨论过程中提出补充意见的权利。
    皮杜尔就艾登计划中所规定的对全德选举实行监督的监督委员会的成员问题发表意见。他主张监督委员会应包括中立国的代表，据他说，这样就可以便于在这个委员会通过决议时应用多数原则。
    皮杜尔接着谈到莫洛托夫在一月三十日会议上的发言。他说：他认为，莫洛托夫在发言中指出举行全德自由选举的重要性，这是一个“积极的因素”。同时，皮杜尔却企图造成一种印象，仿佛真正的自由选举是可以在艾登的建议的基础上得到保证似的。
    皮杜尔接着谈到苏联政府的主张，即在全德选举之后，德国应有真正的自由，能自由地执行它自己的内政和外交政策。这一点，正如莫洛托夫在他一月三十日的发言中所表明的，是艾登的计划做不到的。然而，皮杜尔硬说，苏联代表团所提出的这点要求与西方国家在它们最近两年中致苏联的一些照会中所持的论点相符合。他又说：法国并不主张把德国参加“欧洲防务集团”作为统一德国的条件，但是另一方面，也并不认为有可能禁止德国这样做。
    皮杜尔不顾事实地为波恩条约辩护，硬说这个条约是为了加速对德和约的缔结，然而大家都知道，这个条约规定美国、英国、法国在今后长时期中享有作为西德的占领国的权利。
    艾登接着发言。他表示完全同意把德国问题和保障欧洲安全的问题联系起来。他说，德国问题的解决，应该能保障欧洲的安全。我们大家有责任使德国人民有过自由、民主的生活的机会，使他们能加入世界爱好自由的人民的行列。波茨坦协定中就包括了这个原则，但这并不是说，波茨坦协定的全部条款现在都可以应用。
    艾登同意有必要提供保证防止德国侵略的再起，他硬说，西方国家有意把德国吸收到爱好和平的国家的行列之中，建立“欧洲防务集团”就可以达到这个目的。他综述西方三国的立场说，三国不会回到波茨坦协定所规定的那种四国管制的方式去，并认为更合理的是把德国和欧洲其他国家联合起来。
    艾登说，他不打算要求全德政府事先就必须接受“欧洲防务集团”条约或其他任何国际义务。然而他接着说，西方国家认为，全德政府“会愿意这样做的”。
    艾登谈到莫洛托夫的发言中所说的英国计划中关于全德选举的建议缺乏对德国民主力量的信任。在这一点上他仍然坚持说，全德选举应该在占领国的监督下筹备和举行，他企图证明：这种选举可以真正表现出德国人民的意志。
    然后，莫洛托夫就“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”这项议程发言。莫洛托夫首先指出，这次会议主要要依据德国问题讨论的结果如何来判断。只有对德国问题作出符合于保障和平与欧洲安全的利益的决定，才会对欧洲各国人民，包括德国人民在内，具有重大的意义。今天，如果有谁在帮助德国军国主义的复活，他就要对世界的命运，首先是对欧洲各国人民的命运，负最严重的责任。
    莫洛托夫指出：苏联对德国问题的立场是：法、英、美、苏四国应以过去所通过的那些共同协定的基本原则为依归。这些原则说明必须保障和平，必须防止德国侵略再起的可能性。德国人民对于这一点也是同样关心的。在目前情况下，发动另一次世界大战，还会引起德国人自相残杀的战争的危险。因此，苏联代表团认为，应纠正已经犯下的错误，在今后的会议上听取东德和西德代表的意见，即使只是关于德国问题中个别最重要问题的意见也好。
    莫洛托夫说：如果四国采取共同行动，而不企图利用德国的一部分来使欧洲的一些国家反对其他欧洲国家，那么我们就能够成功地解决德国问题。建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”的计划把德国推上另一条道路。这些计划的政治意义在于：美、英、法三国正企图勾结目前西德的官方人士，结成一个军事集团来反对苏联。不能忽视的是：甚至法国政府也在执行这个政策。不能不承认，如果法国和苏联保持很好的关系，共同为保障自己的外部安全而寻找可靠的途径，那么，在目前情况下，就没有人敢破坏欧洲和平，而欧洲安全也就能够得到保障。法国和苏联不应当执行互相隔离的政策，而应当致力于不断加强法苏关系，致力于为苏联、法国、德国之间的正常合作创造条件，而使德国军国主义者和复仇主义者在欧洲和德国国内陷于孤立。同时，这样的政策也必然会得到最广大的德国人民的支持。
    莫洛托夫接着指出，波恩条约和巴黎条约事实上只不过是庞大的美国军事计划的一部分。波恩条约和巴黎条约把西德变成在欧洲策划新战争的主要桥头堡和主要军事基地。然而，西德还不是唯一的军事基地，它只不过使分布在欧洲、北非、近东、中东及大西洋许多岛屿上的美国军事基地网扩大一些罢了。这一切的目的，就是反对苏联和各人民民主国家。除此之外，美国还在一九五一年颁布了一项“共同安全法”，对苏联和人民民主国家进行破坏活动。
    莫洛托夫说，显然有人企图以波恩条约和巴黎条约来代替对德和约。根据这些条约，西德在今后五十年中都是一个处于半占领状态的国家，被剥夺了国家主权和外交上的独立。甚至凡尔赛条约也没有这样粗鲁地剥夺德国人民的权利。没有人能相信，住在西德的德国人会在一个无限长的时期中忍受这种情况。如果目前西德的某些官方人士同意这种情况，这决不是因为他们在今天勉强驯服的情况下，认真地考虑到可能把这种情况保持几十年。因此，波恩条约和巴黎条约都是建筑在沙滩上的，是不能长久存在的。西德一参加“欧洲防务集团”就会公开走上复活德国军国主义的道路。而爱好和平的德意志民主共和国是不会走这条道路的。由此可见，实现这两个条约会成为统一德国的不可逾越的障碍。我们认为，波恩条约和巴黎条约的命运，不会比凡尔赛条约来得好。要就是波恩条约和巴黎条约不能实现而流产，要就是在开始实现这些条约的同时，作为这些条约的基础的那种国际关系的体系也将开始瓦解。波恩条约和巴黎条约策划者显然没有考虑到他们是生活在二十世纪的中叶。他们拟就了这样一些与现代实际情况不符合的计划。
    莫洛托夫指出：如果我们同意不让德国军国主义复活，出路是不难找到的。正因为如此，才必须解决缔结对德和约的问题。早在两年前，苏联政府就已向法国、英国、美国政府提出了关于对德和约原则的草案。然而直到现在，西方三国还没有对这个草案表示自己的态度，也没有提出任何关于对德和约的建议。这样的态度是不会有助于这个重要问题的解决的。根据我们提出的对德和约原则草案，德国应当恢复成为一个统一、独立、民主与和平的国家。占领国的武装部队应在不迟于和约生效后的一年之内全部撤离德国。我们认为必须在我们以前提出的草案的“政治条款”中补充下列一点：“不得强使德国承担德意志联邦共和国与德意志民主共和国在缔结对德和约及德国重新成为统一的国家以前所缔结的各项条约和协定中所规定的任何政治或军事性质的义务。”
    在条约中规定改善财政经济状况一点，对德国有重大的意义。关于这方面，我们认为最好在我们的草案中加上下面一条：“完全免除德国对美国、英国、法国、苏联所负的战后国债，根据贸易义务所应支付者不在此例。”苏联提出的对德和约草案规定：民主德国得保持为国防所必需的国家武装部队。为了使这一点更加确切，我们对“军事条款”作下列补充，即：“这些武装部队的数额应以内部治安、边防、空防的需要为限”。这一条款应与我们几国政府所已签订的一些相应的和约的条款相符合。
    莫洛托夫说，不用说，只有由在自由选举的基础上选出来的议会成立的全德政府才能在和约上签字。我们的主要义务之一就是：促进这一自由选举的举行。可是，这决不是说：对这一问题旷日持久的争执应成为拒绝准备和约的理由。苏联政府主张在准备和约的各个阶段都要广泛地吸收德国的代表参加。苏联政府认为，在全德政府没有成立之前，可以吸收东德与西德的代表参加准备和约。和约的最后审查与通过应在由全德选举而产生的全德政府的参加下举行，同时和约应由全德议会来批准。可见，苏联政府的建议是要立即开始拟定对德和约草案，而美国、英国和法国的建议却是要继续拖延解决这一问题。开始准备和约，这件事本身就会证明：在解决德国问题的共同工作中，我们已进入了一个新的、十分重要的阶段，在这个工作的过程中我们是能够克服在一些争执问题中存在的分歧的。这还会促使东德与西德双方的接近和解决有关德国问题的一些个别问题，包括成立全德政府和进行全德选举的问题。按照这些建议，苏联代表团将其对德和约原则的经过修正的草案以及“准备对德和约及召开关于对德和约的和平会议”的草案提交这次会议。苏联代表团希望：在座的法国、英国和美国的部长和大臣对这些建议表明自己的意见。
    莫洛托夫最后表示，苏联代表团还将就关于德国问题的其他一些问题提出自己的建议。
    莫洛托夫发言后就将“苏联政府对德和约草案”和“准备对德和约及召开关于对德和约的和平会议”的两份建议交给英国、法国和美国的外交部长。
    会议至此休会。
