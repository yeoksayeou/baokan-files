Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th: Around the Spring Festival, all organs and units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) universally launched activities to cherish the people, further strengthening the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

    From February 1st to 10th, all CPVA units, in accordance with the instructions of the CPVA leadership organs, universally carried out education on cherishing the Korean people, and invited representatives from the local Korean government, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean people to report to the troops on the heroic deeds of the Korean people during the past three years of struggle. A certain unit of the CPVA stationed in the Shangganling area invited Shi Jirong, a model of supporting the front, to give a report to the troops. All units also universally inspected mass discipline and solicited opinions from the local government and people on the stationed troops through the form of discussion meetings. A certain unit of the CPVA on the central front sent a group of cadres and liaison officers to form three inspection teams, which went deep into the villages near the stationed areas to solicit opinions from the Korean people and understand their living conditions, in order to better help them carry out the work of rebuilding their homes. A certain unit of the CPVA in the Shangganling area, together with the local Korean government and people, specifically studied and determined a plan to help the Korean people rebuild their homes and spring plowing. Many units helped residents clear snow before the Spring Festival. A certain unit of the CPVA guarding the east coast also chopped more than 28,000 catties of firewood for the local people before the Spring Festival. A certain unit also organized barbers to give haircuts to more than 400 local Korean people. Soldiers of a certain unit of the CPVA in the Tieyuan area launched a campaign during the Spring Festival to "do one thing for the Korean people for each person." During the Spring Festival, the soldiers actively helped the Korean people grind grain, carry water, and make tofu. Soldiers from a certain unit's heavy artillery battalion and anti-aircraft artillery battalion used the three-day holiday of the Spring Festival to help residents rush to repair seven houses. Many units formulated plans and covenants to cherish the people during the Spring Festival.

    During the Spring Festival, commanders and fighters of many CPVA units extended warm congratulations to the families of the Korean People's Army and the local Korean people, and invited them to dinner and showed them movies. A certain unit of the CPVA guarding the Pingkang area also held a "Sino-Korean Friendship" exhibition hall, and many Korean people came to visit every day. Some units also used the grain saved during the Spring Festival to provide relief to the local people. A certain unit of the CPVA stationed in the Shangganling area alone allocated more than 5,000 catties of grain to provide relief to the Korean people who returned to their homes after the ceasefire. Medical workers from many units also went to the villages near the stationed areas to treat Korean people during the Spring Festival.

    The Korean people are very grateful to the CPVA for their love and care. During the Spring Festival, the People's Committee of South Hamgyong Province awarded certificates of merit to 15 models of cherishing the people from a certain unit of the CPVA. The Korean people of Pingkang County also went to the positions of the CPVA during the Spring Festival to perform songs and dances.
