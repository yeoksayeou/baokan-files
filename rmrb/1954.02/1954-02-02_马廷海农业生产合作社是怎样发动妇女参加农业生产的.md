    How the Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative Mobilized Women to Participate in Agricultural Production
    Kang Zenghui, Liu Shaoye
    The Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huangfu Village, Dali County, Shaanxi Province, was formed in March last year on the basis of a year-round mutual aid team. There are a total of 30 households with 134 people, 65 full and half laborers, including 31 full and 4 half female laborers. Last year, the total output of the cooperative was equivalent to 220,000 jin of wheat. The average income per member was more than 1,600 jin, an increase of more than 200 jin compared to the average income per person in 1952, and an increase of more than 660 jin compared to the average income per person in 1951. Not only was the output higher than that of individual farmers, but it was also higher than that of local mutual aid teams.
    The cooperative was able to increase production and income because it paid attention to bringing into play the production enthusiasm of its female members. Last year, all 35 female laborers in the cooperative participated in field labor. Among them, 13 participated for a full six months, 11 participated for three to four months, and the remaining 11 participated for at least one month. From July to September last year, the cooperative members worked a total of 2,441 workdays, of which female members contributed 854 workdays, accounting for 35 percent of the total workdays. All 314 mu of autumn land in the cooperative, except for planting and weeding cotton, which were the responsibility of men, were handled by women, from seedling setting, thinning, and weeding to cotton pruning, picking, moving corn, and cutting soybeans (with the participation of a few old men and children). In the past, this village always lacked labor. The mutual aid joint team hired 200 short-term workers during the busy farming season the year before last. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, because women participated in field labor, only ten short-term workers were hired to pull cotton stalks, completely changing the past situation of labor shortage. Moreover, because women participated in labor, the cooperative was able to free up male labor for many technical reforms such as processing fertilizer and treating seeds with pesticides, thereby increasing yields.
    The cooperative's experience in mobilizing women to participate in field labor includes the following points:
    First, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the workday system and the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. Many women in Huangfu Village have a habit of working. However, before the Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative was transformed, the mutual aid team did not implement the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women. Some women did not work in the fields, and some women only worked for themselves and were unwilling to help each other. For example, during the summer harvest the year before last, the mutual aid team gave women low work point evaluations and low actual wages. Male laborers generally received 10 points per day, while women with equal labor only received 7 to 8 points. Male laborers received 7 jin of wheat per work unit (10 points), while women received only 5 jin of wheat. Therefore, some female members said: "They treat us as half a person, who wants to work in the fields?" This issue was not resolved until the mutual aid team was reorganized during cotton picking, when female members unanimously demanded that the same "fixed points, flexible evaluation" be applied to male members. After three nights of lengthy discussions, this issue was resolved. After this meeting, regardless of whether they were male or female members, points were awarded based on actual labor. For example, female member Shi Qiuxiang was strong and a good worker. She could do watering and wheat cutting in the fields, and everyone gave her a work point evaluation of 9 points. Some male members with weaker labor, such as Zhang Hanying, were evaluated at 7 or 8 points based on their actual labor. In this way, female members achieved equal pay for equal work with male members for the first time.
    In the autumn of last year, in order to bring into play the production enthusiasm of male and female members, the Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative implemented a "contract system" with fixed time, quality, and quantity based on piecework. When removing buds from cotton, it was stipulated that three mu was one workday for the first round, and two mu was one workday for the second round (because there were more buds on the cotton seedlings during the second round, making it more difficult to remove). When picking cotton after the autumn harvest, work points were recorded by weight. At the same time, different standard work points were evaluated based on the amount of flowering, the ease of picking, and the distance of the land. This greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of women, and they were all willing to work in the fields. However, problems arose again when picking "ground cotton." It was originally stipulated that every 40 jin picked would be recorded as one workday. When women Song Chunxiang and Dai Chunxia picked more than 60 jin each day, some male members were dissatisfied. Some said: "If this is the case, they will be equivalent to one and a half male laborers, which is too disadvantageous for male laborers." In order to solve this problem, some male members were allowed to participate in cotton picking. As a result, the fastest cotton picker, Ren Zhenhai, only picked 40 jin a day, and the next day he was unwilling to pick anymore because of back pain. The facts educated everyone once again, and the principle of equal pay for equal work was upheld.
    In order to encourage the labor enthusiasm of female members, the cooperative should pay attention to recording the workdays of female members separately and announce the workdays of female members once after each production season so that they themselves and the male members know their labor achievements.
    Second, it is necessary to pay attention to carrying out political and ideological education for women and constantly help them learn culture and agricultural production technology. Mobilizing and attracting women to participate in various meetings within the cooperative is a good way to improve women's political awareness. Female members of the Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative actively participate in various meetings within the cooperative. The three female committee members regularly attend the cooperative affairs meetings held every ten days, and most female members attend the general meetings of all members held once a month. Some women arrive earlier than men and dare to express their opinions. Women's participation in meetings allows them to participate in the discussion of various matters of the cooperative and also receive education. Women's issues are sometimes discussed at the general meetings of members. Last summer, the cooperative found that women had the idea of relying on men, and they wanted men to lead the work and male cadres to participate in the work point evaluation. At this time, the agricultural cooperative mobilized women to specifically study a People's Daily news report about women striving for equal pay for equal work – "Labor is liberation, struggle is the only way to gain status," which greatly stimulated the independent and autonomous thinking of female members and improved their enthusiasm for production.
    In order to further improve women's agricultural production technology, the cooperative often assigns cadres to specifically impart technology to women. Before preventing and controlling cotton pests, the cooperative assigned Deputy Director Liu Manchang to teach women how to use sprayers. In terms of cotton field management, a series of technical tasks from thinning to pruning were personally guided by technician Ren Deshui for women to do. Experience has shown that only in this way can women master agricultural technology and continuously improve their interest in participating in agricultural production. Last year, the female members of the cooperative personally cultivated six mu of high-yield cotton fields. Although they failed to achieve a bumper harvest due to initial learning of technology and rainy weather disasters, the yield was still higher than that of cotton fields in nearby villages (averaging about 40 jin of lint per mu).
    In order to improve the cultural level of male and female members, the cooperative established a farmers' spare-time school in February last year. A total of 21 women in the cooperative attended the school, insisting on studying for two hours every day (which was suspended during the busy farming season). Now some women have gone from being illiterate to being able to understand some popular reading materials. This has also created favorable conditions for female members to further improve their political awareness and technical level.
    When there are many female members and they often work together, it is necessary to prevent them from having opinions and disunity over minor matters. To achieve this, in addition to constantly strengthening political and ideological education and education on unity and mutual assistance for female members, female cadres in particular should regularly go deep into the female masses, hold women's group meetings regularly, understand their ideological situation, and solve problems in a timely manner.
    Third, it is necessary to pay attention to solving the combination of household sideline production, housework, and agricultural labor. After women frequently participate in field labor, conflicts will arise with household sideline production and housework. The cooperative's solution to this problem is: on ordinary days, they use their spare time and cloudy and rainy days to engage in weaving and needlework, and participate in field labor the rest of the time; when the autumn harvest cotton comes down, they generally use the morning and evening to do some household chores; from the end of the autumn harvest to February of the following year, they mainly spin and weave cloth to prepare summer clothing, shoes, etc.; after the summer harvest, there is a half-month of relatively free time to prepare winter cotton clothing, shoes, etc. For example, during a production gap last summer, women were relatively free. The cooperative mobilized women to rush to make winter clothes within half a month. Deputy Director Hou Yuqin (female) took the lead in making shoes and mending cotton clothes, solving the winter clothing needs of her family of four. Wang Suqin also made fifteen pairs of shoes and mended six or seven pieces of cotton clothing. During this period, in addition to taking the lead in doing work themselves, female cadres also had to check and supervise back and forth to avoid wasting time.
    According to the cooperative's experience, the contradiction between women's participation in agricultural production and household sideline housework can be solved. The women of the cooperative participate in agricultural labor for a maximum of six months, and the rest of the time is spent on housework. Taking two and a half months as the weaving time (two months for spinning and half a month for weaving), spinning four liang of thread per day, fifteen jin of thread can be spun in two months. One jin of thread can weave one zhang of cloth, and a total of fifteen zhang of cloth can be woven. On average, each person wears four zhang of cloth a year, which can provide clothes for three people. One person needs four pairs of shoes a year, and three people need twelve pairs, which takes an average of three days to make a pair, requiring thirty-six days. The remaining two months and nine days are spent on mending clothes and other tasks, plus they work in the morning and evening, so a woman can solve the problem of clothing and shoes for three people a year in addition to participating in six months of field labor. But in reality, most of the women in the cooperative who participate in field labor for the longest time have small families or have someone at home to help with the work, so it is no problem for them to participate in field labor for half a year. The rest of the women in the cooperative spend most of their time on housework, so of course there is even less of a problem. Because the women of the cooperative arrange their time in a planned way and rationally solve the contradiction between participating in field labor and housework, they have won more time to participate in field labor.
    Fourth, it is necessary to implement a reasonable division of labor between men and women, take care of women's special difficulties, and use women's labor reasonably according to women's possible conditions. The Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative first takes into account the characteristics of women's generally weaker physical strength when allocating production tasks, and allocates the lighter work to women as much as possible. In spring production, women are responsible for peeling peanut seeds, selecting cotton seeds, catching jujube worms, planting, weeding, and pulling grass; men are responsible for preparing the land, pulling manure, planting, loosening jujube tree soil, and weeding cotton. During the busy summer harvest, women cut wheat and do work in the field; men do heavy labor such as cutting wheat, carrying wheat, and planting. During the autumn harvest, women pick cotton, move corn, harvest soybeans, and select seeds and add seeds (when shaking the drill). This not only avoids the phenomenon of "idle work and absenteeism," but also greatly brings into play the production enthusiasm of women and frees up all male labor to do a good job in digging peanuts and autumn plowing and sowing.
    Women have children to take care of, so appropriate care should be taken when allocating work. For example, when picking cotton, women with children are allowed to pick in nearby areas to avoid delaying the children's breastfeeding. During the busy farming season, organize baby-holding groups, give the nannies appropriate work points, and strive to get all the young female laborers to invest in the production front.
    It is necessary to prevent women from overworking regardless of their health. For example, when female member Wang Aizhi of the cooperative was about to give birth, she still insisted on working. After the cooperative leaders discovered this, they immediately persuaded and stopped her through the female cadres.
    Fifth, pay attention to training female cadres. The Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative has equipped a certain number of female cadres in the main cadres within the cooperative. Among the three positive and deputy directors, one deputy director is a woman. Among the nine cooperative affairs committee members, three are women. Some matters related to women within the cooperative are carried out through female cadres. Whether in the Party group meeting or the cooperative affairs committee meeting, women's work is first discussed and discussed through female cadres before being implemented. Give play to the leadership power of female cadres and improve women's enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation and labor production.

    马廷海农业生产合作社是怎样发动妇女参加农业生产的
    康增辉　刘绍业
    陕西省大荔县黄甫村马廷海农业生产合作社，是去年三月在常年互助组基础上组成的，入社户数共三十户，一百三十四人，男女全劳动力六十五人，半劳动力十三人，其中妇女全劳动力三十一人，半劳动力四人。去年全社产量折合小麦共二十二万斤，社员收入每人平均一千六百多斤，比一九五二年每人平均收入增加二百多斤，比一九五一年每人平均收入则增加了六百六十多斤。不仅比单干农民的产量高，也比当地互助组的产量高。
    该社所以能够增加生产，增加收入，和注意发挥了女社员的生产积极性是分不开的。去年全社三十五个女劳力，全部参加了田间劳动，其中参加整六个月的有十三人，参加三至四个月的有十一人，其余十一人最少的也参加了整一个月的田间劳动。去年七月到九月，全社社员做了二千四百四十一个劳动日，其中女社员即做了八百五十四个劳动日，占劳动日总数的百分之三十五。全社三百一十四亩秋地，除下种、锄棉，由男子担负外，从定苗、间苗、锄草到棉花整枝、拾花、搬苞谷、割豆子等一系列工作都是由妇女包做的（有个别老汉、小孩参加）。过去这个村一向缺乏劳动力，前年互助联组在农忙时也雇了二百个短工，成立农业生产合作社后，因为妇女参加田间劳动，只在拔棉秸时雇了十个短工，完全改变了过去缺乏劳动力的状况；而且因为妇女参加了劳动，使社内能腾出男劳动力来进行加工施肥，药剂拌种等许多技术改革工作，因而能够提高产量。
    该社发动妇女参加田间劳动，有以下几点经验：
    第一，必须认真执行劳动日制度和男女同工同酬的原则。黄甫村许多妇女都有劳动习惯。但是马廷海农业生产合作社没有转社前，互助组没有贯彻男女同工同酬原则，有些妇女就不下地劳动，有些妇女下地也是给自己干活，不愿互助。例如前年夏收时，互助组给妇女工分评的低，实际工资也低，男劳力一般每天都评十分，有同等劳动力的妇女只评七到八分，男劳力每工（十分）七斤小麦，妇女却是五斤小麦。因此有些女组员说：把我们当半个人，谁还愿意下地呢？直到拾花时整顿互助组，女组员一致要求和男组员同样作到“死分活评”，经过三个晚上的长时间讨论，这个问题才算解决。这次会后，不论男女组员，都按实际劳动评分，例如女组员石秋香，身体结实，又是一个好劳动，到地里浇水、割麦等都能干，大家给她的劳动工分评为九分，有些劳动力弱的男组员如张汉英等，按照实际劳动情况，分别评成七分或八分。这样女组员才第一次和男组员取得了同工同酬。
    去年秋天，马廷海农业生产合作社为了发挥男女社员的生产积极性，实行了定时、定质、定量的按件“包工制”。在棉花打卡时，规定第一遍三亩为一个劳动日，第二遍二亩为一个劳动日（因为第二遍打卡时，棉苗的赘芽较多，比较难打），秋后拾花时按斤记工，同时还按花开的多少，好拾难拾和地的远近，评出不同的标准工分。这样就大大刺激了妇女的劳动热情，她们都愿意下地劳动。但在拾“脚花”时又发生了问题，原来规定每拾四十斤，记一个劳动日，当妇女宋春香、戴春霞每人每天拾到六十多斤时，有些男社员不满意了，有人说：“如果这样，便顶上一个半男劳力，这样男劳力太吃亏。”为了解决这个问题，便让一些男社员参加拾花。结果拾花最快的男社员任振海，一天才拾到四十斤，而且到第二天因为腰疼，再也不愿意拾花了。事实又一次教育了大家，坚持了同工同酬的原则。
    为了鼓励妇女社员们的劳动热情，社里记劳动日时，应注意把妇女社员的劳动日分开记，并在每个生产季节后，把女社员的劳动日公布一次，以便她们自己和男社员都知道她们的劳动成绩。
    第二，必须注意对妇女进行政治思想教育，并不断帮助她们学习文化和农业生产技术。发动和吸引妇女参加社内各种会议，是提高妇女政治觉悟的一个好办法。马廷海农业生产合作社的女社员都积极参加社内的各种会议。每十天开一次的社务会议，三个妇女委员经常参加，每月开一次的全体社员大会，大部分妇女社员都参加。有些妇女比男人还到得早，又敢发表意见。妇女参加会议，一方面参与了全社各种事情的讨论，另一方面也可以受到教育。开社员大会时，有时也讨论妇女问题。去年夏天社内发现妇女有依靠男人的思想，带工要男的领导，评工时也要男干部参加。这时农业社就发动妇女专门学习了人民日报过去发表的关于妇女争取同工同酬的一篇通讯——“劳动就是解放，斗争才有地位”，大大激发了妇女社员的独立自主思想，提高了女社员的生产积极性。
    为了进一步提高妇女的农业生产技术，该社经常指定干部，专门给妇女传授技术。在防治棉花虫害以前，该社就指定副社长刘满长把喷雾器的使用方法教给妇女。在棉田管理方面，由间苗到整枝等一系列的技术工作，都是由技术员任得水亲自指导妇女来做。经验证明，只有这样，才能使妇女掌握农业技术，和不断提高妇女参加农业生产的兴趣。去年该社女社员，亲自耕作了六亩丰产棉田，虽然由于初学技术，天雨灾害，未能得到丰收，但比起附近各村棉田的产量来，还是要高一些（每亩平均约产皮棉四十斤）。
    为了提高男女社员的文化水平，去年二月，该社成立了农民业余学校，社内共有二十一个妇女上学，每天坚持学习两小时（农忙季节即行停止），现在有的妇女已由不识字到能看懂一些通俗读物。这样也使女社员更进一步提高政治觉悟和技术水平创造了有利条件。
    妇女社员多，经常在一起劳动，一定要防止为小事情闹意见，闹不团结。要作到这一点，除应经常加强对女社员的政治思想和团结互助的教育外，特别是妇女干部应经常深入妇女群众，定时召开妇女小组会议，了解她们的思想情况，及时解决问题。
    第三，要注意解决家庭副业生产、家务操作和农业劳动的结合问题。妇女们经常参加田间劳动后，就会和家庭副业生产、家务操作发生矛盾。该社解决这个问题的办法是：在平常的日子里，她们利用农闲和天阴下雨时间进行纺织和做针线活，其余时间参加田间劳动；在秋收棉花下来时，一般利用早晚做些家庭活；从秋收结束到第二年正二月，主要是纺线织布，准备做夏季的单衣、鞋子等；夏收后有半个月较闲时间，准备冬季的棉衣、鞋子等。例如在去年夏天一个生产空隙期间，妇女比较闲，社内动员妇女在半个月内，赶制冬季衣服，副社长侯玉琴（女）就带头做鞋子和缝补棉衣，解决了全家大小四口人冬季的穿戴问题，王素琴也做了十五双鞋子，和缝补了六、七件棉衣。在这个期间，妇女干部除自己带头做活外，还要来回检查、督促，以免把时间白白浪费了。
    根据该社的经验，妇女参加农业生产和家庭副业家务操作的矛盾是可以设法解决的。该社妇女参加农业劳动时间最多的是整六个月，其余时间都是进行家务劳动。以两个半月为纺织时间（两个月纺，半个月织），每天以纺四两线计，两个月能纺十五斤线，每斤织一丈布，可共织十五丈布，平均每人一年穿四丈布，可供三个人的衣服。一个人一年以四双鞋计，三人共需十二双，平均三天做一双，需三十六天时间。剩余两个月零九天进行缝补衣服等活，再加上她们早晚加工做活，所以一个妇女一年除参加六个月田间劳动外，还可以解决三个人的穿衣穿鞋问题。但实际上该社参加田间劳动时间最多的妇女，大都是家庭人口少，或是家里有人帮助做活，因此她们用半年的时间参加田间劳动是没有问题的。该社其余妇女大部分时间都用在家务劳动方面，当然就更没有问题。该社妇女由于有计划的安排时间，合理地解决了参加田间劳动和家务劳动的矛盾，就使自己争取了更多的参加田间劳动的时间。
    第四，必须实行男女合理分工分业，照顾妇女的特殊困难，根据妇女的可能条件，合理使用妇女劳动力。马廷海农业生产合作社首先是在分配生产任务时，照顾到妇女一般体力较弱的特点，把比较轻便的工作，尽量先分配给妇女。在春季生产中，妇女担任剥花生种子，选棉种子，捉枣虫，点种，锄草，拔草；男人整地、拉粪，下种，松枣树土，锄棉花。在紧张的夏收工作中，妇女割麦及做场里活；男人做割麦，驮麦，下种等重劳动活。秋收期间，妇女拾花，搬苞谷，收豆子，以及选种，添种（摇耧时）等。这样不但避免了“窝工及旷工”现象，并且大大的发挥了妇女的生产热情，腾出所有男劳力作好了挖花生及秋耕、秋播等工作。
    妇女有孩子拖累，在分配活时也要作适当照顾。例如在拾花时，让有孩子的妇女在近处拾，以免耽误小孩吃奶。在紧张的农忙季节，组织抱娃娃组，给媬姆适当的工分，争取青年妇女劳力，全部投入生产战线。
    要防止妇女不顾身体地过分劳动。例如该社女社员王爱芝快要临产时，还勉强劳动，社领导干部发现后，随即通过妇女干部，说服阻止了。
    第五，注意培养妇女干部。马廷海农业生产合作社在社内主要干部方面，都配备了一定数量的妇女干部。在三个正副社长中，有一个副社长是妇女。九个社务委员中，有三个是妇女。社内有关妇女的一些事情，都是通过妇女干部去进行的。不论在党小组会上，或是社务委员会会议上，妇女工作都首先通过妇女干部酝酿讨论，然后执行。发挥妇女干部的领导力量，提高妇女互助合作、劳动生产的热情。
