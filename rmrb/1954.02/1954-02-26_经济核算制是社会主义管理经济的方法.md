Economic Accounting System is a Method of Socialist Economic Management
By Dr. Kozlov, Soviet Economics

The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union formulated a great program for economic and cultural construction. The Congress pointed out the necessity of implementing a system of economy in all links of the national economy.

The Party and the government have put forward the task of vigorously developing heavy industry and continuously reducing retail prices, while at the same time rapidly developing the production departments of people's consumer goods. This requires us to manage the economy more economically and frugally.

The economic accounting system is the main tool for state-owned enterprises to implement the conservation system. The economic accounting system is a method of planned management of the economy, and its role lies in ensuring the discovery and most rational use of the internal potential of production, continuously reducing product costs, and increasing enterprise profitability.

I. The Role of Economic Accounting System under the Socialist System

In a socialist society where the means of production belong to the working people, it is an objective inevitability to continuously reduce the consumption of living labor and materialized labor in the production of unit products. The basic economic law of socialism requires that the economy must be managed economically and rationally. The more economically and carefully the economy is managed, the faster all production departments of socialism will develop, and the higher the material and cultural level of the people will be. Therefore, it is in the vital interests of the working people in socialist society to utilize their labor in the most economical and rational way.

Capitalist management is essentially anti-people. What capitalists seek is not how to save labor, but how to save their own capital. This saving is primarily achieved by intensifying exploitation, by cruelly consuming labor and plundering laborers. The anarchy of production and economic crises shake the capitalist economy, causing a large amount of waste of material wealth and human resources.

The planned development of socialist production, continuously improving production on a high technical basis, creates the possibility of continuously reducing the consumption of living labor and materialized labor and expanding accumulation.

Obtaining profits is not the driving force of socialist production. However, socialist society also needs accumulation. This accumulation is the only source of socialist expanded reproduction, therefore, socialist enterprises must be profitable.

Economy and increased enterprise profitability are not realized spontaneously, but are realized on the basis of adopting advanced socialist management methods and continuously improving labor productivity, through the struggle to maximize the utilization of production potential.

The issue of socialist management methods was first raised by Lenin. As early as 1918, Lenin pointed out that it is necessary to organize the economy in a planned way, to conduct the strictest statistics and supervision of the production and distribution of products, to implement a system of material rewards for labor, to establish the necessary systems to give play to the creative initiative of the working people, and to promote the economic accounting system.

Under the socialist system, state-owned enterprises must implement the economic accounting system because the law of value has a certain effect on production.

However, some Soviet economists deny this important principle of Marxist political economy. For example, Ya. Krennod, in his book "Principles of Economic Accounting System" published in 1952, wrote that the economic accounting system "is not the result of the law of value playing a role under the socialist system." This incorrect viewpoint is the starting point for Ya. Krennod's entire discussion of the economic accounting system. In his book, Krennod made a subjective and erroneous definition of cost, and did not regard cost as an objective economic category, but explained the necessity of cost from the policies of the Party and the government. Due to a lack of understanding of some of the most important issues in the socialist economy, the author failed to give a correct explanation of the essential issues of the economic accounting system.

Stalin pointed out in his work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that the law of value plays a role in production under the socialist system, but it is not the regulator of production. The scope of the law of value is limited. It affects production because the consumer goods necessary to compensate for the consumption of labor are produced and sold as commodities subject to the law of value. Without estimating the role of the law of value, there can be no statistics and supervision, no material rewards for labor, and no explanation of enterprise profits and losses. It is precisely because the law of value affects production that the issues of economic accounting, profitability, and cost become issues of practical significance. The economic accounting system shows a certain dependency relationship between how much contribution an enterprise makes to society and how much the enterprise obtains from society in terms of compensating for the consumption of living labor and materialized labor.

The consumption of producing material wealth and the results of production activities are all calculated in monetary form. The enterprise relies on product sales revenue to compensate for all its production and sales expenses, and thereby obtains profits - this is the essence of the economic accounting system. Completing the state plan according to all indicators is a necessary condition for the economic accounting system.

The economic accounting system is completely subordinate to the law of planned development of the national economy.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government have adopted the economic accounting system in order to fully utilize the existing internal accumulation sources of the economy and discover new accumulation sources. Thoroughly implementing the economic accounting system and improving the work of enterprises can increase profits. For example, the total profits of state-owned enterprises were 65.5 billion rubles in 1950, while they were 111.5 billion rubles in 1953 (according to the plan). However, we still have many loss-making enterprises, whose work does not meet the requirements of the economic accounting system. In 1952, the losses of loss-making industrial enterprises amounted to 16 billion rubles. There are particularly many loss-making enterprises in the coal mining and timber industries. Many construction units failed to complete the task of reducing costs. In the first half of 1953, the cost of industrial products in some leather and shoe industries exceeded the planned regulations.

Violating the principles of economic accounting, condoning losses, and failing to complete the cost reduction plan will hinder the reduction of the prices of heavy and light industrial products.

Failure to complete the profit plan also has an adverse impact on the state budget. For example, in 1952, the coal mining industry alone owed the state budget 180 million rubles in profit sharing.

The economic accounting system is premised on the independent business operations of enterprises. On the one hand, the independent business operations of enterprises enable the state to exercise supervision and leadership over each enterprise, and on the other hand, it also enables enterprises to give play to their initiative in striving to complete and overfulfill the plan. At the same time, since enterprises have a certain degree of independence, they are required to bear full responsibility to the state for completing the plan, rationally using funds, and ensuring profitability.

Implementing the economic accounting system will encourage the completion of the plan, improve labor productivity, adopt advanced production operating methods, improve labor organization, save material reserves, eliminate waste in the use of materials and equipment, and encourage the continuous improvement of product quality, reduce its cost, thereby improving profitability.

II. Economic Accounting System and Implementation of the Principle of Material Interests

One of the basic principles of socialist management is that enterprises and every staff member should enjoy certain material benefits in accordance with their production results. This principle is realized in state-owned enterprises through the economic accounting system.

Material rewards for completing the plan are first manifested in: the amount of monetary funds obtained by enterprises implementing the economic accounting system depends on the degree to which they complete the plan.

Failure to complete the planned quantity indicators, poor product quality, slow sales of products, excess reserves of raw materials, fuels, and materials, overspending of the wage fund, and costs exceeding the plan - all these will worsen the situation of the enterprise.

Under the economic accounting system, the financial situation of an enterprise must depend on how the enterprise works, which urges the enterprise to continuously discover and give play to its internal potential in order to ensure the completion of the plan.

How the plan is formulated is of great significance for the implementation of the economic accounting system. For example, if the production potential is not well calculated and the planned cost is set higher, it may be possible to rely on these potentials to cover up serious shortcomings in the work and a large number of non-productive expenditures, so that the cost plan can be completed without much effort. This is the case in the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry. In 1951, some enterprises in this department lost about 192.2 million rubles due to waste products, and non-productive expenditures exceeded 50 million rubles, but they reduced costs by nearly 60 million rubles above the plan. This bad plan violates one of the most important regulations of the economic accounting system - the financial situation of the enterprise must be consistent with the progress of completing the plan.

The state transfers a portion of the profits of the enterprise to the enterprise for disposal, and uses it as their supplementary working capital and capital construction fund. This is a method used by the state to increase the benefits obtained by the enterprise in completing the planned tasks.

In 1953, enterprises and departments in our country had 33.2 billion rubles (29.8 percent of total profits) available for disposal. More than 70 percent of the newly added working capital and more than 30 percent of the capital construction fund expenditures must be guaranteed by the enterprise's own funds.

The loss-making situation of many enterprises violates the principles of economic accounting, because the losses of these enterprises must be made up for by advanced enterprises, which will weaken the incentive to further increase profits and expand accumulation.

When completing the production plan for the total amount of goods in accordance with the prescribed varieties, and completing the plan to reduce costs and obtain profits, each enterprise can set up a special fund for material rewards - the factory director's fund. However, it is worth pointing out that some enterprise leaders often do not correctly use the portion of the fund used for material rewards for individual staff members and all factory personnel. They often do not calculate the results of advanced producers striving for economy, which reduces the role of the factory director's fund in striving to complete the plan.

Implementing the economic accounting system can help implement the socialist principle of distribution according to work and improve the material interests of every staff member of the enterprise.

Considering the role of the law of value in production and correctly stipulating wholesale prices are of great significance for strengthening the economic accounting system and improving production.

A price system based on correct cost plans and profit plans and faithfully reflecting objective economic laws can encourage the completion of plans, improve product varieties, improve product grades, and save materials. All of this will help improve the profitability of enterprises.

The lack of economic basis in the stipulation of prices will destroy the principles of the economic accounting system and reduce the material benefits in improving product quality. For example, in the sewing industry, the average cost is stipulated for many products, which reduces the benefits obtained in producing excellent products. This often makes it impossible for enterprises that improve product grades to complete the profit plan, and thus cannot obtain the factory director's fund. It is unreasonable to allow this situation to continue, as it will hinder the improvement of commodity varieties. In addition, consolidating the economic accounting system also requires industrial staff to make maximum efforts to improve labor productivity and reduce costs.

With the increase in buyers' requirements for product quality, the number of cases in which commercial organizations return inferior and substandard goods to enterprises and require punishment for these suppliers has increased accordingly. For example, the Leningrad "V. Slozskaya" textile factory lost 2.4 million rubles in seven months of 1953 due to the low grade of its own products.

Undoubtedly, these poorly performing enterprises can only get rid of this difficult situation by improving the quality of their products.

The system of relationships between enterprises plays a major role in strengthening the economic accounting system. Marketing and supply operations are carried out according to plans and based on economic contracts signed between enterprises. The contract system strengthens the responsibility of enterprises to strive to complete the plan and supply a certain quantity, variety, and quality of products in a timely manner.

Failure to comply with the contract is a violation of the regulations of the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, because it will disrupt the supply plan and often hinder the completion of the production plan. The economic accounting system will make enterprises bear serious material responsibility for failing to fulfill the contract: such as fines, overdue fines, and breach of contract fines.

But in practice, there are often cases of non-fulfillment of contracts. At the same time, many enterprises have not demanded punishment for negligent suppliers, and have not made good use of the role of this tool of the economic accounting system. Strengthening the economic accounting system must launch a vigorous struggle to abide by contract discipline.

Party resolutions have pointed out that financial institutions must strengthen the supervision of the ruble in completing economic plans and complying with the system of economy.

The shortcomings in the work of credit institutions and financial institutions have weakened the economic accounting system and made it possible for unplanned sources of funds to appear, destroying the principle that the financial situation of enterprises should be consistent with the process of completing the plan.

Consolidating the economic accounting system requires greatly improving the quality of production plans and financial plans and achieving full coordination between the two. In practice, however, this is often not seriously implemented.

III. Economic Accounting System and Mass Initiative

Thoroughly implementing the economic accounting system and improving the material interests of enterprises and their staff are important factors in strengthening the creative initiative of the masses and launching the competition of laborers to continuously improve the quantity and quality indicators of production.

Correctly organizing economic accounting can help improve the initiative and enthusiasm of workers to strive for production rationalization. In addition, the implementation of economic accounting within the factory is also of great significance. This economic accounting within the factory can encourage every staff member to actively participate in the work of improving production technology and operating methods, improving labor organization, and making the most rational use of funds, and encourage them to fight for the completion and overfulfillment of the plan. If economic accounting within the factory is implemented not only in the main links of the enterprise, but also in the auxiliary and subordinate links of the enterprise, then it can produce greater results.

Implementing workshop economic accounting requires greatly improving the planning of the quantity, variety, and quality of products within the factory, strengthening the balance of work, and formulating the workshop's labor plan and cost reduction plan. Workshop economic accounting is premised on the continuous improvement of the entire quota system, the adoption of advanced quotas based on technology, and the improvement of the statistics and supervision system in the process of completing the plan. Otherwise, it is often equivalent to playing with the economic accounting system, rather than implementing a truly economic accounting management method.

The huge role of the economic accounting system within the factory in reducing costs and increasing accumulation can be proved by the example of the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" metallurgical factory. Here, each workshop has a quarterly plan, which stipulates in advance the total production volume, various production quotas, staffing and total wages, as well as the tasks and planned prices in improving labor productivity and reducing costs. Each workshop has a quarterly production budget and a product cost accounting plan. Workshop production meetings formulate various measures to ensure the completion of the plan.

Here, not only workshops, but also large sub-rooms, work sections, and machine groups implement the economic accounting system. Due to the correct organization of the economic accounting within the factory and the workshop, and the correct mobilization of staff to strive to discover internal potential, the "Sickle and Hammer" factory reduced costs by 2.105 million rubles compared to the plan in seven months of 1953.

In the socialist competition, various forms of cost reduction movements have emerged, such as "personal savings calculation," striving to reduce costs in each operation, and implementing comprehensive savings. At this time, the most important thing is to make workers aware that every kilogram of material and fuel saved, better use of tools, more full use of machine tool capabilities, and reduced electricity consumption can give the factory and workshop great savings. Socialist competition has improved the tenacity and initiative of workers in the struggle to eliminate waste products and other non-productive losses.

The creative initiative of implementing the principle of material interests and launching socialist competition plays a major role in strengthening the struggle for a system of economy. × × ×

The socialist system brings unlimited possibilities for continuously improving production, improving labor productivity, reducing product costs, and increasing accumulation.

Continuously strengthening the economic accounting system and eliminating the major shortcomings that occur in the implementation of the economic accounting system are one of the basic conditions for the further strong development of the socialist economy.

    经济核算制是社会主义管理经济的方法
    苏联经济学博士　科兹洛夫
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会制定了经济与文化建设的伟大纲领，大会指出了在国民经济所有环节中贯彻节约制度的必要性。
    党与政府提出了全力发展重工业和不断降低零售价格，同时迅速发展人民消费品生产部门的任务，这就要求我们要更加经济而节约地管理经济。
    经济核算制是国营企业实行节约制的主要工具。经济核算制是有计划地管理经济的一种方法，它的作用在于能够保证发掘和最合理地利用生产的内部潜力，不断地降低产品成本和提高企业盈利。
    一、社会主义制度下经济核算制的作用
    在生产资料属于劳动人民的社会主义社会里，不断降低单位产品生产中所消耗的活的劳动和物化劳动，是一种客观的必然性。社会主义的基本经济法则要求必须节约而合理地管理经济。越能节约地精打细算地管理经济，则社会主义一切生产部门就发展得越快，人民的物质文化水平也越提高。因此，最经济而合理地利用自己的劳动，对于社会主义社会的劳动人民是有着切身的利益的。
    资本主义式的经营本质上是反人民的。资本家所汲汲以求的，不是如何节约劳动，而是如何节约自己的资本，这种节约首先是靠加强剥削，靠残酷消耗劳动力与掠夺劳动者的办法来实现的。生产的无政府状态和经济危机，动摇着资本主义经济，引起了对物质财富与人力的大量浪费。
    有计划地发展社会主义生产，在高度技术基础上不断提高和改善生产，为不断减少活的劳动和物化劳动的消耗和扩大积累创造了可能性。
    取得利润不是社会主义生产的动力。但社会主义社会也需要积累。这种积累是社会主义扩大再生产的唯一源泉，因此，社会主义企业必须有盈利。
    节约、企业盈利的增大，不是自流地实现的，而是在采用先进的社会主义经营方法与不断提高劳动生产率的基础上，经过最大限度利用生产潜力的斗争而实现的。
    社会主义经营方法的问题是由列宁首先提出的。远在一九一八年列宁即指出必须有计划地组织经济，对于产品的生产和分配必须进行最严格的统计和监督，必须实行对劳动的物质奖励制，建立必要制度以发挥劳动人民的创造积极性，并推行经济核算制。
    在社会主义制度的条件下国营企业之所以必须实行经济核算制，是因为价值法则对生产发生一定的作用。
    但是苏联某些经济学者却否定马克思主义政治经济学的这一重要原理。例如，雅·克伦诺德在其一九五二年出版的“经济核算制原理”一书中写道，经济核算制“并不是社会主义制度下价值法则发生作用的结果”。这种不正确的观点，是雅·克伦诺德对经济核算制的全部论述的出发点。克伦诺德在其著作中对于成本下了主观主义的错误定义，没有把成本看作是一种客观的经济范畴，而是从党和政府的政策来说明成本的必要性。由于不理解社会主义经济中的一些最重要的问题，著者未能对经济核算制的本质问题，给以正确的说明。
    斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”这一著作中指出，价值法则在社会主义制度的条件下对生产发生作用，但它不是生产的调节者。价值法则发生作用的范围是受限制的。它之对生产发生作用是因为：抵偿劳动力的耗费所必需的消费品，是作为受价值法则支配的商品来生产和销售的。不估计价值法则的作用，就不可能有统计和监督以及劳动的物质奖励制，就不可能说明企业的盈亏。正是因为价值法则对生产发生作用，所以才使经济核算、盈利、成本问题成为具有现实意义的问题。企业给了社会多少贡献，以及在抵偿活的劳动和物化劳动的消耗方面企业从社会取得了多少，这二者间的一定的依存关系，就是由经济核算制来表明的。
    生产物质财富的消耗与生产活动的成果，都是用货币形态来计算的。企业依靠产品销售收入来抵偿其一切生产与销售费用，并从而取得利润——这就是经济核算制的实质。按一切指标完成国家计划则是经济核算制的必要条件。
    经济核算制完全从属于国民经济有计划发展的法则。
    共产党与苏联政府为了充分利用现有经济内部的积累源泉，并发掘新的积累源泉而采用经济核算制。彻底实行经济核算制并改善企业工作能使利润增加。例如，国营企业的利润总额在一九五○年为六百五十五亿卢布，而在一九五三年则为一千一百一十五亿卢布（按照计划）。但是我们还有不少亏损的企业，这些企业的工作不符合经济核算制的要求。在一九五二年赔钱的工业企业的亏损额达一百六十亿卢布。在采煤工业和木材工业部门中亏损的企业特别多。许多建筑单位没有完成降低成本的任务。一九五三年上半年若干皮革与制鞋工业的工业品成本超过了计划的规定。
    违反经济核算原则、纵容亏损、完不成降低成本计划，就会妨碍重工业与轻工业产品价格的降低。
    完不成盈利计划，对于国家预算也有不良的影响。例如在一九五二年仅采煤工业即欠交国家预算一亿八千万卢布的利润提成。
    经济核算制是以企业的独立经营业务为前提，企业的独立经营业务一方面使国家得以实行对每个企业的监督与领导，另一方面也可以使企业在争取完成与超额完成计划中发挥它的主动性。同时，企业既然具有一定的独立性，因此就要求企业在完成计划、合理使用资金与保证盈利上，对国家负完全责任。
    实行经济核算制就会鼓励完成计划、提高劳动生产率、采用先进生产操作法、改善劳动组织、节约材料储备、消除使用材料和设备时的浪费现象，就会鼓励不断地改进产品质量、降低其成本，从而提高盈利。
    二、经济核算制与贯彻物质利益的原则
    社会主义经营的基本原则之一就是企业和每个工作人员都应按照其生产成果享有一定的物质利益的原则。这一原则在国营企业中是通过经济核算制来实现的。
    对于完成计划予以物质奖励首先表现在：实行经济核算制的企业取得货币资金的多少，取决于其完成计划的程度。
    未完成计划的数量指标、产品质量低劣、产品滞销、原料燃料材料的超定额储备、工资基金的超支、成本超过计划——所有这些都会使企业处境恶化。 
    在经济核算制之下，企业财务情况须视企业工作如何而定，这就促使企业要不断发掘和发挥内在潜力，以便保证计划的完成。
    计划订得如何，对于实行经济核算制具有重大的意义。例如，如果没有很好地计算生产潜力并把计划成本定得较高，那就可能依靠这些潜力来掩盖工作的严重缺点和大量非生产开支，从而就能够不费力地完成成本计划。在农业机器制造业就有这种情形。这个部门的一些企业在一九五一年中因产生废品损失约一亿九千二百万卢布，非生产开支达五千万卢布以上，但是它们却超计划地把成本降低了几达六千万卢布。这种恶劣的计划违反了经济核算制的一项最主要的条例——企业财务状况必须同完成计划的进度相符合。
    国家把企业的一部分利润交由企业处理，把它作为他们的补充流动资金与基本建设基金，这就是国家用来提高企业在完成计划任务中所得的利益的一种方法。
    一九五三年我国各企业和各部拥有三百三十二亿卢布（占全部利润的百分之二十九点八）可供支配。新增加的百分之七十以上的流动资金和百分之三十以上的基本建设基金开支，都必须依靠企业的自有资金来保证。
    许多企业的亏损情况违反了经济核算原则，因为这些企业的亏损要靠先进企业来弥补，这就会削弱进一步提高盈利和扩大积累的刺激。
    在按照规定品种完成商品总额的生产计划，以及完成降低成本和取得利润的计划时，各个企业都可以设置物质奖励专用基金——厂长基金。但是，值得提出的是一些企业领导者们对于该项基金中用于个别工作人员与全厂人员物质奖励的部分，常没有加以正确运用。他们往往不计算先进生产者争取节约的成果，这样，就降低了厂长基金在争取完成计划中的作用。
    实行经济核算制可以帮助贯彻社会主义的按劳取酬原则，提高每个企业工作人员的物质利益。
    考虑价值法则对于生产所发生的作用，正确规定批发价格，对于加强经济核算制和改进生产，具有重大的意义。
    依据正确的成本计划和盈利计划建立的、忠实反映客观经济法则的价格制度，能够鼓励完成计划、改进产品品种、提高产品等级和节约材料。这一切又会帮助提高企业的盈利。
    价格的规定缺乏经济的根据，就会破坏经济核算制的原则，降低在提高产品质量中的物质利益。例如在缝纫工业里，为许多制品规定了平均成本，这种平均成本降低了在出产优良产品中所得的利益。这常常会使提高产品等级的企业不能完成盈利计划，从而无法获得厂长基金。让这种情况继续下去是不合理的，它将阻碍商品品种的改进。此外，巩固经济核算制也要以工业工作人员尽最大努力来提高劳动生产力与降低成本为前提。
    随着购买者对产品质量要求的提高，商业组织把劣货和次等货退还给企业，并要求处罚这些供应货物者的情况随之增多。例如列宁格勒“维·斯洛兹卡娅”纺织工厂在一九五三年七个月期间，由于自己产品的品级低劣而亏损了二百四十万卢布。
    毫无疑义，这些工作做得不好的企业，只有改进其产品质量，才能使自己摆脱这种困难局面。
    各企业相互间关系的制度对于加强经济核算制有重大作用。推销和供应业务是按照计划，根据各企业间所签订的经济合同而进行的。合同制度加强了各企业争取完成计划，及时供应一定数量、品种、质量的产品的责任。
    不遵守合同，就是违反国民经济有计划按比例发展法则的规定，因为这样就会破坏供应计划并常常妨害生产计划的完成。经济核算制会使企业因未履行合同而担负严重的物质责任：如罚款、过期罚金、违约罚金等。
    但在实际上，常有不履行合同的事情，同时，许多企业也没有要求对疏忽大意的供货者给以处罚，没有很好地利用经济核算制这一工具的作用。经济核算制的加强，必须为恪守合同纪律而展开有力的斗争。
    党的各次决议曾指出财政机关必需在完成经济计划和遵守节约制度方面加强卢布的监督。
    信贷机关和财政机关工作中的缺点，削弱了经济核算制，使计划外的资金来源有出现的可能。破坏了企业财务情况应与完成计划的过程相适合的原则。
    巩固经济核算制要求大大提高生产计划与财务计划的质量，并使两者取得全面的配合，然而在实际上这点常常没有认真执行。
  三、经济核算制和群众的
        主动性
    彻底实行经济核算制、提高企业及其工作人员的物质利益，是加强群众创造积极性和开展劳动者为不断改进生产的数量和质量指标的竞赛的重要因素。
    正确地组织经济核算，可以帮助提高工人争取生产合理化的主动性和积极性。此外，实行厂内经济核算也具有重大的意义，这种厂内经济核算能鼓励每个工作人员积极参加改进生产技术和操作法、改善劳动组织、最合理的使用资金的工作，鼓舞他们为完成与超额完成计划而斗争。如果不仅在企业的主要环节，而且也在企业的辅助和附属环节实行厂内经济核算制，那末它就能够产生更大的效果。
    实行车间经济核算要求大大改进对厂内产品数量、品种和质量的计划工作，要求加强工作的均衡性，并制订车间的劳动计划和降低成本计划。车间的经济核算是以经常改善全部定额制度，采用有技术根据的先进定额，改进在完成计划过程中的统计和监督制度为前提。否则就常常等于玩弄经济核算制，而不是实行真正经济核算的经营方法。
    关于厂内经济核算制在降低成本和增加积累方面所起的巨大作用可由莫斯科“镰刀和锤子”冶金工厂的例子证明。在这里，每个车间，都有季度计划，这些计划预先规定了生产总量、各种生产定额、人员编制和工资总额以及在提高劳动生产率和降低成本方面的任务和计划价格等。各车间都有季度生产概算与产品成本核算计划。车间生产会议都制定了保证完成计划的各种措施。
    在这里，不仅车间，而且大的分间、工段和机组都实行经济核算制。由于正确地组织了厂内和车间的经济核算，正确地动员了工作人员争取发掘内在潜力，“镰刀和锤子”工厂在一九五三年七个月期间，使成本比计划降低了二百一十万零五千卢布。
    在社会主义竞赛中，涌现了各种形式的降低成本运动，如“个人节约计算”、争取在每种操作中降低成本以及实行全面节约等。这时，最重要的是使工人知道，每节约一公斤材料和燃料，更好地使用工具，更充分利用机床能力，缩减电力消耗等，都能给予工厂和车间以莫大的节约。社会主义竞赛提高了工人在消灭废品和其他非生产损失斗争中的顽强精神和主动性。
    贯彻物质利益原则的创造主动性、展开社会主义竞赛，对于加强节约制度的斗争起着重大的作用。×　×　×
    社会主义制度为不断地改善生产、提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本和增加积累带来了无限的可能性。
    不断加强经济核算制、消灭在实行经济核算制中发生的重大缺点，是社会主义经济进一步强大发展的基本条件之一。
