Xinhua News Agency, February 8th, TASS, New York, February 7th: American newspapers are vigorously promoting to their readers that the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference is "bound to fail."

    The Washington "Star" published an article by its Berlin correspondent, Noyes. The article stated that one of the most "troublesome problems" for Western representatives now is "how to end this meeting." Noyes said that this question is "very urgent." The reporter said, "Western strategists most hope to decisively terminate these negotiations." He pointed out the reason for this view, saying, "The hope for reconciliation between East and West has had such an impact that the political situation in Western Europe is paralyzed," and "If this hope continues to be preserved... it may have fatal consequences."
    Scripps-Howard newspaper commentator Schackford reported from Berlin: "The end of the Berlin Conference is imminent if the West can find a suitable way to end this futile marathon... If the public opinion of some Western countries were not so unmanageable, the foreign ministers of Western countries should have suggested a final end to the meeting on February 4th."
    Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: Facts prove that Western newspapers are distorting the coverage of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference under the instruction of the US and British authorities.
    According to TASS: The Italian "Avanti!" published a report from Paris stating that sources in contact with the press attachés of the US embassies in European countries revealed why Western newspapers are pessimistic about the Berlin Conference. Even in January, when the Berlin Conference was in the preparation stage, the US diplomatic representatives in Europe received special instructions to emphasize in their conversations with representatives of political and press circles and diplomats in their host countries that the US government holds a very pessimistic attitude towards the possibility of reaching any agreement with the Soviet Union at the Berlin Conference. The directive pointed out that the major US embassies in Europe should take necessary measures to ensure that European newspapers support the US delegation's position at the Berlin Conference.
    According to the German News Agency: A British journalist said in a conversation with his colleagues that the British Foreign Office's Information Department summoned the British journalists covering the Berlin Conference before they set off and instructed them: The British Foreign Office anticipates that the Soviet delegation attending the Berlin Conference will put forward many proposals that can attract the attention of world public opinion, and measures must be taken to offset the impact of the Soviet proposals on the British public. British journalists were ordered to report as little as possible on the statements of the Soviet delegation and to promote that the Soviet Union is "stubborn." The journalists were to explain to the British readers that the Soviet proposals aim to split the Western world and to point out in every possible way that the Western proposals are "constructive."
    The British journalist also said: Conversations with US press representatives in Berlin gave him the impression that the US State Department had given the same instructions to US journalists and American newspapers published in West Germany.
    The British journalist concluded: He personally believes that the Soviet proposals provide a good basis for the peaceful settlement of international disputes and the easing of international tensions. He particularly emphasized the problem raised by Molotov that the revival of German militarism poses a threat to Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other European countries. He said that despite this, British journalists are unable to talk about these in their newspapers.

    美国报纸散布柏林会议失败的空气
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：美国报纸大力向读者宣传，说柏林四外长会议“必然破产”。
    华盛顿“明星报”刊载了该报驻柏林记者诺伊斯的一篇文章。这文章说现在西方代表最“头痛的问题”之一，就是“如何结束这个会议”。诺伊斯说，这个问题“非常迫切”。这个记者说，“西方的战略家们最希望断然地中止这种谈判”。他指出产生这种看法的原因说，“对东西方之间和解的希望产生了这样一种影响，使西欧的政治局面为之瘫痪”，“这种希望再继续保存下去……可能产生致命的后果”。
    斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸评论员沙克福自柏林报道说：“如果西方能够找到合适的办法来结束这场白费气力的马拉松赛跑，那末柏林会议的结束就指日可待了……要不是某些西方国家的舆论那么让人难以应付的话，西方国家的外长们本应该在二月四日就建议最后结束这次会议的。”
    【新华社八日讯】事实证明，西方报纸是在美英当局指使下对四国外长柏林会议进行歪曲报道的。
    据塔斯社讯：意大利“前进报”刊载的巴黎消息说：与美国驻欧洲国家大使馆的新闻参赞有接触的消息灵通人士透露了西方报纸为什么对柏林会议表示悲观。甚至在一月间柏林会议处于筹备阶段的时候，美国驻欧洲的外交代表就接到特别指令，要他们在和驻在国的政治和新闻界代表以及外交界人士的谈话中，着重指出美国政府对能在柏林会议上和苏联达成任何协议的可能性抱十分悲观的态度。指令指出：美国驻欧洲的各大使馆要采取必要办法，使欧洲报纸支持美国代表团在柏林会议上的立场。
    另据德意志通讯社报道：一个英国记者在和他的同事的谈话中说：英国外交部情报司在采访柏林会议新闻的英国记者们动身以前，曾召集他们训话说：英国外交部预计出席柏林会议的苏联代表团将提出许多能吸引世界舆论意见注意的建议，必须采取办法来抵消苏联建议在英国公众中所起的影响。英国记者奉命尽可能对苏联代表团的声明少作报道，并宣传苏联是“顽固的”。记者们要向英国读者说明苏联建议目的在分裂西方世界，并用一切方法指出西方的建议是“建设”性的。
    这个英国记者又说：在柏林和美国报界代表的谈话使他得到这样印象：美国国务院曾对美国记者和在西德出版的美国报纸给予了同样的指示。
  这个英国记者最后说：他个人认为苏联的建议给和平解决国际争端及缓和国际紧张局势提供了良好的基础。他特别强调莫洛托夫提出的德国军国主义复活对英国、法国、苏联和其他欧洲国家构成威胁的问题。他说，虽然如此，但是英国记者不能够在他们的报纸上谈到这些。
