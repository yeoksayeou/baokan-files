    Strengthen Leadership Over Veterinary Institutions

    Reader A. Lyosha writes: I am a railway veterinary staff member. Recently, there has been a lack of leadership in the veterinary institutions of the Northeast Railway, business cannot be carried out, and many cadres feel distressed.

    In 1950, the railway administrations in the Northeast Region successively established veterinary stations, which were responsible for the disinfection and inspection of poultry, livestock, and livestock products sent or arrived at various railway stations in the Northeast Region. Previously, each veterinary station was under the leadership of the Northeast Commissioner's Office of the former Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government in terms of business and technology. After the Commissioner's Office was abolished, the veterinary institutions of the Northeast Railway were in a state of no leadership. For more than a year, there have been no unified regulations on work guidelines, business exchanges, personnel quotas, financial accounting, and relations with local veterinarians, making it difficult to carry out work. Some people have reported their opinions to the Health Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, but the problem has not been resolved. The long-term existence of this phenomenon is not conducive to the work. It is hoped that the Central Ministry of Railways will work with the Central Ministry of Agriculture to study and resolve the issue, so that veterinary personnel can give full play to their role in the construction of the motherland.

    Editor's Note: Reader A. Lyosha's opinion is correct. Strengthening the leadership of veterinary work plays a significant role in the development of China's animal husbandry. At present, in addition to the agricultural departments in various places, trade, railway, health and other departments have also set up a set of veterinary institutions. The nature and tasks of these veterinary institutions are similar, but they each have their own set of businesses and lack the necessary connections and cooperation, thus causing some institutions to overlap and manpower to be dispersed. In order to rationally use veterinary talents and enable them to fully play their role in animal husbandry production, it is hoped that the Central Ministry of Agriculture will work with other business departments to study the leadership and management of veterinary institutions, formulate a comprehensive veterinary prevention and control plan, and, under the guidance of a unified policy, enable veterinary work to improve.

### 加强对兽医机构的领导

专栏：读者来信摘要

    加强对兽医机构的领导
    读者阿辽沙来信：我是一个铁路兽医工作人员。最近东北铁路兽医机构存在着无人领导的现象，业务无法开展，很多干部都感到苦闷。
    东北区各铁路管理局在一九五○年先后都成立了兽医站，专管东北区铁路各个车站发送或到达的禽畜和畜产品的消毒和检查工作。以前，各兽医站在业务和技术方面均受原中央人民政府铁道部东北特派员办事处领导。办事处撤消后，东北铁路的兽医机构就处于无人领导的状态，一年多来在工作方针、业务交流、人员定额、财务会计以及和地方兽医的关系等方面，都没有统一规定，工作很难开展。有人曾向铁道部卫生局反映过意见，但问题一直没有获得解决。这种现象长期存在下去对工作是不利的，希望中央铁道部会同中央农业部共同研究解决，使兽医人员在祖国建设事业中充分发挥作用。
    编者按：读者阿辽沙的意见是正确的。加强对兽医工作的领导，对发展我国畜牧业有重大的作用。目前，除各地农业部门外，贸易、铁路、卫生等部门也都设立了一套兽医机构。这些兽医机构的工作性质、任务都差不多，可是在业务上却各搞一套，缺少必要的联系和配合，因而造成某些机构重叠、人力分散的现象。为了合理地使用兽医人材，使他们在畜牧业生产中充分发挥作用，希望中央农业部会同其他业务部门共同研究兽医机构的领导和管理问题，制订出全面性的兽医防治计划，在统一的方针指导下，使兽医工作能够提高一步。
