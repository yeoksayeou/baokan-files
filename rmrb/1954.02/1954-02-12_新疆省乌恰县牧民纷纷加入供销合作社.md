Xinjiang Province's Wucha County Herdsmen
Join Supply and Marketing Cooperatives En Masse
The Kirgiz herdsmen of Wucha County, Xinjiang Province, love their supply and marketing cooperatives.

Wucha County is located on the northern slopes of the Pamir Plateau, and is inhabited by more than 13,000 hardworking Kirgiz herdsmen. Before liberation, there was not a single "bazaar" (market) on the grasslands, and transportation was very inconvenient, so livestock products were long stockpiled, or were taken away by unscrupulous merchants at low prices. At the same time, it was difficult for herdsmen to obtain various daily necessities. Since 1952, the Wucha County People's Government has helped herdsmen establish supply and marketing cooperatives and more than a dozen trade groups that move with the herdsmen. Most of the staff are newly trained Kirgiz cadres who often climb high mountains and cross icy rivers, regardless of wind or snow, to supply the herdsmen with grain, cloth, tea, sugar, etc., and purchase livestock products. Last year, they supplied 95,900 jin of grain, more than 100,000 chi of calico, and a large number of sickles and wolf traps for production, and purchased 110,000 jin of wool and 1,000 animal skins. The cooperatives and trade groups are loved by the herdsmen. Wherever they go, many herdsmen bring grouse, snow cock, and skins to invest in shares or exchange goods. Now, two-thirds of the county's herdsmen have joined the supply and marketing cooperatives.

    新疆省乌恰县牧民
    纷纷加入供销合作社
    新疆省乌恰县柯尔克兹族牧民热爱自己的供销合作社。
    乌恰县在帕米尔高原的北麓，境内居住着一万三千多勤劳的柯尔克兹族牧民，解放前草场上没有一个“巴扎”（集市），交通又十分不便，所以畜产品长久地被积压着，或者为奸商用低价剥夺，同时牧民们很难得到各种生活必需品。从一九五二年开始，乌恰县人民政府便帮助牧民建立了跟随牧民流动的供销合作社和十多个贸易小组，工作人员大多是新培养起来的柯尔克兹族干部，他们一年四季不管刮风下雪，经常翻越高山、渡过冰河，向牧民供应粮食、布匹和茶、糖等，并收购畜产品。去年曾供应九万五千九百斤粮食，十多万尺花布和大批扇镰、打狼铗生产用具，收购了十一万斤羊毛及一千张畜皮。合作社和贸易小组受到了牧民的爱戴，无论到了那里，那里便有许多牧民拿着山鸡、雪鸡及皮张等来入股或换货，现在，全县已有三分之二的牧民加入了供销合作社。
