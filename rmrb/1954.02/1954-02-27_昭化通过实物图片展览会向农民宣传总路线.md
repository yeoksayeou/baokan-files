Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, held a lively, accessible, and concrete physical object and picture exhibition in its First District last December when propagandizing the General Line. Through this exhibition, the general line, general task, and grain procurement policies were comprehensively and meticulously publicized to over five thousand attending peasants, with great effect.

The physical object and picture exhibition was divided into three exhibition rooms, with twenty-two cadres specifically responsible for propaganda and explanation. The first exhibition room – "Think About the Past" – contained a total of three sets of pictures. The first set of pictures, "Throughout the Year," illustrated how landlords exploited and oppressed peasants during the twelve months of the year before liberation. The second set of pictures illustrated how landlords and unscrupulous merchants depressed grain prices and hoarded grain when new grain came onto the market before liberation; and how they used high-interest rates and high prices to lend and sell to peasants when grain was scarce. The third set of pictures illustrated how landlords and unscrupulous merchants used usury to exploit peasants before liberation. Collectively, these three sets of pictures were designed to inspire peasants to recall their lives before liberation and to make clear that they could not take the capitalist road but could only take the socialist road. The second exhibition room – "Compare the Present" – contained a total of three sets of pictures and several daily-use industrial products for peasants. The first set of pictures illustrated what good things the Communist Party and the People's Government had done for the peasants of Zhaohua County in the four years since liberation, and what benefits the peasants had received politically and economically (including rent reduction and deposit refunds, land reform, cultural and educational hygiene, loans, grain loans, etc.). The second set of pictures was "The Motherland in Progress," and the third set of pictures was "The Great Achievements of Our Motherland in the Past Three Years." These two sets of pictures illustrated what major events the Communist Party and the People's Government had done for the people of the whole country in the four years since liberation, and also illustrated that the motherland was constantly prospering and becoming stronger. This exhibition room, as a whole, explained the various political and economic benefits that peasants had received since liberation, so that peasants realized that the interests of the peasants were consistent with the interests of the country, the interests of the working class, and the interests of national industrialization; that the interests of the peasants must be subordinate to the interests of national industrialization, and that immediate interests must be subordinate to long-term interests, which was the highest interest of the peasants. The third exhibition room – "Look at the Future" – contained a total of five sets of pictures. The first set of pictures was "The Road of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Development." This set of pictures had four pictures: the first picture depicted the production and life of Zhang Kaixian, a peasant who returned to his hometown to work individually; the second picture depicted the production and life of the He Taosheng mutual aid team in his hometown; the third picture depicted the production and life of the Wang Dengzhi agricultural production cooperative in his hometown; and the fourth picture depicted the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, Northeast China. Each picture had a good explanation above it. The second set of pictures was "We Saw the Soviet Union," the third set of pictures was the process of Shang Jinyu, a member of the Wang Dengzhi agricultural production cooperative, selling surplus grain, and the fourth and fifth sets of pictures were the stories of model military family member Pang Yinwen and peasant He Yongfu selling surplus grain. This exhibition room, as a whole, explained the path that peasants should take and the steps and methods for carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture. This specifically carried out mutual aid and cooperation education and socialist future education for the peasants.

After seeing this exhibition, the peasants further recognized the great significance of national socialist industrialization. For example, after seeing the comparison of the prices of various industrial products between 1948 and 1953, they realized that only when the country realizes industrialization can life get better and better. After seeing the two sets of pictures, "The Great Achievements of Our Motherland in the Past Three Years" and "The Motherland in Progress," they were very excited and said, "The country has done so many things in the past few years, how much money does it take to do these constructions." They were very moved to hear that the benefits that the people of Zhaohua County had obtained through land reform, etc., in the past four years were equivalent to the public grain paid by the peasants of the whole county for six years. They all said: "In the past, we only calculated how much public grain we paid in a year, and we didn't calculate how much we got back. After this calculation, we understood." After seeing the series of pictures "The Road of Mutual Aid and Cooperation Development," they realized that taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation was the road to prosperity for everyone, that mutual aid teams were better than individual work, that cooperatives were better than mutual aid teams, and that collective farms were better than cooperatives. Li Luzhong, a peasant in Guojia Township, said after seeing the pictures of the Wang Dengzhi agricultural production cooperative: "The agricultural production cooperative produces more grain. After I go back, I must do a good job in the mutual aid team and develop it into a cooperative." After seeing the picture of model military family member Pang Yinwen, an old man, actively selling grain to the country, the peasants admired his patriotic actions and said that they would also sell their surplus grain to the country. They saw that the supply and marketing cooperatives could timely purchase peasants' local and special products and supply peasants with industrial products, reducing the merchants' intermediate exploitation of peasants, and expressed that they would increase their shares and run the supply and marketing cooperatives well.

To run this kind of exhibition well: First, the responsible comrades must personally lead and do a good job in the preparation work. Bai Peiheng, the secretary of the Zhaohua County Party Committee, personally led the preparation work for the exhibition. In the process of preparation, the inspection work was strengthened, and the propaganda content and methods were specifically explained to the propaganda cadres. Every cadre who participated in the propaganda had studied beforehand and collected some specific examples from the county based on the pictures they were responsible for explaining to enrich the propaganda content. This made the explanation vivid and specific, avoiding the phenomenon of explaining pictures by rote in the propaganda, which was boring. Second, the content of the exhibition should use more local real people and real events, or use local real people and real events to explain the charts and graphs in the exhibition. For example, when explaining "The Motherland in Progress," they incorporated the example of the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which was commonly seen by peasants, into it; when propagandizing "The Great Achievements of Our Motherland in the Past Three Years," they combined the development of education, farmland water conservancy, mutual aid and cooperation, etc. in the county. Propaganda and explanation should be targeted at the ideological problems of the masses. For example, when propagandizing the road to common prosperity, attention was paid to analyzing and criticizing the erroneous ideas of "eating from the same big pot" and "covering with the same big quilt." Third, the content of the pictures is very rich, but it must be explained around the general line. For example, when introducing the socialist society of the Soviet Union, it is necessary to talk about how the socialist society of the Soviet Union was obtained through arduous struggle, and that if everyone wants to transition to socialism, they must actively develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, increase the production of more grain, and support the country's economic construction, etc. In addition, popular language should be used for propaganda and explanation, and the explanation should be specific but also concentrated and concise, and not too much or too broad.

### 昭化通过实物图片展览会向农民宣传总路线

    昭化通过实物图片展览会向农民宣传总路线
    去年十二月四川省昭化县在宣传总路线时，曾在一区举办了生动活泼、通俗具体的实物图片展览会。通过这个展览会向到会的五千多个农民全面地细致地宣传了总路线总任务和收购粮食的政策，效果很大。
    实物图片展览会，共分三个展览室，有二十二个干部专门负责宣传解释。第一个展览室——“想想从前”，里面共有三套图片。第一套图片是“一年到头”，说明解放前一年十二个月中地主怎样剥削和压迫农民。第二套图片，说明解放前地主和奸商在新粮上市时怎样压低粮价，囤积粮食；缺粮时，又怎样用高利高价贷给和卖给农民。第三套图片，说明解放前地主和奸商怎样使用高利贷来剥削农民。这三套图片，总起来是启发农民回忆解放前的生活，明确不能走资本主义的道路，而只能走社会主义的道路。第二个展览室——“比比现在”，共有三套图片和若干农民日用工业品。第一套图片，说明解放后四年来共产党和人民政府给昭化县农民办了那些好事，农民在政治上、经济上（包括减租退押、土地改革、文教卫生、贷款、贷粮等）得到了那些利益。第二套图片是“前进中的祖国”，第三套图片是“我们祖国三年来的伟大成就”。这两套图片，说明解放后四年来共产党和人民政府给全国人民办了那些大事，又说明祖国正在不断的繁荣和富强。这一展览室，总的是说明农民在解放后政治上、经济上得到的各种利益，从而使农民认识到农民的利益和国家的利益、工人阶级的利益、国家工业化的利益是一致的，农民的利益必须服从国家工业化的利益，眼前利益必须服从长远的利益，这也就是农民最高的利益。第三个展览室——“看看将来”，共有五套图片。第一套图片是“互助合作发展的道路”，这套图片共有四幅：第一幅画是?回乡单干农民张开贤的生产和生活情形，第二幅是?回乡何桃生互助组的生产和生活情形，第三幅是?回乡王登芝农业生产合作社的生产和生活情形，第四幅是东北松江省桦川县星火集体农庄。每幅图片上面都有很好的说明。第二套图片是“我们看到了苏联”，第三套图片是王登芝农业生产合作社社员尚金玉出卖余粮的经过，第四和第五套图片是模范军属庞银文和农民何永富卖余粮的故事。这一展览室，总的是说明农民应走的道路和对农业实行社会主义改造的步骤和方法。这就具体地对农民进行了互助合作教育和社会主义前途教育。
    农民们看了这次展览以后，就进一步认识到国家社会主义工业化的重大意义。比如：他们看了一九四八年与一九五三年各种工业品价格的对比后，体会到只有国家实现工业化，生活才能越过越好。他们看了“我们祖国三年来的伟大成就”和“前进中的祖国”两套图片后，非常激动地说：“几年来国家作了好多事呀，这些建设要多少钱才搞得出来。”他们听了四年来昭化县人民经过土地改革等等获得的利益相当于全县农民六年所交的公粮，很受感动。他们都说：“以前我们只是算一年缴了好多公粮，就没有算我们又拿回来好多，经过这一算，心里就明白了。”他们看了“互助合作发展的道路”那套连环图画，就认识到走互助合作的道路才是大家富裕的道路，互助组比单干好，合作社比互助组好，集体农庄又比合作社好。郭家乡农民李禄中看了王登芝农业生产合作社的图片以后说：“农业生产合作社打的粮食就是多，回去后，一定要把互助组搞好，发展到合作社。”农民在看到模范军属庞银文老头积极卖粮给国家的图画后，都很敬佩他的爱国行动，表示也要把余粮卖给国家。他们看到了供销合作社能够及时收购农民的土特产和供应农民工业品，减少了商人对农民的中间剥削，就表示要增添股金，办好供销合作社。
    要办好这种展览会：第一、要负责同志亲自领导作好准备工作。昭化县委会书记白珮珩同志就亲自领导了展览会的准备工作。在准备过程中，又加强了检查工作，并向宣传干部具体交代宣传内容和方法。每个参加宣传的干部，事前都进行了学习，并根据自己负责解释的图片收集了一些本县的具体事例，充实了宣传内容。这就使讲解生动具体，避免了在宣传中按图讲图，枯燥无味的现象。第二、展览的内容要多用本地的真人真事，或者用本地真人真事来解释展览的图表。比如在解释“前进中的祖国”时，他们就把农民常见的修建宝成铁路的事例贯穿到里面去；在宣传“我们祖国三年来的伟大成就”时，就把本县的教育事业、农田水利、互助合作等发展情况结合起来。宣传解释，要针对群众的思想问题。比如在宣传走大家富裕的道路时，就注意分析批判了“吃大锅饭”“盖大被盖”等等错误思想。第三、图片的内容很多，但是必须围绕总路线来解释。比如在介绍苏联社会主义社会时，就要讲苏联社会主义社会是经过怎样艰苦奋斗得到的，大家要想过渡到社会主义就要积极发展互助合作运动，增产更多的粮食，支援国家经济建设等等。此外要用通俗的语言进行宣传解释，讲解要具体但也要集中扼要，不能讲解得太多太宽。
