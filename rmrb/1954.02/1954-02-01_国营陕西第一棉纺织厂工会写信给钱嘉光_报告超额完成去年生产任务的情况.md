The Trade Union of State-Owned Shaanxi No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory Writes to Qian Jiaguang
Reporting on the Over-fulfillment of Last Year's Production Tasks

Comrade Qian Jiaguang of Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory:

After our entire factory's staff and workers read the letter you wrote to fraternal factories last year (see page 2 of this newspaper, October 28th of last year), we were greatly encouraged. We resolved to answer you with practical actions of striving to increase production and practice thrift, and over-fulfilling our tasks. Now, we are excited to tell you: Our factory's yarn workshop and cloth workshop respectively over-fulfilled the annual production plan ahead of schedule on December 22nd and 24th; and before the end of the year, we increased production for the state of cotton yarn and cotton cloth worth approximately 5.7 billion yuan. We completed the annual labor quota task, improved labor productivity, saved more than 839 million yuan in funds, reduced costs by 1.77 percent, and turned over profits exceeding the plan by more than 3.12 billion yuan.

After the launch of the increase production and practice thrift campaign, every workshop and every team conducted in-depth "four comparisons and three goods" (the four comparisons are: comparing the results of implementing work methods, comparing high output, comparing good quality, and comparing high savings; the three goods are: good unity and mutual assistance, good labor discipline, and good mutual learning of special skills). The entire factory also carried out a remedial movement for advanced work methods, organizing performances and observations; and improved measurement methods, meticulously recording the strengths and weaknesses of shift workers in implementing work methods, and helping workers thoroughly understand each action. This quickly improved the operating skills of the workers. For example, Pan Yueqin, a new worker in the cloth workshop, although she used to sweat profusely when working, had never completed the plan, and the rate of second-class cloth was often around 7 percent; after the advanced work method remedial training, in November, her personal output per machine for 20 hours reached 94.26 yards converted to people's cloth, exceeding the plan by 4.98 percent, and not a single piece of second-class cloth was produced. After the fine yarn workshop promoted the yarn joining work method, the large lumps caused by poor yarn joining decreased from 47 percent to 14 percent. Guo Songpo, an old worker in the cloth workshop, was educated by the "four comparisons and three goods" and reversed the mistaken notion of not believing in the "1951 Weaving Work Method," firmly implementing the "1951 Weaving Work Method." In November, we also set up a "Tip Garden" to raise topics targeting key issues in production, extensively mobilizing the masses to offer rationalization proposals; within a month, the masses put forward 271 rationalization proposals. Among them, the suggestion by Liu Yongqing, an old worker in the mechanical and electrical workshop, to use waste materials to replace the installation of spray pipes in the cotton cleaning room saved the state 8 million yuan in wealth; more importantly, it quickly increased the moisture content of raw cotton from below 7 percent to 8 percent, basically solving the old problem of insufficient moisture content in semi-finished products and difficulties in living.

In the context of the ever-improving living standards of the people across the country, the quality of our products still cannot quickly meet the needs of the masses; in our production process, there is still a phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end. In the future, we must continue to promote advanced operating methods, strengthen planned management and technical management, overcome our shortcomings under the brilliant illumination of the general line, follow the guiding principle of "developing the textile industry to meet the needs of the people," and work harder to complete the new tasks of 1954, and strive to achieve the great goal of the socialist industrialization of the motherland.

### 国营陕西第一棉纺织厂工会写信给钱嘉光  报告超额完成去年生产任务的情况

    国营陕西第一棉纺织厂工会写信给钱嘉光
    报告超额完成去年生产任务的情况
    天津纺织机械厂钱嘉光同志：
    我们全厂职工看到你去年写给兄弟厂的信（见去年十月二十八日本报二版），受到了很大的鼓舞。我们决心用努力增产节约、超额完成任务的实际行动来回答你。现在，我们兴奋地告诉你：我厂纱场和布场分别在十二月二十二日和二十四日提前超额完成了全年生产计划；并在年底以前又给国家增产了约合人民币五十七亿余元的棉纱和棉布。我们完成了全年劳动定员任务，提高了劳动生产率，节约了资金八亿三千九百多万元，降低了成本百分之一点七七，上缴利润超过计划三十一亿二千多万元。
    增产节约竞赛开展以后，每个车间、每个小组都深入进行了“四比三好”（四比是：比执行工作法的成绩，比产量高，比质量好，比节约多；三好是：团结互助好，劳动纪律好，互学特长好）的工作。全厂并进行了先进工作法补课运动，组织表演、观摩；并改进测定方法，详细记载值车工在执行工作法中的优、缺点，帮助工人同志仔细领会每项动作。这样很快提高了工人同志们的操作技术。如布场新工人潘月琴过去工作时虽然累得满头大汗，但从来也没有完成过计划，次布率常在百分之七左右；经过先进工作法补课后，十一月份个人每台二十小时的产量，折人民市布达到九十四点二六码，超过计划百分之四点九八，一匹次布也没出。细纱车间在推广了接头工作法后，因接头不良造成的大疙瘩由百分之四十七减少到百分之十四。布场老工人郭嵩坡受到了“四比三好”的教育，扭转了不相信“先进织布工作法”的错误认识，坚定地执行了“一九五一织布工作法”。在十一月份，我们还设立了“窍门园地”，针对生产中的关键问题提出课题，广泛发动群众提合理化建议；一月内群众提出的合理化建议达二百七十一件。其中机电车间老工人刘永清建议用废料代替安装清花间喷雾管子一项，给国家节约了八百万元的财富；更重要的是使原棉含水量很快由百分之七以下达到百分之八，基本上解决了半制品含水不够、生活难作的老问题。
    在全国人民生活水平日益提高的情况下，我们的产品质量还不能很快满足群众的要求；在我们生产进程中，还有着前松后紧的现象。我们今后一定要在总路线的光辉照耀下，遵循“发展纺织工业，满足人民需要”的指针，继续推行先进操作法，加强计划管理和技术管理，克服我们的缺点，并用更大的努力来完成一九五四年的新任务，为实现祖国社会主义工业化的远大目标而奋斗。
