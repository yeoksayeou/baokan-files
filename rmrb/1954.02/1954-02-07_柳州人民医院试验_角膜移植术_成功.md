Following the successful experimentation with "corneal transplantation" in Northeast China, Tianjin, Xi'an and other places, ophthalmologists at Liuzhou Municipal People's Hospital have also conducted experiments and achieved success. The first patient to undergo the "corneal transplantation" experiment was Hou, a poor peasant from Xianshan Township, Liucheng County, Guangxi. Her right eye was already blind. Tang Jidao and other ophthalmologists at Liuzhou Municipal People's Hospital used "corneal transplantation" to remove the white spot on the cornea of her right eye and replace it with a good cornea. When the bandage was removed five days later, her eye "brightened." After another four days, she could distinguish objects within two chi (Chinese feet). By the ninth day, her vision had reached more than four chi.

Tang Jidao, Lin Shouxun, and Xu Yan'an, three ophthalmologists at Liuzhou Municipal People's Hospital, had studied various documents related to "corneal transplantation" at the end of 1952 and decided to experiment in early 1953. However, they immediately encountered difficulties due to a lack of equipment. They made their own double-edged surgical knife to replace the trephine. They began experimenting with rabbits in September 1953, failing seven times in a row. But each failure increased their experience, and they finally succeeded on the eighth attempt.

Now, ophthalmologists at Liuzhou Municipal People's Hospital are continuing their research with full confidence and using "corneal transplantation" to treat leukomas (white spots on the cornea).

    柳州人民医院试验“角膜移植术”成功
    继东北、天津、西安等地试验“角膜移植术”成功后，柳州市立人民医院眼科医师也进行了试验，获得成功。第一个试验“角膜移植术”的病人，是广西柳城县西岸乡的贫农侯氏。她的右眼已经瞎了。柳州市立人民医院眼科医师唐继道等用“角膜移植术”，给她割去了右眼角膜上的白斑，换上好的角膜，五天以后解开绷带时，她的眼睛“亮了”；又过了四天，她已能辨别二市尺以内的物件。到第九天，她的视力已经到达四市尺多。
    柳州市立人民医院眼科医师唐继道、林守训、徐延安三位医师，在一九五二年底就已研究了有关“角膜移植术”的各种文件，一九五三年初便决定先试验；但一开始便遇上了缺乏器械的困难，他们便自己做了一把双刃手术刀，以代替圆钻。一九五三年九月便开始用兔子试验，连续七次都失败了。但失败一次却增加了一次经验，到第八次终于试验成功了。
    现在，柳州市立人民医院眼科医师正满怀信心地继续进行研究，并用“角膜移植术”来医治白斑。
