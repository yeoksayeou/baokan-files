    Luo Shengjiao River
    Hu Zhao
    Korea has many, many small rivers like this, like veins on the earth's body. They have no names, no magnificent waves, just flowing diligently beside the villages… But one of them has taken the name of a hero, it will forever inspire people, like a moving song. This river is also so humble, without waves, its water is also so crystal clear; hardworking people fetch water and wash clothes here. In winter, a layer of ice covers its flow, but in the place where the river bends and the water is rapid,
    the ice is as thin as paper. One morning, a young volunteer soldier came to the river and watched Korean children sliding swiftly on the ice, laughter bursting from the ice, bursting with simple joy. Suddenly, a boy shot like an arrow towards the bend in the river, ah! Ice shards and flowing water stirred up a vortex... The young volunteer soldier cried out in alarm and jumped into the icy river. The icy water pierced his thin body like needles, he dived again and again, groping on the riverbed... Finally, he used his purple hands to lift the boy out of the water, but he had exhausted his strength and was swallowed by the flowing water... Luo Shengjiao is the name of this young hero, and from then on people called this river the Luo Shengjiao River. The Luo Shengjiao River is an ordinary river, but the extraordinary name will make it eternally praised, it flows on the Korean land, long and ardent. No, it is like a warm current, flowing through the hearts of the Chinese and Korean people, flowing through the hearts of people all over the world, it stirs up huge waves of love...

    罗盛教河
    胡昭朝鲜，很多很多这样的小河，就像大地身上的一根根脉络，它们没有名字，也没有壮阔的波涛，就那么辛辛勤勤地在村边流过……可是其中有一条，取了一个英雄的名字，它永远激励着人们，就像一首动人的歌。这条河也是那么谦卑，无浪无波，它的流水也是那么水晶般的清澈；勤劳的人们在这里汲水、洗衣，冬天，一层冰遮掩着它的流动，但在那河弯水急的地方，
    冰就像纸一样的薄。早晨，一个年青的志愿军来到河边，看朝鲜少年们在冰上飞快地滑过，冰上迸发着笑声，迸发着单纯的欢乐。忽然，一个少年箭似的向河弯滑去，啊！冰片和流水卷起一片漩涡……年青的志愿军惊叫了一声，跃入冰河。冰水像一根根针刺入他瘦弱的身体，他一次又一次地潜下，在河底摸索……最后，用发紫的手把少年举出水面，可是力气用尽了，自己被流水吞没……罗盛教就是这年青的英雄的名字，从此人们就把这河叫做罗盛教河。罗盛教河是一条平凡的河，但不平凡的名字将使它万古传颂，它在朝鲜大地上流着，长远而热烈。不，它像一股暖流，在中朝人民的心上流过，在全世界人民的心上流过，它激起爱的汹涌的大浪大波……
