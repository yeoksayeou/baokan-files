Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 7th: The French newspaper "L'Humanité" reported on the 2nd that the office of the Chairman of the French National Peace Council has decided to forward the "Appeal to French Public Opinion" issued by the Standing Committee of the National Peace Council to Laniel and Bidault in Berlin. The full text of this document is as follows:

    The debates at the Berlin Conference and the exchange of views for holding a five-power conference show that all international disputes and conflicts can be resolved through negotiations.

    The French people's struggle against the entry into force of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty is a decisive factor in the convening of the Four Power representatives.

    However, the existence of these two treaties, and the determination expressed by the French representative in Berlin to insist that these two treaties are a fixed and unchangeable solution, have become a huge obstacle to finding a peaceful solution.

    On the contrary, France's interests require the conclusion of an agreement that guarantees the security of Germany's neighbors, prohibits the revival of militarism in any form, and opens the way for Germany's democratic and peaceful development.

    This situation places some new responsibilities on patriots and all peace-loving people.

    The Berlin Conference should listen to the voice of France. The actions of the French people in opposing the European Defense Community, striving for peace in Vietnam, and striving for motions conducive to easing international tensions are factors that contribute to the success of the Berlin Conference itself. It is important that the French people should bring the patriotic solidarity movement that once guided millions of French people to a new climax, forcing the government to propose motions that conform to the national will.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 7th: According to TASS, Paris, February 6th: French social figures are closely watching the progress of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The movement demanding a peaceful resolution of the German question and other major international issues being discussed at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is growing stronger.

    "L'Humanité" said: The municipal council members of Drancy, Seine Province (belonging to the Communist Party and the Catholic Party) wrote a letter to French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, asking him to "pay attention to the will of the vast majority of the French people" and take a position conducive to the peaceful resolution of major international issues. The letter pointed out that the French people oppose arming former Hitler criminals and demand that the German question be resolved in a way that is both in the interests of the German people and in the interests of the people of Germany's neighboring countries.

    Many women in Montreuil, Seine Province, farmers in Chapelle-Saint-Rémy, Sarthe Province, the municipal council of Villetaneuse, Seine Province (including Socialists, Communists, Gaullists, and "Independents"), many railway workers in La Rochelle, and many other local people have written to Bidault, strongly protesting the rearmament of West Germany under the guise of the "European Army."

    Xinhua News Agency: TASS, Paris, 29th: According to the French newspaper "France-Soir," the French Veterans Federation, with more than three million members, wrote to the countries participating in the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, asking them to reach an agreement specifically on the following issues:

    1. Resolve all international differences through consultation;

    2. Expand international economic, cultural, scientific and other relations;

    3. Lay the foundation for negotiations on the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, the unconditional prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, and the supervision of the implementation of the ban.

    In the letter, the French Veterans Federation said: The main condition for maintaining peace in Europe is a peaceful resolution of the German question, which is to conclude a peace treaty, end any possibility of reviving German militarism, and fully guarantee the security of all Germany's neighbors.

    法国全国和平理事会发表呼吁书
    号召法国人民积极争取和平解决德国问题
    【新华社柏林七日电】法国“人道报”二日报道：法国全国和平理事会主席办公室已决定把全国和平理事会常设委员会发表的“向法国舆论的呼吁书”转交拉尼埃和在柏林的皮杜尔。这一文件的全文如下：
    柏林会议上的争辩和为了举行五大国会议而交换意见，表明一切的国际纠纷和争执都可以通过谈判的道路来解决。
    法国人民为反对使波恩条约和巴黎条约生效而进行的斗争，乃是四大国代表开会的决定性因素。
      但是，这两个条约的存在，以及在柏林的法国代表所表示的决心即硬说这两个条约是确定无移的解决办法，已成为寻觅和平解决办法的巨大障碍。
      相反地，法国的利益要求缔结一项协定，这一协定要保证德国各邻国的安全，禁止任何形式下的军国主义复活，并为德国开辟民主与和平发展的道路。
    这种形势使爱国者和一切爱好和平的人士负担着若干新的责任。
      柏林会议应该听取法国的呼声。法国人民反对欧洲防务集团、争取越南和平和争取有利于缓和国际紧张局势的动议的行动，是使柏林会议本身成功的因素。重要的是：法国人民应使曾经引导着千百万法国人的爱国团结运动达到新的高潮，迫使政府提出符合全国意志的动议。
      【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：法国社会人士密切注意柏林四国外长会议的进程。要求和平解决德国问题及四国外长会议正在讨论的其他重大国际问题的运动，正在壮大。
    “人道报”说：塞纳省德朗西市的市政委员会委员（属共产党和天主教党）写了一封信给法国外交部长乔治·皮杜尔，要求他“重视法国绝大多数人民的意志”，采取有助于和平解决重大国际问题的立场。这封信指出：法国人民反对武装前希特勒罪犯，要求德国问题的解决既符合于德国人民的利益，又符合于德国邻国人民的利益。
    塞纳省蒙特勒伊的许多妇女，萨尔特省夏贝尔·圣勒米市的农民，塞纳省维耶塔纳斯的市政委员会（其中包括社会党人、共产党人、戴高乐分子和“独立”人士），罗舍尔的许多铁路职工以及其他许许多多地方的人民，都写信给皮杜尔，强烈抗议在“欧洲军”掩盖之下重新武装西德。
      【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎二十九日讯：据法国报纸“法兰西第一”报道，有着三百万以上会员的法兰西退伍军人联盟，写信给参加柏林四国外长会议各国，要求他们特别就下列问题达成协议：
    一、通过协商解决所有的国际分歧；
    二、扩展国际间的经济、文化、科学等方面的关系；
    三、为利用原子能于和平目的、无条件禁止大规模毁灭性武器及监督禁令的实施，奠定商谈的基础。
    法兰西退伍军人联盟在信中说：维护欧洲和平的主要条件是和平解决德国问题，这就是缔结和约，终止复活德国军国主义的任何可能、充分保证德国所有邻国的安全。
