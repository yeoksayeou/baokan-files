Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 26th:

    As the weather gradually warms up, grain warehouses are prone to pest infestation and spread. The Grain Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee and the Grain Departments of various provincial People's Governments have successively instructed their subordinate grain departments to do a good job in the spring grain depot inspection, and have dispatched working groups to provide specific assistance. In mid-January, the Grain Department of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government sent cadres to Zhouzhi, Xingping, and Mei County grain depots to conduct inspections in collaboration with the Northwest Grain Storage Inspection Team of the Ministry of Food of the Central People's Government, helping local grain depots and grain stations to test grain and study and formulate grain storage plans. Within half a month, the Fufeng County Grain Company in the province tested and inspected the moisture content and grain quality of more than 7 million jin of grain, and turned over and dried more than 200,000 jin of grain with high moisture content, reducing the moisture content from 21% to 16%, reaching the safe standard under the then situation. Lintong, Ningqiang, Zhouzhi and other counties, after checking warehouses and stacks one by one, promptly handled some moldy and deteriorated grain. The Pucheng County Grain Department promptly handled more than 4,000 jin of heated and insect-infested grain, saving the remaining more than 8 million jin of grain from losses. Grain depot keepers in Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia and other provinces have also promptly carried out the work of cleaning warehouses, eliminating warehouse insects and turning over warehouses to dry grain. Cadres of grain warehouses in various counties of Pingliang Prefecture, Gansu Province, have removed more than 30,000 jin of garbage from grain warehouses, with a cleaning area of 80,000 square meters. They also took advantage of the hibernation period of warehouse insects to eliminate warehouse insects in a timely manner. Grain cadres in Qingyang, Tianshui and other places also paid attention to catching mice and blocking rat holes. The grain departments of Zhongwei, Pingluo and other counties in Ningxia Province organized inspection teams to conduct meticulous inspections of various grain depots during the hibernation period of warehouse insects. The grain inspection team in Pingluo County cleaned more than 20 warehouses in three days, and removed all insect eggs and insect droppings. The counties in Hami Prefecture, Xinjiang Province, focused on the work of turning over warehouses and drying grain. After inspection, three warehouses in Hami County were found to have abnormal bottom temperatures and moldy bottoms. After three days of rescue, all the grain was turned over and dried, avoiding the mold damage of a large amount of grain.

    Many regional grain departments have formulated grain storage plans and storage systems in conjunction with this inspection. Some prevention and treatment and testing personnel of the Xi'an Grain Company have formulated a plan to study the advanced Soviet grain storage experience and the "insect-free grain depot" experience of Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, and are actively working hard to do a good job in grain storage.

    西北区进行春季粮食保管大检查
    【新华社西安二十六日电】现在天气逐渐暖和，粮食仓库的虫害容易滋生和蔓延。西北行政委员会粮食管理局和各省人民政府粮食厅先后指示所属粮食部门做好春季粮库检查工作，并派出工作组具体帮助。一月中旬，陕西省人民政府粮食厅派出干部协同中央人民政府粮食部西北粮食保管检查组先后到盩厔、兴平、郿县等地粮库检查，帮助各地粮库、粮栈化验粮食，并研究制订了粮食保管计划。该省扶风县粮食公司在半个月内就化验、检验了七百多万斤粮食的水分和粮质，并把二十多万斤含水量较大的粮食翻晒，使含水量由百分之二十一降到百分之十六，达到了当时情况下的安全标准。临潼、宁强、盩厔等县经过逐仓、逐垛检查，及时处理了一些霉坏、变质的粮食。蒲城县粮食部门由于及时处理了四千多斤发热和生虫的粮食，使其余八百多万斤粮食免受损失。甘肃、新疆、宁夏等省粮仓的保管人员也大都及时作了清扫仓房、消灭仓虫和翻仓晒粮的工作。甘肃省平凉专区各县粮食仓库的干部已在粮仓中清除垃圾三万多斤，清扫面积达八万平方公尺。他们并趁仓虫冬眠时期，及时消灭仓虫。庆阳、天水等地粮食干部还注意捕灭老鼠和堵塞鼠洞。宁夏省中卫、平罗等县粮食部门趁仓虫冬眠时期，组织检查小组到各粮库进行细密检查。平罗县的粮食检查小组三天内清扫了二十多间仓房，并将虫卵、虫屎全部清除。新疆省哈密专区各县有重点地作了翻仓晒粮工作。哈密县有三个仓库经检查后，发现底温不正常，底层有霉烂现象，经三天抢救，已全部翻晒完毕，避免了大批粮食霉坏。
    许多地区粮食部门结合这次检查制订了粮食保管计划和保管制度。西安市粮食公司部分防治和化验人员订出了学习苏联先进粮食保管经验和浙江省馀杭县“无虫粮仓”经验的计划，积极努力地做好粮食保管工作。
