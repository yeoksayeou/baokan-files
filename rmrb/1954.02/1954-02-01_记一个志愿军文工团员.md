    A Member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Song and Dance Troupe
    Ruoshui
    The first time I saw her was shortly after arriving in Korea. That night, the visiting delegation put on a performance, and the auditorium was packed. As soon as the doors opened, everyone rushed in. A little thing was darting through the crowd. Someone joked, "Who is this little runt? Pushing and shoving!" The "little runt" turned around, squinted her eyes, didn't answer, and pushed forward with all her might.

    I saw her again the next day. She was with some comrades from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. We exchanged names and addresses. She wrote her address in my notebook as well. From then on, we became acquainted.

    She was only sixteen years old, the youngest in the song and dance troupe. Her appearance was ordinary: two short braids, slightly dark skin, and a few freckles on her cheeks. Wherever she went, it became lively, with everyone calling out, "Little Chen Min! Little Chen Min!"

    Little Chen Min had only been in Korea for a year and a half, but she had changed a lot. People told me stories about her from before: When she first arrived in Korea, she encountered an airplane, but she didn't take cover. She was curious and wanted to see the bombs being dropped. Suddenly, a bomb fell, knocking her into a pit. People rushed to help her up and saw that she was covered in dirt, but fortunately unharmed. Once she calmed down, she burst into tears and said:

    "Does my mom know about this?"

    Her mom wasn't in Korea, so how would she know!

    I asked her, "Do you miss home?"

    "At first, I did a little; now I don't. I'd rather stay in the army for the rest of my life."

    After a pause, she said, "I just love army life. The revolutionary big family is warmer than anywhere else. My mom loves me, but she only cares about what I eat and what I wear. The army leaders are different: they take good care of you, but they are also principled. If you make a mistake, they don't excuse you, but help you correct it."

      "Life here must be hard?"

    "It's not hard. The people of the motherland are supplying us well, thinking of everything for us. There are hard times, but we are spiritually happy."

    She told me stories. In the past, when marching, she carried thirty pounds of equipment by herself. When people offered to carry it for her, she refused. As a result, she fell behind. Others had to take her things and carry them for her. At night, twenty or thirty people would squeeze into a small room. It was during the rainy season, and the room was damp, with mushrooms growing on the wooden walls. She slept in the corner, her face touching the mushrooms. It rained all night, soaking her clothes and bedding. They used pots, basins, and jars to collect the rainwater. It wasn't enough, so they even hung rubber shoes to catch the rain. When they woke up, many people were soaked in water. Although they didn't sleep well, everyone was laughing and jumping around. The more difficult it was, the more united and friendly everyone became. When they arrived at a place to stay, everyone would fight over the worst places to sleep. Little Chen Min received special care, and she felt like everyone around her was her older brother or sister.

    During the summer counterattack last year, Little Chen Min also went to the front lines. She and another experienced male comrade took flowers and candy to comfort the soldiers. Getting to the front lines required climbing mountains. Some mountains were so steep, "four legs to go up, an elevator to go down." They also had to pass through several lines of defense. Her legs were short, but she ran very fast, falling all the time. She didn't care about falling, getting up and falling again, falling and getting up again. Once, a shell exploded not far from her, but it didn't hit her. She got up and laughed; then she touched her head: Oh no, her hat was gone! It had been blown away by the explosion.

    "Weren't you afraid?" I asked.

   "No, as long as you understand the pattern of the shells, it's easy to dodge them!" she said.

    Whenever she arrived at the front lines, she always surprised the soldiers: "Oh my, why have you come to this place!" But they were also very happy and immediately surrounded her. They talked and sang, one after another. Finally, the squad leader asked everyone:

    "Comrades! How shall we respond to the comfort of the comrades from the song and dance troupe?"

    "Fight victoriously!" the soldiers answered like thunder.

    So they went to other positions. Before they could catch their breath, they swallowed and started singing again.

    The soldiers longed to hear the voices of the song and dance troupe members, and the song and dance troupe members had to take care of everyone, going everywhere. Little Chen Min said, "Once was really funny. One place was quite far from us, and there were few people there, so we didn't get around to going. They called and said they wanted to hear me sing. I said, 'Okay, I'll come.' They said, 'Don't come, we'll worry about you; just sing to us over the phone!' Ha, that was so funny! I sang three songs into the earpiece for them."

    Little Chen Min knew many songs and sang all day long. Her voice was indeed good. I had heard her sing a few Korean songs, very clear and crisp. The soldiers loved to hear her sing. As she sang, everyone sang along with her. The wounded soldiers also said, "Little sister, when you sing, my wounds don't hurt anymore!" As soon as she finished singing, everyone always shouted, "One more!" She would immediately sing another one, never refusing. Some soldiers would say, "Don't tire yourself out, save your voice!" She said, "It's okay! My voice won't get hoarse."

    But her voice finally did get hoarse, so hoarse that she herself thought it sounded awful. She was so worried that she wanted to cry: "What should I do? Can the soldiers still be happy listening to this voice?" So she did other things: while the soldiers were out on missions, she would put up pictures and slogans in their rooms, decorating them beautifully; she would find their dirty and bloody clothes and wash them; she would secretly put a letter of comfort that she wrote herself on their bedside, congratulating them on their victorious return. After a few days, her voice got a little better, and she ran to the front lines to sing again.

    "Sometimes, performing in the tunnels is really stuffy," she said. "There are too many people, and the tunnels are narrow, so you can hardly breathe. It's pitch black inside, and on top of being tired, you get sleepy as soon as you go in. Once, I fell asleep while singing. I vaguely heard a voice say, 'Why is there no sound?' I suddenly thought: I haven't finished singing yet! I quickly perked up and continued singing."

    She and I both laughed. "How long had you been awake?" I asked.

    "Oh, that time I hadn't slept for four days and four nights in a row," she said casually. "When walking on the road, my legs were as soft as cotton, not listening to my commands. I couldn't tell east, west, north, or south. It was clearly a wide road, but I would go astray. The planes were strafing overhead, and I didn't even know it. It was so funny!"

    I couldn't help but look at her more closely. She still had that same face: dark skin, a few freckles, a bit of a mischievous look, and eyes that always liked to squint. Once she squinted, there were only two slits. She was completely an ordinary girl, and two years ago, she was still a delicate and tender child. Four days and four nights without sleep? It was her?

      "How could you do it?"

    "I don't know myself! I didn't feel anything at the time, but when I think about it later, I'm surprised myself. Really, when I was in school, if I stayed up for three hours, I would have a headache all day the next day and couldn't do anything."

      "Actually, what we do is nothing!" she said after a pause. "You haven't seen the soldiers. They haven't slept or eaten for days and nights, and they rush up mountains hundreds of meters high. Some of them are wounded in the legs, but they don't want to be carried, they crawl down, and they sing as they crawl. When they see people, they shout: 'Today's fight was really great! I got my money's worth!'"

    I handed her half of a peeled apple, listening to her continue.

      "The soldiers are just so lovable, it's really not wrong to call them the most lovable people." She took a bite of the apple and continued. "After the battle, you see them all black and dirty, skinny as anything, but you still feel they are lovable from the bottom of your heart."

    "You've made good friends with them, haven't you?"

    "Of course." She took out her autograph book and showed it to me. It was full of soldiers' inscriptions and photos. Many of the words were written very kindly, some calling her "lovable Comrade Chen Min," others calling her "dear little sister."

    "When you go down to the companies, you have to become one with the soldiers," she said. "You have to slowly feel their hearts. Once you get familiar with them, they treat you like family, telling you everything. It's so satisfying to hear them tell war stories!"

    "See this photo?" she pointed to a soldier's photo. Then she told a story.

    This soldier was called Li Jiaju. Before the counterattack, Little Chen Min went down to the company to guide the entertainment work and became quite familiar with him. They often talked about the motherland and the future. "When the motherland's ten-year plan is completed, where will we be?" Little Chen Min would say, "At that time, you must have become a student at the military academy, do you believe it?" Li Jiaju was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth, and he also said, "At that time, you must have become a famous singer, winning first place in international competitions. You must come to our school to perform! We will welcome you!" When the counterattack began, at the swearing-in ceremony before the expedition, Little Chen Min presented Li Jiaju with a bouquet of flowers and said to him, "I wish you a good battle, and we'll see you at the celebration meeting!" Li Jiaju said, "No problem, you wait for my victory news!"

    Three days later, Chen Min also went to the front lines to comfort the soldiers. She went to Li Jiaju's squad, but she didn't see him. The squad leader told her: Li Jiaju was injured.

    "Is it a serious injury?" she asked anxiously.

    "Not light," the squad leader said. "He fought very bravely, he's a tough guy. He was hit in three places, but he kept shouting to charge. I ran up to bandage him. He said, 'You are responsible for the war. Don't worry about me, hurry up, don't miss the opportunity!' He's really great!"

    The next day, Chen Min saw Li Jiaju at the medical station. She comforted him, but he just shook his head, indicating that he couldn't hear. It turned out that his ears had been deafened by the shells. She became anxious and put her mouth close to his ear to sing, hoping to make him happy. But Li Jiaju's eyes were wet, and he said:

    "Little Chen Min, I'm sorry! I was injured before I completed my mission..."

    Chen Min said loudly: "I'm the one who should be sorry! You are a hero, but I haven't done anything!"

    Li Jiaju just kept shaking his head. …

      "What happened later?" I asked.

    "Later—" she paused and said, "He sacrificed himself. I saw him die with my own eyes. He said to me, 'Don't be sad, sing one for me!' So I sang, and as I sang, his eyes closed."

    At this time, I saw two sparkling tears in her eyes.

    "Later I cried," she said. "It was the first time I felt so sad. People have contributed everything, but what about me? I just hate that there is so little I can do, just sing..."

      "No," I held her hand tightly and said, "You have done a lot for the motherland, you have done more than many of us adults!"

    Before we returned to the country, the troops and the visiting delegation jointly held a banquet. I raised a glass of wine to her:

    "Little Chen Min, drink! I wish you good health!"

    She smiled: "I also wish you good health. We'll write to each other in the future, and I'll send you a photo from the front lines..."

    There are many such girls in the Volunteer Army. They have dedicated their most precious youth to the revolutionary struggle of blood and fire, to the most magnificent cause of mankind. They are the flowers of the battlefield, the pride of the motherland. They are growing rapidly. …

    记一个志愿军文工团员
    若水
    我第一次看见她是在刚到朝鲜不久的时候。那晚赴朝慰问团演戏，礼堂外面挤满了人，门一开，大家一拥而进。一个小家伙在人缝中乱钻。人丛中有人逗着玩问：“这个小不点是谁呀？乱挤！”“小不点”回过头来，眯了眯眼睛，没答话，又一股劲往前钻。
    第二天我又看见她了。那时她和好些中国人民志愿军同志在一起。我们相互交换姓名和通讯处。她也在我的笔记本上写了自己的通讯处。从此我们便相熟了。
    她只有十六岁，文工团里数她最小。她的相貌是平凡的：两条短辫子，微黑的皮肤，颊上有几点雀斑。她走到那里，那里就热闹起来，只听见一片声叫：“小陈敏！小陈敏！”
    小陈敏入朝才一年半，变化可不小。人家跟我讲她从前的故事：刚到朝鲜，碰上了飞机，她也不躲，好奇地想看看扔炸弹。猛地一个炸弹落下来，把她掀倒在一个坑里了。人家赶快过去扶她起来，一看，浑身是土，幸好没受伤。她心神一定，哇地一声哭开了，说：
    “我妈知道不知道呀！”
    她妈又不在朝鲜，哪里会知道！
    我问她：“你想家不想呀？”
    “开头也有点想；现在不想了。我呀，就情愿在部队里呆一辈子。”
    停一会，她说：“我就喜欢部队生活。革命大家庭比哪儿都温暖。妈也爱我，可只关心我吃得怎么样穿得怎么样。部队首长就不同：他对你挺照顾，可又是有原则的。你有错误，他不迁就，而是帮助你改正。”
      “这里生活苦吧？”
    “不苦。祖国人民供应得挺好，样样都替我们想到了。也有苦的时候，可是精神上很快乐。”
    她跟我讲故事。过去行军时，她一个人背三十斤东西。人家要代她背，她不服气，结果走着走着就掉了队，还是别人抢过她的东西背上了。晚上睡觉，二三十人挤在一间小屋子里。那时正赶上雨季，屋子发潮，木头墙上面都长了蘑菇。她睡在墙角里，脸就贴着蘑菇了。夜里尽漏雨，衣服被子全湿透。她们把锅、脸盆、罐子全都用来接雨。还不够，就连胶皮鞋也吊起来接雨。醒过来一看，好些人的身子都浸在水里了。虽然没睡好，大家还嘻嘻哈哈，蹦蹦跳跳的。越是艰苦，大家越是团结友爱。到一个住的地方，大家都抢坏地方睡。小陈敏受到的照顾特别多，她觉得周围的人全是她的哥哥或姐姐。
    去年夏季反击战中，小陈敏也去过前沿阵地。她跟另外一个有经验的男同志一起，带了花，带了糖果去慰问战士。上前沿得爬山。有些山又陡又高，“上山四条腿，下山坐电梯”。一路上还得通过好几道封锁线。她腿短，可跑得飞快，一面跑一面摔交。她对摔交满不在乎，爬起又摔倒，摔倒又爬起。有一回一个炮弹在她身旁不远的地方爆炸了，没炸着她。她爬起身来还乐得格格笑；再一摸脑袋：哎呀，帽子没有了！原来帽子给炸飞了。
    “那你不怕呀？”我问。
   “不怕。只要你抓住炮弹的规律就容易躲啦！”她说。
    她一到前沿，总要使战士吃一惊：“哎呀，怎么你们也到这个地方来了！”可同时也很高兴，立刻围了上来。他们两个就又是说，又是唱，完了一个又一个。最后结束了，班长就问大伙：
    “同志们！咱们用什么来回答文工团同志的慰问呀？”
    “打胜仗！”战士们雷一样地回答。
    于是他们两个又到别的阵地去。气还没有喘过来，咽一口唾沫又唱。
    战士渴望听见文工团员的歌声，文工团员必须面面照顾，那儿都去。小陈敏说：“有一回才好玩呢。有一处地方离我们挺远，那儿人又少，我们没有顾得上去。他们就来电话了，说想听我唱歌。我说，‘好，我就来吧。’他们说：‘甭来啦，你来我们也担心；就在电话里给我们唱一个吧！’哈，真逗！我就对着耳机，一连给他们唱了三个。”
    小陈敏歌子记得多，一天到晚尽唱。她的嗓子也的确好，我听她唱过几支朝鲜歌曲，非常清脆。战士最喜欢听她唱歌。她唱着唱着，大伙也都跟着她唱起来。伤员也说：“小妹妹，你这一唱，我的伤口也不痛啦！”她一唱完，大伙总是叫：“再来一个！”她马上再来一个，从来不拒绝。也有的战士说：“你别太累啦，留着嗓子吧！”她说：“没关系！我的嗓子唱不哑。”
    但是她的嗓子终于唱哑了，哑得连自己都觉得难听。她急得想哭：“怎么办呢？这个嗓子唱出来还能叫战士听着高兴呀！”她就做些别的事情：乘战士出去执行任务的时候，在他们房间里贴上画，贴上标语，布置得漂漂亮亮的；找出他们的脏衣服血衣服来洗；在他们的床头偷偷放上一封自己写的慰问信，祝贺他们胜利归来。过几天嗓子好了些，她又跑到前沿去唱起来。
    “有时在坑道里演唱，真气闷。”她说。“人太多，洞又窄，简直透不过气来。里面一片黑，加上又累，一进去就困。有一回我唱着唱着就睡着了，迷迷糊糊听见一个声音说：‘怎么没声音啦？’我猛地一想：还没唱完呢！连忙振作起来接着唱。”
    我和她都大笑了起来。“那你有多长时间没睡啦？”我问。
    “嗄，那一次就接连四天四夜没睡。”她淡淡地说，“走在路上，腿软得像棉花，不听自己使唤。东南西北也分不清，明明一条大道，走着走着就走岔了。上面飞机在扫射，我还不知道呢。真笑死人！”
    我不由得又注意看了看她。她还是那副脸：黑皮肤，几点雀斑，带点俏皮相，眼睛总是喜欢眯起来，一眯，就只有两条缝。完完全全是个普通女孩子，倒退两年的时候还是个又娇又嫩的娃娃。四天四夜没睡觉？就是她？
      “你怎么能作到的呢？”
    “我自己也不知道哇！当时不觉得什么，过后一想，连自己都奇怪。真的，在学校里的时候，我要是开了三个钟头的夜车，第二天就头昏一整天，什么都干不了。”
      “其实我们这个算什么呀！”停停她又说。“你没看见战士呢。几天几夜没睡觉没吃饭，几百公尺的高山，一冲就上去了。有的腿负了伤，不愿叫人抬，爬着下来，一面爬还一面唱。见了人就叫：‘今儿个打得真痛快！我够本啦！’”
    我递了半个削好的苹果给她，听她说下去。
      “战士就是可爱，叫他们最可爱的人真一点也不错。”她咬了一口苹果，接着说。“打完仗下来，你瞧他们一个个又黑又脏，瘦得不像人样，可是你还从心眼里觉得他们可爱。”
    “你跟他们做了很好的朋友吧？”
    “当然啰。”她掏出她的纪念册给我看。那上面满是战士的题字和相片。那许多话都写得很亲切，有的叫她“可爱的陈敏同志”，有的叫她“亲爱的小妹妹”。
    “下连队呀，就得和战士打成一片。”她说，“要慢慢摸他的心。一跟他弄熟了，他就拿你当亲人，什么话都跟你说。听他们讲打仗故事才过瘾呢！”
    “看见这张相片吗？”她指给我看一张战士的相片。接着就讲了一段故事。
    这个战士叫李家驹。反击战以前，小陈敏下连队去辅导文娱工作，跟他弄得挺熟。他们常在一起聊祖国，聊将来。“将来祖国十年计划完成后，我们在那儿呢？”小陈敏就说：“那时候呀，你一定当上了军事学院的学生，信不信？”李家驹乐得合不拢嘴，也说：“那时你一定成了出名的歌唱家，在国际比赛会上得第一名。你一定到我们学校来表演吧！我们好好欢迎你！”反击战开始了，出征前的誓师大会上，小陈敏献了一束花给李家驹，对他说：“祝你打好仗，咱们庆功会上见！”李家驹说：“没问题，你等着我的胜利消息吧！”
    过了三天，陈敏也到前沿去慰问了。她到了李家驹那个班，可没看见他。班长告诉她：李家驹负伤了。
    “伤重不重？”她着急地问。
    “不轻。”班长说。“他打得挺顽强，是个硬骨头。三处挂花了，还不断喊着冲。我跑上去替他绑扎。他说：‘你是对战争负责的。别管我，赶快上去，别误了时机！’他真是好样的！”
    第二天陈敏在医疗所看见了李家驹。她安慰他，他只是摇头，表示听不见。原来他的耳朵被炮弹震聋了。她急了，把嘴凑近他的耳朵去唱歌，希望使他高兴。可是李家驹的眼睛湿润了，他说：
    “小陈敏，我对不起你！我没有完成任务就负了伤……”
    陈敏大声说：“我才对不起你呢！你是英雄，我却什么也没有做！”
    李家驹还只是摇头。……
      “后来呢？”我问。
    “后来——”她停了一停，说，“他牺牲了。我亲眼看见他死的。他对我说，‘别难受，给我唱一个吧！’我就唱，唱着唱着，他的眼睛就闭上了。”
    这时我看见她的眼睛里含着两颗晶莹的泪珠。
    “后来我哭了。”她说，“我第一次感到那么难受。人家把什么都贡献出来了，可我呢？我就恨自己能作的事太少，只会唱唱歌……”
      “不，”我紧紧握住她的手，说：“你为祖国做得并不少，你比我们很多成年人还做得多呢！”
    我们回国之前，部队和慰问团共同举行了宴会。我端起一杯葡萄酒给她：
    “小陈敏，喝吧！我祝你健康！”
    她微笑了：“我也祝你身体健康。将来我们通信吧，我要寄给你一张在前线的照片……”
    志愿军里有不少这样的女孩子，她们把最宝贵的青春献给了血和火的革命斗争，献给了人类最壮丽的事业。她们是战地的花朵，是祖国的骄傲。她们在飞快地成长。……
