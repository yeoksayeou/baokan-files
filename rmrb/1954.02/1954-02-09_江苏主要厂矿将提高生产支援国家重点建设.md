Major factories and mines in Jiangsu Province, including the State-owned Liguo Iron Mine, Nanjing Machine Tool Plant, Nanjing Insulator Factory, Nanjing Light Bulb Factory, and Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory, will produce more products this year to support national key construction projects. The production plans of these factories and mines for each quarter this year are higher than those of the fourth quarter of last year. The planned output of iron ore from Xuzhou Liguo Iron Mine in the first quarter of this year has been greatly increased. The workers have created a method of expanding the bottom with chain blasting, using pneumatic drills for drilling, and using electric blasting, which can increase production efficiency by 15 times. The production plan of Nanjing Machine Tool Plant this year will increase by more than 65% compared with last year. They will start mass production of Soviet-style 1336 machine tools this year. This kind of machine tool is very efficient and can be equipped with 16 tool bits, while ordinary lathes can only be equipped with 4 to 5 tool bits. This kind of machine tool can replace general lathes, drilling machines, and small boring machines to undertake processing of cutting, drilling, precision boring and other processes. The high-voltage and low-voltage insulators produced by Nanjing Insulator Factory were supplied to new construction projects such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway last year to install telecommunications equipment. This year, the factory is also responsible for supporting the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The number of fluorescent lamps produced by Nanjing Light Bulb Factory this year will increase sevenfold compared to last year. The output of spotlights for basic construction sites will also increase by 20%. The factory successfully trial-produced high-pressure mercury lamps for blueprinting last year, and Anshan, the steel capital, will be able to use their new product this year. Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory has so far received orders from more than 200 units in various places. Therefore, the production of the factory's main products will be greatly increased this year, with levels increasing three times compared to last year, and current meters increasing two times. In order to meet the needs of national construction, the factory is also trial-producing new products such as "self-recording water level gauges" and "self-recording rain gauges." This year, the Film Machinery Factory will manufacture four pairs of automated double developing machines. After these four pairs of developing machines are successfully manufactured, they can meet the needs of the current state-owned film studios. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江苏主要厂矿将提高生产支援国家重点建设
    江苏省国营利国铁矿、南京机床厂、南京电瓷厂、南京灯泡厂、南京水工仪器厂等主要的工厂、矿山今年将生产更多的产品、支援国家的重点建设。这些厂矿今年各个季度的生产计划都比去年第四季度为高。徐州利国铁矿今年第一季度的铁矿石计划产量就提高了很多，工人们创造了扩大窝底连环放炮法，采用风电钻打眼，用电力放炮，使生产效率可以提高十五倍。南京机床厂今年生产计划比去年增加百分之六十五以上。他们在今年开始大量生产苏式一三三六工作母机，这种机床效率很高，可以装置十六把刀具，而普通车床只能装置四把到五把刀具。这种机床能代替一般车床、钻床、小型搪床担负切削、钻孔、精密搪等多种工序的加工。南京电瓷厂生产的高压、低压电瓷，去年曾供应给成渝铁路等新建工程装置电讯设备，今年这个厂又担负了支援宝成铁路的任务。南京灯泡厂今年生产日光灯的数量将比去年增加七倍。供应基本建设工地用的聚光灯的产量也将增加百分之二十。该厂去年试制成功晒图用的高压水银灯，今年钢都鞍山就可以用到他们的这项新产品了。南京水工仪器厂到现在为止已接受了各地两百多个单位的订货，因此，这个厂今年主要产品的生产将大大增加，其中水平仪比去年增加三倍，流速仪增加二倍。为着适应国家建设需要，该厂又在试制“自记水位计”、“自记雨量计”等新产品。电影机械厂今年要制造四对自动化复式洗片机，这四对洗片机制造成功后，可以满足目前国营电影制片厂的需要。（据新华社讯）
