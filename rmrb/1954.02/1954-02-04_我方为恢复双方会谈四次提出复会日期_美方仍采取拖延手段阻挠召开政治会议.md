Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 1st - Our special correspondent reports: Today is the date suggested by the Korean and Chinese negotiation representatives to the U.S. representatives, Dean, for the resumption of the bilateral talks on the political conference. This is the fourth resumption date proposed by the Korean and Chinese sides since January 14th. However, all indications show that after continuously rejecting the three resumption dates proposed by the Korean and Chinese sides, the U.S. side is still not sincere in resuming the talks and is preparing to make the convening of the Korean political conference even more distant.

    The U.S. State Department spokesman in Washington said yesterday that the U.S. response to the Korean and Chinese proposals will not be sent out before February 1st. The Associated Press admitted that this response "was deliberately delayed." This attitude of the U.S. side proves that it is not yet prepared to change its consistent position of delaying the convening of the political conference and obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    The fact that the Korean and Chinese sides have made continuous efforts to promote the early convening of the political conference has long been known to the world. The suggestion of resuming the meeting on February 1st is a new and active step taken by the Korean and Chinese sides to break the deadlock in the interrupted talks, and this suggestion has received widespread attention from world public opinion. Even the British "Manchester Guardian" admitted on the 27th that the Korean and Chinese proposal had "done some work" in "promoting the convening of the Korean political conference." Because the Korean and Chinese proposal left the U.S. side with no room to dodge on the issue of resuming or rejecting the talks, the U.S. authorities have been put in an embarrassing situation under the public eye. A Washington dispatch published by the U.S. "New York Times" on the 27th quoted "authoritative sources" as saying that the letter from the Korean and Chinese representatives suggesting the resumption of the Panmunjom talks has enabled the Korean and Chinese sides to "seize the initiative in propaganda, thus making it difficult for the United States to reject their suggestions."

    In this situation, the U.S. authorities are trying their best to escape the embarrassing situation for which they are being criticized by the world, while continuing to play the infamous tricks of sabotage and resistance, making the realization of Korean peace seem remote.

    News from U.S. news agencies shows that the U.S. side still wants to insist that we withdraw the accusations about the U.S. side's perfidy. The U.S. side clearly knows that the Korean and Chinese sides cannot agree to this unreasonable demand; however, it insists on clinging to this point. Even the U.S. personnel do not hesitate to state what its intention is. An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 30th quoted diplomatic sources as saying, "The U.S. notice stipulating this condition is, in fact, a rejection of the Communist side's proposal to resume the Panmunjom talks on Monday." According to news, while playing these sabotage tricks, the U.S. side even intends to continue to act shamelessly and shift the responsibility for the failure to convene the political conference to the Korean and Chinese sides.

    Obviously, this trick cannot cover up the U.S. conspiracy to obstruct the convening of the political conference, thereby obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. For the U.S. authorities, the right way out is to order Dean to return to Panmunjom immediately to conduct negotiations, so that the long-delayed political conference can be convened as soon as possible.

### 我方为恢复双方会谈四次提出复会日期  美方仍采取拖延手段阻挠召开政治会议

    我方为恢复双方会谈四次提出复会日期
    美方仍采取拖延手段阻挠召开政治会议
    【新华社开城一日电】本社特派记者报道：今天是朝中谈判代表向美方代表迪安建议的恢复关于政治会议的双方会谈的日期。这是朝中方面自从一月十四日以来第四次提出的复会日期。但是，种种迹象表明：美方在连续拒绝了朝中方面三次提出的复会日期之后，现在仍然没有诚意来恢复会谈，而准备使朝鲜政治会议的召开越来越遥远。
    华盛顿的美国国务院发言人昨天说，美方对于朝中建议的答复不会在二月一日以前送出。美联社承认：这一答复“是被故意地拖延了”。美方的这种态度，证明它还不准备改变它拖延政治会议的召开、阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯立场。
    朝中方面为了促成政治会议的早日召开曾经作了不断的努力，这些事实早已为世人所共见。二月一日复会的建议是朝中方面为打开会谈中断的僵局而采取的新的积极步骤，这一建议受到世界公正舆论的广泛重视。甚至英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”二十七日也承认，朝中建议已在“促成朝鲜政治会议的召开”方面“做了一些工作”。由于朝中建议使美方在恢复还是拒绝会谈的问题上毫无躲闪的余地，美国当局已在众目睽睽之下陷于狼狈不堪的境地。美国“纽约时报”二十七日发表的华盛顿通讯引用
  “权威人士”说，朝中代表建议恢复板门店会谈的信件已使朝中方面“夺得了宣传上的主动，因此使美国难以拒绝它们的建议”。
    在这种情况下，美国当局正在一方面竭力企图逃脱它为举世指责的窘迫处境，一方面又在继续玩弄声名狼藉的破坏和抵制的手法，使朝鲜和平的实现遥遥无期。
    美国通讯社的消息表明，美方还想坚持要求我方撤回关于美方背信弃义的指责。美方明明知道，朝中方面不可能同意这种毫无道理的主张；然而它却偏要咬定这一点不放，其用心何在，连美方人士都毫不讳言。美联社华盛顿三十日电引外交人士说，“规定着这种条件的美国通知，事实上将是对共方提出的星期一恢复板门店会谈的建议的一种拒绝。”有消息说，美方在玩弄这种破坏手法的同时，居然还打算继续耍无赖，把政治会议不能召开的责任推给朝中方面。
    很显然，这种诡计掩盖不了美方阻挠政治会议的召开，从而阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决的阴谋。对于美国当局来说，正当的出路是命令迪安立即回到板门店来进行谈判，使已经被延迟很久的政治会议得以早日召开。
