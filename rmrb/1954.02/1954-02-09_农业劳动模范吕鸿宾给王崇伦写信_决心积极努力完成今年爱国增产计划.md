Agricultural Labor Model Lü Hongbin Writes to Wang Chonglun
    Determined to Actively Work Hard to Complete This Year's Patriotic Increase Production Plan

    Dear Comrade Wang Chonglun:
    Under the brilliant light of the General Line, we are celebrating the Spring Festival of 1954 together, and I am truly overjoyed. I would like to extend my warm congratulations to you for the brilliant achievement of creating a universal tool rest last year, which increased production efficiency by six to seven times, and I wish you success in improving the grinder.

    Dear Comrade Wang Chonglun, our agricultural production cooperative fought relentlessly against natural disasters last year and finally achieved a bumper harvest. The cooperative's more than 700 mu of land yielded more than 280,000 jin of grain, an average of 400 jin per mu, an increase of 15 percent over 1952. This is all due to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the help of our worker brothers. After studying the General Line, the awareness of the cooperative members has been more universally raised. In order to support industrial construction, we also sold surplus grain to the state. However, this number is still far behind the contributions of our worker brothers to the country. Therefore, in addition to working hard to prepare for production, and in accordance with the requirements of the state, combined with the actual situation of our cooperative, we have formulated a preliminary plan for patriotic production increase in 1954, striving to sell more grain to the state this year.

    This year, the total sown area of our cooperative is 675 mu (excluding the land of new members), and the total output is required to reach 368,560 jin, an average of 546 jin per mu, an increase of 36.5 percent over last year. The area of land planted with grain and industrial raw material crops should be appropriately expanded compared to last year.

    Currently, our cooperative is developing rapidly, and 27 households have already applied to join. In addition to paying attention to absorbing new members, we must also help the work of newly established cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and tell them about our experience and benefits of running the cooperative, so that the vast number of farmers can join us on the road to agricultural cooperation.

    Dear Comrade Wang Chonglun, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, I am determined to lead all the members of the cooperative to realize the production increase plan for 1954 with the greatest efforts, and strive to produce more and better grain. I believe that you will further develop your creativity and make more contributions to accelerating the socialist industrialization of the motherland. Let our workers and peasants unite closely and work hard to achieve a better socialism!
                        Lü Hongbin, Aiguo Village, Juxian County, Shandong

    农业劳动模范吕鸿宾给王崇伦写信
    决心积极努力完成今年爱国增产计划
    亲爱的王崇伦同志：
    在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们一同欢度一九五四年的春节，真有说不出的高兴。我谨向您去年创造了万能工具胎使生产效率提高了六、七倍的辉煌成绩致热烈的祝贺，并预祝您改进磨床胜利成功。
    亲爱的王崇伦同志，我们的农业生产合作社在去年向自然灾害进行了不断的斗争，终于获得了丰收。全社七百多亩土地，收了二十八万多斤粮食，平均每亩收粮四百斤，比一九五二年增产百分之十五。这都是由于党和毛主席的领导，工人老大哥的帮助的结果。学习了总路线后，社员们的觉悟更加普遍提高了。我们为了支援工业建设，又把余粮卖给了国家。但是，这个数字比起工人老大哥对国家的贡献来说，还差的很远。因此，我们除努力作好生产准备工作外，并根据国家的要求，结合俺社的实际情况，订出了一九五四年爱国增产的初步计划，争取今年把更多的粮食卖给国家。
    俺社今年总播种面积为六百七十五亩（新社员的土地未计算在内），总产量要求达到三十六万八千五百六十斤，每亩平均五百四十六斤，比去年增产百分之三十六点五。种植粮食和工业原料作物的土地面积要比去年适当扩大。
    目前俺社正在迅速发展，有二十七户已经申请入社。我们除了注意吸收新社员外，还要帮助新建社和互助组的工作，把我们办社的经验和好处告诉他们，使广大农民能和我们一起走上农业合作化的道路。
    亲爱的王崇伦同志：在党和毛主席的领导下，我决心带领全体社员用最大的努力实现一九五四年的增产计划，争取打更多更好的粮食。我相信，你也会更进一步发挥创造性，为加速祖国社会主义工业化而作更多的贡献。让咱们工人和农民紧紧团结在一起，为实现美好的社会主义而努力！  山东莒县爱国村　吕鸿宾
