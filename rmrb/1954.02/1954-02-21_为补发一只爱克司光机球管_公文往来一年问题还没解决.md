    Regarding the Reissuance of an X-ray Machine Tube
    Problem Remains Unresolved After a Year of Official Correspondence
    A letter from the Jiangxi Provincial Company of the China Medical Company: In December 1952, the Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Medical Company (formerly the Tianjin Office of the China Medical Company, hereinafter referred to as the Tianjin Station) allocated six X-ray machines to our company, including one tube. After this batch of equipment was sent to Nanchang by the post office, our company, together with the local post office and the Nanchang branch of the People's Insurance Company of China, inspected it and found that the glass of the tube was broken. The three parties immediately issued a breakage certificate. Because the Tianjin Station did not send the insurance policy, we could not claim compensation from the insurance company. Therefore, on January 21, 1953, we sent the breakage certificate to the Tianjin Station so that they could claim compensation from the insurance company and requested that they reissue a tube. After repeated inquiries by our company, the Tianjin Station replied on April 3, saying, "The insurance policy has already been sent." However, after our company checked carefully, we did not receive the insurance policy, and we sent another letter on April 25 asking when the insurance policy was sent. After repeated inquiries, the station did not reply. After our company reported to the China Medical Company and sent a letter to notify them, the Tianjin Station replied on September 5, saying, "Due to an error by the person in charge, no insurance was taken out. To solve this problem quickly, your company can purchase it locally, and the cost will be borne by our station; otherwise, please send a letter stating the brand, factory, and specifications, etc., and our station will order a tube to reissue." In order to avoid further delays, our company decided to purchase it ourselves and requested the Tianjin Station to remit 30 million yuan to our company at the current price. However, on November 2 and 12, the Tianjin Station deliberately sent letters inquiring about the tube specifications (in fact, they already knew), without mentioning the payment at all. On December 22, we informed the Tianjin Station of the factory brand and specifications, etc., but the problem has not yet been resolved.
    For an X-ray machine tube, more than 30 official letters have been exchanged, and the delay has lasted for more than a year, but the problem has not yet been resolved. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Medical Company has adopted a perfunctory, procrastinating, and irresponsible attitude towards this problem, which is very wrong.

### 为补发一只爱克司光机球管  公文往来一年问题还没解决

专栏：读者来信摘要

    为补发一只爱克司光机球管
    公文往来一年问题还没解决
    中国医药公司江西省公司来信：一九五二年十二月，中国医药公司天津采购供应站（即前中国医药公司天津办事处，以下简称天津站）调拨我公司爱克司光机六台，内有球管一只。这批器材经邮局寄到南昌后，我公司会同当地邮局和中国人民保险公司南昌市支公司验收，结果发现球管玻璃已经破碎，当即由三方会同出具破碎证明书。因为天津站没有将保险单寄来，我们无法向保险公司索赔，所以在一九五三年一月二十一日将破碎证明书寄给天津站，以便他们向保险公司索赔，同时请求补发球管一只。经我公司多次催问后，天津站到四月三日才答复说：“保险单前已寄给。”但经我公司详细检查，并未收到保险单，又在四月二十五日去信询问保险单是何时寄出的。以后又催问多次，该站一直不作答复。经我公司呈报中国医药公司去信通知后，天津站到九月五日才来信说：“因经办同志之误，并未保险。为急速解决这个问题，你公司可于当地自购，费用由我站负担；否则可来信说明牌号、厂别、规格等，由我站订购一球管补发。”为了免得这件事再拖延下去，我公司就决定自行购置，并请天津站按时价三千万元汇给我公司。但是，天津站到十一月二日和十二日还故意来信询问球管规格（其实他们早就知道了），对付款的事一句不提；十二月二十二日我们将厂牌、规格等告知天津站，但问题还没有得到解决。
    为了一只爱克司光机球管，来往公文三十多次，拖延时间一年以上，问题还没有得到解决。中国医药公司天津采购供应站对待这个问题采取了敷衍拖拉、不负责任的态度，这是很不应该的。
