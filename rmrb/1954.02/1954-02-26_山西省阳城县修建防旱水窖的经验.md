Shanxi Province's Yangcheng County is a hilly area with few trees and scarce water sources. Canal construction and well digging are difficult, making it prone to drought. After liberation, thanks to the active leadership of the Party and the People's Government in guiding farmers to build water conservancy projects and fight against drought, over the ten years from 1942 to 1951, the county built more than 6,950 water cellars (also called dry wells). Farmers used these water cellars to store rainwater, which could be used for planting or irrigating seedlings during spring or autumn droughts, proving very beneficial. In the spring of 1952, after the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on drought prevention and resistance, the Yangcheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Government further called on farmers to build water conservancy projects and combat drought, launching a widespread water cellar construction movement throughout the county. That spring, over 32,000 water cellars were built. Last spring, the masses spontaneously built another 12,000 plus. Now, of the county's 173 villages, excluding 16 villages unsuitable for building such water cellars, a total of more than 44,590 water cellars have been built. On both sides of the 50-li road from Zhoucun in Jincheng to Yangcheng County, almost every field has such a water cellar. Linjian Village, with over 240 households, has an average of three such water cellars per household.

These water cellars store a lot of water and play a significant role in overcoming drought and developing agricultural production. These water cellars are built beside fields or roads and are connected by waterways, making water storage very convenient. As long as there is a heavy snowfall in winter or a heavy rain in spring or summer, they can be filled. The largest water cellars in the county can store 3,000 dan of water each, while ordinary ones can store about 300 dan. According to statistics, the total water storage capacity of the county's water cellars is about 11,854,000 dan. If this water is used for planting during spring drought, at a rate of 30 dan of water per mu of corn, it can be used to plant more than 395,000 mu, equivalent to 57 percent of the county's land. If used for irrigating seedlings during autumn drought (watering the roots of the seedlings), it can protect 330,000 mu of autumn seedlings from withering in the most severe drought conditions. Calculated according to the county's population of 234,000, each person can have 1.4 mu of land protected by drought resistance. Building these water cellars requires little labor and investment, and they are durable. According to the county's experience, building a water cellar only requires 200 jin of lime and about 25 man-days. Once built, each water cellar can generally be used for more than ten years. A large water cellar in Hengling Village in this county, capable of storing 3,000 dan of water, has been in use for more than 20 years.

The county has achieved certain successes in building water cellars, primarily due to the active leadership of local leading departments. In the spring of 1952, the local CCP County Committee, based on the instructions of the higher-level Party Committee, carefully analyzed the local natural conditions and the farmers' existing experience in drought resistance. They found that water cellars were a relatively successful method of drought resistance in the area and vigorously called on farmers to build them. In the specific implementation process, the County Committee, on the one hand, called on Party and Communist Youth League members to lead by example; on the other hand, organized cadres to go deep into the rural areas to lead this movement. In addition to guiding farmers to recall the suffering during the great drought of 1943, they also organized farmers who had benefited from building water cellars to use accounting and comparison methods to publicize the benefits to neighboring families and villages. This greatly increased the farmers' enthusiasm for drought resistance, and the work of building water cellars quickly unfolded.

Secondly, in mobilizing the masses to build water cellars, they closely integrated it with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, thereby solving the labor shortage in well digging; at the same time, the construction of water cellars promoted the further development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In 1952, on the basis of the existing mutual aid and cooperation movement, through the work of building water cellars, the number of households organized in the county accounted for 90 percent of the total number of farm households.

Thirdly, they did a good job in imparting technical knowledge in the construction of water cellars, ensuring the quality of the water cellars. Because the county organized small-scale observation meetings in a timely manner and exchanged experiences and techniques, the quality of the water cellars built was very good. According to the county's experience, attention should be paid to selecting a good location and plastering the cellar walls and bottom firmly when building water cellars. The location of small cellars should be chosen in a place where the soil is firm and can attract rainwater, so as to avoid seepage and collapse and facilitate water storage. The cellar walls and bottom of the water cellar should be plastered firmly with mixed mud (made of lime mixed with sand or white soil) to maintain firmness and prevent leakage. The plastering method here is to drill small holes in the cellar wall first, and then apply the mud by hand. This can make the mud adhere firmly and prevent it from falling off. The thickness of the mud is one inch for the cellar wall and four inches for the cellar bottom. After plastering the mud, use a mud board to flatten and even it out, cover the cellar opening, and then press it once or twice with a mud board after a few days. This will make the built water cellar strong and durable.

    山西省阳城县修建防旱水窖的经验
    武文斌
    山西省阳城县是一个多丘陵的地区，树林很少，水源缺乏，开渠打井都很困难，经常容易遭受旱灾。解放后，由于党和人民政府积极领导农民兴修水利，向旱灾作斗争，从一九四二到一九五一年的十年中，全县修建了六千九百五十多个水窖（也叫旱井），农民利用这种水窖储蓄雨水，每遇春旱或秋旱的时候，就可以用这些雨水进行点种或润苗，好处很大。一九五二年春，中央人民政府政务院发布关于防旱抗旱的指示后，中共阳城县委员会和县人民政府，进一步号召农民兴修水利，战胜旱灾，在全县普遍发动了打水窖运动。这年春天，全县打成水窖达三万二千多个。去年春季群众又自动打成一万二千多个。现在全县一百七十三个村，除十六个村不能打这种水窖外，总共打水窖四万四千五百九十多个。从晋城周村到阳城县城五十里路的两侧，几乎每块地边都有这种水窖。临涧村二百四十多户，每户平均就有三个这样的水窖。
    这种水窖蓄水很多，对克服干旱，发展农业生产的作用很大。这种水窖建筑在地边或道路两侧，并有水道相通，蓄水也很方便。只要冬天有场大雪、春天或夏天有场大雨，就可灌满。该县最大的水窖，每个可蓄水三千担，一般的都能蓄三百担左右。经统计全县水窖的一次蓄水量约有一千一百八十五万四千多担。这些水如用在春旱点种上，按一亩玉茭三十担水计，可点种三十九万五千多亩，等于全县土地的百分之五十七，如果用在秋旱润苗上（水浇到苗根），在最旱的情况下，可保苗三十三万亩秋苗不致枯死。这些可以抗旱保苗的地按全县二十三万四千人口平均，每人可有一亩四分。修建这种水窖，用工少，投资小，而且坚固耐用。根据这个县的经验，修一个水窖只需用二百斤石灰，和二十五个左右的人工，修成后，每个水窖一般可用十多年。这个县横岭村一个蓄三千担水的大水窖，已有二十多年的历史。
    这个县在修建水窖上取得了一定的成绩，首先是和当地领导部门积极领导分不开的。一九五二年春，当地中共县委根据上级党委的指示，认真分析了当地自然条件，和农民已有的抗旱经验，发现水窖是当地一种比较成功的抗旱方法，就大力号召农民进行修建。在具体进行中，县委会一方面号召党团员以身作则，带头示范；一方面组织干部深入农村领导这一运动。除了引导农民回忆一九四三年大旱时的痛苦情况外，并组织那些由于修建水窖获益的农民，用算账对比的方法，向邻家邻村宣传。这样就大大提高了农民的抗旱积极性，兴修水窖工作也就迅速地开展起来了。
    其次是在发动群众修建水窖中，密切结合了互助合作运动的发展，从而解决了打井中劳力不足的困难；同时由于通过修建水窖也促使了互助合作运动的进一步发展。一九五二年在原有的互助合作运动的基础上，通过兴修水窖工作，全县组织起来的农户，占到总农户的百分之九十。
    再次是在修建水窖中做好了技术传授工作，保证了水窖的质量。这个县由于及时组织了小型观摩会，交流了经验和技术，因而打成的水窖质量都很好。根据这个县的经验，修建水窖应该注意选好地址和糊牢窖壁窖底。小窖的地址要选择土质坚硬和能引来雨水的地方，这样才能避免渗漏坍塌，便于蓄水。水窖的窖壁窖底要用混合泥（用石灰掺沙土或白土和成）糊牢，以保持坚固不漏水；这里的糊泥方法是先在窖筒壁上钻些小窟窿，然后把泥用手抹上，这样可以把泥糊牢，不易脱落。泥的厚度，窖壁一寸，窖底四寸。糊泥后用泥板推平推匀，盖住窖口，过几日再用泥板压一、二次，这样就可以使打成的水窖坚固耐用。
