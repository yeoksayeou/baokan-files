    Patriotic Movement to Reclaim New Lands
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

    Late at night on the 22nd, Muscovites warmly saw off the first group of Communist Youth League members volunteering to reclaim new lands at the Kazan Railway Station. They bid farewell to the capital and set off for the Altai Territory. Among these pioneers were many advanced workers, capable engineers, and active members of the Youth League. As the train slowly left the station, a new song echoed in the cold air:

    Send back the news,
    The grasslands are about to bloom!
    The Party ordered,
    The Youth League replied: "Yes!"

    Following this first train, more people from Moscow will volunteer to reclaim new lands in North Kazakhstan, West Siberia, and the South Urals.

    A few days ago, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out in its appeal to all voters that reclaiming new lands in the eastern part of the Soviet Union could greatly increase grain production: Today, the main line of Soviet development of grain production is to increase yields, but at the same time, attention is paid to exploiting potential capacity and expanding arable land area. The Soviet Union plans to reclaim 2.3 million hectares of new land this spring in Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and the Volga River basin, and a total of more than 13 million hectares of new land (195 million mu) will be reclaimed in the next two years, which will increase grain production by several hundred million piculs. The state has already transported thousands of tractors and other agricultural machinery to the areas to be reclaimed.

    Now that spring plowing is approaching, when there is a need for people, for a volunteer army to conquer the uncultivated land, the Youth League members have launched a patriotic movement to participate in the reclamation of new lands. In the past few days, 12,500 people in Moscow, 10,000 people in Ukraine, nearly 1,000 people in Belarus, and more than 25,000 Youth League members across the country have applied to go to reclaim new lands. This vividly demonstrates the Soviet youth's love for the motherland, the Party, and the people.

    Before the Youth League members participating in the reclamation set off, a farewell party was held in the Kremlin by youth representatives from Moscow City and the Moscow Oblast. Comrades Malenkov and other Soviet Party and government leaders attended. Comrade Khrushchev congratulated and encouraged the young patriots on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. Zoya Gavrilina, a young engineer from the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, said on the stage: "We will dedicate all our youthful enthusiasm to solving the great task! We will make the dormant land serve the Soviet people!" She spoke the will of the Soviet youth. Three years ago, Zoya Gavrilina wanted to go to the Volga-Don Canal to participate in the work, but the factory did not allow it. For the past three years, she has been constantly learning and mastering specialized technology. This time, after reading the newspaper, she decided to go to reclaim new land before she had time to discuss it with her parents. She comforted her mother and persuaded the workshop director who was worried about the February production plan.

    Leaving accustomed work, familiar relatives and friends, and convenient places to go to distant places to reclaim land and do hard work is not easy. This demonstrates the noble communist qualities of Soviet youth. In a letter to all Soviet youth, the Youth League members who set off to reclaim land said: "Soviet young men and women never look for an easy life - this is how our Communist Party educates us. We clearly see the great goal in front of us, and we will persistently and selflessly strive to achieve it."

    The predecessors of the Youth League city on the Heilongjiang River, the Dnepr hydroelectric power station, and the young builders of Magnitogorsk are their role models, and the young reclaimers will create new miracles on the eastern land of the Soviet Union.

### 开垦新地的爱国主义运动

    开垦新地的爱国主义运动
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    二十二日深夜，莫斯科人在喀山火车站热烈地送走了第一批志愿去开垦新地的共产主义青年团团员。他们告别了首都，出发到阿尔泰边疆去。这些拓荒者中有许多先进的工人，能干的工程师和青年团的积极分子。当火车徐徐离站时，在严寒的空气中响着一支新歌：
    捎来吧音讯，
    草原要开花！
    党吩咐了，
    青年团回答：“是”。
    随着这第一列火车之后，莫斯科将有更多的人志愿到北哈萨克、西西伯利亚、南乌拉尔等地方去开垦新地。
    几天前，苏联共产党中央委员会在告全体选民书中指出了开垦苏联东部新地，可以大大增产谷物：今天苏联发展谷物生产的主要路线是提高收获量，但同时也注意发挥潜在能力，扩大耕地面积。苏联计划今年春天在西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域开垦二百三十万公顷新地，今明两年内共将开垦一千三百多万公顷新地（一亿九千五百万市亩），将增产几亿公担粮食。国家已经运送了几千台拖拉机及其他农业机器到待开垦的地区去。
    现在春耕快要到来，那里正需要人，需要征服未开垦的土地的志愿军的时候，青年团员们发起了参加开垦新地的爱国主义运动。几天来，莫斯科已有一万二千五百人，乌克兰有一万人，白俄罗斯有近千人，全国各地共有二万五千以上的青年团员申请去开垦新地。这事鲜明地表现着苏联青年对祖国、对党、对人民的热爱。
    在参加开垦的青年团员们出发之前，莫斯科市和莫斯科州的青年代表在克里姆林宫举行了欢送会。以马林科夫同志为首的苏联党和政府领袖都出席了。赫鲁晓夫同志代表苏联共产党中央和苏联政府给青年爱国者以祝贺和勉励。莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂年青工程师卓娅·加甫里林娜到台上说：“我们将献出全部青年的热情来解决伟大的任务！我们将使长眠的土地为苏联人民服务！”她说出了苏联青年的意志。卓娅·加甫里林娜三年前想到伏尔加河—顿河运河去参加工作，没有得到工厂的允许。三年来她不断学习，掌握了专门技术。这次她读报纸后还没有来得及和父母商量，就决定开垦新地去。她安慰了母亲，说服了担心二月份生产计划的车间主任。
    离开习惯的工作、熟悉的亲友、方便的地方，而到远方去开垦，去做艰难的工作，这是不容易的。这表现了苏联青年的崇高的共产主义品质。出发开垦的青年团员们给全苏青年的信中说：“苏联男女青年从来不找轻松的生活，——我们共产党就是这样教养我们的。我们明确地看到面前的伟大目标，我们将坚持地和忘我地争取它的实现。”
    黑龙江上的共青团城、第聂伯水电站、马格尼托哥尔斯克的青年建设者的先辈是他们的榜样，年青的开垦者们将在苏联东部土地上创造出新的奇迹。
