Xinhua News Agency, 1st. According to the Indian News Service: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, on January 30th, at the Delhi memorial meeting for the sixth anniversary of Gandhi's death, condemned the planned "military aid" from the United States to Pakistan. He said: "The military aid that the United States is giving to Pakistan is a fundamentally and completely wrong thing."

Nehru said: "Some people say that this 'aid' is a symbol of peace and will strengthen world peace, which is an absolutely absurd statement."

He said: "This aid will not only lead to a hot war, but will immediately bring about a cold war."

Referring to whether India would accept foreign "military aid," Nehru said: "If we become so foolish as to accept foreign military aid and reach out our hands to beg for this aid, then we are simply mortgaging our freedom and will eventually lose it."
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 31st. The movement of people from all walks of life in India against the planned US-Pakistan military treaty is rising.

All parties in India held a huge mass rally in Bombay on the 24th and passed a resolution condemning the US-Pakistan military treaty. Speakers at the meeting unanimously pointed out that this treaty is a threat to the freedom and sovereignty of the Indian people and Asian countries.

Mrs. Gian Chand and Mrs. Khaila Begum, heads of the All India Women's Liaison Committee, in an open letter to Pakistani women on behalf of the committee, expressed strong indignation at turning Pakistan into a US military base, and guaranteed that Indian women would support the struggle of Pakistani women against US aggression. Mrs. Gian Chand and Mrs. Khaila Begum pointed out in the open letter that the proposed US-Pakistan military treaty threatens not only Pakistan but also India. The open letter said: Indian women hate war, and they very much hope to live and raise their children in a peaceful environment.

The Northern Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of India has notified all levels of the CPI in the province to hold a Peace Week against the US-Pakistan military treaty from February 8th to 14th. The Benares County Committee of the Communist Party of India in Northern Province has formulated a plan to hold a Peace Week and called on people from all walks of life in the county to participate in this movement.

Lucknow, the capital of Northern Province, also held a mass rally on the 21st. Many political leaders expressed serious concern about the US-Pakistan military treaty in their speeches.

Ten thousand believers of various Hindu sects held a conference on the banks of the Ganges River near Allahabad in southern Northern Province on the 28th. The conference pointed out that the proposed US-Pakistan military treaty will not only bring losses to Pakistan, but also bring disasters to India and other neighboring countries.

Chan P. N. Singh, Governor of East Punjab Province, condemned the "military assistance" that the United States plans to give to Pakistan at a celebration of Indian National Day in Chandigarh, the provincial capital, on the 26th. He said: This "aid" will surely make Pakistan lose its independence and sovereignty.

    尼赫鲁谴责美国给巴基斯坦“军事援助”
    【新华社一日讯】据印度新闻处报道：印度总理尼赫鲁一月三十日在德里纪念甘地逝世六周年大会上，谴责策划中的美国给予巴基斯坦的“军事援助”。他说：“美国给予巴基斯坦的军事援助是一件根本上完全错误的事情。”
    尼赫鲁说：“有些人把这种‘援助’说成是和平的标志并将加强世界和平，这完全是一种绝对荒谬的说法。”
    他说：“这种援助除了将招致热战而外，并将立即带来冷战。”
    谈到印度是否将接受外国的“军事援助”时，尼赫鲁说：“假如我们变得如此愚蠢而接受外来的军事援助，并伸出我们的双手乞求这种援助，那我们只是拿我们的自由去抵押，并将在最后失去我们的自由。”【新华社新德里三十一日电】印度各阶层人士反对策划中的美巴军事条约的运动日益高涨。
