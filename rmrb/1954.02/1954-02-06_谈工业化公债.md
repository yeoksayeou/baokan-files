    On Industrialization Bonds
    By Maxim Gorky (Soviet Union)
    A journalist asked me a question: What do I think of the national economic industrialization bonds?
    I feel that subscribing to these bonds is a basic obligation of every Soviet citizen with even a little bit of awareness. It is very clear that to build a free and just socialist workers' state, we must have the latest technical equipment and build many large and small factories to supply the people of the whole country with everything they need. The people themselves should also contribute money to produce everything they need. The capitalists of Europe will not contribute money to do this kind of thing. They believe that the working people of Russia will exhaust their last strength in the labor of restoring their country's industry. They do not know how great the reserves of this strength are. They hope to economically enslave the working people of Russia, just as they previously enslaved the people of India and China.
    Our peasants and workers will not become the painfully wretched captives of European capital. Our urban and rural laborers have long understood that they must take out their surplus money to purchase national bonds so that the state can use this surplus money to further develop the national economy, which benefits the laborers. The Soviet regime has no other interests besides the interests of the working people. This is the only truly people's regime in the world, which truly hopes to create more favorable living conditions for the laborers and to build a just, socialist country. Our working people understand what their own regime wants to achieve, and this is illustrated by the fact that the people are willing to take out their savings to develop the country's economic undertakings. The people have earned their freedom with blood, and every person who buys a bond has done their part in consolidating this freedom.
      That is what I can say about industrialization bonds. When I say this, I am not a politician, but a citizen of my own country, a person who regards the happiness of the people, who are as close as parents, as my own happiness and joy, and a person who uses his whole life to confirm that "freedom and labor are above all else."

    Vladimir Ilyich Lenin understood the past very clearly, and he was able and good at looking at the present from the future. This is not something I am fabricating here "to be witty." Every one of his works, every article, especially those after the October Revolution, affirms this point. As early as the 1907 London Congress, he had foreseen that the victory of the October Revolution of workers and peasants was inevitable and drawing closer. He was good at predicting what should happen, which generally speaking no one had been able to do before him. The reason why he was good at and able to do this, I feel, is that half of his great heart lived in the future; his logic, as solid as steel but also extraordinarily flexible, allowed him to see a distant but very concrete and very real future. In my opinion, this is precisely what explains his remarkable perseverance in dealing with reality, no matter how difficult and complex this reality was, it would never confuse him, would never shake his firm conviction that the moment would surely come when the working class and the peasants should and will become the masters of the world. Before Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, our and the world's working people had no leader.
              ×　　×　　×
    Every ordinary soldier in Lenin's ranks should understand the knowledge and faith of his leader. Understanding this means being armed, having an unshakable and invincible force. We have already grasped some of this power, it has already produced, and is producing, many remarkable creative deeds, is bravely and forcefully laying the foundation for the world's first socialist state of workers and peasants, and is cultivating comrades and comrades-in-arms for itself all over the world.
    Is it really cultivating them? The capitalists of the world answer this question for us with their ever-increasing hatred of the Soviet Union and of the world's teacher of workers.
    The masters of the Soviet state, the workers and peasants, have lived for twelve years in a state of intense self-defense against internal and external enemies, against all kinds of robbers, parasites, and bad elements. They are now living in struggle, fighting against their own lack of culture and illiteracy, against those deeply ingrained bad habits of life that they brought from the bourgeoisie and that the cursed old world of slaves infected them with.
    Although there are these and many other unbelievably difficult conditions, although there are many obstacles to building their own country in peace, the working class and the advanced peasants have still achieved unprecedented achievements in their work. This is undeniable proof of the creative power of the working masses, a proof of the richest and inexhaustible potential of the working masses.
    I feel that if each of us could understand this more deeply, and each person or each unit believed that our country must defend itself and must "treat the economic transformation of our country with a socialist attitude," then the strength of the working masses would become even greater, and even more amazing results would be produced.
    The self-defense of the working masses against internal and external enemies first requires each of us to have a deep understanding, that is to say, to recognize that workers and peasants are the only legal masters of the Soviet Union, and that this is forever the case!
    It should be recognized that our economy, in terms of the existing technical situation, cannot fully satisfy all the needs of workers and peasants. Although the fault lies in our poor past, some of it should also be attributed to the workers and peasants themselves, to their incorrect understanding of the meaning of labor, which can overcome all obstacles on the road to a new life. Only labor, only knowledge can overcome obstacles.
    It must be known that the needs of our 160 million people will become greater and greater later on. The increase in this need is essentially the development of culture and the development of the strength and power of the working masses, the masters of the country, and the working people. But at the same time, it must be understood that the truly new culture that the advanced and conscious workers and peasants should create, and are already creating, should not and cannot be expressed in the accumulation of some needed items by individuals, but in the liberation of people from the power of surplus items.
    Bourgeois culture is precisely because of the excess of items that it perishes, and the joy of life and the will to live disappear because of the excess of items.
    Of course, it is too early for us to talk about surplus items now, and we still lack the necessary things. But it should be said that the petty-bourgeois desire to accumulate dispensable small furniture will still be revived; "comfortable" and vulgar petty-bourgeois life will still be coveted, although this is not very appropriate, or even ridiculously funny, in a country surrounded by enemies and in a state of self-defense.
            ×　　×　　×
    Self-defense, this means first of all accumulating correct knowledge of real life, arming wisdom and will, and the conclusion that should reasonably be drawn from this: we must strengthen the armament of our country with industry.
    The fortress used by workers and peasants to defend their country against enemy attack is unbreakable. And every new factory, new collective farm, and new agricultural commune is a brick and stone of varying degrees of firmness under this fortress. Only by accumulating industrial wealth on a national scale can all personal needs be fully satisfied. Only industry and agricultural mechanization, which is inseparable from industry, can strengthen our strength and strengthen our self-defense against enemies, so that we will be so strong that none of them will dare to raise their dirty and greedy hands against our country.
    It must be thoroughly understood that we are fighting against the old world, and every hour and every day of work is a victory for us in the struggle; every ruble we spend on the country's economic undertakings is a step forward towards victory.
    We have launched a socialist competition in the work of building a new life, but the enemy has answered us with bandit-like attacks in the Far East [Note].
    Our answer is to quickly subscribe to industrialization bonds. This bond illustrates the political improvement of workers and peasants, and its great economic significance goes without saying. This answer to the bandits is a beautiful and smart answer from the real masters of the country. It conclusively and indisputably shows that the spirit of Vladimir Lenin is immortal and incomparably great, and that the working masses are increasingly deeply understanding this spirit.

### 谈工业化公债

    谈工业化公债
    苏联　高尔基
    一位新闻记者向我提出一个问题：我对国民经济工业化公债怎样看法？
    我觉得，认购这种公债是每一个稍稍有一点觉悟的苏联公民的基本义务。很明显，要建立自由而公正的社会主义的工人国家，必须有最新的技术装备，必须修建许多大小工厂，这才能供给全国人民所需要的一切。人民自己也应当拿出钱来生产需要的一切物品。欧洲的资本家是不会拿钱来干这种事情的。他们认为，俄国劳动人民在恢复本国工业的劳动当中，会把自己的最后力量消耗掉。他们不知道这力量有多么大的储备。这个国家的人民有何等样的才干，他们所希望的，是要从经济上奴役俄国劳动人民，像从前他们奴役印度人和中国人一样。
    我们的农民和工人，不会作欧洲资本的痛苦万分的俘虏，我们的城乡劳动者早已懂得必须拿出余钱来购买国家公债，这是为了国家把这些余钱用来进一步发展有利于劳动者的国民经济。苏维埃政权除了劳动人民的利益之外，没有别的利益。这是世界上唯一真正人民的政权，它真正希望为劳动者创造更便利的生活条件，建立公正的、社会主义的国家。我们的劳动人民，懂得他们自己的政权要达到什么目的，下面这件事实就说明了这一点：人民愿意把自己的储蓄拿出来发展国家的经济事业。人民以鲜血换得了自由，每一个购买公债的人，都在巩固这种自由的事业当中尽了自己一分力量。
      这就是我关于工业化公债所能够讲的话。我讲这个的时候，不是一个政治家，而是自己国家的一个公民，是把亲如父母的人民的幸福看作自己的幸福与欢乐的人，是以自己的一生来证实“自由与劳动胜于一切”的人。
              ×　　×　　×
    乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁非常清楚已往的历史，他能够而且善于从未来看现在。这不是我“为了说俏皮话”而在这里凭空捏造。他的每一件工作，每一篇文章，特别是十月革命以后的，都在肯定这一点。早在一九○七年的伦敦代表大会上，他已经预见到工农十月革命的胜利是必然的，并且日益接近了。他善于预见应当发生的事情，一般说来这在他之前是没有人能做到的。他之所以善于而且能够这样作，我觉得这是他那伟大的心灵，有一半是生活在未来；他那钢铁般坚固，但也异常灵活的逻辑，使他看见了遥远的，但非常具体、非常实在的未来。依我看来，这一点正说明了他对待现实有着了不起的坚忍不拔的精神，无论这现实是多么困难和复杂，决不会使他困惑，决不会动摇他那坚定的信心，他始终相信工人阶级与农民应当而且将要成为世界主人的那个时刻一定到来。
    资产阶级的哲学家们，本能地感觉到：知识跟他们所习惯的旧“秩序”是敌对的。所以他们在过去和现在都喜欢指出：智慧与信仰不可调和。乌拉季米尔·列宁是有信仰的人，他之所以有毫不动摇的信心，这是因为他知道得十分清楚。他能有非凡的力量，这是因为他有明敏惊人的智慧。他用以充实自己智慧的渊博知识，把他武装起来，使他能够预见今天可能而且必定给予明天的一切。今天的现实，在他看来仅仅是构成未来的材料，我再说一次，无论什么决不会把他吓倒。他看见，也感触到身边有千千万万新历史的创造者，这就是工人阶级的先锋队，他们是他的思想和信仰培养出来的，他们能够带领全体工人群众，能够把牢牢地在土地上生了根的贫苦农民从土地里拔出来，使他们走上通往社会主义文化的宽广自由的大道。在乌拉季米尔·列宁以前，我们的和全世界的劳动人民是没有领袖的。
              ×　　×　　×
    列宁队伍里的每一位普通战士，都应当领会自己领袖的知识与信仰。领会了这个，这就是说有了武装，有了不可动摇和战无不胜的力量。这力量我们多少已经掌握了一些，它已经产生了，并且正在产生着许多了不起的创造事迹，正勇敢而有力地在为世界上第一个工农的社会主义国家打基础，正在全世界为自己培养同志和战友。
    真在培养吗？全世界的资本家对苏联、对全世界工人导师日益增强的仇恨心，为我们回答了这个问题。
    苏维埃国家的主人，工人和农民，已经在反对内外敌人，反对各种强盗、寄生虫、坏分子的紧张自卫状态中，生活了十二年。他们现在在斗争中过着日子，在反对自己没有文化和目不识丁，反对他们从资产阶级那里带来的、以及该诅咒的奴隶的旧世界传染给他们的那些根深柢固的生活恶习。
    虽然有着这一些以及其他许多难于令人相信的困难条件，虽然要安心建设自己的国家，还是障碍重重，但工人阶级与先进农民仍旧在工作中获得了空前未有的成就。这是工农群众的创造力量的无可争辩的证明，是工农群众最丰富的永无穷尽的潜在力量的证明。
    我觉得，如果我们每个人能更深刻地领会这一点，每个人或每个单位都认为我们的国家必须自己保卫，必须“以社会主义态度对待我国的经济改造事业”，那么工人群众的力量还会更加壮大，也会产生更为惊人的效果。
    工农群众对内外敌人进行的自卫，首先要求我们每人要有深刻的认识，这就是说能认识工人和农民是苏联唯一的合法的主人，并且是永远如此！
    应当认识我们的经济，就现有的技术情况来说，还不能完全满足工农的一切需要，虽然罪过在于我们贫困的过去，但也有一部分应当归咎于工人和农民自身，归咎于他们对劳动的意义有着不正确的理解，而这种劳动是能克服新生活道路上的一切障碍的。只有劳动，只有知识才能克服障碍。
    必须知道，愈到后来，我国一亿六千万人民的需要就会愈见加大，这种需要的增涨，实质上就是文化有了发展，工农群众、国家主人翁、劳动人民的力量和政权有了发展。但同时必须懂得，先进的觉悟的工人和农民应当创造，并且已经在创造着的真正的新文化，不应该，也不可能表现于个人积蓄一些需用的物品，而是表现于人解脱了剩余物品的权力。
    资产阶级文化正是由于物品过剩而灭亡，生活的乐趣和生活的意志都因物品过剩而消失了。
    当然，我们现在谈剩余物品为时还早，我们还缺乏必需的东西。但是应该说说，积存可有可无的小家私的小市民欲望，还会死灰复燃；“舒适”的、庸俗的小市民生活，还会有人贪求，虽然这在四面受敌，并且处于自卫状态的国家里，是不很恰当，甚至是滑稽可笑的。
            ×　　×　　×
    自卫，这意思首先就是积蓄正确的现实生活知识，予智慧与意志以武装，以及理应由此得出的结论：必须以工业来加强我们国家的武装。
    工人和农民用来保卫自己国家以防敌人进攻的堡垒，是牢不可破的。而每一个新的工厂，新的集体农庄，新的农业公社，都是这座堡垒底下坚固程度不同的一砖一石。只有把工业财富积累起来具有国家的规模，这才能充分满足个人的一切需要。只有工业以及与工业不可分的农业机械化，才能加强我们的力量，加强我们对敌人的自卫，这样我们就会强大到他们谁也不敢对我们的国家举起龌龊贪婪的手。
    必须透澈地懂得，我们正在对旧世界进行斗争，每一小时、每一天的劳动，都是我们在斗争中的一次胜利；我们用在国家经济事业上的每一个卢布，都是向胜利前进的一步。
    我们在建设新生活的工作中展开了社会主义竞赛，而敌人却在远东以强盗式的袭击来答复我们〔注〕。
    我们的回答是迅速认购工业化公债。这项公债说明了工人和农民在政治上的提高，至于它的重大经济意义，那就不用再说了。给强盗们的这个答复，是国家真正的主人翁们的漂亮和聪明的答复。它确凿而不可争辩地说明了乌拉季米尔·列宁精神不死，并且是无比的伟大，说明了工农群众越来越深刻地领会了这种精神。
