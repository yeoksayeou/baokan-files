    Cooperative Cafeterias That Do Not Serve the Laboring People
    Reader Zhu Bohua from Tangshan writes: At the end of last year, the Tangshan Cooperative Union opened two cooperative cafeterias in the urban area (called Cooperative First and Cooperative Second Cafeterias). When they first opened, they were very popular among the masses, and many people came to eat every day. However, not long after starting business, these two cafeterias raised food prices and eliminated popular, affordable foods. For example, stir-fried dishes used to be 4,500 yuan a plate, but now they have been raised to 6,500 yuan; dumplings have increased from 150 yuan each to 200 yuan; pancakes and steamed buns have been removed, and replaced with over a hundred kinds of expensive dishes and meals such as "Three Delicacies Rice" and "Duck Wing Feast." As a result, it now costs at least 8,000 to 10,000 yuan for a meal. The number of people coming has decreased day by day, and most of the customers are now shop owners wearing long gowns. The cafeterias' turnover has also decreased significantly. The Second Cafeteria used to have a daily turnover of 8 million yuan, but now it has decreased to 6 million yuan.
    The workers in Tangshan have many complaints about the cooperative cafeterias. I believe that the cooperative is an economic organization of the laboring people, and it should face the workers and peasants and serve the laboring people. The business policy of the Tangshan cooperative cafeterias does not conform to this principle. I hope that the superior cooperative will conduct a prompt investigation and make a satisfactory resolution.

### 不为劳动人民服务的合作食堂

专栏：读者来信摘要

    不为劳动人民服务的合作食堂
    唐山市读者诸伯华来信：唐山市合作社联合社去年年底在市区开办了两个合作食堂（称合作第一和合作第二食堂），开始营业时极受群众欢迎，每天来吃饭的人很多。但是营业不久，这两个食堂就提高了食品价格和取消了大众化的食品。例如，过去一般炒菜为四千五百元一盘，现在提高到六千五百元；水饺由每个一百五十元提高到两百元；大饼、馒头取消了，而添了三鲜饭、鸭翅席等名贵菜饭一百多种，这样，吃一顿饭至少要花八千元至一万元，来的人一天比一天少，而且大部分成为穿长袍的商店老板了。食堂营业额也显著降低，第二食堂过去每天营业额达八百万元，现在降低到六百万元。
    唐山市职工们对合作食堂意见纷纷。我认为，合作社是劳动人民自己的经济组织，它就应该面向工农，为劳动人民服务。唐山市合作食堂的营业方针是不符合这个原则的，希望上级合作社迅速进行调查，并作令人满意的处理。
