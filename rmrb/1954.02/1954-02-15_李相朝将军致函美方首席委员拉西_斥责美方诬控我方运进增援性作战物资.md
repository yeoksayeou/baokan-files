Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 13th: General Li Xiangchao, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, pointed out in a letter to U.S. Senior Member Lacey today that the U.S. accusation on February 9th that our side violated the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcement war materials is "another completely unfounded and utterly fabricated and slanderous accusation." General Li Xiangchao also pointed out: "Your side violates the Armistice Agreement itself, yet arbitrarily slanders our side and wants the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate our side, attempting to divert the attention of the people of the world, evade your side's responsibility for violating the Armistice Agreement, and create a tense situation."

General Li Xiangchao pointed out in the letter: "Our side has consistently strictly abided by and implemented the Armistice Agreement. This is publicly acknowledged by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, and is known to the world. Your side once falsely accused our side of transporting reinforcement warplanes into the Uiju Airport, but the investigation by the Neutral Nations Mobile Inspection Team proved that your accusation was completely unfounded and utterly fabricated."

General Li Xiangchao condemned the U.S. side for violating the Armistice Agreement by forcibly detaining more than 21,900 of our captured personnel and handing them over to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek as cannon fodder, and for transporting reinforcement war materials from outside Korea. General Li Xiangchao pointed out: In fact, it is the U.S. side that is violating the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcement military forces. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has clearly pointed out in its report on the supervision of rotation and replacement that the U.S. side illegally transported 106 4.2-inch caliber mortars and violated the one-to-one replacement rule in certain types of combat aircraft, importing more than it exported. The U.S. side has not yet accounted for this. At the same time, based solely on the incomplete report figures of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from the ceasefire to the end of 1953, the U.S. side transported more than 460,000 pounds of combat aircraft parts. However, the U.S. side openly violated the Armistice Agreement by refusing to submit reports to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. At the staff meeting on the issue of parts, the U.S. side claimed that combat aircraft and weapons, etc., could be freely transported into Korea if they were disassembled and packaged separately, without the need to submit reports and without being considered a violation of the Armistice Agreement. Now, the U.S. side is attempting to unilaterally interrupt the discussion on the issue of parts in order to simply evade the obligations stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

General Li Xiangchao emphasized: The U.S. accusations are completely unfounded and cannot stand at all. "Our side firmly cannot agree to investigate our side, which abides by the Armistice Agreement, based on your slanders, and to allow you to continue to undermine the Armistice Agreement under the cover of constant fabrications and slanders, and to not account for your actions in violating the Armistice Agreement."

General Li Xiangchao emphasized: "Now, the important issue for stabilizing the Korean armistice is that your side must first account for the more than 20,000 of our captured personnel who were forcibly detained by your side; must account for the large amount of reinforcement war materials that your side has violated the Armistice Agreement and transported into Korea, as pointed out by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; and must immediately stop violating the Armistice Agreement by transporting reinforcement war materials to equip the Syngman Rhee army."

General Li Xiangchao has also sent the same letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    李相朝将军致函美方首席委员拉西
    斥责美方诬控我方运进增援性作战物资
   【新华社开城十三日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在今天给美方首席委员拉西的信中指出：美方在二月九日诬控我方违反停战协定运进增援性作战物资，是“又一次毫无事实根据、彻头彻尾的捏造和诬蔑”。李相朝将军并指出：“你方自己违反停战协定，却恣意诬蔑我方，要中立国监察委员会向我方进行调查，企图以此转移世界人民视线，逃避你方违反停战协定的责任，并制造紧张局势。”
    李相朝将军在信中指出：“我方一贯严格遵守和执行停战协定，这是中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组所公开承认，也是举世周知的。你方曾经诬控我方在义州机场运入增援性作战飞机，但中立国机动视察小组调查的结果证明你方的指控毫无事实根据，是彻头彻尾的捏造。”
    李相朝将军在信中谴责美方违反停战协定强迫扣留二万一千九百多名我方被俘人员并把他们移交给李承晚和蒋介石充当炮灰，和自朝鲜境外运进增援性作战物资。李相朝将军指出：事实上，违反停战协定运进增援性军事力量的正是美方。中立国监察委员会在其监督轮换替换的报告中已明确指出：美方非法运进一百零六门四点二英寸口径的迫击炮；并在某些类型的作战飞机方面违反一对一替换的规定，运入超过运出。美方对此至今未作交代。同时，仅仅根据自停战以后到一九五三年底为止的中立国监察委员会的不完全的报告数字，美方就运进作战飞机的零件四十六万磅以上。但美方却公然违反停战协定，拒绝向军事停战委员会及中立国监察委员会提出报告。美方在关于零件问题的双方参谋会议上声称，作战飞机和武器等拆散分装，就可以自由地运入朝鲜，不必提出报告，也不算违反停战协定。现在美方又企图片面中断关于零件问题的讨论，以便干脆回避停战协定所规定的义务。
    李相朝将军着重声明：美方的指控毫无事实根据，根本不能成立。“我方坚决不能同意就你方的诬蔑来向遵守停战协定的我方调查，而容许你方在不断的捏造和诬蔑的掩盖之下继续破坏停战协定，并对你方破坏停战协定的行为不作交代。”
    李相朝将军强调指出：“现在，稳定朝鲜停战的重要问题是：你方必须首先交代二万余名被你方强迫扣留的我方被俘人员；必须交代已经由中立国监察委员会指出的你方违反停战协定、运入朝鲜的大量增援性作战物资；必须立即停止违反停战协定运进增援性作战物资以装备李承晚军队。”
    李相朝将军同时已把同样的函件送交中立国监察委员会。
