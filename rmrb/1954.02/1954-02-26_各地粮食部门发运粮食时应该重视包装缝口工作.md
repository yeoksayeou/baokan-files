    All Grain Departments Should Emphasize Packaging Seam Work When Shipping Grain
    (I)
    Letters from Yi Zifa and Li Yanyu of the Changbei Receiving Station of the Changsha Grain Company in Hunan Province: In our grain receiving work, we often find that the seams of the sacks used to package grain are not strong. After shaking during transportation, the stitches break, and the bags split open, causing losses to the grain during transportation and loading and unloading. For example, in December of last year, we received a large quantity of beans from Zhumadian, Henan Province, and other places. The seams of the bags were very carelessly sewn, with only five or six single stitches on each bag opening, and the tung hemp used for sewing was not tightened. As a result, when unloading the bags, beans were scattered everywhere in the carriages, on the platforms, and under the stacks. The amount swept up was more than 1,300 jin. Also, in January of this year, we received a batch of wheat from Wuchang, Hubei Province, shipped by the Hubei Provincial Grain Bureau. The sewing of the bags was equally careless, and many bag openings were broken. Moreover, because there was no cargo space on the platform, the wheat was unloaded on both sides of the open-air railway tracks, and many wheat grains fell into the gaps between the sleepers and the gravel. In order to prevent grain from suffering further losses during loading, unloading, and handling, we often send two or three workers to sew the bags. However, this does not solve the fundamental problem. We suggest that grain departments in various places carefully do the packaging work when shipping grain to ensure that the people's property is not lost.

    Letter from Zheng Yaogen of the Xiaoshan County Grain Bureau, Zhejiang Province: I am engaged in grain transfer and receiving work. Recently, we received seven trucks of soybeans totaling 217 tons from Linhuaiguan and nine trucks of soybeans totaling 326 tons from Tianjia'an. Among these two batches of grain, broken bags accounted for 50%, resulting in a lot of soybeans being scattered during handling. Although we tried our best to collect them, the loss was already significant. The reason for the broken bags is mainly that the sacks were filled too much, and the bag openings could not be sewn tightly. At the same time, the seams were not good enough, and they would break after a slight shaking. Similar situations have occurred frequently since last autumn and winter. In order to avoid losses to state property, we have made several suggestions to the grain sending units to improve packaging, but the situation has not improved. I hope that the relevant grain sending departments should pay attention to this issue and pay attention to improving grain packaging work. At the same time, I hope that the competent departments of the grain system can formulate unified standards and specifications for grain packaging.

### 各地粮食部门发运粮食时应该重视包装缝口工作

    各地粮食部门发运粮食时应该重视包装缝口工作
    （一）
    湖南省长沙市粮食公司长北接运站易子发、李炎煜来信：我们在接收粮食工作中，经常发现许多包装粮食的麻袋袋口缝得不牢，经过运输途中的震动后，缝线中断，包口开裂，使粮食在运输和装卸中受到损失。如去年十二月份，我们接收大批从河南驻马店等地运来的豆类，麻袋的包口都缝得非常草率，每个袋口只缝了五、六针单边，同时缝口的梧桐麻还没有绞紧。因此，在卸袋时，车厢内、月台上、码架下，到处都撒满了豆子，经扫起的就有一千三百多斤。又如今年一月份，我们接收湖北省粮食厅从武昌运来的一批小麦，同样是缝包草率，包口破裂的很多。又因为月台没有货位，这批小麦卸在露天的铁道两旁，很多麦粒都掉在枕木缝和砂石里。我们为了使粮食在装卸搬运过程中不再遭受损失，经常派两三个工人去做缝包的工作，但是，这并不能解决根本问题。建议各地粮食部门发运粮食时认真做好包装工作，以保证人民的财产不受损失。
    （二）
    浙江省萧山县粮食局郑耀根来信：我是搞粮食调运接收工作的。最近我们接收从临淮关运来黄豆七车计二百一十七吨，从田家庵运来黄豆九车计三百二十六吨。这两批粮食中，破包占百分之五十，以致在搬运中黄豆撒落很多；虽经我们努力收拣，但损失已经很大。造成破包的原因，主要是麻袋里装得太多，包口缝不拢；同时缝口不够好，稍经震动就会破裂。类似情况，从去年秋冬以来就经常发生。我们为了避免国家财产遭受损失，曾几次向发粮单位提出改进包装的意见，但情况未见好转。我希望有关发粮部门应该重视这一问题，注意改进粮食包装工作；同时希望粮食系统的主管部门能对粮食的包装制订出统一的标准和规格。
