    A Model Patrolman Who Lost His Hands
    Qiu Ming
    A disabled worker who lost both hands due to labor in the old society and wanted to commit suicide has now become a model worker. This person is Zhao Duanzhang, a patrolman at the Jinan Railway Materials General Factory.
    Zhao Duanzhang was born into a poor peasant family in Dong'e County, Shandong Province. He begged for food with his parents and herded cattle for landlords. At the age of sixteen, he worked as a handyman in the Fushun Coal Mine Power Plant, where he learned the trade of repairing electrical wires. Later, he became an electrician in the "Jinan Electrical Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway."
    In January 1948, when Jinan had not yet been liberated, on a windy and snowy day, Zhao Duanzhang was forced to repair a high-voltage line on a utility pole more than four zhang (about 13 meters) high. This was a very dangerous job, requiring rubber boots and gloves to protect labor safety. However, he had nothing. He could only use his hands, which were frozen like red shrimp, to grip the utility pole tightly. The foreman shouted loudly below, "Hey! The power is off now, hurry up!" Zhao Duanzhang quickly repaired the two high-voltage wires and was about to come down from the tall utility pole when the electricity came on and he was electrocuted and lost consciousness.
    Zhao Duanzhang's life was saved through the efforts of the workers. But from then on, he lost both hands, lost his job, and his family's life had to be maintained by his wife grinding flour for others. Seeing his pregnant wife being tortured until her face was black and blue, Zhao Duanzhang felt that he had increased his wife's burden, so he wanted to commit suicide. But then he thought, "My wife has suffered with me and has never resented me; if I die, how will she and our two children survive!" So, regardless of the pain in his wounds, he helped his wife grind flour for others with his arms. In the old society, it was very easy for poor people to commit suicide, but living was a difficult task. Zhao Duanzhang persevered and lived on.
    Jinan was liberated, the people saw the sun again, and everyone was overjoyed. Only Zhao Duanzhang was half happy and half worried. He thought, "My hands were destroyed by working for the reactionaries. Will the Communist Party take care of me now?" After a few days, he personally saw many unemployed workers return to work, and he felt that he also had a way to live. Zhao Duanzhang was not disappointed. He took a job as a purchasing agent in the Transportation Department of the Jinan Railway Administration. Zhao Duanzhang thought, "My heart is not disabled, I will use my brain to work!"
    Zhao Duanzhang worked very conscientiously and responsibly. When purchasing materials, he always encouraged himself: "If you compare three stores, you won't be fooled. Although I don't have hands, my feet can run more." Many profiteers had tried various methods to win him over to steal state property, but Zhao Duanzhang stood firm on the position of the working class and did not allow state property to suffer any loss. Every time the superiors sent him to purchase materials, they always asked him to hire rickshaws to carry them, but in order to save transportation costs, he asked people to put the purchased materials in his bags and carry them back, or hung the materials on his arms.
    The wounds on Zhao Duanzhang's arms had not been completely healed, and he could not do strenuous work, but he did not let the superiors know, and he used his shoulders and arms to work, which caused his wounds to ache severely. After the superiors found out, they asked him to go to the railway hospital for treatment. After his wounds were completely healed, he was transferred to the Materials General Factory as a patrolman.
    In his guard work, Zhao Duanzhang always paid attention to fire prevention, anti-espionage, and anti-theft, protecting the property of the people's railway. For more than four years, no accidents had occurred. The comrades in the guard room all loved and respected him. But when he thought of the many outstanding workers creating more wealth for the country, he couldn't help but feel sad for losing his hands.
    Jin Xiu, the squad leader of the guard room and a Communist Party member, understood Zhao Duanzhang's feelings very well. He always warmly comforted and encouraged him, and often told him the stories of the famous Soviet novels "A Real Man" and "How the Steel Was Tempered" in detail.
    The increase production and practice economy campaign was launched. Employees tried to find tricks, and new achievements constantly appeared in production. One night, Zhao Duanzhang was patrolling the factory and saw workers loading and unloading materials, with dozens of electric lights brightly illuminating the area. He thought, "It would be great to have a large floodlight to illuminate the loading and unloading area, with concentrated light and saving electricity!" The next day, he found an old floodlight in the waste warehouse and put forward a rationalization proposal to the leadership. As a result, a floodlight was installed according to his method, saving more than one million yuan in electricity costs every month.
    From then on, even the patrolmen in the guard room, who were generally considered unable to increase production or practice economy, also launched a heat wave of labor competition to increase production and practice economy. Whenever they had free time, some would dig up scrap iron buried underground, and some would use waste materials to repair tools. In just one month, in addition to doing their own guard work, the patrolmen in the guard room collected five and a half tons of scrap iron for the country, made three pairs of pry bars from waste materials, and repaired fire-fighting equipment and many tools, saving a total of more than 23 million yuan. They won the rotating red flag for outstanding labor competition in the factory.
    In early November 1953, the employees launched the study of the general line, and Zhao Duanzhang's work enthusiasm was even higher. One day, Zhao Duanzhang saw stevedores unloading large logs from a train car, using steel cables to tie the ends of the large logs. Some were on the car using poles to pry, and some were pulling the ropes below. It took seventeen or eight people a long time to unload a large log weighing more than two tons. He was attracted by this. He thought:
  "There are tens of thousands of large logs in the factory. How long will it take to load and unload them to reach socialism using this 'slow ox' method! If we could use a machine to load and unload logs, how fast and labor-saving it would be!" So he said to the technician Ma Chengshun, "I want to make a machine to pull logs based on the principle of the 'windlass' used to draw well water in vegetable gardens, so that we can solve the difficulty of loading and unloading logs and improve the efficiency of loading and unloading work." As Zhao Duanzhang spoke, he squatted on the ground and used his arm without hands to draw a diagram on a flat piece of sand.
    Zhao Duanzhang's initiative received the support and help of the leadership and the masses of employees. Seven days later, the log loading and unloading machine designed by Zhao Duanzhang was manufactured successfully with a cost of only more than 1.2 million yuan. After testing the loading and unloading of logs, it not only saved labor and shortened working hours, but also strengthened the labor safety of the loading and unloading workers.
    This happy event spread throughout the factory like it had wings. But Zhao Duanzhang was still not satisfied. He still thought, "I am still far behind the Soviet heroes Meresjev and Pavel Korchagin. I want to use my blood and sweat to create more wealth for the motherland, so that the people know that I, a disabled person who has lost both hands, am working happily for socialism under the leadership of Chairman Mao."

    一个失去了双手的模范巡守员
    秋明
    一个在旧社会里因劳动失去了双手而想要自杀的残废工人，现在变成了一个模范工作者，这个人就是济南铁路材料总厂巡守员赵段章。
    赵段章生长在山东东阿县一个贫农的家里，跟着父母讨过饭，给地主放过牛。他十六岁时，在抚顺煤矿发电厂当小工，学会了修理电线的手艺。后来在“津浦铁路济南电气段”当了电气工。
    一九四八年一月，在济南还未解放的时候，在一个大风大雪的日子里，赵段章被迫在一根四丈多高的电杆上修理高压线。这是一件很危险的工作，需要穿胶皮靴、戴胶皮手套，才能保护劳动的安全。但是，他却什么都没有。他只有用他那冻得像红虾一样的两手，使劲地攀住电杆。监工在下面大声的喊道：“喂！现在停电了，你快点干！”赵段章迅速地把两股高压线修理好，正要从高高的电杆上下来，电流来了，他触电昏过去了。
    赵段章的生命经过工人们的努力抢救过来了。但从此失去了双手，失去了工作，家里的生活只好靠他妻子给人家推磨来维持。赵段章见怀孕的妻子被折磨得头青脸肿，感到自己增加了妻子的负担，因此便想自杀。但他又一想：“我的妻子和我同受苦难，从没怨恨过我；要是我死了，她和两个孩子怎么活下去啊！”于是他不顾伤口的疼痛，用胳臂帮着妻子去给人家推磨。在旧社会里的穷人，自杀是非常容易的，活着却是一件难事。赵段章却坚持着生活下来了。
    济南解放了，人民重见了太阳，个个欢天喜地，只有赵段章却半喜半忧。他想：“我的一双手给反动派干活干掉了，现在共产党会养着我吗？”过了几天，他亲眼见到很多失业的工人复了工，觉得自己也有了活路。赵段章果然没有失望，他在济南铁路管理局运务处担任了采购员的工作。赵段章想：“我的心并没有残废，我要用我的脑子来工作！”
    赵段章工作非常认真负责。购买材料的时候，他总是勉励着自己：“货买三家不上当，我虽没有手，但我的脚还可以多跑路。”不少奸商曾想出各种办法来拉拢他盗窃国家资财，赵段章却站稳了工人阶级的立场，没有使国家财产受到任何损失。每次上级派他去采购材料的时候，总叫他雇人力车搬运，但是，他为了节省运费，就把买到的材料叫人放在他的袋子里背回来，或者用自己的胳臂把材料挂回来。
    赵段章胳臂上的伤口本来没有彻底养好，不能干出力的活，但他不让上级知道，就用肩膀和胳臂去劳动，因此，使伤口剧烈的疼痛起来。上级发现后，就要他到铁路医院去治疗。等他完全治好了伤口以后，又调他到材料总厂当巡守员。
    赵段章在守卫工作中，时时刻刻地注意防火、防特务、防盗，保护着人民铁路的财产，四年多来没有发生过任何事故。守卫室的同志们都爱戴他。但当他想到很多优秀的工人为国家创造更多财富的时候，不禁又为自己失去了双手而难过。
    守卫室班长、共产党员金修同志，是很了解赵段章的心情的。总是热情地安慰和鼓励他，并且经常把苏联著名的小说“真正的人”和“钢铁是怎样炼成的”的故事，仔细地讲给他听。
    增产节约竞赛开展起来了。职工们想办法找窍门，生产上不断出现新的成绩。一天晚上，赵段章在厂里巡查，看见工人们正在装卸材料，几十盏电灯亮通通地照着。他想：“做一个大的照明灯照着装卸车，灯光又集中、又节省电力，该多好！”第二天，他到废料仓库找了个旧照明灯，向领导提出了合理化建议。结果按照他的办法，安装了照明灯，每月可节省电费一百多万元。
    从这以后，一般认为不能增产节约的守卫室的巡守员们，也掀起了增产节约劳动竞赛的热潮。他们一有空闲，有的就去挖掘着埋藏在地下的废铁，有的利用废料修理工具。仅一个月，守卫室的巡守员们，除了做好本身守卫工作以外，给国家收集了五吨半废铁，利用废料做好三付撬板，还修理了防火设备和很多工具，总共节约两千三百多万元。获得了厂里劳动竞赛的优胜循环红旗。
    一九五三年十一月初，职工们展开了总路线的学习，赵段章的工作热情更高了。有一天，赵段章看见装卸工人卸着车上的大圆木，用钢丝绳系在大圆木的两头，有的在车上用棍撬，有的在下面拉着绳子。十七、八个人费了很长的时间，才把一根两吨多重的大圆木卸下来。他被这事吸引住了。心想：
  “厂里的大圆木成千上万根，用这样‘慢牵牛’的办法来装卸，多咱才能装卸到社会主义啊！要是能用一个装卸圆木的机器，多快，多省劲！”于是他就对技术工人马诚顺说：“我想根据菜园打井水用的‘辘轳’的道理，作一个拉圆木的机器，这样就可以解决装卸圆木的困难，提高装卸工作效率。”赵段章一面说着，一面蹲在地下，用那没有手的胳臂，在一块平面的沙土上画着图样。
    赵段章的创议得到了领导上和职工群众的支持和帮助。七天后，赵段章所设计的圆木装卸机，只用了一百二十多万元的成本，就制造成功了。经过装卸圆木的试验，不但节省了人力，缩短了工时，并且加强了装卸工的劳动安全。
    这件喜事就像长了翅膀一样，立刻传遍了全厂。但是赵段章仍不满足，他还是这样想：“我比起苏联的英雄密列西耶夫和保尔来还差得远，我要用我的心血为祖国创造更多的财富，让人民知道我这个失去了双手的残废人，在毛主席的领导下，正为社会主义而愉快地劳动着。”
