Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: State-owned and local state-owned factories in Tianjin are actively arranging and carrying out work before and after the Spring Festival, in order to ensure that workers have a good Spring Festival holiday and strive to complete the production plan for February on schedule.

Many factories have deeply promoted the general line among workers, making them realize the importance of balanced completion of national plans. The workers have all made guarantees that production will not slacken before and after the Spring Festival. Workers in various workshops of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory guaranteed that attendance would be over 98 percent before and after the Spring Festival. The Tianjin No. 1 Iron Wire Factory lost 222 working days due to absenteeism during the Spring Festival last year, which was equivalent to creating over 1.16 billion yuan less wealth for the country. This concrete example gave the workers a great education. After discussion, workers in various workshops and groups successively proposed guarantees of normal attendance. Workers who needed to go home for the Spring Festival also expressed their intention to return to the factory immediately after the holiday. At the same time, the factories seized the production preparation work for February. The operation plans for February in many factories have been roughly arranged and are being discussed by the workers. The Tianjin Paper Mill, the No. 9 Rubber Factory, and others have already made plans to overhaul machinery during the Spring Festival. The Tianjin Electric Power Bureau's power plants will also use the Spring Festival period for cleaning work to ensure safe power supply after the Spring Festival.

In order to make the workers feel happy and have a good rest during the Spring Festival, many factories are paying attention to doing a good job in serving them during the Spring Festival holiday. The Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, the Tianjin No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory, and others have all made plans to provide good Spring Festival meals and carry out educational and meaningful recreational activities. The China Oil Chemical Factory, the Woolen Mill, and other factories close to the suburbs are preparing to invite farmers to a Spring Festival get-together. Workers returning to their hometowns during the Spring Festival holiday have also made hometown covenants, to promote the worker-peasant alliance and ensure they return to the factory on time.

    天津各国营工厂积极安排春节前后工作
    保证职工过好春节并争取完成生产计划
    据新华社天津讯：天津市国营和地方国营工厂正在积极安排和进行春节前后的工作，以便使职工们过好春节假期，并争取二月份的生产计划能够按期完成。
    许多工厂在职工中间深入展开了总路线的宣传，使职工们认识到均衡完成国家计划的重要。职工们都提出春节前后生产不松劲的保证。天津自行车厂各车间的职工保证春节前后有百分之九十八以上出勤。天津第一铁丝厂去年春节前后因缺勤损失了二百二十二个工作日，等于少给国家创造十一亿六千多万元的财富。这个具体事例给职工以很大教育，各车间、小组工人们经讨论后，纷纷提出正常出勤的保证，需要回家过春节的职工也表示在休假期满后立即回厂。与此同时，各工厂抓紧了二月份的生产准备工作，许多工厂二月份的作业计划已大致排定，正发动职工讨论。天津造纸厂、第九橡胶厂等已做好春节期间检修机器的计划。天津电业局各发电厂也将利用春节时间进行清洁工作，保证春节后安全供电。
    为了使职工们过春节时精神愉快，很好地休息，许多工厂都注意做好春节假期的服务工作。天津第四棉纺织厂、天津第一印染厂等都订出办好春节伙食，开展富有教育意义的文娱活动的计划。中国油脂化学厂、毛织厂等接近郊区的工厂，准备在春节期间邀请农民联欢。在春节假期中回乡的工人也订了回乡公约，要做好工农联盟的宣传，并保证按期回厂。
