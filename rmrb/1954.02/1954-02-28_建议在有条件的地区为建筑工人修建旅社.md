    Suggest building hostels for construction workers in areas with suitable conditions
    Reader Qian Zhi's letter: Currently, most construction workers live in temporary sheds at construction sites during the construction season. In winter, many have to return home because there are no suitable accommodations, and they cannot participate in winter training and study. In addition, some construction companies have built special dormitories for construction workers to solve the winter accommodation problem; however, these houses are too far from the construction site and are idle for seven or eight months during the construction season, while another set of temporary sheds has to be set up at the construction site.
    This waste is difficult to completely avoid at present; but it can be partially avoided. One way is to build hostels for construction workers where appropriate conditions exist. For example, in some large cities and industrial and mining areas, some areas will have a large number of construction projects in the next few years. If some construction worker hostels are built in or near these areas, then temporary sheds can be eliminated for local construction projects. When all the construction projects in these areas are completed, these houses can be turned into residential housing or general apartments; the changes for future use must be considered during construction. Therefore, the construction and management of these construction worker hostels should not be handled by construction companies, but should be thoroughly studied by the local municipal or property management agencies.
    Editor's Note: Reader Qian Zhi's suggestion is very good. According to our understanding, many fraternal countries in Eastern Europe have used this method and have been able to avoid some of the losses caused by worker accommodation problems in engineering construction. Building "hostels" for construction workers in suitable places can not only meet the current construction needs, but also be used for other purposes in the future. This is a win-win situation. It is hoped that the central ministries with many basic construction tasks and the municipal authorities in areas with concentrated projects can jointly study Comrade Qian Zhi's suggestion and consider implementing it on a trial basis where possible.

### 建议在有条件的地区为建筑工人修建旅社

专栏：读者来信摘要

    建议在有条件的地区为建筑工人修建旅社
    读者千之来信：目前多数建筑工人在施工季节住在工地的临时工棚里；到了冬季，因为没有适当的住宿场所，许多人就得分散回家，不能参加冬季的训练和学习。另外有一些建筑企业为了解决建筑工人冬季的住宿问题，专门建造了建筑工人宿舍；可是这些房屋距离工地过远，到了施工季节就要闲七、八个月，而在工地又要另设一套临时工棚。
    这种浪费，目前我们难于完全避免；但部分地避免还是可以作到的。办法之一，就是在具备适当条件的情形下为建筑工人建造旅社。例如在某些大城市和工矿区内，有些区域在今后若干年内都有大量的建筑工程，如在这些区域或其附近建造一些建筑工人旅社，则当地的建筑工程就可不再设置临时工棚。当这些区域的全部建筑工程完竣，这些房屋即可变为居民住宅或一般公寓；在建造时就必须顾到以后用途的变更。因此，这些建筑工人旅社的建筑和管理，就不宜由建筑企业来办，而应由当地的市政或房产管理机构来作周密的通盘的研究。
    编者按：读者千之的建议是很好的。据我们了解，东欧很多兄弟国家曾经采用过这种办法，确能避免一部分工程建设中因工人住宿问题所造成的损失。在有条件的地方为建筑工人建造“旅社”，既能适应当前建设的需要，以后也可供作其他用途，这是一举两得的事。希望中央各部基本建设任务众多的单位与工程集中地区的市政机关能共同研究千之同志的建议，并考虑在可能的条件下试行。
