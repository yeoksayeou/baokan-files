    Xu Changhua Mutual Aid Team Writes to Workers of North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory
    Hoping for More and Better New-Style Farm Tools
    Worker comrades of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory:

    We sincerely thank you for your help. In 1950, the new-style walking plow you manufactured was promoted in our Guanyun County. Our mutual aid team bought two and used them, and they have many advantages. The new-style walking plow can plow six inches deep, twice as deep as the old-style plow; after light rain, the old-style plow cannot plow, but the new-style walking plow can; because it plows deeply and thoroughly, without leaving stalks, it can retain moisture; moreover, using the new-style walking plow is not strenuous, and four women in our team can use it to plow the land.

    Since using the new-style walking plow, our team's output has been increasing year by year. Before using the new-style walking plow and before organizing the mutual aid team, even in years of favorable weather, each mu of corn could only yield 270 jin; after organizing the mutual aid team and using the new-style walking plow, the yield was much higher than before. Last year, although the corn suffered from wind and flood disasters, each mu still yielded 500 jin. Due to the increase in output, the lives of the team members have also generally improved. Of the nine households in the team, four have enough to eat, and five have a surplus.

    We deeply appreciate the benefits that industry gives us. After studying the General Line, we sold 5,200 jin of surplus grain to the state to support national construction. In addition, we want to run the mutual aid team even better and prepare to transition to an agricultural production cooperative. Our entire team plans to accumulate 1,400 loads of fertilizer, ensuring a 30% increase in production this year. At the same time, we will also tell others about the benefits of the new-style walking plow and help you promote it.

    Worker comrades: The new-style walking plow you manufactured has already helped us increase production. We hope you will continue your efforts to manufacture more and better farm tools for us, to help us continue to increase output. Let our worker and peasant brothers fight together on different fronts for the construction of a socialist society!

    徐长华互助组写信给华北农业机械总厂工人
    希望制造更多更好的新式农具华北农业机械总厂工人老大哥：
    我们衷心感谢你们对我们的帮助。一九五○年，你们制造的新式步犁推广到我们灌云县。我们互助组买了两张使用，它的好处很多。新式步犁能耕六寸深，比旧式犁深得一倍；小雨后，旧式犁没法耕，新式步犁却能耕；因为它耕得深透，没有梗子，所以能保潮；而且，使用新式步犁不费劲，我们组里就有四个妇女能用新式步犁耕地。
    自从使用新式步犁以来，我们组的产量在逐年增加。未用新式步犁和未组织互助组前，即使是风调雨顺的年头，每亩玉米只能收二百七十斤；组织起互助组和用上新式步犁后，比以前就收得多的多了，去年玉米虽然遭受了风灾、水灾，每亩还收了五百斤。由于产量的增加，组员们的生活也普遍改善了。全组九户，有四户够吃，五户有剩余。
    我们深深地体会到工业给予我们的好处。学习总路线后，我们把五千二百斤余粮卖给了国家，来支援国家建设。此外，我们要把互助组搞得更好，准备转向农业生产合作社。我们全组计划积肥一千四百挑，保证今年增产三成。同时，我们还要把新式步犁的好处讲给别人听，帮助你们推广。
    工人老大哥：你们造的新式步犁，已帮助我们提高了生产。我们希望你们继续努力，制造出更多更好的农具供给我们，帮助我们继续提高产量。让我们工、农兄弟在不同的岗位上，共同为建设社会主义社会而奋斗！
