    Mangshi Looks Even More Beautiful

    Traveling west along the Yunnan-Burma Highway, crossing the turbulent Lancang (Mekong) and Nu (Salween) Rivers, the highway extends directly from the Gaoligong Mountains to a vast and fertile plain, which is the seat of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region People's Government on the southwestern border of the motherland—Mangshi.

    This place has a tropical landscape, and the air is filled with the aroma of pineapples and mangoes. At a glance, it is full of tempting green bamboo, banana trees, and banyan trees. The unique Dai villages are half-hidden in the green bamboo, and the exquisite Burmese pagodas stand tall. The plains are covered with fertile rice fields, and the sound of gurgling water is everywhere. “Mangshi rice, Zhezhang rice,” this is absolutely true.

    Cars come and go in the bamboo shade, passing through Mangshi to Zhezhang and the end of the highway—Wanting. From Wanting to the west, you can directly reach Ruili, Longchuan, Yingjiang, Lianshan, Lianghe, Zhanxi and other places close to Burma.

    In order to enable the people of all ethnic groups to live a good life, the People's Government has successively issued tens of billions of yuan in production loans here, and built nearly fifty small-scale water conservancy projects. The construction of the embankment on the Dayingjiang River has exempted more than 10,000 mu of land from flooding and irrigated more than 10,000 mu of land. In Yingjiang, Longchuan, Ruili, and Zhezhang, the People's Government organized nearly 500 Jingpo families who lacked land to reclaim wasteland, and issued large amounts of agricultural loans to help them develop production and initially improve their lives.

    Here, all counties have health clinics. The Yunnan Provincial Nationalities Work Team's Health Team has successively come here to provide free medical treatment for people of all ethnic groups. In Mangshi, the seat of the Autonomous Region People's Government, a large-scale national hospital has been newly built. Before liberation, there was no school here. Now there are two provincial middle schools and eleven provincial primary schools. The number of students has reached more than 2,000, of whom 30% to 40% have received people's grants.

    The autonomous region is a rich granary and a producer of industrial raw materials. Last year, the Yunnan Provincial Nationalities Work Team helped people grow cotton in Xuan'gang District of Mangshi, and achieved a bumper harvest, breaking the saying that "cotton cannot be grown here." A large amount of cotton will be planted here this year.

    The ethnic divisions inherited from history have been basically eliminated. People of all ethnic groups have signed patriotic pacts, stating that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, they will implement unity and mutual assistance, consolidate national defense, and build the border areas.
                                      (Li Qiao)

    "We are One Family!"

    Ti'e County, Guangxi Province, is a multi-ethnic area. Cen Zhihua, a Miao from Yalin Township, participated in a Zhuang-Han mutual aid team. He said with a smile:

  “Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are one family!” Among the 221 county and district cadres, there are 111 cadres from Zhuang, Miao, Yao, and Yi ethnic groups; ethnic minority cadres account for 90% of township cadres.

    Last year, the People's Government gave a large number of loans and relief funds to farmers of all ethnic groups, basically solving the difficulties farmers faced in production. There are now 1,188 mutual aid teams in the county, with a general increase in production of 5%. The Huang Jinhua mutual aid team in Yanli Township, District 4, had an annual output of 180 dan, but last year, due to fertilization, the output increased to 230 dan, an increase of 7%. The famous local specialty—Ai powder—also had a bumper harvest last year. Many farmers used the money they earned from selling Ai powder to buy large quantities of new farm tools to expand production.

    The first middle school has been established in Ti'e County. Rural night schools and private primary schools also developed last year. Primary schools were established for the first time in Gandong Township in the Yao area, Zhongbao Township in the Miao area, and Haizhou Township in the Yi area. The head of Haizhou Township said, “With schools, we will make progress day by day.” (Li Wenda)

    The People of Dizhen are Smiling

    Dizhen is a small village in Liping County, Guizhou Province, located at the foot of the Miaoling Mountains. It is surrounded by lush pine forests, and a clear stream flows south around the village.

    Thirty-six Miao families live here. In the past, they used the crudest farm tools to plow and tread the land before planting crops, so the yield was not high. Last spring, the People's Government distributed a large number of farm tools here. Twelve Miao families in the village received plows, plowshares, sickles, and hoes. The Miao compatriot Yang Xingquan shed tears of gratitude after receiving the farm tools. He asked someone to write the words "Chairman Mao Loves the Miao People" on the handle of his plow. The People's Bank also issued loans for farm tools and draft animals in the village, allowing Miao compatriots to add cattle, plows, plowshares, hoes, sickles, and so on. Village cadres patiently taught farmers new farming methods.

    After the improvement of production tools, the Miao compatriots' enthusiasm for production and farming techniques improved. For example, Lin Shuncheng used to only plow and tread the land once when planting crops, but now he has learned to plow the land with cattle, doing three plows and three harrows. In the past, he used human labor to pull the plow, and could cultivate a maximum of two shi of land per day; now he uses cattle and iron plows, and can plow six shi of land per day, plowing deeper and faster. He also added seven dan of cattle manure and rice seedlings to each tiao of field. As a result, last year's rice yield increased by 24% compared to the past.

    Fir is a local specialty here. In the past, the selling price of each fir tree was very low. Now, state-owned logging stations purchase them in large quantities at reasonable prices. Last year, Miao compatriots used more than 14 million yuan from the sale of fir trees to purchase cattle and other daily necessities.

    The lives of Miao compatriots have also improved. In the past, many Miao compatriots lived a life of "plain water and dry pot vegetables" all year round, and many children developed "goiters" (thyroid enlargement) from birth. Now, Miao compatriots can eat an average of half a jin of salt per month per person. For example, the Miao compatriot Yang Yi'an used to have nothing to eat or wear, but now his children have changed into blue cloth clothes. Twenty-four wooden houses have been built in the village, and many Miao compatriots have moved into new houses. (Tao Sheng, Bi Bo)

    "Protecting the Forest is Protecting My Home!"

    In the northeastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there live more than 850 hardworking and simple Oroqen people.

    On October 1, 1951, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner was established. They participated in political activities for the first time and became masters of their own affairs. On the leadership side of the banner, while starting the work of political construction, they also launched a patriotic movement for fire prevention and forest protection. After the masses' awareness of fire prevention and forest protection was raised, a fire prevention committee was established, and three fire brigades were established in Gan'kui, Tuozhamin, Nuomin and other Sumus (districts) within the territory, and seven fire squadrons were established in each Gaolu (village), with seventeen squads under them. In addition, a transportation and supply team and three supply stations were established to specifically supply all fire prevention materials. Sixteen forest protection stations and 173 forest rangers were set up at various traffic arteries, and a zoning responsibility system was established according to each administrative region. Close ties were also established with neighboring Molidawa Banner, Buteha Banner, Erguna Banner, and Nenjiang and Huma counties in Heilongjiang Province. Every year when the fire prevention period begins, the Oroqen people mobilize and the forest rangers work in units of squads, dividing areas and sections. Women from all tribes are organized to elect leaders to take turns on duty. During this period, people are prohibited from smoking in the wild; when hunters go out, they must notify the location in advance so that they can maintain regular contact with the fire prevention team and station.

    During the fire prevention period, hunters patrol the mountains while hunting; women stand guard while engaging in sideline production. With the development of fire prevention and forest protection work, their production has also improved. At the first People's Congress of Tuozhamin Sumu, an old man said: "Today, we have good guns, good horses, and enough bullets, so we can hunt more things; and the price of one roe deer skin is equivalent to five skins in the past."

    Now, the Oroqen people have regarded protecting the forests of the motherland as their sacred duty. People everywhere are singing like this: "The forest is our home, protecting the forest is protecting my home."
                                  (Wang Jixian)

    A Happy Life Has Begun

    Shuikou Township in Liping County, Guizhou Province, is covered with dense fir forests. More than 40,000 brave and simple Dong people live in the high mountains, forests, and canyons.

    Before liberation, the life of the Dong compatriots was: "Officials eat the Dong, the Dong eat mud." Moss was their vegetable; salt was their treasure. After liberation, a new flame of life was ignited on the plateau, and a happy life began. Last spring, the People's Government transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into the mountain villages, using "typical demonstrations" and comparison methods to educate the Dong people, so that they would understand the benefits of new farming methods. After in-depth education, more than 50% of Dong farmers were happy to plow the land with cattle. For example, among the more than 400 farmers in Ten Village, Shuikou Township, only 14 used cattle to plow the land in the past. Last year, 201 households had completely switched to using cattle.

    The People's Government also distributed various farm tools to Dong farmers free of charge. In Huamin and Diping alone, 1,130 plows, 580 harrows, 560 hoes, and 600 sickles were distributed. In addition, a large number of water conservancy loans were issued to help Dong farmers build thousands of small-scale water conservancy projects, turning dry fields into paddy fields.
                              (De Zhong, Tao Sheng)

    Spring in Gaobaibang

    Gaobaibang is a mountain village in the Buyi and Miao Autonomous Region of Huishui County, Guizhou Province, about 2,000 meters above sea level. For three seasons of the year, it is shrouded in thick fog and drizzle.

    When spring comes and the accumulated ice in the fields has not yet melted, the Miao people of Baibang begin spring plowing. People know clearly that it is relatively difficult to increase production when using fairly primitive wooden plows and wooden harrows. Take the poor peasant Fang Luka as an example. Although he used draft cattle last year, changing the past farming methods of "human plowing" and "hoeing fields", and labor efficiency doubled, wooden plows and wooden harrows could not plow deeply or harrow much, nor could they be used for intensive cultivation. In order to support the development of production by minority nationalities, the People's Government has distributed a large number of iron farm tools here. On the night of the distribution of farm tools, many people were so excited that they could not sleep; the next day, all villages and groups automatically carried out deliberation and discussion, and universally formulated patriotic production increase plans. More than a dozen Miao farmers in Shiban Village also automatically organized two temporary mutual aid teams.

    After the distribution of new farm tools, the Miao families no longer used wooden plows and wooden harrows to cultivate the land. In the entire Baibang, there are 3,154 large iron farm tools in five categories, including plows, harrows, and hoes; 80% of Miao families have sets of farm tools such as plowshares and sickles.

    The initial improvement of production tools has also brought happiness to Miao women. Traditionally, Miao women's labor has been more arduous than men's. "Bending over to weed rice seedlings" has caused their bodies to develop abnormally. Many women become hunchbacks after the age of fifty. Now, they can use new farm tools and stand up to weed rice seedlings.

    Production reform will bring a bumper harvest to the Miao families in the mountain villages, and the bumper harvest will bring them a happy life. People firmly believe that under the shining of Chairman Mao's warm sunshine, production will get better year by year, and life will get stronger day by day. (Ye Shaobin)

    帮助各兄弟民族建设繁荣幸福的家乡
    芒市显得更美丽了
    沿着滇缅公路向西，跨过波涛汹涌的澜沧江和怒江，公路由高黎贡山山脉直伸到一片辽阔肥沃的原野，那便是祖国西南边疆上的德宏傣族、景颇族自治区人民政府的所在地——芒市。
    这里具有着热带风光，空气里夹杂着菠箩、芒果的香味。一眼望去，四处是诱人的翠竹、芭蕉和榕树。别有风味的傣族村庄，半掩在翠竹里，那玲珑俊秀的缅塔矗立着。原野上布满了肥沃的稻田，四处是潺潺的流水声。“芒市谷子，遮放米”，这是千真万确的。
    汽车出没于竹荫中，穿过芒市便到了遮放和公路的终点——畹町。由畹町向西，可直达接近缅甸的瑞丽、陇川、盈江、莲山、梁河、盏西等地。
    为了使各族人民能过好日子，人民政府在这里先后发放了几十亿元的生产贷款，兴修了近五十处小型水利。大盈江河堤的兴修，使一万多亩的土地免除了水灾，并使一万多亩的土地得到了灌溉。在盈江、陇川、瑞丽、遮放，人民政府又组织近五百户缺田的景颇族人民开荒，并发放大批农贷，帮助他们发展生产，初步改善生活。
    这里，各县都有了卫生所。云南省民族工作队卫生队曾先后到这里为各族人民免费治病。在自治区人民政府的所在地——芒市，新建了一所规模宏大的民族医院。在解放前，这里没有一所学校，现在已有省立中学二所、省立小学十一所。学生已达二千余人，其中百分之三十至四十得到了人民助学金。
    自治区是丰饶的谷仓，同时也是工业原料的出产地。去年云南省民族工作队在芒市轩岗区帮助人民种棉花，得到了丰收，打破了“此地不能种棉”的说法。今年这里将大量植棉。
    历史上沿袭下来的民族隔阂基本上已消除。各族人民订立了爱国公约，表示要在共产党和毛主席的领导下，实行团结互助，巩固国防，建设边疆。
                                      （李乔）
    “我们是一家人了！”
    广西省天峨县是一个多民族的地区。牙林乡苗族岑志华参加了僮汉族的互助组，他笑盈盈地说：
  “在毛主席领导下，我们是一家人了！”在二百二十一个县区干部中，有僮、苗、瑶、彝等民族干部一百一十一人；乡干部中兄弟民族干部占了百分之九十。
    去年，人民政府给了各族农民大批的贷款、救济金，基本上解决了农民在生产上的困难问题。全县现已有一千一百八十八个互助组，普遍增产百分之五。四区岩里乡黄锦华互助组全组常年产量是一百八十挑，去年因加工施肥，产量提高到二百三十挑，增产百分之七。此地有名的土产——艾粉，去年也获得丰收。许多农民用出卖艾粉所得到的钱，购买了大批新农具，以扩大生产。
    第一所中学已在天峨县成立。乡村夜校和民办小学去年也有了发展。瑶族地区的甘洞乡、苗族地区的中堡乡、彝族地区的海洲乡，都第一次建立了小学校。海洲乡乡长说：“有了学校，我们就会一天天的进步了。”（李文达）
    地珍的人民欢笑了
    地珍是贵州省黎平县的一个小村寨，它在苗岭支脉的山麓。四围都是青葱茂密的松林，一道清澈的小河，绕过村子向南流去。
    这里居住着三十六户苗族人民。过去，他们用最粗笨的农具犁一道、踩一回，便种上了庄稼，因此产量不高。去年春天，人民政府在这里发放了大批的农具，村内有十二户苗胞领到了犁、铧、镰刀、锄头。苗族同胞杨兴全领到农具后，流出了感激的热泪，他请人在他的犁柄上写上“毛主席爱苗家”几个字。人民银行也在村里发放了农具和耕畜贷款，让苗族同胞添置了耕牛、犁、铧、锄头、镰刀等等。村干部并耐心地教农民学习新耕作法。
    生产工具改进后，苗族同胞的生产积极性和耕作技术都提高了。例如，林顺成往年种庄稼时只做到一犁一踩，现在他学会了用牛犁田，作到三犁三耙。过去他用人拉犁，每天最多能耕二石田面；现在用了牛和铁犁，每天就可犁六石田面；耕的又深、又快。每挑田并上了七担牛粪和秧草。因此，去年稻谷的产量比过去增加了百分之二十四。
    杉木是这里的特产。过去，每根杉木的售价很低，现在，国营伐木站以合理的价格大量收购。去年，苗族同胞们用一千四百多万元的杉木售款，添置了耕牛以及其他日用品。
    苗族同胞的生活也有了提高。过去，很多苗族同胞终年过的是“白水干锅菜”的生活，很多小孩一出生便长上“疱颈”（甲状腺肿大）。现在，苗族同胞每人每月平均能吃上半斤盐。例如，苗族同胞杨义安过去吃不上、穿不上，现在，他的孩子换上了蓝细布衣。全村建筑了木房二十四幢，很多的苗族同胞已搬进了新房子。（涛声、碧波）
    “保护好森林，就是保护了我的家！”
    在内蒙古自治区境内的东北部，聚居着八百五十多名勤劳纯朴的鄂伦春族人民。
    一九五一年十月一日，鄂伦春族自治旗成立了。他们第一次参加了政治活动，当家作了主人。旗领导方面，一面着手政权建设工作，一面开展防火护林的爱国运动。在群众对防火护林的认识提高后，又建立了防火委员会，并在境内的甘奎、托扎明、诺敏等苏木（区）设立了三个防火大队，各高鲁（村）设立了七个防火中队，下设十七个小队。此外，还建立了一个运输供给队和三个供应站，专门供应一切防火物资。在各交通要道，分设了护林站十六处和一百七十三名护林员，并根据各行政区建立了分区负责制。又和邻近的莫力达瓦旗、布特哈旗、额尔古纳旗以及黑龙江省的嫩江、呼玛等县建立了密切联系。每年一进入防火期间，鄂伦春族人民都动员起来，护林员以小队为单位分区分段进行工作。各个部落的妇女都组织起来，选出组长轮流值日。在这期间，禁止人们在野外吸烟；猎户外出时，必须预告地点，以便和防火队、站保持经常联系。
    在防火期内，猎民们一边在山上巡视，一边进行围猎；妇女们一边站岗放哨，一边进行副业生产。随着防火护林工作的开展，他们的生产也提高了。托扎明苏木第一届人民代表会议上，有一位老大爷说：“今天，我们有了好枪、好马和足够的子弹，就能猎取更多的东西；而且一张狍皮的价格可抵上过去五张皮。”
    现在，鄂伦春族人民已把保护好祖国的森林当作自己神圣的职责。人们到处这样唱着：“森林就是我们的家，保护好森林，就是保护了我的家。”
                                  （王继先）
    幸福生活开了头
    贵州省黎平县水口乡，遍地是茂密的杉林。在高山、丛林、峡谷中，居住着四万多勇敢、朴实的侗族人民。
    解放前，侗族同胞的生活情景是：“官家吃侗家，侗家吃泥巴”。青苔是他们的蔬菜；盐巴是他们的珍品。解放后，高原上燃起了新生的火焰，幸福的生活开了头。去年春天，人民政府抽调了大批干部，深入各个山村，用“典型示范”、对比等方法，教育侗族人民，使他们懂得新耕作法的好处。经过深入的教育以后，百分之五十以上的侗族农民乐于用牛犁田了。例如，水口乡十村的四百多户农民，过去只有十四户用牛犁田，去年已有二百零一户完全改用牛犁了。
    人民政府还无偿地发给侗族农民各种农具，仅化民、地坪两地，就发放犁一千一百三十张，耙五百八十架，锄头五百六十把，镰刀六百把。另外，还发放大批水利贷款，帮助侗族农民兴修了数千处小型水利，把干田变成水田。
                              （德忠、涛声）
    高摆塝的春天
    高摆塝是贵州省惠水县布依族、苗族自治区的山村，拔海约两千公尺。这里一年有三季都是大雾弥漫，细雨蒙蒙。
    当春天来到，田里的积冰还未化完的时候，摆塝的苗家就开始春耕了。人们清楚地知道，在使用相当原始的木犁木耙耕作的情况下，要想增产是比较困难的。就拿贫农方路卡来说，去年他虽然使上了耕牛，改变了过去“人拉犁”和“锄挖田”的耕作法，劳动效率提高了一倍，但是，木犁木耙不能深耕、多耙，也不能用以精耕细作。为了扶助少数民族人民发展生产，人民政府曾在这里发放了大批铁质农具。在发放农具的那天晚上，好多人都兴奋得睡不着觉；第二天，各寨各组都自动进行了酝酿和讨论，普遍订出了爱国增产计划。石板寨的十几户苗族农民，还自动组织了两个临时互助组。
    发放新农具后，苗家都不用木犁木耙耕作了。全摆塝仅犁、耙、锄等五种铁质大农具，就有三千一百五十四件；百分之八十的苗家都有了犁头、镰刀等成套的农具。
    生产工具的初步改进，也给苗族妇女带来了幸福。历来，苗家妇女的劳动比男人还繁重，“勾腰薅秧”使她们身体畸形发展，许多妇女一上五十岁，大都成了驼背。现在，她们可以使用新农具，站立起来薅秧了。
    生产改革将给山村里的苗家带来丰收，丰收又将给他们带来了幸福生活。人们坚信着：在毛主席温暖阳光的照耀下，生产将一年比一年好，日子将一天比一天强。（叶绍宾）
