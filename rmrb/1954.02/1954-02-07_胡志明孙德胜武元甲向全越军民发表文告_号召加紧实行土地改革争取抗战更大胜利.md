Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: According to Vietnam News Agency on February 3rd: On the eve of the Spring Festival, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, and Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued messages to all soldiers and civilians across Vietnam, to the soldiers and civilians bravely fighting behind enemy lines, and to the people in enemy-occupied areas, respectively, to celebrate the Spring Festival, and called on all soldiers and civilians to intensify their efforts, implement land reform, advance the resistance war, and strive for greater victories.

    In his message, President Ho Chi Minh called out: Cadres and soldiers behind enemy lines and in enemy-occupied areas should concentrate their efforts on implementing the resolutions of last year's National Guerrilla Conference and annihilate as much of the enemy's active forces as possible; young men and women in enemy-occupied areas should resolutely refuse to join the French invading army, actively join the People's Army and guerrillas, and fight against the enemy alongside the people. President Ho Chi Minh also called on the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines to extensively carry out the work of disintegrating the puppet army and strive for the puppet army to surrender to the People's Army.

    President Ho Chi Minh said in his message: Our resistance war will be more arduous in the new year, but we will achieve greater victories. In his message to the nation, President Ton Duc Thang said: On the occasion of celebrating the Lunar New Year of Vietnam-Soviet-China friendship, on behalf of the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, I wish all compatriots at home and abroad, and the cadres and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army, under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the government, new achievements in advancing the resistance war and implementing land reform, and new achievements in strengthening the friendship between the peoples of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries, assisting in safeguarding the security and independence of all countries, and ensuring lasting world peace.

    In his congratulatory message to all cadres and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army, militiamen, and guerrillas, Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap said: Last year, more than 90,000 enemy soldiers lost their combat effectiveness. In the future, the enemy's casualties will be even more severe. Facing such a situation, the French and American imperialists will inevitably attempt to do everything possible to reverse their defeat. We do not underestimate the enemy, but we firmly believe that we will achieve greater victories in the new year. Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap called out: In order to welcome the victorious new year, the troops on all fronts must engage in sustained combat, closely coordinate with each other, resolutely destroy the enemy, and strive for the "Resolutely Fight and Resolutely Win" banner awarded by President Ho Chi Minh. Finally, Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap called on the Vietnamese People's Army, militiamen, and guerrillas to turn this year's spring into a spring of victory.

    胡志明孙德胜武元甲向全越军民发表文告
    号召加紧实行土地改革争取抗战更大胜利
   【新华社六日讯】据越南通讯社三日讯：越南民主共和国胡志明主席、越苏中友好月中央组织委员会孙德胜主席、越南人民军武元甲总司令，在春节前夕分别向越南全国军民和在敌后英勇作战的军民及敌占区人民发表文告，祝贺春节，并号召全体军民加紧努力，实行土地改革、推进抗战，争取更大的胜利。
    胡志明主席在文告中号召说：敌后和敌占区的干部、战士们，要集中力量执行去年全国游击队员会议的决议，尽量歼灭敌人的有生力量；敌占区的男女青年们，坚决不参加法国侵略军，积极参加人民军和游击队，与人民群众并肩对敌作战。胡志明主席并号召敌后军民广泛展开瓦解伪军的工作，争取伪军向人民军投诚。
    胡志明主席在文告中说：我们的抗战在新的一年中将会更加艰苦，但是，我们将取得更大的胜利。孙德胜主席向全国军民发表的文告说：值此庆祝越苏中友好的旧历新年，我代表越苏中友好月中央组织委员会，预祝国内外的全体同胞，越南人民军的干部和战士在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和政府的英明领导下，在推进抗战和实行土地改革方面取得新的成就，并在加强越南与苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家人民之间的友谊、协助保障各国的安全和独立以及世界持久和平方面取得新的成就。
    武元甲总司令给越南人民军、民兵和游击队的全体干部和战士的贺电说：去年，九万多名敌军失去了战斗力。将来，敌人的伤亡还会更加惨重。法、美帝国主义者面临着这样的局势，必然会企图竭力挽回他们的失败。我们并不低估敌人，但是我们坚决相信，我们在新的一年中必将取得更大的胜利。武元甲总司令号召说：为了迎接胜利的新年，各战线上的部队必须进行持久的战斗，互相密切配合作战，坚决摧毁敌人，争取胡志明主席颁发的“坚决作战坚决得胜”奖旗。武元甲总司令最后号召越南人民军、民兵和游击队把今年的春天变成胜利的春天。
