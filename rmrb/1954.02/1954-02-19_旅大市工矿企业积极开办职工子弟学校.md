Lüda City's Industrial and Mining Enterprises Actively Establish Schools for Children of Employees

Lüda City already has twenty-four industrial and mining enterprises that have established twenty-one schools for children of employees, enrolling 2,983 higher primary school graduates.

In the autumn of 1953, approximately five thousand children of employees of various industrial and mining enterprises in Lüda City did not advance to middle school. The Lüda Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed that various methods should be used to resolve their learning and employment issues, one of which was to "actively mobilize qualified factories and mines to establish schools for children of employees" to absorb a portion of higher primary school graduates and cultivate them as reserve labor forces. The Municipal Committee also instructed that factories and mines should have a long-term perspective on running schools, not only to "establish" them but also to "persist" in operating them. To smoothly carry out this work, the Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Government jointly convened a joint meeting of managers and Party committee secretaries of various industrial and mining enterprises to mobilize them. The Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department, Education Bureau, Communist Youth League Municipal Committee, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also dispatched cadres to form a working group to assist various units in establishing schools, enrolling students, conducting examinations, and starting classes. They also worked with various units to specifically study and resolve difficulties regarding teachers, funding, school buildings, and curriculum. Last autumn, the working group first focused on pilot projects in units with better conditions and then helped units with difficulties to actively overcome various obstacles and gradually establish schools. In this way, the schools for children of employees of various industrial and mining enterprises were established one after another. Those units that did not yet have the conditions at the time were preparing to establish them this year.

The schools for children of employees of industrial and mining enterprises in Lüda City are generally run independently by a single factory. Because the city has determined that the purpose of factories and mines running schools is to cultivate reserve labor forces for their respective factories and mines, it would be difficult to determine the technical courses if several factories jointly operated a school. Operating a school independently by a single factory not only avoids this difficulty but also facilitates leadership, strengthens the responsibility of the sponsoring unit, avoids mutual buck-passing, and makes it easier to persist in operating the school.

Facts have proven that the method of mobilizing factories and mines to run schools to solve the learning and employment problems of employees' children is feasible in large and medium-sized cities and mining areas. The result of Lüda City's efforts has been the support of the broad masses of employees, and the political influence is extremely positive. The masses of employees have long eagerly hoped that their factories would have schools for children of employees. Most factories and enterprises are also willing to establish such schools. Many factory directors, managers, Party committee secretaries, and trade union chairmen personally attended and spoke at the opening ceremonies of the schools, encouraging the students to study hard. The Party committee secretary of the 523 Factory also went to the school to understand the students' learning situation and guide the school to do a good job in political and ideological education. Because the responsible persons of these factories and mines realize that this is not only a matter of employee welfare, but if it is not resolved well, it will affect the enthusiasm of employees for production to a certain extent; moreover, this is also needed for the development of the factories and mines themselves, as it can cultivate a group of reserve labor forces with junior high school education level for the unit.

The funding for this batch of schools for children of employees in Lüda City is generally raised from factory director funds, year-end bonuses, and other sources. Thanks to the efforts of various units to tap potential and give play to their initiative, as well as the assistance of the Municipal Education Bureau, the two major difficulties of teachers and school buildings have also been basically resolved. School buildings generally utilize employee cultural and literacy schools or clubs, while the Crane Factory specifically vacated a building to use as a school building. For units that truly have difficulties, the Municipal Education Bureau helps them borrow nearby middle school buildings (middle schools adopting a two-shift system). Teachers are generally drawn from the factory's office staff, technicians, and teachers of cultural and literacy schools. In addition to providing specific leadership and assistance to the schools for children of employees in terms of relevant policies, systems, and teaching plans, the Municipal Education Bureau also helped various units solve some of the teacher shortage: adjusting some liberal arts teachers, assigning several more experienced teachers to schools with more than four classes to serve as backbone teachers, and holding study sessions for more than eighty teachers. Through listening to reports and observing in middle schools, these teachers learned classroom teaching, homeroom teacher work, and Young Pioneers work, and initially mastered teaching knowledge.

This year, Lüda City plans to continue to mobilize industrial and mining enterprises to run schools to absorb more higher primary school graduates into schools.

### 旅大市工矿企业积极开办职工子弟学校

    旅大市工矿企业积极开办职工子弟学校
    旅大市已有二十四个工矿企业举办了二十一处职工子弟学校，招收了高小毕业生二千九百八十三人。
    一九五三年秋季，旅大市没有升入中学的各工矿企业的职工子女约有五千人。中共旅大市委会指示要用各种方法解决他们的学习和就业问题，其中一项办法，就是“积极发动有条件的厂矿举办职工子弟学校”，吸收一部分高小毕业生，培养他们成为劳动后备力量。市委并指示，各厂矿企业要有长期办学的思想。不仅要“办起来”，而且要“坚持下去”。为了顺利地进行这一工作，市委和市人民政府曾联合召开了各工矿企业的经理和党委书记的联席会议来进行动员。市委宣传部、教育局、青年团市委和市工会联合会并抽调干部组成工作组，到各单位协助进行创校、招生、考试、开学上课等工作，并和各单位具体研究解决师资、经费、校舍、课程等困难问题。去年秋季，工作组先在条件较好的单位重点试办，然后帮助有困难的单位积极克服各种困难，陆续举办，这样，各工矿企业的职工子弟学校就先后办了起来。那些当时还没有条件的单位，准备在今年举办。
    旅大市工矿企业的职工子弟学校，一般是一厂单独举办的。因为该市确定工矿企业办学的宗旨是培养各该厂矿企业的劳动后备力量，如果几个工厂联合举办，学校的技术课就不易确定。而一厂单独举办不仅可以避免这种困难，而且还便于领导，可以加强主办单位的责任心，避免互相推诿的现象，容易坚持办下去。
    事实证明，在大、中城市和工矿区，发动厂矿办学来解决职工子女的学习和就业问题的办法是可行的。旅大市这样作的结果，得到了广大职工的拥护，政治影响极其良好。职工群众早已迫切希望自己的工厂有子弟学校。大多数工厂和企业也都愿意创办职工子弟学校。许多厂矿的厂长、经理、党委书记、工会主席在学校举行开学典礼时，曾亲自到会讲话，勉励学生努力学习。五二三厂党委书记并到学校了解学生学习情况，指导学校做好政治思想教育工作。因为这些厂矿企业的负责人都认识到，这不仅是关乎职工福利的问题，如果解决不好，会在一定程度上影响职工的生产积极性；而且，这也是厂矿、企业本身发展所需要的，它可以为本单位培养一批具有初中文化程度的劳动后备力量。
    旅大市这一批职工子弟学校的经费，一般都是由厂长基金、年终奖金等方面筹集的。由于各单位挖掘潜力，发挥积极性，以及市教育局的帮助，师资和校舍两大困难也都基本上得到了解决。校舍一般都利用职工文化补习学校或俱乐部，起重机厂则专门腾出了一栋楼房来做校舍。确有困难的单位，市教育局帮助他们借用附近的中学校舍（中学改二部制）。师资一般都是从厂矿的科室工作人员、技术人员和文化补习学校教员中抽调的。市教育局除了在有关方针、政策、学制、教学计划等方面给予职工子弟学校以具体的领导和帮助外，也帮助各单位解决了一部分师资的困难：调剂了一部分文史教员，抽调了若干较有经验的教师分配到有四个班以上的学校充当骨干，举办了八十余名教师的学习会，这批教师通过听报告、到中学观摩等方式，学习了课堂教学、班主任工作及少年先锋队工作，初步掌握了教学知识。
    今年，旅大市准备继续发动工矿企业办学，以吸收更多的高小毕业生入校学习。
