Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Many factories across the country completed the national production plan for January this year, changing the situation of slackness at the beginning of the year or failure to complete the plan in the early months, thus creating conditions for fulfilling and overfulfilling the national production plan for the first quarter of this year. According to available materials, those who completed the January production plan include state-owned coal mines in the Northeast and North China regions, state-owned and joint state-private iron and steel factories in East China, 75 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province, some state-owned factories in Shenyang, factories and mines in the Daye area, and seven major factories in Changsha. The January production task of coal mines in Northeast China increased by more than 16% compared to the same period last year. Among the 12 units of coal mines in the region, 10 units completed the January production plan one to four days ahead of schedule. The output plans of the seven major state-owned coal mines in North China were all overfulfilled, and the actual coal output was higher than any month last year, exceeding the same period last year by more than 20%. In East China, the output of steel ingots exceeded the national plan by 1.7%, steel by 8.5%, pig iron by 54.2%, and the output of train wheels, rolling mills, etc., was overfulfilled, and the quality of various products also exceeded the national standards. Among the 75 units in Shanxi Province that completed the January plan, such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Taiyuan Electric Power Bureau, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, and Shanxi Machinery Factory, 65 units overfulfilled their plans. State-owned factories in Shenyang that completed the January production plan include smelters, water pump factories, textile factories, the No. 7 Rubber Factory, and heating equipment factories. The actual output of various products of the Shenyang No. 7 Rubber Factory in January exceeded the plan by an average of 12.4%, with over 9,650 more tires produced alone. In the Daye area, those who completed the January production plan include Daye Steel Plant, Huaxin Cement Plant, Yuanhua Coal Mine, and the No. 1 Power Plant of Wuhan Metallurgical Electric Power Bureau. In Changsha, Hunan Province, those who completed the January production plan include the state-owned Changsha Machine Tool Plant, Changsha Automobile Parts Factory, and Changsha Power Plant.

    Due to the many preparations made in the fourth quarter of last year for the first quarter of this year, a new atmosphere emerged in the production of many factories and mines in January this year. For example, most mining bureaus and mines in the Northeast coal mining area were able to complete their production plans evenly on a ten-day basis. In North China's coal mines, the daily output of the entire region, except for being slightly lower than the plan on January 2nd and 3rd, exceeded the daily plan every day for the rest of the month. Some factories and mines also created new production records in January. For example, the converter workshop of the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Plant created a new record of refining 80 furnaces of steel per day on the second day of entering 1954, which was three more furnaces than the newly set quota for January, and further increased to 86 furnaces on the third day. The electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant created a new record for the highest monthly output since the start of the furnace more than a year ago, with output increasing by more than 9% compared to the highest monthly output last year. The Bessemer furnace of Daye Steel Plant successively created the highest records of 93 and 94 furnaces per day on January 22nd and 23rd, which was 9 to 10 more furnaces than this year's quota and 14 to 15 more furnaces than in December last year. Some factories and mines that had previously performed poorly in completing production plans completed their plans ahead of schedule or exceeded them in January this year. For example, Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 2 Plant was one of the worst performers in completing plans at the beginning of last year. In January this year, various products of the plant, such as steel, steel window frames, and wire rods, all exceeded the plan. Last January, most state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Shanxi Province did not complete their plans, but in January this year, most of them completed their plans. For example, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which did not complete the plan in January last year, overfulfilled the plan for all major products in January this year, including pig iron, steel ingots, electric furnace steel, coke, thin plates, steel, and refractory materials. The overfulfillment ranged from 0.8% to 52.81%. The actual output increased by 35.6% to more than 153% compared to the actual output in January last year. The output of electric furnace steel, thin plates, and refractory materials increased by 7.6% to more than 57% compared to the actual output in December last year.

    The quality of some factory and mine products also improved in January. For example, all 675 water pumps produced by Shenyang Water Pump Factory were first-class products.

    The timely completion of the national production plan by many factories and mines in January enabled the ordering units in various places to receive the required orders in a timely manner. Daye Steel Plant and Huaxin Cement Company alone enabled more than 200 ordering units to obtain the required steel and cement in a timely manner.

    许多厂矿完成一月份国家计划
    为完成第一季度生产计划创造了条件
    【新华社五日讯】各地有许多工厂在今年一月份完成了国家生产计划，改变了过去年初松或年初完不成计划的情况，为完成和超额完成今年第一季的国家生产计划创造了条件。据已有材料，完成一月份生产计划的有东北区和华北区的国营煤矿，华东区的国营和公私合营钢铁工厂，山西省的七十五个国营和地方国营厂矿，沈阳市的部分国营工厂，大冶地区的各厂矿，长沙市的七个主要工厂。东北煤矿一月份生产任务比去年同期提高了百分之十六以上，全区煤矿十二个单位中就有十个单位提前一天到四天完成一月份生产计划。华北区七大国营煤矿的产量计划都超额完成，实际产煤量比去年任何一个月都多，超过去年同期百分之二十以上。华东区钢锭产量超过国家计划百分之一点七，钢材超过百分之八点五，生铁超过百分之五十四点二，火车轮、轧辊等的产量都超额完成，各种产品的质量也超过了国家规定的指标。山西省完成一月份计划的太原钢铁厂、太原电业局、太原矿山机器厂、山西机器厂等七十五个单位中超额的有六十五个。沈阳市完成一月份生产计划的有冶炼厂、水泵厂、纺织厂、第七橡胶厂、暖气器材厂等国营工厂，沈阳第七橡胶厂一月份各种产品实际产量平均超过计划百分之十二点四，其中只各种轮胎就多生产了九千六百五十多条。大冶地区完成一月份生产计划的有大冶钢厂、华新水泥厂、源华煤矿、武汉冶电业局第一发电厂等。湖南长沙市完成一月份生产计划的有国营长沙机床厂、长沙汽车配件厂、长沙发电厂等。
    由于去年第四季度就为今年第一季的生产作了许多准备工作，今年一月份，许多厂矿的生产都出现了新的气象。如东北区煤矿大多数矿务局和矿场都能均衡地按旬完成生产计划。华北煤矿全区日产量，除一月二、三两天稍低于计划外，其余每天都超额完成日计划。有些厂矿并且在一月份中创造了生产新纪录，如上海钢铁公司第一厂转炉车间在进入一九五四年的第二天就创造了日炼八十炉钢的新纪录，比一月份新定额还多三炉，第三天更上升到炼了八十六炉。太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部创造了开炉一年多以来的最高月产新纪录，产量比去年最高月产量还提高百分之九以上。大冶钢厂贝氏炉在一月二十二和二十三两天，先后创造了日产九十三炉和九十四炉的最高纪录，比今年定额多九炉到十炉，比去年十二月多十四炉到十五炉。有些过去完成生产计划很差的厂矿，今年一月份都提前或超额完成了计划。如上海钢铁公司第二厂就是去年年初完成计划最差的一个，今年一月份该厂的钢材、钢窗料、线材等各种产品，都超额完成计划。山西省去年一月份大部分国营和地方国营厂矿都没有完成计划，而今年一月，绝大部分都完成了计划。如去年一月份没有完成计划的太原钢铁厂今年一月份全部主要产品包括生铁、钢锭、电炉钢、焦炭、薄板、钢材、耐火材料等都超额完成。超额数从百分之零点八到百分之五十二点八一。实际产量比去年一月份的实际产量提高了百分之三十五点六到百分之一百五十三以上。电炉钢、薄板、耐火材料等产品比去年十二月实际产量还增加了百分之七点六到百分之五十七以上。
    一月份有些厂矿产品的质量也有提高。如沈阳水泵厂生产的六百七十五台水泵，全部都是一级品。
    一月份许多厂矿的按时完成国家生产计划，使各地订货单位所需要的订货得到了及时的供应。只是大冶钢厂和华新水泥公司就使二百多个订货单位及时得到了所需要的钢材和水泥。
