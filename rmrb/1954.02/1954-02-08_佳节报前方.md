Firecrackers are going off everywhere, and the sound of gongs and drums is getting louder and louder. The masses in Shuangliushu Village, Fangshan County, Hebei Province, are bustling with activity, celebrating the Spring Festival. The home of Wang Baofen, a soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, is filled with a festive atmosphere and is particularly busy.

The door of the newly built brick house is adorned with red paper Spring Festival couplets sent by the village. On the front wall of the main room are portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, alongside two New Year pictures. On the right wall is a certificate of merit awarded to Wang Baofen's elder brother, Wang Baokun, for his participation in the railway workers' effort to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The red-hot stove is burning brightly under the kang, the kettle is merrily whistling, and the dumplings are tumbling in the pot.

Wang Baofen's father, Wang Zhenduo, has just returned from a meeting of military families convened by the village. He sits at the entrance of the main room, taking advantage of the evening light to shave. Wang Baofen's mother is on the kang, playing with her five-year-old grandson, Wang Baokun's son, Xiao Qi. Wang Baofen's twelve-year-old younger sister, Wang Shuqing, is wearing a new uniform with pink silk ribbons in her hair, meticulously pasting paper-cut window decorations on the newly papered windows. Her seventy-five-year-old maternal grandmother is busy heating the kang for her second grandson, Wang Baosen, who is returning home tonight for the Spring Festival. Wang Baofen's sister-in-law is in the east room, preparing dinner while coaxing her three-year-old daughter. At this moment, Wang Baofen's second elder brother, Wang Baosen, the secretary of the local Communist Party branch, returns home with a smile. Soon after, Wang Baokun, who works as a railway worker at the Fengtai Engineering Section, also enters the house. Then the youngest son, Wang Baofang, who is fifteen years old and rehearsing in the village drama troupe, also returns, bringing with him Wang Baosen's fiancée, Pan Yuxiang. The mother, seeing this girl in a willow-patterned padded jacket and large red silk ribbons in her hair, is overjoyed, her eyes narrowing into slits, and she quickly invites her to sit on the warm kang. The New Year's Eve dinner begins. Wang Baosen, having just finished his dumplings, is already shouting, "Hurry up, it's time for the meeting, time for the meeting!" This advanced rural family will be using the New Year's Eve to plan the main tasks for each member in 1954.

The family of eleven sits around the kang table, and Wang Baokun is elected as chairman, with Wang Baosen as the recorder.

Father Wang Zhenduo is the first to speak. This year he is fifty-five years old and is a backbone member of the village's agricultural production cooperative, leading two field production teams. He smokes his pipe and says calmly, "I guarantee to complete the production plan set by the cooperative for 1954, produce more grain, sell all surplus grain to the state, and strive to become a model worker. I will also ensure that the whole family is more harmonious and united, work hard, and strive to become a model family."

The mother follows the father, saying, "I guarantee to cook well, take good care of the two children, and also raise two fat pigs."

Before liberation, the sister-in-law was just a housewife who only knew how to work around the stove. After liberation, she gradually became an active participant in learning and production, and she has now recognized two thousand characters. She has been preparing for this for a long time, and she speaks in one breath: "First, I must work hard and strive to be a model; second, I must study hard, learn culture and politics; third, I must take good care of the two children and cultivate the new generation of the country; fourth, I must do a good job in sanitation and ensure the health of the family."

Now everyone is looking at Pan Yuxiang, who is sitting next to the grandmother. She is nineteen years old this year, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a model propagandist in Fangshan County, studying in the fifth grade of the over-age class in the village primary school. She says in a soft voice, her face flushed, "I will study hard at school, striving to get 100 points in arithmetic and 80 points in Chinese and other courses. When I get home, I will seize the time to help with production."

Then Wang Baofang, Wang Shuqing, Wang Baokun, and Wang Baosen all announced their determination to work harder and study better in 1954.

As they are talking, the village director, Meng Xianzhang, walks in with seven or eight young people. They are all good friends of Wang Baofen, having grown up together, suffered together, struggled against the landlords together after liberation, and participated in the construction of Shuangliushu Village together. Since 1951, they have left one after another. Wang Baofen joined the Volunteer Army, and other young people have participated in water conservancy construction, entered factories, worked in banks, or gone to supply and marketing cooperatives and Xinhua bookstores… Now they have all returned home for the Spring Festival. They have come to visit the relatives of their old friend, as usual.

After seeing off this group of happy guests, the family sits down again, and Wang Baokun writes a letter to Wang Baofen, who is far away in Korea.

"Brother Baofen:

It is now New Year's Eve, and our whole village and family are celebrating this Spring Festival in a lively manner. Our family even held a family meeting, and everyone planned the main tasks to be done in 1954. Didn't you want to know about the implementation of the General Line in our village in your last letter? Let me tell you: Before the publicity of the General Line, some people in our village had the idea of going it alone and 'standing out,' and people like Zhang Yingjie and Zhou Fangying were not active in participating in mutual aid teams, and Li Zhilin and Li Jialin withdrew from the cooperative. The village cadres and Party members were also not very clear about the path that the countryside should take. Since the publicity of the General Line was launched at the end of November last year, the masses' understanding has greatly improved, and they all understand that they must take the socialist road. Zhang Yingjie's thinking has also been cleared up, and his family sold 2,200 jin of surplus grain. Because our family built three new tile-roofed houses, we have already used some of the grain, but we also sold 300 jin of corn. Our village sold a total of 170,000 jin of surplus grain and received the title of patriotic grain-selling model village. With the upsurge in selling grain, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has also developed. There was originally only one Li Chunzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative and eight mutual aid teams in the village. Now, the Wang Fu Agricultural Production Cooperative and six mutual aid teams have been newly added. The entire village, except for the landlords and rich peasants, has been organized. On January 24th, the county magistrate personally came to our village to present the banner. Since 1951, this is the eleventh banner our village has received in production, learning, sanitation, and various political movements.

Finally, let me tell you a good news, you are about to have a new sister-in-law. Your second elder brother and Pan Yuxiang, a member of the Communist Youth League in our village, are freely in love and will be married on the ninth day of the first lunar month. This is the first free love marriage in Shuangliushu Village!"

Wang Baokun finished writing the letter and tilted his head to ask his father, mother, younger brothers, and grandmother if there was anything else they wanted to tell Baofen. Father Wang Zhenduo knocked his pipe on the edge of the kang and said slowly, "Tell Baofen that the people in our village are working together to move towards socialism, striving to take a step ahead and use tractors first in the county." The grandmother on the side also said tremblingly, "Tell Baofen that my body is very strong, and I still want to live to see socialism, to see the 'iron ox' plowing the fields."

The night is deep, the firecrackers are still crackling, and the sound of gongs and drums and fiddles from the village primary school's drama rehearsal is rippling in the night sky, seeming especially lively. The crisp sound of chopping dumpling filling is coming from every household. Xu Laoer, a member of the Wang Fu Mutual Aid Team, is writing the words "Wang Fu Agricultural Production Cooperative" neatly with a brush on a wooden board, preparing to hang it up on the first day of the New Year.

    佳节报前方
    金凤
    鞭炮在各处响起来了，锣鼓声一阵紧似一阵。河北省房山县双柳树村的群众正在闹烘烘地迎接春节，志愿军战士王宝芬家里一片节日景象，显得格外忙碌。
    新起的大砖房的门上贴着村里送来的红纸春联，正房的正面墙上是毛主席和朱总司令的画像，旁边是两张新年画。右面墙上是王宝芬的大哥王宝坤参加铁路工人抗美援朝抢修队的立功喜报。炕下烧着通红的炉火，开水壶在快乐地喧响着，锅里煮的饺子在翻滚着。
    王宝芬的父亲王振铎大爷刚开完村中召集的军属座谈会回来，坐在堂屋门口，乘着傍晚的微光在剃头。王宝芬的母亲在炕上逗着五岁的孙子——王宝坤的儿子小七玩。王宝芬的十二岁的小妹妹王淑卿穿着一身新制服，头上扎着粉红色的绸发结，在精心地往新糊的窗纸上贴着窗花。她的七十五岁的姥姥忙着给今晚要赶回家过春节的二外孙王宝森烧炕。王宝芬的大嫂在东边屋里一面准备晚饭，一面哄着她三岁的小丫头。这时王宝芬的二哥，本乡中共总支书记王宝森笑嘻嘻地回来了，在丰台工务段当铁路工人的大哥王宝坤不久也进了家门。紧接着最小的儿子，正在村剧团排戏的十五岁的王宝芳也回来了，还带来了王宝森的未婚妻潘玉香。大妈一看到这位穿着双燕穿柳花棉袄，头上结着大红绸结的姑娘，喜得眼睛都眯成一条缝，连忙招呼她坐到热炕上。除夕晚餐开始了，王宝森刚刚吃完饺子，就在一旁嚷着“快点，开会了，开会了。”这个农村的先进家庭要在除夕晚上布置各人在一九五四年的主要工作。
    一家子十一口人，团团围着炕桌坐下，公推大哥王宝坤当主席，老二王宝森做记录。
    父亲王振铎第一个发言。他今年五十五岁，他是本村农业生产合作社的骨干分子，领导着两个田间生产小组。他一边抽着旱烟，一边不慌不忙地说：“我保证完成一九五四年合作社制定的生产计划，多打粮食，把余粮全部卖给国家，争取当劳动模范。还要保证使全家更加和睦团结，努力生产，争取成为模范家庭。”
    大妈紧接着大爷发言了，她说：“保证做好饭，带好两个孩子，还要喂两口肥猪。”
    大嫂解放前原是只知道围着锅台转的家庭妇女，解放后渐渐变成了学习和生产中的积极分子，现在她已认了两千字。她在一旁早就准备好了，一口气讲下去：“第一要好好劳动，争取模范；第二要好好学习，学文化，学政治；第三要带好两个孩子，培养好国家的新一代；第四要做好卫生工作，保证一家健康。”
    现在大家都看着坐在姥姥身旁的潘玉香了，她今年十九岁，是青年团员，又是房山县的模范宣传员，在村小学超龄班五年级上学。只见她红着脸细声地说：“在学校要努力学习，争取算术达到一百分，国语和其他课程达到八十分。回家抓紧时间帮助生产。”
    接着王宝芳、王淑卿和王宝坤、王宝森都宣布了自己在一九五四年要工作得更好学习得更好的决心。
    正说着，村主任孟宪章带着七、八个青年走进屋里来了。他们都是王宝芬的好朋友，自小一块长大，一块受苦，解放后一块斗争了地主，一块参加双柳树村的建设。从一九五一年起，他们陆续出去了。王宝芬参加了志愿军，其他青年，有的参加了水利建设，有的进了工厂，有的做了银行工作，有的到了供销合作社和新华书店，……现在他们都回家来过春节。他们照例来探望自己老朋友的亲属来了。
    送走这一群快乐的客人以后，全家又重新坐下来，由王宝坤执笔给远在朝鲜的王宝芬写信了。
      “宝芬弟：
    现在是除夕，咱们全村和全家正在热热闹闹地过这个春节，咱家还开了家庭会议，各人都计划了
  一九五四年要做的主要工作。你前次来信不是想知道咱村贯彻总路线的情况吗？让我告诉你吧：在总路线宣传以前，咱村部分的人存在着单干‘冒尖’的思想，像张英杰、周芳瀛参加互助组不积极，李芝林、李家林退出了合作社。村里的干部和党员也对农村应走的道路不大明确。自去年十一月底总路线的宣传展开以后，群众的认识大大提高了，都懂得要走社会主义这条路，张英杰的思想也打通了，他一家就卖了余粮两千二百斤。咱家因为新盖了三间大瓦房，已经用了一部分粮食，但是也卖了三百斤玉米。咱村共卖余粮十七万斤，得到了爱国售粮模范村的称号。随着售粮的热潮，互助合作运动也有了发展，村中原来只有一个李春长农业生产合作社和八个互助组，现在又新增加了王福农业生产合作社和六个互助组。全村除地主、富农外已经全都组织起来。一月二十四日，县长还亲自到咱村来授旗，自从一九五一年以来，这已是咱村在生产、学习、卫生和各种政治运动中得到的第十一面锦旗了。
    最后告诉你一件喜事，你快要添一个新嫂子了。你二哥和本村青年团员潘玉香自由恋爱，就要在旧历正月初九结婚。这还是双柳树村第一对自由恋爱结婚的呢？”
    王宝坤把信写完了，侧着头问父亲、母亲、弟弟和姥姥，还有什么话要告诉宝芬，王振铎大爷把烟袋往炕沿上敲了敲，慢慢地说：“告诉宝芬，咱村的人齐心合力都要奔向社会主义，争取提前一步，在全县先使拖拉机。”姥姥在一旁也颤巍巍地说：“告诉宝芬，我身体很硬朗，我还要活着看到社会主义，看到‘铁牛’犁地哩。”
    夜深了，鞭炮还在噼噼拍拍地响着，村小学排剧的锣鼓声和胡琴声荡漾在夜空中显得分外闹热，家家户户都传出剁饺子馅的清脆的声音。原是王福互助组的组员徐老二正在一块木板上用毛笔工工整整写着“王福农业生产合作社”几个大字，准备在大年初一挂起来。（附图片）
