    Jiulonggang Coal Mine in Huainan achieved great success in safe production last year, and was rewarded by the CPC Huainan Municipal Committee and the Huainan Mining Bureau. While overfulfilling last year’s national production plan and increased production plan, the mine eliminated fatalities throughout the year, significantly reduced minor injuries compared to 1952, and eliminated serious injuries underground.
    During last year’s safe production, many models emerged in the mine. Among the 282 advanced workers and many advanced units selected, many achieved remarkable results in safe production. For example, the Zhao Duocai coal mining team and the Zong Chaogen tunneling team have led their teams in production for four consecutive years without a single work-related injury; veteran electromechanical worker Ban Jingtian worked actively, ensuring the safe operation of machinery for several years without any major accidents, setting an example for safe production throughout the mine. These advanced workers have all been rewarded by the leaders of Jiulonggang Coal Mine.

    九龙岗煤矿安全生产工作获得成绩
    淮南九龙岗煤矿去年的安全生产工作获得很大成绩，受到中共淮南市委和淮南矿务局的奖励。该矿职工在超额完成去年的国家生产计划和增产计划当中，全年消灭了死亡事故，轻伤事故也比一九五二年显著减少，并在井下消灭了重伤事故。
    该矿在去年的安全生产中，涌现出许多模范。在选出的二百八十二个先进工作者和许多先进单位中，有很多都是在安全生产方面有显著成绩的。如赵夺彩采煤班、宗朝根掘进班连续四年领导全班工人生产没有出一个工伤事故；老机电工人班景田积极工作，几年来保证了机器安全运转，没有发生过重大事故，给全矿的安全生产树立了榜样。这些先进工作者都得到九龙岗煤矿领导上的奖励。
