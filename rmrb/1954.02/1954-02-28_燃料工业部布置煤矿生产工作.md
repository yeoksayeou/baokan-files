The General Bureau of Coal Mine Management of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry recently convened a national coal mine cadre meeting to determine the production guidelines and tasks for 1954.

In 1953, national coal mines achieved great results in production due to strengthened planned management, especially strengthened dispatching work and operation plans. However, technical levels and management work still lagged behind the needs of production development, the responsibility system was not yet sound, and therefore the three links of geology, tunneling, and coal mining were still unbalanced, and accidents continued to occur. The coal mine production task for 1954 is very heavy, with planned output increasing by more than 13 percent compared to 1953, and total output value increasing by more than 14 percent. In order to ensure the successful completion of the national plan, the meeting determined this year's production policy as: conscientiously study and implement the general line, improve management level, continue to implement planned management, implement the responsibility system; under the principle of safe production, vigorously promote mechanization, tap production potential, and comprehensively and evenly complete production tasks. In continuing to strengthen planned management, it was emphasized that the responsibility system must be done well, first of all the factory director responsibility system and production area management system must be done well, and in technical management, operation regulations must be conscientiously implemented and reasonable coal mining methods must be promoted.

Regarding production geology work, it is required that organizational structures be established before March, geological personnel be equipped, and leadership of this work be strengthened. Other specific arrangements have been made for tunneling, safety, labor protection and other work. In terms of safe production, the meeting decided to make July of this year as a safety inspection month. The conference also gave clear instructions on how to continue to support capital construction and actively help local state-owned coal mines. The conference also organized typical reports and exchanged experiences. In addition, the conference also commended units with better production performance and paid tribute to Soviet experts.

    燃料工业部布置煤矿生产工作
    中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局最近召开全国煤矿干部会议，确定一九五四年的生产方针和任务。
    一九五三年全国煤矿由于加强了计划管理，特别是加强了调度工作和作业计划，在生产上取得了很大成绩。但是，技术水平和管理工作还落后于生产发展的需要，责任制度还不健全，因而地质、掘进和采煤三个环节还不平衡，事故仍不断发生。一九五四年煤矿生产任务很重，计划产量较一九五三年增加百分之十三以上，总产值将增加百分之十四以上。为了保证胜利完成国家计划，会议确定今年的生产方针为：认真学习和贯彻总路线，提高管理水平，继续贯彻计划管理，推行责任制；在安全生产的原则下，大力推行机械化，发掘生产潜力，全面地、均衡地完成生产任务。在继续加强计划管理方面，强调要搞好责任制，首先是要搞好厂长负责制及生产区域管理制，在技术管理上要认真贯彻作业规程和推行合理的采煤方法。
    关于生产地质工作，要求在三月份以前建立起组织机构，配备地质人员，加强该项工作的领导。其他对掘进、安全、劳动保护等工作都做了具体布置。在安全生产方面，会议决以今年七月为安全检阅月。对于如何继续支援基本建设，积极帮助地方国营煤矿等问题，会议也都有明确的指示。大会还组织了典型报告，交流了经验。另外，会议还表扬了生产成绩较好的单位，并向苏联专家献礼致敬。（振坤）
