    Central Commercial Department and Other Units
    Expand Supply of Rural Medicines
    To solve the problem of medication for the broad masses of peasants, the Central People's Government Ministry of Commerce, the Central People's Government Ministry of Health, and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives jointly issued a notice deciding that local pharmaceutical companies and cooperatives, under the guidance and assistance of local health administrative departments, should greatly increase the supply of rural medicines in accordance with the national health work policy.
    With the improvement of people's living standards and cultural level, the need for disease treatment and medicines among the broad masses of peasants is increasing day by day. Before liberation, peasants often used dust to stop bleeding when they broke their skin, but now they buy mercurochrome. Many farmers are familiar with saying: "If a child catches a cold, buy a few aspirin." There are now more than one hundred kinds of commonly used prepared medicines in rural areas. Among them, penicillin tablets and sulfathiazole tablets are the most widely used. Commonly used powders include sodium bicarbonate, rhubarb powder, aspirin, glucose, etc.; tablets include compound aspirin tablets, santonin calomel tablets, quinine tablets, and cough tablets.
    The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, based on the general disease conditions in rural areas, has requested and been approved by the Central Ministry of Health to research and develop 27 kinds of prepared medicine prescriptions for the treatment of multiple diseases, including pediatric antipyretic tablets, anti-malarial tablets, stomachic tablets, menstrual regulating tablets, anti-ascariasis tablets, blood tonic tablets, anti-dysentery tablets, Ten Drops, scabies ointment, ringworm solution, and eye drops, with attached indications and instructions for use, in order to supply them to farmers in rural areas. The China National Pharmaceutical Corporation has also signed a 1954 agreement with the All-China Federation of Cooperatives for the supply and marketing of medicines to rural areas, and based on past experience in various regions, is actively preparing to vigorously develop this work.

    中央商业部等单位
    扩大供应农村药品
    为解决广大农民用药问题，中央人民政府商业部、中央人民政府卫生部、和中华全国合作总社曾发出联合通知，决定由各地医药公司和合作社，根据国家卫生工作的方针，在各地卫生行政部门指导协助下，大量供应农村药品。
    随着人民生活水平和文化水平的提高，广大农民对疾病的医治和药品的需要日益增加。解放前农民碰破皮肤多是用灰尘止血，现在却买红药水来用。很多农民很熟悉地说：小孩着凉了，买几片阿斯匹林。现在农村常用的成药有一百余种。其中应用最广的是青霉素片和?胺噻唑片，一般常用的粉剂有重曹、大黄末、阿斯匹林、葡萄糖等；片剂是复方阿司匹灵片、山道年甘汞片、奎宁片、止咳片等。
    现中国医药公司已根据农村一般病症情况，请准中央卫生部研究制出治疗多项病症的成药药方二十七种，其中有小儿退热片、止疟片、健胃片、调经片、驱蛔虫片、补血片、止痢片、十滴水、灭疥膏、癣药水及眼药水等，并附有主治病症及用药说明书，以便下乡供应农民。中国医药公司又和全国合作总社签订了一九五四年的下乡药品供销协议，并根据过去各地的经验，积极准备大力开展这一工作。
