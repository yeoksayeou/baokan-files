The first plenary session of the Central People's Government's Sports Commission was held in Beijing from January 16th to 21st. More than 100 people attended the meeting, including all members of the Central Sports Commission, heads of sports commissions from major administrative regions, heads of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Sports Association, representatives from relevant central departments, and directors of political departments from major military regions. In accordance with the spirit of the general line for the state's transition period, this meeting reviewed and summarized the work of 1953 and determined the work guidelines and specific tasks for 1954.

At the opening session, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government and Vice Premier Guo Moruo of the Government Administration Council attended and gave instructions.

Vice Chairman Zhu De pointed out: Over the past few years, under the care and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, great progress has been made in the development of sports, the enhancement of the people's physique, and the improvement of various sports techniques. He said that this is one of the important material guarantees for a strong and prosperous country. Therefore, the main responsibility of the Sports Commission is to further mobilize and promote people to engage in sustained and regular sports activities. Vice Chairman Zhu said: Sports have already achieved great results, but future needs will be even greater. From a national defense perspective, the country needs powerful technical arms, which require young people to have strong bodies and possess flexible, courageous, agile, and persevering qualities; this is equally necessary for the country's economic and cultural construction. If the bodies of our generation and the next generation are strong, coupled with our country's economic construction, our country will truly be prosperous and strong. From an individual perspective, good health is the greatest wealth. If everyone's health becomes stronger day by day, it will be more conducive to the cause of socialist construction.

Vice Chairman Zhu also gave specific instructions on basic issues necessary for carrying out sports activities, such as teachers, cadres, equipment, venues, and the combination of sports and hygiene work.

Vice Premier Guo Moruo pointed out in his speech: In implementing the general line for the state's transition period, sports work is a very important link because good health is necessary to work better. He emphasized that in order to further develop sports and make it mass-oriented and regular, attention should be paid to strengthening organizational leadership, strengthening publicity and education, strengthening learning, and strengthening research.

The meeting listened to the report by He Long, Director of the Central People's Government Sports Commission, entitled "Strive to Develop Mass Sports Under the Guidance of the General Line," and the report by Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Central Sports Commission, on the work plan for 1954.

In his report, Director He Long first pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao are very concerned about the health of the people. The sports work conference convened by the Central Sports Commission in April 1953 formulated the working guidelines for developing mass sports based on the correct direction indicated by Chairman Mao. Over the past year, sports activities have been carried out to a certain extent in factories, mines, schools, government offices, troops, and rural areas across the country. This has effectively helped the broad masses of people improve their health and increase labor, work, and learning efficiency. In addition, remarkable achievements have also been made in cadre training, sports competition, national defense sports, international sports activities, and publicity work. He said that the achievements of sports work over the past year have been great and are the main aspect. However, there are still serious shortcomings in our work, namely: the development of sports across the country is still uneven, some people's understanding of sports is not clear enough; the working guidelines for mass amateur sports have not been implemented enough; sports work organizations at all levels are not sound; there is a lack of sports teachers and sports technical guidance, etc. In analyzing the reasons for the shortcomings, Director He Long pointed out that the existence of these shortcomings is mainly due to the Central Sports Commission's insufficient understanding of the situation in its leadership, the existence of a serious bureaucratic work style, a lack of specific guidance, and the failure to effectively seek the joint efforts of relevant parties.

After discussion and research, the conference made speeches and finally adopted the above-mentioned two reports.

This meeting first further clarified that the guideline for carrying out sports work must be to combine with the actual situation, develop mass sports, and gradually popularize and regularize it. According to this guideline, the central task for 1954 is: to further carry out gymnastics before and after work or during work breaks in factories and mines across the country to improve the health of workers and staff; to promote the "Preparation for Labor and Defense" sports system (referred to as the "Labor and Defense System") preparatory level (i.e., the original "Physical Exercise Standards") in secondary schools and above across the country in a prepared and planned manner, and to selectively conduct key trials of the "Labor and Defense System" in schools with the best conditions; to promote morning exercises and work break exercises in government offices across the country; in troops across the country, in addition to strengthening physical training, the "Preparation for Labor and Defense" sports system should also be gradually promoted in a planned manner; in rural areas, taking advantage of the slack farming season, focus on piloting regular exercises for certain sports, and also generally promote folk sports inherent in the countryside that are beneficial to people's health. The determination of this guideline and task is the concretization of the general line in the current sports work.

Secondly, in order to successfully complete this central task, the meeting believes that it is necessary to do a good job in publicity, training cadres, and carrying out grassroots sports competitions. In terms of publicity work, the scientific value of sports for enhancing people's health and its importance for work, study, production, and national defense should be promoted through real people and real events in a lively and vivid manner; introduce the basic techniques and physiological hygiene knowledge of sports, and introduce a large amount of Soviet sports theory and experience. In addition, newspapers, radio stations, movies, and slides should be fully utilized to carry out the publicity and reporting of sports activities. In terms of training cadres, short-term sports training classes should be opened in a planned manner in various places, and grassroots amateur sports activist training classes should be held by utilizing the spare time of factories, mines, government offices, troops, and schools, or by adopting a short-term separation from production method. Various places can also appropriately use winter and summer vacation study sessions, amateur research associations, amateur advanced studies, or short-term separation from production advanced studies to organize on-the-job sports workers' professional studies to improve their political and professional level. In terms of sports competition work, in the future, it will be mainly based on utilizing holidays and spare time to carry out sports competitions in grassroots units such as factories, mines, schools, and government offices, as well as city-wide single-item sports leagues.

The meeting believes that in order to better implement the 1954 work tasks, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership and improve the political and ideological level of all sports workers; in terms of leadership work, in addition to strengthening investigation and research and understanding the situation, it is also necessary to well summarize past work experience, strengthen contact between superiors and subordinates, strengthen contact with various relevant parties, and establish and improve the reporting system.

    中央体育运动委员会举行首次全体会议
    确定今年体育工作方针
    朱德副主席指示进一步发动和推动持久的、经常的群众性的体育运动
    【新华社七日讯】中央人民政府体育运动委员会第一次全体委员会议一月十六日到二十一日在北京举行。出席这次会议的，有中央体育运动委员会全体委员、各大行政区体育运动委员会、内蒙古自治区体育协会负责人及中央各有关部门代表和各大军区政治部主任等一百多人。这次会议根据国家过渡时期总路线的精神，检查总结了一九五三年的工作，确定了一九五四年的工作方针和具体任务。
    开幕会上，中央人民政府朱德副主席、政务院郭沫若副总理到会作了指示。
    朱德副主席指出：几年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的关怀和领导下，体育运动的开展、人民体质的增强，以及各种运动技术的提高，都有了很大的进步。他说，这就是国家富强的重要物质保证之一。因此，体育运动委员会的主要职责，就是进一步发动和推动人们进行持久的、经常的体育运动。朱副主席说：体育运动现在已经有了很大成绩，但将来的需要更大。从国防上说，国家需要强大的技术兵种，这就要青年们都有很强壮的身体，要有灵活、勇敢、敏捷、坚韧不拔的品质；这对国家的经济建设和文化建设也是同样需要的。我们这一代和下一代的身体都强壮起来了，再加上我们国家的经济建设，我们国家就真是富强了。从个人说，身体好也就是最大的富足。如果我们大家的身体一天比一天强健，这就更有利于社会主义的建设事业。
    对于开展体育运动所必需具备的师资、干部、器械、场地设备以及体育运动和卫生工作的结合等基本问题，朱副主席也作了具体的指示。
    郭沫若副总理在讲话中指出：在贯彻执行国家过渡时期的总路线中，体育工作是一个很重要的环节，因为身体好了才能更好地工作。他着重指出：要把体育运动进一步开展起来，使它群众化、经常化，就应注意加强组织领导，加强宣传教育，加强学习，加强研究。
    会议听取了中央人民政府体育运动委员会主任贺龙的“在总路线的照耀下，为开展群众性的体育运动而奋斗”的报告，和中央体委秘书长荣高棠关于一九五四年工作计划的报告。
    贺龙主任在报告中首先指出：中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席是十分关怀人民健康的。一九五三年四月中央体育运动委员会召开的体育工作会议，根据毛主席指示的正确方向，制定了开展群众性体育运动的工作方针。一年来，体育运动在全国工厂、矿山、学校、机关、部队、农村都有了一定的开展。这就有力地帮助广大群众改善了身体健康状况，提高了劳动、工作和学习效率。另外，在干部训练工作、运动竞赛工作、国防体育工作、国际体育活动和宣传工作等方面也都取得了显著的成绩。他说：一年来体育工作的成绩是很大的，而且是主要的。但在我们的工作中还存在着严重的缺点，这就是：全国体育运动的发展还不平衡，一部分人对体育运动认识还不够明确；群众性的业余体育运动工作方针还贯彻不够；各级体育工作机构还不健全；缺乏体育师资，缺乏体育技术指导等。贺龙主任在分析缺点的原因时指出：这些缺点的存在，主要是由于中央体育运动委员会领导上了解情况不够，工作中存在着严重的事务主义作风，缺乏具体指导，以及没有很好地争取有关方面的共同努力所造成的。
    会议经过讨论研究，大会发言，最后通过了上述两项报告。
    这次会议首先进一步明确了开展体育工作的方针必须是结合实际情况，开展群众性的体育运动，并逐步地使之普及和经常化。根据这一方针，一九五四年的中心任务是：在全国各厂矿进一步开展劳动前后或工作间隙的体操，以增进职工身体健康；在全国中等以上学校中，有准备、有计划地推行“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度（简称“劳卫制”）的预备级（即原“体育锻炼标准”），并选择其中条件最好的学校重点试行“劳卫制”；在全国各机关中，推行早操和工间操；在全国各部队，除加强体育训练外，也应有计划地逐步推行“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度；在农村中，利用农闲季节，重点试行一定运动项目的经常锻炼，另外也可以一般地提倡农民中固有的有利于人民健康的民间体育。这一方针和任务的确定，就是总路线在当前体育工作上的具体化。
    其次，为了胜利完成这一中心任务，会议认为：必须做好宣传、培养训练干部、开展基层运动竞赛等工作。在宣传工作方面，应通过真人真事、生动活泼地宣传体育运动对增强人民健康的科学价值和对于工作、学习、生产和国防的重要意义；介绍体育运动的初级技术和生理卫生知识，并大量介绍苏联体育运动的理论和经验。此外，应充分运用报纸、广播电台、电影和幻灯等进行体育运动的宣传和报道。在培养训练干部方面，各地应有计划地开办短期体育训练班，和利用厂矿、机关、部队、学校的业余时间或采取短期脱离生产方式举办基层业余体育积极分子训练班。各地也可适当利用寒暑假的学习会、业余研究会、业余进修或短期脱离生产进修等方式组织在职体育工作者的业务学习，以便提高他们的政治和业务水平。在运动竞赛工作方面，今后以利用假日及业余时间开展各厂矿、学校、机关等基层单位的运动竞赛为主，和全市性的各单项运动联赛。
    会议认为：要更好地贯彻执行一九五四年工作任务，必须加强思想领导，提高全体体育工作者的政治思想水平；在领导工作方面，除了加强调查研究、了解情况外，还要很好地总结过去的工作经验，加强上下级联系，加强与各有关方面的联系，建立与健全请示报告制度。
