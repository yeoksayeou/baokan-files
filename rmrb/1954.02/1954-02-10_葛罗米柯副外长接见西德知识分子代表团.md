Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 9th: According to TASS, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister A. A. Gromyko received a delegation of West German intellectuals on February 8th at the Soviet Embassy in Berlin. Members of the delegation included: Professor August Gallinger (Munich), sculptor Hans Graef (Karlsruhe), painter Dora Meyer-Wachs (Nuremberg), and Heinz Lebherz-Bachwitz, staff member and journalist of the "Nuremberg News."

The delegation presented Gromyko with a petition addressed to the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, France, Great Britain, and the United States. Currently, more than 500 well-known figures in science, art, and culture have signed this petition, and signatures are still being collected. The petition expresses the hope that representatives from West Germany and East Germany will hold joint meetings to formulate proposals for concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and that scientific and cultural institutions throughout Germany will establish free cooperation as soon as possible. The petition states that such cooperation will help German national culture escape its deplorable situation and prevent the spread of militarism and racial hatred.

In accepting the petition, Gromyko said that the wishes of West German intellectuals cannot fail to arouse the sympathy of the Soviet delegation. Such wishes are in line with the task of striving to establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, which is precisely the task that the Soviet delegation is striving to accomplish at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    葛罗米柯副外长接见西德知识分子代表团
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：苏联外交部副部长安·阿·葛罗米柯八日在柏林苏联大使馆接见西德知识分子代表团。代表团团员包括：奥古斯特·加林格教授（慕尼黑），雕刻家汉斯·格拉耶夫（加尔斯卢合），画家道拉·迈耶—瓦克斯（纽伦堡），“纽伦堡新闻”报工作人员、记者海恩斯·列布尔·巴希维茨等。
    代表团把给苏联、法国、英国和美国四国外交部长的请愿书交给葛罗米柯。目前，在这封请愿书上签名的已有五百余个有名的科学、艺术、文化工作者，签名还在继续征集中。请愿书中表示希望西德和东德的代表举行联席会议，拟订关于缔结对德和约的建议，并希望全德的科学文化机关尽快地建立自由合作。请愿书写道，这种合作将有助于使德国民族文化脱离可悲的处境，阻止军国主义和种族仇视思想的传播。
    葛罗米柯在接受请愿书时说，西德知识分子的愿望不能不引起苏联代表团的同情。这种愿望是符合于争取建立一个统一、和平与民主的德国的任务的，苏联代表团在四国外长会议上所争取完成的正是这项任务。
