    Northwest Nationalities Institute Has Great Development in the Past Four Years; More Than 2,500 Graduates Have Been Assigned to Work in Various Ethnic Minority Regions

    The Northwest Nationalities Institute, which trains ethnic minority cadres, has greatly developed over the past four years. It has already had 2,573 graduates, who have been assigned to work in various ethnic minority regions and other departments in other regions. Currently, there are 786 students studying at the institute, including thirteen ethnic groups: Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Hui, Tu, Dongxiang, Salar, Baoan, Yugu, Kazakh, Uzbek, Manchu, and Han.

    According to the policies and guidelines of the Party and the People's Government, and combined with the needs of ethnic work in the Northwest region, the Northwest Nationalities Institute has conducted relatively thorough patriotic education for students of all ethnic groups. It has also combined theory with practice to carry out necessary professional, cultural, and scientific education, enabling students of all ethnic groups to gradually break free from the adverse effects caused by the reactionary ruling class's long-term implementation of ethnic oppression policies, enhance their patriotic ideology, and establish the concept of serving the people of all ethnic groups. Over the past four years, the school has cautiously and actively developed 68 Communist Party members and 338 Communist Youth League members among students of all ethnic groups. The graduates include incumbent cadres of various ethnic groups, activists from farming and pastoral areas, patriotic intellectuals, and upper-level ethnic and religious figures who have ties with the people. After returning to their respective ethnic minority areas, under the leadership of local Party and government organizations, they are generally able to correctly publicize policies, work actively, and promote ethnic unity; they have played a certain role in promoting the development of the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of various ethnic groups. Students at the school can also unite and help each other, study actively, and respond to organizational calls at any time to participate in off-campus political movements.

    In teaching and the daily life management of students, the Northwest Nationalities Institute fully values the characteristics of all ethnic groups, and students of all ethnic groups can study and live with peace of mind. All departments use the languages of the respective ethnic groups for teaching, some through translation and some directly in the ethnic languages. The school has also compiled vocabularies of the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur languages to facilitate students' learning. From the autumn of 1952 to 1953, the school made 1,617 sets of ethnic clothing for students of all ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Kazakh. The school's catering is divided into different kitchens according to the different customs and habits of the various ethnic groups, and it purchases beef, mutton, butter, and tsampa that the students like to eat from ethnic minority areas.

    Over the past four years, the number of faculty and staff at the Northwest Nationalities Institute has grown to 308, including twelve ethnic groups. Among them, the number of faculty and staff from ethnic minorities (eleven ethnic groups) accounts for more than 43% of the total number of faculty and staff. In 1952, all faculty and staff, following the instructions of the higher authorities, launched a four-month study movement on ethnic policies, focusing on criticizing Han chauvinist ideology in teaching management and administrative work, and improved the policy and ideological level of all cadres. In addition, Han cadres have been studying ethnic minority languages, and ethnic minority cadres have also voluntarily organized themselves to study Han Chinese, enhancing mutual understanding and communication, and facilitating the development of work. In order to meet the needs of development, the school is now actively carrying out basic construction. Over the past four years, it has built more than 16,000 square meters of classrooms and dormitories. A grand, national-style auditorium, classrooms, and dormitories are under construction. Over the past four years, it has also purchased more than 80,000 volumes of books in various ethnic languages and some teaching instruments.

    In order to improve the quality of teaching and meet the actual requirements of national economic construction and ethnic work in the Northwest, in September last year, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the school summarized the work of the entire school, focusing on summarizing the teaching work of the past four years. In order to complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the People's Government in the future, it was decided this year to continue to strengthen the study of political theory, ethnic policies, and advanced Soviet teaching experience for all faculty and staff, improve the ideological level of faculty and staff, and prepare to systematically compile teaching materials, improve teaching management, and further improve the quality of teaching.

    西北民族学院四年来有很大发展
    二千五百多名毕业生已先后分发到各民族地区工作
    培养少数民族干部的西北民族学院，四年来有很大发展。已有二千五百七十三名毕业生，先后分发到各少数民族地区及其他地区各部门工作。现在该院学习的有七百八十六名同学，包括蒙古、藏、维吾尔、回、土、东乡、撒拉、保安、裕固、哈萨克、乌兹别克、满、汉等十三个民族。
    西北民族学院根据党和人民政府的政策方针，结合西北地区民族工作的需要，向各族同学进行了比较深入的爱国主义教育，并结合实际进行了必要的业务、文化和科学教育，使各族同学逐渐摆脱反动统治阶级长期实施民族压迫政策所造成的不良影响，增强爱国主义思想，并建立为各族人民服务的观点。四年来，该校在各族同学中，慎重而积极地发展了共产党员六十八人，青年团员三百三十八人。已经毕业的同学，包括各民族的在职干部、农牧民积极分子、爱国知识分子及与人民有联系的民族宗教上层人士。他们回到各民族地区后，在当地党、政领导下，一般都能正确宣传政策，积极工作，促进民族团结；对各民族政治、经济、文化事业的发展，起了一定的推进作用。在校同学，也能团结互助，积极学习；并能随时响应组织号召，参加校外政治运动。
    在教学工作和同学的日常生活管理中，西北民族学院充分重视了各民族的特点，各族同学都能安心地学习和生活。各班系都是通过了各民族的语文进行教学，有的通过翻译，有的直接用民族语文进行教学。学校并编辑了蒙古、藏、维吾尔三族的语文字汇，便利同学们的学习。一九五二年秋至一九五三年，该校给各族同学缝制了蒙古、藏、维吾尔、哈萨克等民族服装一千六百一十七套。全校伙食都按各民族的风俗习惯的不同分灶开伙，并到少数民族地区购买同学们爱吃的牛羊肉、酥油和糌粑。
    四年来，西北民族学院的教职员已经发展到三百零八人，包括十二个民族，其中少数民族的教职员（十一个民族）人数，占教职员总数百分之四十三强。一九五二年，全体教职员曾经遵照上级指示展开了四个月的民族政策学习运动，着重批判了教学管理及行政工作中的大汉族主义思想，提高了全体干部的政策思想水平。另外，汉族干部都分别学习少数民族语文，少数民族干部也自动地组织起来学习汉族语文，增强了互相之间的了解和联系，便利了工作的开展。为适应发展的需要，该校现正积极进行基本建设，四年来共修建了教室、宿舍一万六千多平方公尺，规模宏大的、民族形式的大礼堂和教室、宿舍，正在修建中。四年来还购买了各民族图书八万多册和一部分教学仪器。
    为了提高教学质量，适应祖国经济建设和西北民族工作的实际要求，去年九月，该校在上级党和人民政府的领导下，总结了全校工作，着重总结了四年来的教学工作。为了完成党和人民政府所赋予的今后任务，并决定在今年内，继续加强全体教职员政治理论、民族政策及苏联的先进教学经验的学习，提高教职员的思想水平；并准备系统地编选教材，改进教学管理，进一步提高教学质量。
