Xinhua News Agency, 16th.

The North China region's farmers will produce 14.4 percent more grain and 29 percent more cotton than last year to support the country's industrial construction.

The North China Administrative Committee has, based on the needs of national industrial development, passed the North China region's 1954 agricultural production plan. The plan stipulates that the total grain output should increase by 14.4 percent compared to 1953, and the unit area yield should increase by 14.1 percent compared to 1953; among them, the wheat sown area should be expanded by 17.5 percent compared to 1953, and the unit area yield should increase by 6.7 percent compared to 1953. The cotton planting area should be expanded by 14.4 percent compared to 1953, and the total output should increase by 29 percent compared to 1953. The planting area of various oil crops should be expanded by 48.8 percent compared to 1953.

In the North China region, the biggest threats affecting the increase in crop yields are drought and floods. In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers in the North China region have resolutely fought against natural disasters and have achieved great success, and have gained relatively mature experience in preventing drought, preserving soil moisture, and drought-resistant sowing. However, continuing to fight against water and drought disasters is still an arduous task to ensure increased grain and cotton production in the future. Therefore, the plan emphasizes the development of farmland water conservancy and afforestation. This year, the focus will be on developing small-scale farmland water conservancy, striving to expand the irrigated area by 1.4 million mu, and gradually reduce the threat of drought. To this end, it is required to dig 35,000 wells and promote 51,000 waterwheels. In terms of fighting against floods, in addition to continuing to strengthen flood control, this year a drainage system will be planned in a planned way to reduce waterlogging disasters. After the completion of Hebei Province's 5 million cubic meter drainage project, 3 million mu of land can be spared from water damage. This year, relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, the masses will be widely mobilized to afforest 1.2 million mu and cultivate 30,500 mu of seedlings in order to effectively conserve water and soil, gradually eliminate barren mountains and sandy wastes, regulate climate and rainfall, prevent wind and sand, achieve favorable grain and cotton production, and prepare industrial timber for the country.

The decisive link to ensure the completion of the North China region's 1954 agricultural production plan is to conscientiously implement the country's general line during the transition period and actively and steadily carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This year, it is required that the organized farmers in Hebei Province should develop to account for more than 60 percent of the total number of farmers, and Shanxi Province should develop to account for more than 70 percent of the total number of farmers, and strengthen the work in backward areas.

In terms of technical guidance, this year we must do our best to promote the experience of close planting and full seedlings, careful harvesting and fine threshing, and drought prevention and resistance of crops such as wheat, cotton, and millet, which have been accepted by the majority of farmers, and send more scientific and technical personnel to the countryside to conduct natural regional soil, fertilizer, crop variety, pest control, cultivation, and other investigations and research, so as to improve the farmers' farming technology level on the existing basis.

This year, farmers in the North China region will receive 45,000 new-style walking plows, 30 sets of horse-drawn farm implements, 600,000 tons of fine fertilizer, and 3,300 tons of pesticides from the state. All parts of the North China region will also mobilize farmers to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer and correct the farmers' idea of ​​relying solely on fine fertilizer. In order to effectively prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests, in addition to supplying farmers with the pesticides and agricultural machinery they need through loans and sales, the state will also store a portion of pesticides and agricultural machinery in areas with serious diseases and insect pests, and concentrate on eliminating them when insect pests occur.

In addition, the North China region's 1954 agricultural production plan also stipulates that animal husbandry and aquaculture production should be developed, nine state-owned mechanical farms should be added, and 100,000 mu of land should be reclaimed.

    华北行政委员会通过今年农业生产计划
    进一步增产粮棉支援工业建设
    【新华社十六日讯】华北区农民今年将生产比去年多百分之十四点四的粮食和比去年多百分之二十九的棉花，来支援国家的工业建设。
    华北行政委员会已根据国家发展工业的需要，通过了华北区一九五四年的农业生产计划。计划中规定：粮食总产量要比一九五三年增加百分之十四点四，单位面积产量比一九五三年提高百分之十四点一；其中小麦播种面积要比一九五三年扩大百分之十七点五，单位面积产量比一九五三年提高百分之六点七。棉花种植面积要比一九五三年扩大百分之十四点四，总产量比一九五三年增加百分之二十九。各种油料作物种植面积要比一九五三年扩大百分之四十八点八。
    在华北区，影响农作物产量增加的最大威胁是旱灾和水灾。几年来，华北区广大农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，坚决和自然灾害作斗争，已经取得很大成绩，并在防旱保墒和抗旱播种方面有了比较成熟的经验。但是继续和水、旱灾害作斗争，仍是今后保证粮、棉增产的一项艰巨任务。因此，计划中强调要发展农田水利和植树造林。今年将以发展农田小型水利为重点，争取扩大灌溉面积一百四十万亩，逐步减轻旱灾的威胁。为此，要求打井三万五千眼，推广水车五万一千辆。在和水灾作斗争方面，除继续加强防汛外，今年将有计划地规划排水系统，减轻内涝灾害。河北省五百万公方的排水工程完成后，能免除三百万亩土地因积水成灾。今年将依靠互助合作组织，广泛发动群众，造林一百二十万亩，育苗三万零五百亩，以有效地保持水土，逐渐消灭荒山和沙荒，调节气候和雨量，防避风沙，做到有利粮、棉增产，并为国家准备工业用材。
    保证完成华北区一九五四年农业生产计划的决定环节，是认真贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线，积极稳步地开展互助合作运动。今年要求河北省组织起来的农户发展到占总农户的百分之六十以上，山西省发展到占总农户的百分之七十以上，并加强对落后地区的工作。
    在技术指导方面，今年要全力推广已为广大农民所接受的小麦、棉花、谷子等作物的密植和全苗、精收细打、防旱抗旱经验，并将派出更多的科学技术人员深入农村，进行自然区域性的土壤、肥料、作物品种、病虫害防治、栽培等方面的调查研究，以便在现有基础上把农民的耕作技术水平提高一步。
    今年华北区农民将得到国家供应的新式步犁四万五千件，马拉农具三十套，细肥六十万吨，农药三千三百吨。华北区各地并将发动农民大量积肥，纠正农民单纯依赖细肥的思想。为了有效地防治农作物的病虫害，国家除用贷、卖等方式供应农民所需农药和农械外，并将在病虫害严重地区储蓄一部分农药和农械，遇到虫害发生时，予以集中消灭。
    此外，华北区一九五四年农业生产计划中还规定要发展畜牧、水产生产，增建国营机械农场九处，垦殖土地十万亩。
