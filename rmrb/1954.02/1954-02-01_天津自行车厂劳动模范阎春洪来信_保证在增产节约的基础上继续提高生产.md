To the Editor:

    Our factory had already exceeded its annual production increase and economy plan by the end of December 1953. In the production increase and economy campaign in the fourth quarter of last year, we increased production for the state by 12,702 bicycles that met quality standards, and the cost was also 8.28% lower than the state plan. This achievement is the result of the active labor of all our factory's employees in response to Chairman Mao's call to increase production and practice economy. Our second workshop also overfulfilled the production increase and economy plan. We improved seven sets of punching dies (originally planned for six), which increased productivity by 100% to 200%. The automatic feeding slide was also installed in December and is now in production. The amount of 16 kinds of parts used was shortened (originally planned for nine), saving the country 713 million yuan (originally planned for more than 579 million yuan). We have also established systems such as a person responsible system, a person inspection system, and a machine responsible system, which have played a great role in production. For example, the scrap and rework rate accounted for 2.985% of all products in November, but it dropped to 0.718% in December. No accidents of any size occurred in November and December.

    This year, the state has given our factory a production task that is more than double that of last year. All the employees of our factory have studied the general line of the state during the transition period, and their enthusiasm for work is even greater. Everyone has full confidence in completing this glorious task. The factory had already completed various production preparations for the first quarter of this year at the end of last year, ensuring that production will continue to improve on the basis of increased production and economy. Many workers guarantee that the attendance rate will often reach more than 97%. Our workshop plans to continue to transform 20 sets of old molds in the punching die team this year, improve the degree of automation of equipment, and contribute greater strength to the country's industrialization.

    We were very excited to read the reply from our fellow workers at the Shanghai Bicycle Factory (see page 2 of this newspaper on December 26, 1953). Let us continue to work together and strive for the construction of socialism.

    天津自行车厂劳动模范阎春洪来信
    保证在增产节约的基础上继续提高生产
    编辑同志：
    我厂在一九五三年十二月底已超额完成了全年增产节约计划。在去年第四季度的增产节约运动中，我们为国家增产了一万二千七百零二辆合乎质量规格的自行车，而且成本也比国家计划降低了百分之八点二八。这个成绩，是我们全厂职工响应毛主席增产节约号召而积极劳动的结果。我们第二车间也超额完成了增产节约计划，我们改进了七件冲模（原计划六件），使生产率提高百分之一百到二百；自动送料的滑道也在十二月份内安装起来，现在已经投入生产。十六种零件（原计划是九件）的占用量缩短了，给国家节约了七亿一千三百万元
  （原计划五亿七千九百多万）。我们还建立了专人负责制、专人检查制、机器负责制等制度，对生产起了很大作用；如报废退修率在十一月份占全部产品的百分之二点九八五，十二月份就降低到百分之零点七一八；十一、十二两月没有发生任何大小事故。
    今年，国家给予我厂的生产任务比去年增加了一倍多。我们全厂职工学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，干活的劲头更足了，大家有充分信心来完成这个光荣的任务。厂里在去年年底已经作好了今年第一季度的各项生产准备工作，保证在增产节约成绩的基础上继续提高生产。很多工人保证出勤率经常达到百分之九十七以上。我们车间准备在今年内把冲模班的旧模具继续改造二十套，提高设备自动化的程度，在国家工业化的事业中献出更大的力量。
    我们读到了上海自行车厂职工兄弟给我们的回信（见一九五三年十二月二十六日本报二版），使我们兴奋万分。让我们继续共同努力，为建设社会主义而奋斗。
    天津自行车厂第二车间副主任
    天津市特等劳动模范  阎春洪
