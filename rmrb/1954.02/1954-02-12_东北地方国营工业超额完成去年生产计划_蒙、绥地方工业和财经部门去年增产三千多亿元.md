Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 10th: Northeast China's local state-owned industries overfulfilled the 1953 production plan and increased production by products worth 760 billion yuan. Throughout the year, they accumulated 1.6 trillion yuan in wealth for the country.

Through the increased production and conservation campaign carried out last year by local state-owned industries in the Northeast region, the quality of many products, such as red bricks, agricultural tools, office paper, enamel products, knitwear, rubber shoes, fountain pens, toothpaste, and soap, has been significantly improved. Local industrial management departments in various regions, due to their mastery of the principle of using local materials and diversifying products, have increased the number of products from 866 in 1952 to 931, and have trial-produced more than 150 new products. Among these new products are diesel engines, air compressors, drilling machines, 40-ton crankshaft presses, Soviet-style woodworking circular saws, cement mixers, cement asbestos boards, and particle boards for basic construction needs; sowing machines, carts, and steel plates for agricultural production needs; and sewing machines, newsprint, pianos, accordions, violins, enamel kettles, printed socks, children's shoes, and women's shoes for the needs of the people's lives.

In 1953, local industries in various parts of Northeast China paid attention to strengthening technical management, and, focusing on improving product quality, unified and promoted operating procedures, thereby greatly improving product quality and increasing labor productivity. In 1953, local industries in various parts of Northeast China also vigorously promoted the method of rational use of materials and the utilization of waste materials, so that the consumption of product materials was reduced and costs were lowered. For example, the cost of knitwear in 1953 was reduced by 10.6% compared to 1952; enamel basins were reduced by 9.19%; rubber shoes were reduced by 17.5%; and small hardware was reduced by 9.2%.

Xinhua News Agency: As of mid-January, industrial and financial departments in Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan regions had turned over 328.5 billion yuan of increased production and savings from last year to the state, exceeding the original planned increase in production and savings by 33.7%. The vast number of workers and staff in the above-mentioned areas have continued to launch labor emulation drives in conjunction with the study of the general line, striving to create more wealth to support national construction.

The increased production and conservation campaign launched by industrial and financial departments in Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan regions in the second half of last year played a significant role in promoting the completion and overfulfillment of state plans by various units. In the competition, the vast number of workers and staff in local state-owned factories and mines and basic construction sites grasped links such as planning management, technical management, and the promotion of advanced experience, which improved the quality of products and projects and reduced costs. Employees of one unit put forward 338 rationalization proposals, 243 of which were adopted, with a value of 3.57 billion yuan. After the launch of the competition by various state-owned commercial departments, not only were most of the purchase and sales plans completed, but also significant achievements were made in saving circulation expenses. For example, the transfer group of the Guisui Supply and Wholesale Station of the China Department Store Company organized direct transportation, shortening the cargo transfer time from three to four days in the past to one day, and it is estimated that transportation costs alone can be saved by an average of 378,000 yuan per day. In addition, all administrative units have conscientiously reduced business expenses and administrative management expenses that could be handled or not handled, greatly reducing expenditures.

    东北地方国营工业超额完成去年生产计划
    蒙、绥地方工业和财经部门去年增产三千多亿元
   【新华社沈阳十日电】东北区地方国营工业超额完成了一九五三年的生产计划，并增产了价值七千六百亿元的产品。全年为国家积累了一万六千亿元的财富。
    东北区地方国营工业经过去年开展的增产节约竞赛，许多产品如红砖、农具、办公纸、搪瓷制品、针织品、胶鞋、金笔、牙膏和香皂等产品的质量都有了显著提高。各地的地方工业管理部门，由于掌握了就地取材和产品多样化的方针，产品已由一九五二年的八百六十六种增加到九百三十一种，并试制了一百五十多种新产品。这些新产品中，有供应基本建设需要的柴油机、空气压缩机、钻探机、四十吨曲轴压力机、苏式木工圆锯、水泥搅拌机、水泥石绵板、刨花板等；有供应农业生产需要的播种机、大车、钢板等；有供应人民生活需要的缝纫机、新闻纸、钢琴、手风琴、提琴、搪瓷水壶、印花袜、小孩鞋和妇女鞋等。
    一九五三年，东北各地地方工业注意加强了技术管理工作，并以提高产品质量为中心，统一和推广了操作规程，因而大大改进了产品质量，提高了劳动生产率。一九五三年，东北各地地方工业还大力提倡合理用材和利用废材的办法，使产品用料的损耗减少，成本降低。如针织品一九五三年的成本比一九五二年降低百分之十点六；搪瓷面盆降低百分之九点一九；胶鞋降低百分之十七点五；小五金降低了百分之九点二。
   【新华社讯】至一月中旬，内蒙古、绥远地区工业、财经等部门已把去年增产节约的三千二百八十五亿元上缴国家，此数超过去年原订增产节约计划百分之三十三点七。上述地区的广大职工已结合总路线的学习，继续展开劳动竞赛，争取创造更多的财富支援国家建设。
    蒙、绥地区的工业和财经等部门去年下半年开展的增产节约竞赛，对各单位完成和超额完成国家计划起了很大的推动作用。地方国营厂矿和基本建设工地的广大职工，在竞赛中抓住计划管理、技术管理、推广先进经验等环节，提高了产品和工程的质量，减低了成本。某单位职工提出了三百三十八件合理化建议，被采用了二百四十三件，价值达三十五亿七千万元。各国营商业部门开展竞赛后，不但大部完成了购销计划，并在节约流转费用上做出显著成绩。如中国百货公司归绥供应批发站调拨组组织直线运输，货物调拨时间由过去的三至四天缩短为一天，仅运费一项估计平均每天即可节省三十七万八千元。此外，各行政单位都认真削减了可办可不办的事业费和行政管理费用，大大缩减了支出。
