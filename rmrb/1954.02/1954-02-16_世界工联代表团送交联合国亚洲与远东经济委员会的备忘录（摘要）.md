Xinhua News Agency, Kandy, February 14th: The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, attending the Tenth Session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, submitted a memorandum to the Secretariat of the Commission.

The memorandum first pointed out: The World Federation of Trade Unions has always advocated maintaining world peace, developing national economies, improving the living standards of working people, and promoting social progress and prosperity. At the Commission's previous session, the World Federation of Trade Unions pointed out two different economic development situations in the region, as well as the fundamental reasons for these two situations. The facts of the past year have proven that the World Federation of Trade Unions' analysis at that time was correct.

The memorandum listed facts and figures to illustrate that: In the Soviet Asian republics, the People's Republic of China, the Mongolian People's Republic, and other countries in the region, which have consistently adhered to a peaceful policy and independently developed their economies, both industry and agriculture have achieved great development. The memorandum continued: These countries and peoples are developing international economic and trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and are carrying out friendly cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance between countries. In particular, the Soviet Union has provided selfless assistance to the people's democratic countries.

The memorandum then pointed out that: the economies of some countries in Asia and the Far East are showing a bleak picture. Foreign monopoly capital controls the economies of these countries, hinders the normal development of their industry and agriculture, and forces some countries to implement a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, militarizing the national economy, thus their economies are damaged, and the people are increasingly impoverished.

The memorandum stated: Japan is a typical example. After listing specific examples, the memorandum said: The militarization of Japan not only affects the lives of the Japanese people, but also threatens the peace and security of Asia and the world.

The memorandum also stated: Southeast Asia has also encountered serious difficulties in recent years. The national industry and commerce of these countries have been reduced or bankrupt, unemployment has increased sharply, and the lives of the working people have become even more difficult.

The reason for these unsatisfactory situations is mainly that certain monopoly capital, on the one hand, deliberately lowers the prices of raw materials in the international market, and on the other hand, uses various threats and inducements to prevent Southeast Asian countries from selling them to other countries at higher prices, while at the same time failing to correspondingly reduce the prices of industrial products exported to these countries.

The memorandum then exposed the truth about the so-called "aid" from the United States to the economic development of the region with facts. The memorandum pointed out: This kind of "aid" has increased the difficulties of some countries receiving "aid." These policies cannot but arouse the public anger and opposition of the people of Asia and the Far East. The memorandum introduced the welcome of the Soviet-Indian trade agreement by Indian public opinion.

The memorandum stated: The people of Asia love peace and hope to build their own countries in a peaceful environment, carry out equal international trade, and improve people's lives. The efforts of the Chinese and Korean people and the kind people of the world have contributed to the realization of the Korean armistice. This has enabled many countries, especially countries in the region, to develop and strengthen trade relations between countries. In these countries, not only the working class but also many important figures in the political and business circles and public opinion circles unanimously demand to develop normal trade without obstruction, and advocate abolishing "embargoes" and breaking blockades. For example, the Japanese House of Representatives passed a resolution requesting the expansion of trade with China. In 1953, the new China signed a trade agreement with the economic delegation of the Indonesian government based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit; the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade also signed a trade agreement with the delegation of the Japanese "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade." The well-known China-Sri Lanka trade agreement was also extended for two years last September with the agreement of both parties.

The memorandum finally suggested that the current session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East adopt the following resolution:

"The Tenth Session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has studied the economic situation of countries in Asia and the Far East, and believes that the main reasons for the lack of development of industry and agriculture and the poverty of the people in these countries are the control of foreign monopoly capital and the impact of the policy of arms expansion and war preparation.

In view of the people's desire for peace, economic development, and improved living standards, it is hereby recommended that the governments of Asian and Far Eastern countries: oppose the policy of war preparation, demand an end to the ongoing wars, and use all resources for peaceful construction; ensure the independent development of national economies without foreign obstruction, protect and develop national industries; demand the lifting of blockades and embargoes, and carry out normal trade between countries; take effective measures to improve the lives of working people, provide unemployment relief, implement and expand social insurance, and effectively protect the freedom of the people and trade unions."

    世界工联代表团送交联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会的备忘录（摘要）
    【新华社十四日讯】康提消息：列席联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第十届会议的世界工会联合会代表团，以备忘录一件提交委员会秘书处。
    备忘录首先指出：世界工会联合会一向主张维护世界和平、发展国民经济、提高劳动人民生活、促进社会进步与繁荣。在委员会的上届会议上，世界工会联合会曾经指出本地区两种不同的经济发展情况，以及产生这两种情况的根本原因。一年来的事实证明，世界工会联合会当时的分析是正确的。
    备忘录列举了事实和数字说明：在本地区的苏联亚洲各共和国、中华人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国等国家，一贯坚持和平政策，独立自主地发展自己的经济，因而工农业都获得极大发展。备忘录接着说：这些国家与人民都在平等互利的基础上发展国际间的经济贸易关系，展开各国之间的友好合作和兄弟般的互助。特别是苏联对人民民主国家给了无私援助。
    备忘录接着指出：亚洲及远东地区还有一些国家的经济呈现出黯淡的景象。外国垄断资本控制了这些国家的经济，阻碍着它们的工农业的正常发展，强使某些国家实行扩军备战政策，使国民经济军事化，因而它们的经济遭到破坏，人民日益贫困。
    备忘录说：日本就是一个典型的例证。在列举具体的事例后，备忘录说：日本的军国主义化不仅影响日本人民的生活，而且还威胁着亚洲与世界的和平与安全。
    备忘录又说：东南亚近年来也遭到严重困难。这些国家的民族工商业纷纷缩减或破产，失业剧增，劳动人民的生活更形困难。
    这些不能令人满意的情况之所以产生，主要是若干垄断资本一方面肆意压低国际市场上的原料价格，另一方面又用各种威胁利诱的办法，阻止东南亚国家按较高的价格把它们卖给别的国家，同时又不相应降低输出到这些国家去的工业品价格。
    备忘录接着以事实揭露了美国所谓“援助”本地区经济发展的真相。备忘录指出：这类“援助”增加了一些接受“援助”国家的困难。这些政策不能不引起亚洲与远东人民的公愤与反对。备忘录介绍了苏联——印度贸易协定受到印度舆论欢迎的情况。
    备忘录说：亚洲人民是热爱和平的，希望在和平的环境中建设自己的国家，进行平等的国际贸易，改善人民生活。中国和朝鲜人民与全世界善良人民的努力促成了朝鲜停战的实现。这使许多国家特别是本区域的国家能够发展和加强各国间的贸易关系。在这些国家内，不仅工人阶级而且政界商界的许多重要人士和舆论界也一致要求展开正常贸易而不受阻碍，主张废除“禁运”，打破封锁。例如日本众议院就通过决议要求扩大对中国的贸易。新中国在一九五三年就本着平等互利的原则和印尼政府经济代表团签订了贸易协定；中国国际贸易促进委员会也和日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团签订了贸易协定。众所周知的中锡贸易协定，也于去年九月经双方同意延长了两年。
    备忘录最后建议亚洲与远东经济委员会本届会议通过如下的决议：
    “亚洲与远东经济委员会第十届会议研究了亚洲及远东各国经济情况，认为这些国家工农业不发展和人民生活贫困的主要原因是外国垄断资本的控制和扩军备战政策的影响。
    鉴于各国人民要求和平、发展经济和改善生活的愿望，兹建议亚洲及远东各国政府：反对备战政策，要求结束正在进行的战争，把一切资源用于和平建设；保障各国国民经济独立发展而不受外国的阻挠，保护与发展民族工业；要求取消封锁禁运，展开各国之间的正常贸易；采取有效措施改善劳动人民的生活，救济失业，实行与扩大社会保险，并切实保障人民和工会各项自由权利。”
