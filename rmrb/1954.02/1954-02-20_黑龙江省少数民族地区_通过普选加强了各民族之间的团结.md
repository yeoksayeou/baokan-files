In counties of Heilongjiang Province with larger ethnic minority populations, unity among all ethnic groups has been further strengthened through universal suffrage, building on the foundation of correct implementation of ethnic policies in the past. The basic-level election work in these counties was carried out in accordance with the spirit stipulated in Chapter IV of the Electoral Law, "Elections of Various Ethnic Minorities," and the Party's ethnic policies, based on the characteristics of multi-ethnic areas. First, the specific provisions of the Electoral Law concerning ethnic minority elections were widely publicized in ethnic forms. Nineteen banners and counties, including Durbert Banner, Tieli, Fuyu, Guoerluosi Banner, and Suiling, were equipped with ethnic minority election cadres to conduct propaganda to their own ethnic people in their own languages. For example, when Bayinhua Village (a Mongolian-inhabited village) in Durbert Banner conducted universal suffrage, Mongolian cadres sent by the county conducted propaganda in Mongolian. Suiling County transferred five Korean cadres to participate in the election work of Korean autonomous villages. When Fuyu County conducted population surveys in the Wujiazi Kirgiz Autonomous Village and Dengke Daur Autonomous Village, the county sent cadres of the respective ethnic groups to work in their own languages. Guoerluosi Banner transferred thirty-four Mongolian cadres to participate in the election work at the beginning of the basic-level elections. Voter certificates for ethnic minority voters with their own written languages were filled out in their own languages, and in some areas, voter lists were also published in both Han and ethnic minority languages. The basic-level election work in these counties was welcomed by all ethnic groups because it grasped the characteristics of the ethnic groups, paid attention to ethnic forms, used the languages of the ethnic groups, and respected the customs and habits of the ethnic minorities in every way. All ethnic groups enthusiastically participated in the universal suffrage activities, and through the universal suffrage, they raised their political awareness and further enhanced their enthusiasm for production. For example, after Wujiazi Village in Fuyu County implemented universal suffrage, the masses generally reflected: The Communist Party cares too much about our Kirgiz people, we must do a good job in production and support national construction. The enthusiasm of the masses in the whole village for production has been greatly improved, and an agricultural production cooperative has been established.

The basic-level elections in these counties also truly guaranteed the equal political rights of all ethnic groups. The number of representatives was allocated according to the population ratio of each ethnic group, and ethnic groups with smaller populations were also taken care of, so that each ethnic group had a number of representatives commensurate with its status in the organs of state power. For example, seventeen people's representatives were elected in Jisibao Village, Fuyu County, including six Han people, nine Daur people, one Mongolian person, and one Manchu person. In the first street of Da'an County, ethnic minorities accounted for 15.1 percent of the total population, and the number of ethnic minority representatives elected accounted for 18.7 percent of the total number of representatives.

Through the basic-level elections, some problems that originally existed between and within ethnic groups that needed to be resolved and could be resolved were appropriately resolved under the principles of mutual respect, mutual understanding, and full consultation among all ethnic groups. For example, the first street of Da'an County is a mixed residential area of Hui, Han, and Manchu ethnic groups. Due to different customs and habits, disputes had occurred among the ethnic groups. During the universal suffrage, the working group held a forum for representatives of the Han, Hui, and Manchu ethnic groups. At the meeting, the people of all ethnic groups made self-criticisms and expressed that they would strengthen unity and respect each other in the future. Another example is Laomo Village in the seventh district of Qing'an County, which is a mixed residential village of Korean and Han ethnic groups. In the past, the Korean and Han ethnic groups each had a set of village cadres, and the cadres of each ethnic group managed the affairs of their own ethnic group. In this universal suffrage, people's representatives were elected in proportion to the population of each ethnic group. At the People's Congress, eleven members of the village people's government were elected, including five Koreans and six Han people, and it was decided that work should be arranged in a unified manner and actions should be unified in the future, and various systems were also established. At the same time, some past problems of disunity between ethnic groups were resolved. In the past, Korean schools were relatively complete, and Han schools were very dilapidated. This time, a joint repair method was also proposed. The relationship between the Korean and Han ethnic groups in this village is closer. The Han ethnic group accounts for 28 percent of the total population of Haotiangele Village in the sixth district of Durbert Banner. In the past, there were no Han cadres, and two Han cadres were also elected in this universal suffrage.

In addition, eleven counties (banners), including Guoerluosi Banner, Durbert Banner, Fuyu, Longjiang, Suihua, Kaitong, and Nenjiang, will establish nineteen village-level ethnic regional autonomous governments on the basis of basic-level elections.

    黑龙江省少数民族地区
    通过普选加强了各民族之间的团结
    黑龙江省少数民族较多的县份，在过去正确地贯彻民族政策的基础上，经过普选，更加强了各族人民之间的团结。这些县份的基层选举工作都是根据多民族地区的特点，遵循着选举法第四章“各少数民族的选举”中所规定的精神与党的民族政策进行的。首先是通过民族形式广泛地宣传了选举法中有关少数民族选举的各项具体规定。杜尔伯特旗、铁骊、富裕、郭后旗、绥棱等十九个旗县都配备了少数民族的普选干部，用本民族语言向本民族人民进行宣传。如杜尔伯特旗巴音花屯（蒙族聚居屯）进行普选时，由县里派去蒙古族干部用蒙古语进行宣传。绥棱县抽调了朝鲜族干部五人，参加朝鲜族自治村的普选工作。富裕县五家子吉尔吉斯族自治村及登科达呼尔族自治村在进行人口调查工作时，县里都派了各该民族的干部用本民族语言文字进行工作。郭后旗在基层选举开始时即抽调了三十四名蒙族干部参加普选工作。有本民族文字的各少数民族选民证均用本民族文字填写，有的地区的选民榜也用汉族与少数民族的两种文字公布。这些县份的基层选举工作，由于掌握了民族特点，注意了民族形式和使用了各民族的语言文字，并处处尊重少数民族的风俗习惯，所以受到各族人民的欢迎。各族人民都热烈地参加了普选活动，并且经过普选提高了政治觉悟，进一步发挥了生产积极性。如富裕县五家子村实行普选后，群众普遍反映：共产党对我们吉尔吉斯族太关心了，一定要搞好生产，支援国家建设。全村群众生产热情大为提高，并已成立了一个农业生产合作社。
    这些县份的基层选举也确切地保障了各民族平等的政治权利。代表名额根据各民族人口比例分配，并照顾了人口较少的民族，使各个民族在政权机关中都有与其地位相称的代表名额。如富裕县吉斯宝村共选出人民代表十七名，其中有汉族六人，达呼尔族九人，蒙族一人，满族一人。大赉县城区一街少数民族占总人口百分之十五点一，选出的少数民族代表人数，占代表总数的百分之十八点七。
    经过基层选举，原来存在于民族之间和民族内部的某些需要解决而又可能解决的问题，在各族人民互相尊重，互相谅解与充分协商的原则下获得了适当的解决。如大赉县城区一街是回、汉、满各族杂居区，各族因风俗习惯不同，曾发生过纠纷。在普选中，工作组召开了汉、回、满三个民族代表的座谈会，在会上各族人民作了检讨，并表示今后一定加强团结，互相尊重。又如庆安县七区劳模村是朝鲜族和汉族杂居村，过去朝鲜族和汉族各有一套村干部，各族干部管各族的事。这次普选中，根据各族人口比例产生相适应的人民代表，在人民代表大会上选出村人民政府委员十一名，其中有五名是朝鲜族，六名是汉族，并决定今后要统一布置工作，统一行动，还建立了各种制度；同时解决了过去民族间某些不团结的问题。过去朝鲜族学校比较完整，汉族学校很破旧，这次也提出了共同修理的办法。这个村的朝鲜族和汉族的关系更密切了。杜尔伯特旗六区好田格勒村汉族占全村人口百分之二十八，过去没有汉族干部，这次普选也选上了两名。
    此外，郭后旗、杜尔伯特旗、富裕、龙江、绥化、开通、嫩江等十一个县（旗）将在基层选举的基础上建立十九个村级的民族区域自治政权。
