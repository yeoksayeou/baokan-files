Anshan Iron and Steel's Seamless Steel Tube Plant and Large Rolling Mill have produced a large number of high-quality seamless steel tubes, heavy steel rails, and various steel products to support production and construction across the country. Since production began, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant has undertaken the task of supporting the entire nation. From December of last year to January 13th of this year, more than fifty units nationwide have signed ordering contracts with the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, including more than thirty regions such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Xi'an. The seamless steel tubes already shipped to various locations are all high-quality, first-class products, including general seamless steel tubes for water pipes, oil pipelines, and various mechanical parts, various boiler tubes for trains, ships, and steam pipes, and geological drilling pipes with extremely strict quality requirements. These domestically produced seamless steel tubes are warmly welcomed by the people everywhere. When workers in Shanghai received the first batch of seamless steel tubes produced by the motherland, the employees were overjoyed, and everyone happily said, "Last year we supported the construction of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and this year the Seamless Steel Tube Plant is supporting us." The Shanghai State-owned Boiler Factory used to have to order from abroad when making boilers because China did not produce seamless steel tubes. Sometimes, work would be suspended due to delayed supply, or other materials would be used instead. When the seamless steel tubes from Anshan Iron and Steel arrived, the employees all said, "These are seamless steel tubes made by the people of our steel capital. They are cheap and of good quality. We must produce better boilers to supply the needs of various places." When miners received a large batch of geological drilling pipes and oil pipelines sent from Anshan Iron and Steel, they excitedly said, "With the seamless steel tubes produced by the motherland, we comrades working in the mines must work harder to extract more underground treasures for the country."

To better fulfill the responsibility of supporting the whole country, the employees of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant launched a heated production competition, which improved the quality of seamless steel tubes—the proportion of first-class products increased from 90 percent last year to more than 97 percent now, exceeding the national plan by more than 12 percent.

Since the Large Rolling Mill started production, it has rolled out a large batch of high-quality tube blanks and heavy steel rails for the country. At 6:00 PM on January 14th, the first batch of heavy steel rails was shipped out of the factory to support national construction. From the beginning of production, all employees of the Large Rolling Mill have attached great importance to product quality. Since the New Year, the quality of tube blanks and heavy rails rolled by the factory has exceeded the quality indicators for 1954. All employees guarantee that in addition to producing various high-quality steel products needed for national construction, they will also produce better heavy rails and continuously transport them out of the factory to support the development of the transportation industry and strive for the early realization of socialist industrialization in the motherland.

    鞍钢无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂
    生产大批优质产品支援国家建设
    鞍钢无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂已经生产出大批品质优良的无缝钢管、重型钢轨和各种钢材，支援全国各地生产建设。无缝钢管厂从开始生产以来，便担负起支援全国的任务。从去年十二月到今年一月十三日止，全国各地和无缝钢管厂签订订货合同的已有五十多个单位，包括上海、天津、青岛、武汉、广州、西安等三十多个地区。已运送各地的无缝钢管，都是质量优良的一级品，其中有作水管、输油管和各种机械零件等用的一般无缝钢管，有作火车、轮船、蒸汽管用的各种锅炉管，有质量要求极为严格的地质钻探管。这些我国国产的无缝钢管，在各地都受到人民热烈的欢迎。当上海工人接到祖国出品的第一批无缝钢管时，职工们都欢欣鼓舞，大家高兴地说：“去年我们支援无缝钢管厂的建设，今年无缝钢管厂便来支援我们了。”上海国营锅炉厂，过去因为我国不出无缝钢管，制作锅炉时只好向国外订货，有时由于供应不及时而停工待料，或用其他材料代替。当鞍钢无缝钢管运去以后，职工们都说：“这是我们钢都人民制造的无缝钢管，价格便宜、质量很好，我们一定要更好的生产锅炉供应各地需要。”当矿山工人接到鞍钢运去的大批地质钻探管和石油输送管时，兴奋地说：“用了祖国出产的无缝钢管，我们在矿山工作的同志更要加紧工作，为国家开采出更多的地下宝藏。”
    无缝钢管厂职工，为了更好地担负起支援全国的责任，展开了热烈的生产竞赛，使无缝钢管质量——一级品由去年百分之九十，提高到现在的百分之九十七以上，超过了国家计划百分之十二强。
    大型轧钢厂自开工生产以来，已经给国家轧出大批优质的管坯和重型钢轨。一月十四日下午六点钟，第一批重型钢轨已运送出厂，支援国家建设。大型轧钢厂一开始生产，全体职工就重视了产品的质量。新年以来，该厂所轧出的管坯和重轨的质量都超过了一九五四年的质量指标。全体职工保证，除生产出国家建设需要的各种优质钢材，还要生产出更好的重轨，源源不断地输送出厂，支援交通运输事业的发展，争取祖国早日实现社会主义工业化。
