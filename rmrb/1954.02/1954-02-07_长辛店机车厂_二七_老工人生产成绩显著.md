    Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike of 1923 have continued to display their spirit of hard work and struggle after liberation, creating brilliant achievements on the motherland's production front. In recent years, eleven "February 7th" veteran workers from the entire factory have been selected as labor models, some have become administrative directors, and others have served as technicians and engineers. He Fengting, the deputy director of the lumber yard, is a Communist Party member with thirty-six years of service. Last January, under circumstances where production preparations were insufficient, he led the entire yard to overfulfill its task, exceeding the annual target by eight hundred cubic meters of finished lumber. He has a low level of education and often encounters difficulties in his work, but he never loses heart. He always carefully studies problems and inspects work on-site, actively seeking help from leaders and the masses to solve difficulties together. He often advises other workers to be meticulous in their calculations, taking materials according to requirements to save wood. Under his influence, everyone uses bark to create small materials, reducing the consumption of each piece of wood from six or seven millimeters to four millimeters, accumulating several tens of thousands of yuan for the country in this aspect alone.
    Zhang Jingxian, a lathe worker in the machine shop, is also an excellent Communist Party member. Because of his enthusiasm for training apprentices, he was once rated as a model master in Beijing factories and mines. He treats apprentices as kindly as his own children. No matter what he teaches, he always explains it until the apprentice understands. When apprentices practice, he also carefully watches them. If there is anything wrong, he corrects it immediately. The apprentices he has trained almost all have higher skills, and some have already passed the exam to become planing machine operators ahead of schedule.
    Liu Bingbo, a riveter in the freight car shop, is sixty-eight years old this year. The leadership takes care of his health and wants him to do some light work, but he disagrees. He says:
  "Don't look at me being old, but I'm not weaker than young lads at work!" He actively participates in repairing cars sent back from Korea. Encouraged by him, the workers worked with even greater labor enthusiasm, accelerating the work and completing the task ahead of schedule, winning the Ministry of Railways' national railway factory victory red flag.
    The "February 7th" veteran workers all treat every job with a high degree of ownership and strict demands on themselves. Therefore, in the Changxindian Railway Factory, the "February 7th" veteran workers are respected by the workers, and the staff are immensely proud to have these veteran workers.

    长辛店机车厂“二七”老工人生产成绩显著
   【本报讯】长辛店机车车辆修理工厂参加过一九二三年“二七”大罢工的老工人，解放后继续发挥艰苦奋斗的精神，在祖国生产战线上创造了辉煌的成绩。几年来，全厂“二七”老工人有十一个被选为劳动模范，有的当了行政主任，有的担任了技师、技术员。制材场副主任何凤亭，是一位有三十六年工龄的共产党员。去年一月，他在生产准备工作不够的情形下领导全场超额完成了任务，全年超额完成了八百方净木。他文化低，工作上时时遇到困难，但他从不灰心，他总是细心在现场各处研究问题、检查工作，积极争取领导和群众帮助他共同解决困难。他经常劝其他工人精打细算，按料取材节省木材。在他的影响下，大伙就利用板皮拉小料，将每块木材消耗量，从六、七个公厘减少到四个公厘，单在这一方面就为国家积累了好几千万元。
    机械场车床工张景贤，也是一位优秀的共产党员。因为他热心培养学徒，曾经被评为北京市厂矿模范师傅。他对学徒像对自己孩子一般亲，不论教什么，总是不嫌麻烦地讲到学徒懂了才罢休。学徒练习时，他也在旁边细看，有一点不对，就马上纠正。由他教育出来的学徒，差不多都有较高的技术，有的已经提前考上了刨床工。
    货车场铆工刘炳波，今年六十八岁，领导上照顾他的身体，要他干些轻活，他不同意，他说：
  “别看我老，干活可不比小伙子软！”他积极参加修理从朝鲜送回来的车。在他的鼓舞下，工人们都以更大的劳动热忱，加速地工作，提前完成任务，获得了铁道部全国铁路工厂优胜大红旗。
    “二七”老工人都是以高度的主人翁态度，严格要求自己对待每一件工作的。因此，在长辛店铁路工厂里，“二七”老工人受到了工人们的尊敬，职工们都以有这些老工人感到莫大的骄傲。
