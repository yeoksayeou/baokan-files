Editor's Note: In order to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet newspapers during the period of socialist industrialization, this newspaper will translate and publish a portion of the essays from the "Collection of Bolshevik Newspapers". In addition to Comrade Molotov's report at the 1925 Newspaper Workers Conference published today, there will be abstracts of two reports by Comrade Molotov at the Central and Local Newspaper Editors Conference in 1927 and the All-Soviet Editors Conference in 1928: "The Press and the Current Economic Movement" and "The Present Period and the Press". In addition, there will be a speech by Comrade Kuibyshev at the 1931 Correspondence Society Conference: "Struggle to Implement the Party's General Line and Oppose All Deviations and Distortions." These reports and speeches are very enlightening for us to clearly understand the basic tasks of the newspaper during the transition period, and how the newspaper can fight for the realization of the country's socialist industrialization and the implementation of the Party's general line.

    Industrial Upsurge—Development of Basic Socialist
        Forces
    We are witnessing the general development and consolidation of the forces of the first Soviet state. The development, upsurge, and consolidation of the proletarian republic are the most prominent features of the current period, or at least one of the most prominent. This development of strength is becoming increasingly evident and powerful; at the same time, all of us, led by the working class and together with the broad masses of peasants, are increasingly being drawn into this development process. What is particularly important now is that we can see, feel, and perceive these achievements—the initial achievements and the beginning of a strong upsurge of the proletarian socialist state. If we see a real upsurge in our country's industry—as we can now boldly say—then this is the development and upsurge of the basic socialist economic forces. If we see more developed collectivization in our rural areas, and see an increasing number of peasant masses participating in the work of cooperatives, then we can be sure that this lays the foundation for the vigorous development of socialist factors in the countryside. If we talk about the restoration and continuous growth of the basic cadres of the proletariat, and at the same time acknowledge the development of the cultural level and organization of the masses, and this development is manifested in all aspects; then this is first and foremost the development of the workers' state, the development of the organization and new Soviet life of the masses of this state, and in the final analysis, in our situation, the real development of various components of the socialist state.
    At the same time, if we know how the ideological and political forces of our country are developing, especially taking the press as a basic reflection of ideological and political work and the overall ideological development, we can also affirm the significant and undeniable achievements in ideological and political work, which is of particularly great significance. Because the development of the ideological and political activism of the workers and peasants under the leadership of the increasingly consolidated Communist Party, it will fundamentally lead socialist construction to a consolidated stage.
    Simultaneous with the overall development of our country's strength, the strength of the Party, the proletarian party, the Communist Party itself has also developed and consolidated. The Party is precisely leading the development of this force, performing, and correctly performing, the role of the true leader of the proletarian state, the leader of all practical work of the Soviet state and its ideological and political development.
      The Role of the Press
    In all the work of the Party, the role of the press is particularly important. The press is the most active participant in all practical work and the main expression of the development of our ideological forces. The press directly undertakes the work of organizing the masses and conducting ideological education of the masses. Our press has participated in the development of this cause. In addition, it directly educates the tens of thousands, and now hundreds of thousands, of active workers and peasants in the press—a strong contingent of worker and peasant correspondents from the people. The press not only organizes the masses around itself, but also organizes them in the most different and broadest practical work of the Soviets, trade unions, cooperatives, and the increasingly important cultural and political construction. At the same time, the press is and should increasingly be one of the main disseminators of socialist ideology and Leninism among the masses and in all the work of the masses.
      The Organizational Role of the Press
    The press plays a most important role in attracting new forces of workers and peasants to the cause of all construction departments. The very important organizational role of the press, as is well known, was clearly pointed out by Lenin at that time. Now, this role of the press is even more increasing. Our press is the most important assistant in cultivating leading cadres for all Soviet construction departments and in conducting ideological education for them. In addition, the press also makes countless worker and peasant correspondents become leading backbones; the significance of this matter, whether from the aspect of the Party leading the masses, from the aspect of reflecting the interests and aspirations of the masses, or for the press or all organizations, is becoming increasingly significant.
    In short, the development and active nature of mass organizational work, making an increasing number of workers and peasants participate in various organizational forms, is the direction of our basic and practical organizational tasks. At present, the practical work of the proletarian state will be carried out on this basis, and the leadership of the proletariat over the masses—embodied in the leadership of the Communist Party over the masses—will also be consolidated on this basis.
    But, comrades, we also have an ideological and political task before us. Its significance is increasing with each further achievement and development of our economic and cultural strength in the future, and correctly solving the ideological and political tasks has always been a major task for our Party. We have ideological principles for solving this problem, which are based on scientific principles and tested by the actual struggle of the proletarian revolution. Marxism and Leninism are the principles on which we base our conclusions on all work. Leninism is the developed Marxism of the era of imperialism and the beginning of the proletarian revolution. The principles of Leninism that guide all our practice, and the ideas of Leninism that guide all our practical work, are and must be our starting point.
    The press should have a great sense of responsibility and obligation to defend the true principles of Leninism. The press should truly become the disseminator of Leninist ideology among the broad masses. Newspaper workers should be good at seeing the essence of the problem from between the lines under the best titles of books and articles related to Leninism, and be good at correctly explaining Lenin's ideas. Unfortunately, we cannot yet say that all our official newspapers and newspaper workers have fully understood the most important responsibility they bear to the Party in eliminating distortions of Leninism. Our press and its leaders must pay more attention to this top priority task in the future. Of course, there are already really good books on Leninism, but it is important that we should take all measures to disseminate Lenin's works as widely as possible among the masses. Moreover, the task of the press in clarifying Leninist ideology has not only not been alleviated, but on the contrary, the Party should remind everyone again and again of this basic task of the press, and correct all shortcomings and errors in this regard.
    The Danger of Distorting Our Party's Policies
    In addition, we should correctly assess the new conditions formed by the international and domestic situation. We should conduct serious consideration and explanation work on the issue of the Party's line. We should also be good at putting forward the Party's current new tasks from the principles of Leninism.
    In our ideological work, in which the press occupies a leading position, and in all our ideological and political life, it is now necessary not only to defend but also to develop the ideas that constitute the essence of our policy and the essence of all our work. But at the same time, the Party has to pay special attention to preventing the distortion of our policies on fundamental issues. Recent Party resolutions have paid great attention to this matter…
    The Press Should Become the Party's Assistant
        in Organizing the Masses
    Precisely because of this, it is now necessary to correctly explain the basic issues of Leninism in our press, while opposing distortions of the Party's policies. In terms of the economy, in improving cultural standards, in organizing the strength of the proletariat, in uniting the peasant masses around the proletariat, and in the consolidation and development of our Party, preliminary and significant achievements have been made. In this situation, we must also remember the difficulties on our path forward, pay special attention to the need to correctly implement the principles of Leninism, and thereby remember that we must wage a ruthless struggle against ideological wavering and distortions of Leninism. Before us, not only in terms of the restoration of the country's material resources, the development of Soviet culture and mass organization, are there significant difficulties; but in all our work, in the ideological struggle against tendencies that deviate from the true Leninist ideology, we also bear the responsibility of maintaining ideological clarity.
    The most important task of the press lies precisely in this area. If we ask more specifically how the press can correctly fulfill its tasks, then obviously, there can only be one answer for us: the press should truly become the expression and mouthpiece of the Party's will in leading all socialist construction and developing the strength of the proletarian state. The press should in fact become the Party's main assistant in organizing the masses and conducting Leninist ideological education to the masses.
    Therefore, I believe that what must be particularly emphasized at present is that the press should not only have close ties with our Party, and not only be placed under the complete leadership of the Party, but should also completely integrate all its work with the Party's work and the Party's ideological life.
    We are now on the eve of the Fourteenth Party Congress. This congress should put forward our basic paths and tasks for the next period. I believe that these paths are now basically clear. The resolutions recently put forward make it possible for us to understand what basic guidelines the Party Congress will follow in preparing its work, and to understand what basic issues the Fourteenth Congress will focus on.
    The press should be in step with these tasks and work in accordance with the direction followed by our entire Party. When the press carries out its main responsibilities, it should give greater attention to these aspects: to fully and correctly reflect the Party's ideology and policies in the press, to resolutely counter distortions of the Party's policies, and at the same time, to conduct all the preparatory work for the Party Congress as much as possible in the context of our Party's more active ideological life. Whether it is different opinions and special insights on practical construction issues, or ideological differences within the Party, until certain doubts arise within a part of the Party on individual issues, all should be reflected to a certain extent in our Party newspapers before the Party Congress is held. But this does not mean that the press should become a "parliament for expressing opinions" and lack due Party leadership in the work of formulating the Party's current resolutions. Not like this! The press has the responsibility to implement the Party's ideology and policies. Before us, whether in practical work or in ideological and political terms, there are more complex and difficult tasks, and at the same time, we are faced with a task, which is to increasingly attract batches of working masses to the work of all socialist construction. Therefore, we should further expand the possibility of reflecting the voices of the masses in all our newspapers, and we should report this voice to the maximum extent and objectively in the press, so as to ensure the leadership of our Party and ensure further unity among all Leninists and the entire Party. If the press treats its current tasks and responsibilities in this way, and closely links all the work of the press with the work of the Party in this way, then it will truly and correctly fulfill its responsibilities.

    苏维埃的和党的报刊的基本任务
    （莫洛托夫同志在一九二五年十月二十一日报刊工作者会议上的报告）
    编者按：为学习苏联报刊在社会主义工业化时期的先进经验，本报特将“布尔什维克报刊文集”中一部分论文译出发表。除今天发表的莫洛托夫同志在一九二五年报刊工作者会议上所作的报告外，接着发表的还有莫洛托夫同志在一九二七年中央和地方报纸编辑会议上和一九二八年全苏编辑会议上所作两篇报告的摘要：“报刊和当前的经济运动”、“现时期和报刊”；另外，还有古比雪夫同志在一九三一年通讯社会议上的演说：“为实现党的总路线，反对一切偏向和曲解而斗争”。这些报告和演说，对于我们明确认识报纸在过渡时期的基本任务，以及报纸如何为实现国家社会主义工业化，为实现党的总路线而斗争，都有很大的启发作用。
    工业的高涨—社会主义基本
        力量的发展
    我们眼看着第一个苏维埃国家力量的普遍发展和巩固。无产阶级共和国的发展、高涨与巩固，是现时期最特出的特征，或者至少是最特出的特征之一。这种力量的发展愈来愈明显而有力；同时我们大家以工人阶级为首和广大农民群众一起，愈来愈被吸引到这个发展的过程中来了。现在特别重要的，是要我们能看到、感到和觉察到这些成就——无产阶级社会主义国家的初步成就和强大高涨的开端。假如我们见到了我们国家工业方面的真正高涨——我们现在可以大胆地这样说。那么，这就是社会主义基本经济力量的发展和高涨。假如我们见到我们农村中更加发展的合作化的情形，见到了日益众多的农民群众参加合作社的工作，那我们就能确信，这就为农村中社会主义因素的有力发展奠定了基础。如果我们说到关于无产阶级基本干部的恢复和不断增长的情形，并同时承认群众的文化程度和组织性的发展，而这种发展正表现在各个方面的话；那么，这首先是工人国家的发展，是这个国家群众的组织性和新的苏维埃生活的发展，归根结底，就我们的情况说来，是社会主义国家各种成分的真正发展。
    同时，如果我们知道，我们国家的思想政治力量如何地在发展着，特别以作为思想政治工作和总的思想发展状况的基本反映的报刊为例，我们也可以肯定在思想政治工作方面重大而无可争辩的成就，这是具有特别重大的意义的。因为工农群众思想政治积极性的发展，是在日益巩固的共产党的领导下，它会使社会主义建设从基本上走向巩固的地步。
    和我们国家力量的总的发展同时，党、无产阶级的党、共产主义的党本身的力量也发展和巩固起来了。党正是领导着这种力量的发展，执行着、并且是完全正确地执行着无产阶级国家真正领导者的作用，执行着苏维埃国家一切实际工作和它的思想政治发展的领导者的作用。
      报刊的作用
    在党的一切工作中，报刊的作用是特别重大的。报刊是一切实际工作的最积极的参加者，我们思想力量发展的主要的表达者。报刊直接担负了组织群众和对群众进行思想教育的工作。我们的报刊参与了这种事业的发展。除此以外，它还直接地教育着团结在自己周围的千万个、而现在是上几十万个的工人和农民的积极的报刊工作者——一支从人民群众中来的强大的工农通讯员队伍。报刊不仅把群众组织在自己的周围，而且把他们组织在那最不同的和最广泛的苏维埃的、职工会的、合作社的、以及愈来愈具有重大意义的文化和政治建设的实际工作中去。同时，报刊是而且愈加应该是社会主义思想、列宁主义思想在群众中、在群众的一切工作中的主要传播者之一。
      报刊的组织作用
    报刊在吸引工农群众的新的力量到一切建设部门的事业方面，起着最重要的作用。报刊的非常重大的组织者的作用，正如众所周知，是列宁当时所曾明确地指出了的。现在，报刊的这个作用是更加增长了。我们的报刊在为一切苏维埃建设部门培养领导干部以及对他们进行思想教育的事业中，是最重要的助手。除此以外，报刊还使许许多多的工农通讯员成为领导骨干；这件事情的意义，无论从党领导群众的方面，从反映群众的利益和志趣方面，无论对于报刊或一切的组织来说，都日益重大。
    总之，群众组织工作的发展和活跃，使日益众多的工人和农民参加到各种组织形式中去，是我们基本的、实际的组织任务的方向。现时无产阶级国家的实际工作，将在这个基础上开展起来，而且无产阶级对于群众的领导——体现于共产党对群众的领导，也将在这个基础上巩固起来。
    但是，同志们，在我们面前还有一个思想政治的任务。它的意义正随着今后我们经济和文化力量的每进一步的成就和发展而增大，而正确解决思想、政治的任务，对于我们党始终是一个主要的工作。我们是有解决这个问题的思想原则的，这个原则是具有科学的根据并经过了无产阶级革命的实际斗争所考验过的。马克思主义和列宁主义，就是我们对一切工作做结论时所根据的原则。列宁主义是帝国主义和无产阶级革命开始展开时代的发展了的马克思主义。指导着我们一切实践的列宁主义的原则，指导着我们一切实际工作的列宁主义的思想，是而且必须是我们的出发点。
    应该使报刊有保卫列宁主义真正的原则的重大的责任感和义务。应该使报刊真正地成为列宁主义思想在广大群众中的传播者。报刊工作者应善于在有关列宁主义的书和文章的最好标题之下，从字里行间看出问题的实质，并善于正确地阐明列宁的思想。可惜，我们还不能说，我们一切的机关报和报刊工作者都已经充分了解他们在消灭对列宁主义的曲解这方面对党所负的最重要的责任。我们的报刊和它的领导者，今后必须对这个头等重要的任务予以更大的注意。当然，现在已经有了关于列宁主义的真正的好书，但重要的是我们应该采取一切方法，尽可能广泛地把列宁的著作传播到群众中去。不但如此，报刊在阐明列宁主义思想方面的任务，现在不仅没有减轻，而且相反，党应该一次又一次地向大家提示报刊的这个基本任务，并改正这方面所有的缺点和错误。
    曲解我们党的政策的危险性
    此外，我们应该正确地估计到由国际和国内的情况所形成的新的条件。我们应该对于党的路线问题进行严肃的考虑和解释工作。我们还应该从列宁主义的原则出发，善于提出党的当前的新任务。
    在报刊占据首要地位的我们的思想工作中和在我们一切的思想政治生活中，现时不仅必须保卫而且必须去发展那些构成我们政策的实质和我们一切工作的实质的思想。但同时，党不得不特别防止歪曲我们在基本问题上的政策。最近的全党决议，对这件事情曾予以极大的注意……
    报刊应该成为党在组织群众
        方面的助手
    正因为如此，所以现在就必须在我们的报刊上正确解释列宁主义的基本问题，同时反对曲解党的政策。在经济方面，在提高文化程度方面，在组织无产阶级的力量、在使农民群众团结在无产阶级的周围以及我们党的巩固和发展等方面，已获得了初步的重大成就。在此情况下，我们也要记住我们前进途中的困难，要特别注意必须正确实行列宁学说的原则，从而记住，必须对思想上的动摇和曲解列宁主义作无情的斗争。在我们的面前，不仅在国家物质的恢复方面、在苏维埃文化和群众组织性的发展方面，有重大的困难；而且我们在一切工作中，在和脱离真正的列宁主义思想的倾向的思想斗争中，也负有坚持思想上的明确性的责任。
    报刊的最重大的任务，正是在这方面。假如更具体地提出报刊如何能够正确地实现自己的任务这个问题的话，那么很明显的，对于我们只可能有一个回答：报刊应该真正成为领导一切社会主义建设和发展无产阶级国家力量的事业的党的意志的表现者和喉舌。报刊事实上应该成为党在组织群众和向群众进行列宁主义思想教育方面的主要的助手。
    因此，我认为现时尤须强调指出的是：报刊不仅应该和我们的党有密切的联系，不仅应该置于党的完全的领导之下，而且应该使自己的全部工作完全地与党的工作和党的思想生活结合起来。
    我们现在是在十四次党的代表大会的前夜。这次大会应该提出今后一个时期的我们的基本的道路和任务。我认为这些道路现在已经基本上弄清楚了。最近提出的那些决议，使我们有可能懂得党的代表大会将按照什么基本方针去进行准备工作，懂得十四次代表大会将集中地注意那些基本问题。
    报刊应该和这些任务取得一致的步调，按照我们全党所遵循的方针进行工作。报刊在执行自己的主要责任的时候，应对这些方面给予更大的重视：使党的思想和政策在报刊上完全地得到正确的反映，使对党的政策的歪曲受到应有的坚决的回击，同时应使党的代表大会的一切准备工作尽可能在我党的更加积极的思想生活的情况下进行。无论是对实际建设问题看法上的不同意见和特殊见解，或者是党内思想的差异，直到党内某一部分对个别问题发生的某些疑问，在党代表大会没有召开之前，都应该在我们的党报上有一定的反映。但是这并不是说，报刊应该变成一种“发表意见的国会”，而在拟定当前全党的决议的工作中缺乏应有的党的领导。不是这样！报刊有执行党的思想和政策的职责。在我们面前，无论在实际工作方面和在思想政治方面，还有更复杂和艰难的任务，同时我们还面临着一项任务，这就是要把一批一批劳动群众日益吸引到一切社会主义建设的工作中去。因此，应该进一步扩大使群众的呼声反映到我们一切报刊上来的可能，应该在报刊上最大限度地和客观地报道这种呼声，借以保证我们党的领导和保证一切列宁主义者和全党进一步的团结。报刊如果这样地对待自己当前的任务和责任，使报刊的一切工作和党的工作这样密切联系起来，那么它就会真正地、正确地履行自己的职责。
