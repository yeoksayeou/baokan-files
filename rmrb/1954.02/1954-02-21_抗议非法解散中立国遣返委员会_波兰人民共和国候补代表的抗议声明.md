Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 20th: Colonel Marian Graniewski, Alternate Representative of the Polish People's Republic to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, made the following statement to reporters from Xinhua News Agency and the Korean Central News Agency on February 18th:

    At the meeting of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission held this morning, the Indian representative put forward a draft resolution proposing the dissolution of the Commission. I made the following statement on this draft resolution at the meeting:

    Each of us, as long as we objectively and with full responsibility regard our duties as members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, must admit that we have not fulfilled the special and extremely important mission entrusted to us six months ago.

    If the proposal is adopted, it would indicate that the majority of the members of the Commission have not recognized this fact, or that even if they have recognized this fact, the actions taken are contradictory. Our delegation believes that this proposal to dissolve the Commission is not only wrong but also illegal. Our delegation will firmly oppose the adoption of this proposal.

    In order to explain this position, and to clarify the current situation, I would like to trace back the circumstances and reasons that have placed the Commission in this regrettable situation.

    Our glorious and rightful task was to assist in the peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict in the repatriation of prisoners of war. The warring parties in Korea, by signing the Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," entrusted us with the task of ensuring that all prisoners of war placed in our custody have the opportunity to truly and freely exercise their right to return home and live peaceful lives.

    As everyone knows, although the so-called United Nations Command handed over the prisoners of war in its custody to the Commission, these prisoners of war remained under the direct control and brutal force of a powerful terrorist organization directed by the special agents of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. The purpose of this organization was to prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war through intimidation, the use of force, and terrorist means. The well-known facts about the existence of this organization, its origins and its masters, the criminal means it has adopted, the barbaric massacres it has carried out, and the results of its activities – all of these have been exposed in many documents of the Commission and analyzed in its official reports.

    In view of the existence of this organization, this delegation and the Czechoslovak delegation, from the very beginning, requested to affirmatively and immediately break up this organization and isolate the special agents. In other words, we insisted on taking indispensable steps to remove the decisive obstacles hindering the Commission from carrying out its mission.

    Although the Indian delegation recognized the necessity of taking such measures, it did not decide to implement them out of concern for the consequences of the so-called use of force against the special agents. Therefore, the Indian delegation cannot escape part of the responsibility for the fact that the terrorist organization in the camps was not broken up. The Swedish and Swiss delegations openly opposed breaking up this organization. We pointed out at the time that this position was unreasonable and would have dangerous consequences, which would seriously undermine the "Terms of Reference." It must be emphasized that because our proposal was rejected, the special agents not only made it impossible for the Commission to carry out its mission, but in fact forced the Commission to comply with their wishes. They negotiated with the Chairman of the Commission and the Indian custodial forces in the guise of so-called prisoner of war representatives, claiming to speak on behalf of the prisoners of war, but in fact they were deceiving and coercing them through terrorist means to obey.

    The activities of the special agents and the criminal organization in the camps made it impossible for a single prisoner of war to freely express their desire for repatriation. Every prisoner of war who wished to be repatriated had to risk their life when requesting repatriation, and some prisoners of war who attempted to escape in order to obtain repatriation were brutally murdered.

    Under these circumstances, it is clear that there were no suitable conditions for conducting the explanatory work stipulated in the "Terms of Reference." The explanatory work was to enable prisoners of war to freely express their desire to return home. We pointed out at the time that the so-called United Nations Command deliberately sabotaged the construction of the explanatory facilities, delaying this work for as long as nineteen days. The "Terms of Reference" stipulated a ninety-day explanatory period, but the explanatory work actually only lasted for ten days, and only fifteen percent of the prisoners of war listened to the explanation. This situation was created by the special agents of the so-called United Nations Command, who used deception and terrorist means, using force and murder, to prevent prisoners of war from listening to the explanation; they caused long interruptions in the explanatory work and obstructed the isolation of prisoners of war. As a result of these criminal activities, the vast majority of prisoners of war did not have the opportunity to listen to the explanation.

    It should also be emphasized that even during the short period of explanatory work, prisoners of war were still subjected to intimidation and barbaric terrorist means. They had in reality become people who had suffered devastation and terror persecution and could not express their desire for repatriation.

    Even at this stage of the Commission's existence, it was still possible to make up for lost time and complete its mission by compensatorily extending the explanation period and creating conditions for prisoners of war to freely exercise their right to be repatriated. The Czechoslovak delegation and our delegation both suggested taking such action in accordance with Article 24 of the "Terms of Reference." The Indian delegation repeatedly expressed its support for such a solution; the Swedish and Swiss delegations opposed using this only opportunity to enable the Commission to turn back and complete its mission. However, due to the resolute opposition of the so-called United Nations Command, the Indian delegation was unable to decide to steadfastly implement the measures it considered "appropriate and necessary." The purpose of that command was obvious: to continue its previous policy of obstructing the repatriation of prisoners of war, and finally, to achieve the forced retention of prisoners of war by repeatedly violating the agreements it had also signed.

    The Swedish delegation, with the unreserved support of the Swiss delegation, demanded the release of prisoners of war, making them civilians. This proposal was consistent with the attitude and demands of the so-called United Nations Command, and, if this proposal had been implemented, it would have amounted to approving that side's forced retention of prisoners of war. However, the majority of the Commission resolutely rejected this proposal, because, as the Chairman of the Commission correctly pointed out in a memorandum to both commands, prisoners of war could only be released after the prior conditions stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" had been fulfilled, that is, after the explanatory work had been completed and the issue of non-repatriation of prisoners of war had been discussed at the subsequent political conference.

    However, despite putting forward the correct premise, the Indian delegation later made an arbitrary decision to hand over the prisoners of war to the original detaining party in their capacity as prisoners of war, and unilaterally took this illegal action. Our delegation and the Czechoslovak delegation unanimously condemned and strongly protested the transfer of prisoners of war to a party to which they should never have returned according to the "Terms of Reference."

    We pointed out at the time that this step was illegal, and that from a legal, political, and humanitarian point of view, this was unacceptable. We pointed out that restoring the status quo was a step backward in the Commission's work and nullified the meager achievements that had been made up to that time.

    The so-called United Nations Command, disregarding the Chairman's absolute reservation and the subsequent decision of the Commission that any change in the status of prisoners of war was a violation of the "Terms of Reference," actually released the prisoners of war and made them civilians, in fact transferring them to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek groups, in order to incorporate them into their aggressive armies. These actions violated basic international agreements in many ways, including the Geneva Conventions.

    The so-called United Nations Command thus actually robbed and detained prisoners of war belonging to the Korean-Chinese Command. That side trampled on the Armistice Agreement it had also signed only a few months earlier, making it impossible for the Commission established under the agreement to complete its mission. Instead of dedicating itself to the peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict, seeking the solution longed for by the people of the world, the so-called United Nations Command aggravated the tense situation in Korea. Finally, we must constantly remember the tragic fate of those unfortunate, deceived, and intimidated people, who not only cannot return to reunite with their families, but are forced to serve as cannon fodder for the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek groups, serving their despicable purposes of provocation and aggression.

    In view of this actual situation, which is fraught with serious consequences, it is a very wrong, harmful, and dangerous action to dissolve the Commission before it has completed its mission, whether from a political, legal, or humanitarian point of view. This proves that the majority of the members of the Commission who decided to make the decision to dissolve must bear serious responsibility for thereby undermining the "Terms of Reference" – the basis of the Commission's work. Therefore, as I said at the beginning, our delegation will vote against the adoption of this proposal.

    Despite the firm opposition of the Polish and Czechoslovak delegations, the majority of the Commission passed this draft resolution. In view of this decision, I lodge a strong protest against the illegal dissolution of this Commission before it has completed the tasks stipulated in the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." I emphasize that, according to universally recognized legal and moral principles, any action that violates the agreement, any illegal action, no matter how many times they are taken, no matter how serious the nature, cannot deprive the prisoners of war of their legitimate and inalienable right to return to their homeland and reunite with their families. I declare that the attempt to deprive prisoners of war of their rights and all the consequences arising therefrom are the sole responsibility of those who have contributed to this situation.

    抗议非法解散中立国遣返委员会
    波兰人民共和国候补代表的抗议声明
    【新华社开城二十日电】中立国遣返委员会波兰人民共和国候补代表马里安·格兰尼夫斯基上校二月十八日对新华通讯社和朝鲜中央通讯社记者发表声明如下：
    在中立国遣返委员会今天上午举行的会议上，印度代表提出一项决议草案，建议把委员会解散。我在会上就这项决议草案发表了下述声明：
    我们当中每一个人只要客观地、具有充分责任感地看待自己作为中立国遣返委员会委员的职务，就必须承认我们没有实现我们在六个月以前受托担负的特别的极关重要的使命。
    所提的这个建议如获通过，那就表明委员会的多数委员没有认识这个事实，或者虽然认识这个事实，所采取的行动也是矛盾的。我们的代表团认为，这个解散委员会的建议不仅是错误的，而且是非法的。我们的代表团将坚决反对通过这个建议。
    为了解释这种立场，为了说明目前的情况，我愿意追述使委员会处于这种令人遗憾的境地的情况与原因。
    我们的光荣的分内的任务是在遣返战俘方面帮助和平解决朝鲜的冲突。在朝鲜的交战双方由于签订了停战协定和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，也就委托给我们一项任务，要我们保证交给我们看管的一切战俘有机会真正自由行使他们回家过和平生活的权利。
    大家知道，所谓联合国军司令部虽然把在它看管下的战俘交给委员会，但这些战俘仍然处于该司令部的特务——李承晚和蒋介石特务——所指挥的一个强有力的恐怖组织的直接控制和残暴势力之下。这种组织的目的在于通过恫吓、使用武力和恐怖手段来阻止战俘遣返。众所周知的关于这种组织的存在的事实，它的由来和它的主子，它所采取的罪恶手段，它所进行的野蛮屠杀，以及它的活动的结果——所有这些，委员会的许多文件已加以揭露，它的正式报告已加以分析。
    鉴于这种组织的存在，本代表团和捷克斯洛伐克代表团从一开始就要求肯定地立即打散这种组织，对特务加以隔离，换句话说，我们坚持采取不可缺少的步骤，以除去妨碍委员会执行任务的决定性障碍。
    印度代表团虽然认识到有必要采取这种措施，但是由于担心所谓对特务使用武力所产生的后果，没有决定加以执行。因此对于营场中的恐怖组织没有被打散这一事实，印度代表团不能逃脱一部分责任。瑞典和瑞士代表团公然反对打散这种组织。我们当时曾指出这种立场是没有理由的，是会引起危险后果的，这就是会严重破坏“职权范围”。必须强调指出，由于我们的建议被拒绝，特务不仅使委员会无法执行它的任务，而且实际上强迫委员会依从他们的意愿。他们以所谓战俘代表的身分和委员会主席以及印度看管部队进行谈判，自称代表战俘说话，而事实上他们并不是代表战俘，却是蒙骗和用恐怖手段强迫他们服从。
    特务的活动以及营场中的罪恶组织，使得没有
  一个战俘有机会能自由表示他们要求遣返的意愿，每一个希望被遣返的战俘在要求遣返时都不得不冒生命的危险，而一些为了得到遣返机会而逃跑未遂的战俘惨遭杀害。
    在这种情况下，显然没有进行“职权范围”中所规定的解释工作的适当条件。解释工作是为了使战俘能自由表示回国的意愿。我们当时已指出，所谓联合国军方面故意破坏解释设备的修建工作，把这种工作拖延了十九天之久。“职权范围”规定了九十天的解释限期，而解释工作实际上只进行了十天，听过解释的战俘只占百分之十五。这种情况是所谓联合国军方面的特务造成的，他们用欺骗和恐怖手段，用使用武力和进行谋杀的办法，不给战俘听取解释的机会；他们使得解释工作长期中断，阻挠战俘的隔离。由于进行这种罪恶活动的结果，绝大多数战俘没有机会听取解释。
    还应当强调指出：甚至在进行解释工作的短时期中，仍然对战俘施行恫吓和野蛮的恐怖手段，他们实际上已成为遭受摧残和恐怖迫害的人，无法表示要求遣返的意愿。
    即使是在委员会存在的这个阶段，它还是能够通过补偿性地延长解释期限，并创造使战俘能自由行使被遣返权利的条件，来补足丧失的时间，并完成它的任务的。捷克斯洛伐克代表团和我们代表团都曾建议根据“职权范围”第二十四款，采取这样的行动。印度代表团不止一次地表示赞成这样的解决办法；瑞典与瑞士代表团反对利用这个唯一的机会使委员会得以回头去完成它的任务。不过由于所谓联合国军司令部的断然反对，印度代表团并没有能够决定坚持不渝地实行它认为是“适当而必要”的措施。那个司令部的目的很明显：继续实行它以前的政策，即阻挠战俘遣返，最后，通过一再地破坏它们也签了字的协定来实现强迫扣留战俘。
    瑞典代表团在瑞士代表团毫无保留的支持下，要求释放战俘，使之成为平民。这个建议是与所谓联合国军方面的态度和要求一致的，而且，假如这个建议实现的话，就等于是批准那一方对战俘的强迫扣留。但是委员会的大多数断然拒绝了这个建议，因为如委员会主席在致双方司令部的备忘录中正确地指出的，只有在履行了“职权范围”所规定的先决条件，就是在完成了解释工作，并且在以后举行的政治会议上讨论了不遣返战俘的问题以后，才能释放战俘。
    不过，印度代表团尽管提出了正确的前提，后来还是作出了专断的决定，要把战俘以战俘身份移交给原拘留方，并且独断地采取了这种非法行动。我们代表团与捷克斯洛伐克代表团一致谴责并强烈抗议把战俘移交给根据“职权范围”他们决不应该回到的一方。
    我们当时曾指出这一步骤是非法的，并且指出从法律、政治与人道主义观点来看，这都是不能容许的。我们指出，恢复原状是在委员会的工作中倒退了一步，并且使得到那时为止所得到的微不足道的成就化为乌有。
    所谓联合国军司令部，不顾主席的绝对保留以及委员会随后的决定，即战俘地位的任何改变都是违反“职权范围”的，居然正式释放了战俘使之成为平民，而事实上是把他们移交给了李承晚与蒋介石集团，以便把他们编入他们的侵略军队。这些行动多方面违反了基本的国际协定，包括日内瓦公约在内。
    所谓联合国军方面就这样实际上劫夺了和扣留了属于朝中司令部的战俘。那一方践踏了仅仅几个月以前它也签过字的停战协定，使得根据协定成立的委员会不可能完成它的任务。所谓联合国军方面非但不致力于和平解决朝鲜冲突，谋求全世界人民所渴望的解决，反而使得朝鲜紧张局势更加恶化了。最后我们必须经常记住那些不幸的、受欺骗的、受恫吓的人们的悲惨命运，他们不但不能回去与家人团聚，而且被强迫充当李承晚与蒋介石集团的炮灰，为它们挑衅与侵略的卑鄙目的服务。
    鉴于这种包藏着严重后果的实际情况，无论从政治、法律、以至人道主义的观点来看，委员会在没有完成任务以前就予以解散是非常错误的有害的危险的行动。这证明要作出解散的决定的委员会大多数委员必须对由此破坏“职权范围”——委员会工作的基础——负严重责任。因此，如我在开始的时候所说的，我们的代表团将投票反对通过这个建议。
    尽管波兰与捷克斯洛伐克代表团坚决反对，委员会大多数还是通过了这个决议草案。鉴于这个决定，我提出坚决抗议，反对在委员会完成“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的任务以前，非法地解散这个委员会。我强调指出：根据普遍承认的法律与道德原则，任何破坏协定的行动，任何非法行动，不论它们采取了多少次，不论性质是多么严重，都不能剥夺战俘回到祖国与家人团聚的正当的、不可剥夺的权利。我声明：想剥夺战俘的权利的企图以及由此而产生的一切后果要由那些促成这种情况的人负全部责任。
