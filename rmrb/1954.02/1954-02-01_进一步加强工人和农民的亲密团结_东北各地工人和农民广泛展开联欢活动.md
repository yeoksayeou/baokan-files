Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 31st: Workers and peasants in various parts of Northeast China have widely launched joint celebration activities, further strengthening the close unity between workers and peasants.

    After sending three delegations to the countryside for visits, workers in Anshan recently invited famous agricultural labor models from various provinces in Northeast China to visit Anshan. In addition, more than 50 farmers from the suburbs were invited to visit major factories in Anshan. The Third Engineering Company of the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau in Shenyang, the Shenyang Construction and Installation Engineering Company, the Fushun City Federation of Trade Unions, and the Liaoxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions also organized worker delegations to visit and celebrate with the countryside, carrying various gifts. A total of sixteen factories including Dalian Chemical Plant and Dalian Textile Factory in Dalian invited more than 1,000 farmer and fisherman representatives from the suburbs to visit; Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine invited more than 500 agricultural and forestry labor models from Fuxin County to visit; workers from Liaodong Silk Spinning Factory and Liaoxi Provincial No. 401 Factory also invited nearby farmers to visit. Harbin, Benxi, Changchun and other cities have held joint celebration symposiums for worker and peasant representatives. Fushun City also organized more than 500 farmers from the suburbs to visit the Dahuo房 Reservoir construction site.

    The peasants were warmly welcomed when they arrived at the factories and mines, and the workers were warmly welcomed when they arrived in the countryside. Many workers and peasants talked cordially about production and living conditions. Workers in Anshan and other places also hosted banquets for the farmers. Workers in various places also gave the farmers new farm tools, fertilizer, and other industrial products. Employees of the Lingshan Farm Tool Factory in Anshan City voluntarily contributed a day's work to buy three "Worker-Peasant Alliance" harvesters and six large double-wheeled double-share plows with the day's wages, and donated them to the Chengde "May 1st" Collective Farm and the Han En and Wang Ximing agricultural production cooperatives respectively. Farmers in various places also presented workers with local specialties and various banners. The joint celebration activities have enabled workers and peasants to gain a further understanding of each other. Yu Yanjun, a farmer from the suburbs of Anshan, said after visiting a certain steel rolling mill: "There are only a little over a thousand people in our village, and we only pay over one hundred thousand catties of public grain a year. A steel rolling mill has only five or six hundred workers, and the value of their daily production can buy more than 11,000 tons of grain. The greatness of the working class, I really know it this time." Farmer representatives from the suburbs of Dalian City visited the Dalian Textile Factory and were very excited to see the scene of machine spinning. Farmer Du Chongxuan said to the workers: "This year our agricultural production cooperative must further increase the yield of cotton to support you!" Li Fangliang, an agricultural labor model from the suburbs of Benxi City, was moved after hearing Qu Fuming, an industrial labor model, introduce how their entire team united and overfulfilled the state's tasks under unfavorable conditions. He said: "We must learn from the collective spirit of our worker brothers, unite all the farmers in the village to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, produce more grain, grow more vegetables, and raise more pigs to support our worker brothers."

    During the joint celebration, the workers also expressed their gratitude for the support of the peasants, and proposed to vigorously help the peasants increase production. Workers in Liu Yulin's group at the Lingshan Farm Tool Factory said: "Our peasant brothers sell surplus grain to the state to support us; we must produce more and better new farm tools to help them produce more grain!" Workers at the Dalian Chemical Plant said that they would produce more high-quality and inexpensive fertilizers. The employees of the Dahuo房 Reservoir unanimously stated that they would work hard to improve efficiency and strive to complete the project ahead of schedule to relieve the threat of floods for the farmers as soon as possible.

    进一步加强工人和农民的亲密团结
    东北各地工人和农民广泛展开联欢活动
    【新华社沈阳三十一日电】东北各地的工人和农民广泛展开了联欢活动，进一步加强了工人和农民之间的亲密团结。
    鞍山的工人，继派出三个代表团到农村进行访问之后，又于最近邀请了东北各省著名的农业劳动模范到鞍山参观。此外，还邀请了郊区农民五十多人参观了鞍山各大工厂。沈阳市东北建筑工程局第三工程公司、沈阳建筑安装工程公司、抚顺市工会以及辽西省工会也组织了工人代表团，携带各种礼品到农村进行访问、联欢。旅大市大连化学厂、大连纺织厂等十六个工厂共邀请了市郊农民、渔民代表一千多人参观；阜新海州露天矿邀请了阜新县农、林业劳动模范五百多人参观；辽东绢纺工厂和辽西省第四零一工厂的工人也邀请了附近农民参观。哈尔滨、本溪、长春等市已召开了工农代表联欢座谈会。抚顺市还组织了郊区五百多农民访问了大伙房水库工地。
    各地农民到达各厂矿和工人到达农村后，都受到对方的热烈欢迎。许多工人和农民亲切地交谈了生产和生活情况。鞍山等地的工人并设宴招待农民。各地工人还赠给农民新式农具、肥田粉以及其他工业品。鞍山市灵山农具厂的职工，为了赠给农民礼物，自动献工一日，以这一天的工资买了三台“工农联盟”号收割机和六台大型双轮双铧犁，分别赠给了承德“五一”集体农庄和韩恩、王喜明两农业生产合作社。各地农民们也以本地特产和各样锦旗赠给工人老大哥。各地联欢活动，使工人和农民进一步得到了解。鞍山郊区农民于彦君参观了某轧钢厂以后说：“我们村一千来人，一年只缴十几万斤公粮，一个轧钢厂才五、六百工人，他们一天的生产价值就能买一万一千多吨粮食。工人阶级的伟大，这回可真知道了。”旅大市郊农民代表参观了大连纺织厂，看到了机器纺织的情景非常兴奋。农民杜崇暄向工人说：“今年我们的农业生产合作社一定要再提高棉花的产量，来支援你们！”本溪市郊农业劳动模范李芳良听到工业劳动模范曲福明介绍他们全班团结一致，在条件不好的情况下，超额完成国家任务的事迹后感动地说：“我们一定要学习工人老大哥的集体主义精神，团结全村农民搞好互助合作，多打粮食，多种蔬菜、多养猪，支援工人老大哥。”
    在联欢中，工人们对农民的支援也表示感激，并纷纷提出，要大力帮助农民增加生产。灵山农具厂刘玉林小组工人说：“农民兄弟向国家卖余粮支援我们；我们要生产出更多更好的新农具，帮助他们生产出更多的粮食！”大连化学厂工人表示要生产更多的物美价廉的肥料。大伙房水库的职工一致表示：要努力提高效率，争取提前完工，为农民早日解除水患威胁。
