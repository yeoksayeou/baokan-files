Solving Farmers' Difficulties and Promoting Agricultural Production
Remarkable Achievements of Northwest Rural Credit Cooperatives
Rural credit cooperative undertakings in Northwest China have developed under the leadership of local Party committees and governments and with the assistance of the People's Bank of China. They have played a significant role in promoting agricultural production and combating rural usury. According to incomplete statistics, there are 271 credit cooperatives and 7,475 credit mutual aid groups in the region, with more than 319,000 members.

In the past year, these credit cooperative organizations have absorbed more than 20 billion yuan (excluding shares) of rural idle funds and issued nearly 30 billion yuan in loans. The largest proportion of loans issued was used to solve the production and living difficulties of farmers. The Chengquan Credit Cooperative in Diwang Township, Zhuquan District, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, lent out more than 179 million yuan last year, of which 158.9 million yuan (including sideline production loans) was used for production, helping farmers increase their number of ploughing cattle, carts, large and small farm tools, and solving the difficulties of some farmers in lacking seeds and fertilizers. Since their establishment in August 1952, the 29 credit cooperatives and credit mutual aid groups in Liquan County have solved the difficulties of more than 200 farmers in terms of funds for wheat harvesting and fertilizer shortages for autumn fields. In Li Jiaying Village, Longxi County, Gansu Province, the credit mutual aid group solved the difficulties of spring ploughing and production, thus ensuring a bumper harvest.

In order to better serve production, some credit cooperatives have established close ties with agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations. The Zhang Fenghui Mutual Aid Group in Ningshuo County, Ningxia Province, almost collapsed because the crops were poor in 1952, and the Zhang Fengying and Zhang Fengchi families pawned 13 mu of land due to living difficulties. The credit mutual aid group helped the Zhang Fengying and Zhang Fengchi families redeem the land and provided loans to the group to add seeds and livestock, enabling the Zhang Fenghui Mutual Aid Group to overcome the spring famine and improve production enthusiasm. Last year, the average wheat yield per mu of the whole group was 447 jin, and the highest yield per mu reached 583 jin, which was more than twice the general yield in the area. Group leader Zhang Fenghui happily said: "Our mutual aid group must be consolidated and strengthened, and we can't do without the credit mutual aid group."

Credit mutual aid organizations can also provide timely loans to help farmers solve urgent difficulties such as disasters, diseases, weddings, and funerals. In Xijiaqu Village, Fourth District, Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province, farmers mostly engaged in mat weaving as a sideline after entering winter last year, but due to lack of organization, sales could not be opened up. At the same time, production funds could not be solved. After the establishment of the credit cooperative, it not only provided financial assistance, but also contacted the local supply and marketing cooperative and supply and marketing cooperatives in Weinan Lanjia Dian and other places through the credit cooperative, signed supply and sales contracts, opened up sales for mats, and increased farmers' income. Zhi Jinnian, a farmer in Zhimocun Village, Second District, Lantian County, Shaanxi Province, suffered from illness in all six members of his family in August last year, and there was no way to solve the problem of living and medical expenses. Thanks to a loan from the credit cooperative, he was able to overcome the difficulties. Later, he said to everyone he met: "If it weren't for the cooperative, our whole family would have lost our lives." Because many urgent difficulties of farmers have been solved in a timely manner, farmers affectionately call credit cooperatives "small banks" that provide emergency relief.

Credit mutual aid cooperation organizations have played a great role in combating farmers' usury activities. In Shankou Township in Nanzheng County and Anba Township in Yang County, Shaanxi Province, the phenomenon of selling empty warehouses was very serious every year in February and March when the old grain was running out and the new grain was not yet available. Since the establishment of credit cooperatives last year, the phenomenon of selling empty warehouses has not occurred again.

Because credit mutual aid cooperation organizations in various places have helped farmers solve their production and living difficulties, farmers have generally realized the benefits of credit cooperatives. Especially after vigorously publicizing the general line of the state's transition period to farmers, more and more people are requesting to join credit mutual aid cooperation organizations. The Xiaoyifang Credit Cooperative in Sanxiang, Seventh District, Yaoxian County, Shaanxi Province, regularly receives applications for membership from non-member people; the Sancha Village Credit Cooperative in Erqu, Fengxian County also has frequent requests for participation, with 32 farmers from Kuantan Village alone, which is near the cooperative, requesting membership; according to the farmers' requests, under the unified leadership of the Party and government, cadres of the Bin County People's Bank helped farmers successively establish three credit cooperatives in Caojiadian, Xiangmiao, Daku and other townships in mid-December last year.

At present, Party committees at all levels and People's Banks at all levels in Northwest China attach great importance to the credit mutual aid cooperation undertaking. The Weinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shaanxi Province has instructed the county Party committees under its jurisdiction that, in conjunction with winter production and grain purchase work, they should strengthen and improve the existing cooperatives and groups through the publicity of the general line, and require all counties to establish a credit cooperative in each district this year based on the specific local conditions.

    解决农民困难，推动农业生产
    西北农村信用合作组织成绩显著
    西北各地农村信用合作事业，在各地党委、政府领导和人民银行的帮助下，有了发展，对推动农业生产打击农村高利贷起了很重要的作用。据不完全统计：全区有信用合作社二百七十一个，信用互助组七千四百七十五个，社员、组员三十一万九千多人。
    这些信用合作组织在去年一年中，共吸收农村闲散资金二百多亿元（股金不在内），放款额将近三百亿元。在贷出的款项中，以解决农民生产和生活困难的比重最大。陕西省咸阳县珠泉区帝王乡程泉信用合作社，去年一年共贷出一亿七千九百多万元，用于生产方面的贷款就有一亿五千八百九十万元（包括副业生产贷款），帮助农民增添了耕牛、大车、大小农具等，解决了部分农民缺乏籽种肥料的困难。醴泉县的二十九个信用合作社和信用互助组，从一九五二年八月成立以来，解决了二百多户农民的割麦资金困难和秋田缺肥问题。甘肃省陇西县李家营村由于信用互助组解决了春耕生产困难，因而保证了丰收。
    有的信用合作社为更好地为生产服务，和农业生产互助合作组织建立了密切联系，宁夏省宁朔县张凤辉互助组因为一九五二年庄稼歉收，张凤英、张凤池两家因生活困难把十三亩地当了出去，互助组几乎垮台。信用互助组帮助张凤英、张凤池两家赎回了地，并贷款给该组添置籽种、牲口，使张凤辉互助组战胜了春荒，提高了生产热情。去年全组麦子平均每亩产量是四百四十七斤，最高产量每亩达到五百八十三斤，高出当地一般产量一倍以上。组长张凤辉高兴地说：“咱们互助组要巩固壮大，离开信用互助组可不行。”
    信用互助组织还能及时贷款帮助农民解决灾荒、疾病、婚丧等紧急困难。陕西省蒲城县第四区西贾曲村，去年入冬后农民多以编席为副业，但由于缺乏组织，销路打不开。同时生产资金也无法解决。信用合作社成立后，不但给以资金扶助，而且通过信用合作社和当地供销合作社和渭南兰家店等地的供销合作社联系，签订了供销合同，给席子打开了销路，增加了农民收入。陕西省蓝田县第二区支磨村农民支金年，去年八月间全家六口人都得了病，生活、医药费都没法解决，经信用合作社贷款，才算度过了难关，以后他逢人便说：“要不是合作社，我们全家人早就没命了。”由于农民许多紧急的困难问题都得到及时解决，农民都亲切的把信用合作社称为救急救难的“小银行”。
    信用互助合作组织对打击农民高利贷的活动起了很大作用。陕西省南郑县的山口乡和洋县的安霸乡，过去每到春二、三月青黄不接卖空仓的现象很严重，从去年成立信用合作社，就再没有卖空仓的现象发生了。
    由于各地信用互助合作组织帮助农民解决了生产生活的困难，农民已普遍认识到信用合作社的好处，尤其是经过大张旗鼓向农民进行国家过渡时期总路线的宣传后，要求加入信用互助合作组织的人越来越多。陕西省耀县七区三乡孝义坊信用合作社，经常接到非社员群众的入社申请书；凤县二区三岔村信用合作社也经常有人要求参加，仅该社附近的宽滩村一个村，就有三十二户农民要求入社；邠县人民银行干部根据农民要求，在党政统一领导下，即于去年十二月中旬在曹家店、香庙、大库等乡帮助农民先后成立了三个信用合作社。
    目前，西北各级党委和各级人民银行对信用互助合作事业极为重视。中共陕西省渭南地委已指示所属各县县委，应结合冬季生产、购粮等工作，通过总路线宣传，除对原有的社、组加以巩固提高外，并要求各县应根据当地具体情况，争取今年内在每个区都建立起一个信用合作社。
