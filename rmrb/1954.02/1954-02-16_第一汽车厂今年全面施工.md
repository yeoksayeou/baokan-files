The construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will be fully launched this year. The construction volume this year will reach more than 550,000 square meters, accounting for 65.16 percent of the total construction volume of the plant. Among them, the building area of the factory area is 291,103 square meters, which is more than four times that of 1953; the dormitory and welfare buildings are more than 225,000 square meters, which is 3.6 times that of 1953. The future ten major workshops of the automobile factory will be built simultaneously this year. In addition to the five workshops of mechanical assembly, non-ferrous metals, woodworking, forging, and auxiliary that have already started construction last year, five new workshops including body pressing, motorcycle, model, and thermal power will also be built. In addition, construction projects such as employee residential areas, nurseries, shops, and theaters will also start construction this year. Surrounding this vast factory area and residential area, railways, highways, machine material transportation routes, and hundreds of kilometers of water supply and drainage pipes, air compression, cable, and telecommunications industrial pipelines will also be built. Auxiliary buildings such as office buildings, engineering buildings, and garages will also begin construction. The earthwork volume of these projects reaches 500,000 cubic meters, the total amount of concrete is nearly 200,000 cubic meters, and the number of more than 20 kinds of main materials used for construction reaches more than 1.6 million tons.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's large-scale and technically complex project, an unprecedented tense atmosphere prevails on the construction site of the First Automobile Factory. In the office building, the factory director and the managers of the construction and installation engineering company are tirelessly discussing the work summary of last year, absorbing experiences and lessons; engineering and technical personnel are nervously compiling the construction organization design; the staff of the planning department are studying batches of engineering plans; the supply department and the transportation department are contacting various departments through dozens of telephones. The various construction work areas are also scenes of intense activity, with thousands of workers enthusiastically studying the general line, and some workers are discussing the issues of factory and mechanized construction with relish in technical study classes.

Thanks to the leadership's close attention to inspection and timely balance, and the strenuous efforts of all employees, the various construction preparation works of the First Automobile Factory are proceeding in an orderly manner. The changes in engineering projects and quotas have not delayed the compilation of the overall design of the construction organization. The mechanized supply station has been prepared for this year's large-scale construction, and the new-style shovel loaders, excavators, bulldozers, tractors, cranes, belt conveyors, etc. manufactured at home and abroad have mostly arrived. Transportation personnel have launched a huge organizational supply work, and timber from the Changbai Mountains, steel from Anshan, sand and gravel from the Songhua River, and machinery and materials from all over the country have arrived at the construction site in a steady stream. The huge construction team has been quickly assembled from all over the country and is currently undergoing centralized training. Special types of training—plumbing and electrical classes and mechanized driver classes—have officially started; grassroots cadre training and foreman training are also being actively planned.

The construction preparation work of the First Automobile Factory is closely integrated with improving the construction management work. Leading cadres of various units personally grasp the construction preparation work, and through summarizing and inspecting last year's work, discuss improving this year's work system and methods, and put forward clear requirements and specific plans for various construction preparation work. For example, in terms of planning management, it is proposed that we must comprehensively prepare the construction organization design and the overall design of unit projects, do a good job in the construction design of sub-projects and the overall operation plan, and also strengthen the scheduling system and implement the engineering task list to ensure the implementation of the operation plan. In terms of technical management, it is necessary to compile and implement operating procedures, vigorously promote advanced experience with emphasis, and strengthen material testing and research work; other requirements are put forward for implementing economic accounting, strengthening factory and mechanized construction, cultivating talents, and improving living welfare. Then, around these requirements, a specific preparation work plan is formulated, and a dedicated department is assigned to arrange the progress. In the process of work, leading cadres mobilize the masses on the one hand, and strengthen supervision and inspection on the other hand, and immediately study countermeasures to improve any weak links found. This ensures that the massive construction preparation work can proceed smoothly under the overall plan.

    第一汽车厂今年全面施工
    【本报讯】第一汽车制造厂建厂工程今年将全面展开。今年的建筑工程量达五十五万多平方公尺，占建厂总工程量百分之六十五点一六。其中厂区建筑面积为二十九万一千一百零三平方公尺，等于一九五三年的四倍多；宿舍及福利建筑为二十二万五千多平方公尺，等于一九五三年的三点六倍。未来的汽车制造厂的十大车间，将在今年同时兴建，除去年已经动工的机械装配、有色金属、木工、锻工、辅助五个车间外，还要新建车身压制、摩托、模型、热电等五个车间。此外，职工住宅区、托儿所、商店、剧院等建筑工程也将在今年一齐动工。环绕着这幅员广阔的厂区和住宅区，还要建起纵横交错的铁道、公路、机器材料运搬路线和数百公里的上下水道，空气压缩、电缆、电讯等工业管道。办公大楼、工程大楼、汽车库等附属建筑，也将开始建筑。这些工程的土方工程量达五十万立方公尺，混凝土总量近二十万立方公尺，建筑用的二十几种主要材料数达一百六十万吨以上。
    为了保证完成今年规模巨大、技术复杂的工程，第一汽车厂建厂工地上呈现着空前的紧张现象。办公大楼里，厂长和建筑安装工程公司的经理们正在不倦地讨论着去年的工作总结，从中吸收经验教训；工程技术人员们紧张地编制着施工组织设计；计划处的工作人员研究着一批一批的工程计划书；供应处、运输处通过数十台电话联系着各处的工作。各个建筑工区也是一片紧张景象，数千工人正在热情学习总路线，有些工人在技术学习班里津津有味地讨论着工厂化和机械化施工的问题。
    由于领导方面抓紧检查、及时平衡，和全体职工的紧张努力，第一汽车厂各项施工准备工作正在有秩序地进行着。工程项目和定额的变动并没有使施工组织总设计的编制拖延下来。机械化供应站已为今年大规模施工做好准备，国内外制造的新式铲运机、掘土机、推土机、拖拉机、起重机、皮带运输机等已大部到齐。运输人员展开了巨大的组织供应工作，长白森林的木材、鞍山的钢材、松花江的砂石以及全国各地的机器、材料，已源源到达工地。庞大的施工队伍已经迅速由全国各地集结起来，目前正在集中进行训练。特殊工种的训练——水暖电气班和机械化司机班已正式开课；基层干部训练和工长训练也正在积极筹划中。
    第一汽车厂的施工准备工作紧紧地和提高施工管理工作相结合。各单位领导干部亲自掌握施工准备工作，通过总结、检查去年的工作，讨论改进今年的工作制度与工作方法，并对各项施工准备工作提出明确的要求和具体的计划。如在计划管理方面就提出：一定要全面编好施工组织设计、单位工程总设计，做好分部工程施工设计和全面的作业计划，另外还要加强调度制度，实施工程任务单，以保证作业计划的贯彻。在技术管理方面，要编制与贯彻操作规程，有重点地大力推广先进经验，加强材料试验、研究工作；其他对贯彻经济核算、加强工厂化、机械化施工、培养人材、生活福利等都一一提出要求。然后围绕这些要求，定出具体准备工作计划，指定专门负责部门排定进度。在工作进程中，领导干部一面发动群众，一面加强督促检查，发现薄弱环节立即研究对策加以改进。这就保证了内容浩繁的施工准备工作在总的计划下能够顺利进行。
