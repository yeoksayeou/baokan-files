Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th: According to TASS, the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers convened the State Farm Workers' Conference, which opened on the 3rd in the Kremlin.  2,105 people attended the meeting, including state farm directors, scientists, agronomists, livestock breeding experts, and farm mechanization experts.

Soviet Party and government leaders Malenkov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Saburov, Pervukhin, Shvernik, Suslov, Pospelov, and Shatalin participated in the meeting.  They were warmly welcomed by the audience as they took their seats on the podium.

A. Kozlov, Minister of Soviet State Farms, delivered a report at the meeting on the resolution of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee regarding the improvement of state farm work. In his report, he described the achievements and experiences gained by state farm workers in implementing the resolution and pointed out the enormous potential of state farms in increasing crop yields and livestock productivity.

Kozlov said: The task facing state farms is to greatly increase the output of agricultural products. Compared with 1940, state farms are to double meat production, more than double milk production, and double wool production in 1954. In the two years of 1954 and 1955, the wheat sown area of state farms will increase by 4.3 million hectares (approximately 64.5 million mu) to ensure an annual increase of at least 5 million tons of grain supply. In terms of land reclamation, state farms have received a large number of tractors and other agricultural machines supplied by the government. The area planted with vegetables is being expanded, and 413 state farms will be fully engaged in the production of vegetables and potatoes. In 1954 and 1955, state farms will add greenhouses with a construction area of 189,000 square meters and build approximately 700,000 more hotbeds. After pointing out that improving livestock breeding is the main task of developing socialist agriculture, Kozlov also described the achievements made by advanced livestock state farms. After Kozlov's report, the meeting launched a discussion on the report.

The meeting will continue on the 4th.
