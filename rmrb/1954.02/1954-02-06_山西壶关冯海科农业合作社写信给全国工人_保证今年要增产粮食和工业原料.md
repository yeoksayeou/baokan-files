Shanxi Huguan Feng Haike Agricultural Cooperative Writes to National Workers
Guaranteeing Increased Grain and Industrial Raw Material Production This Year
Dear elder brothers, the workers of the whole country:
    Whenever we think of the development of production over the past three years, we cannot forget your great assistance. Three years ago, our production was relatively poor, with an average yield of only 270 jin per mu in the entire village. In 1951, we established an agricultural production cooperative, used new-style agricultural implements and medicines manufactured by you, and improved our farming techniques, which greatly improved production. Although most of the 345 mu of land of the 44 households in the cooperative are mountain slope terraces, with more than 2,800 large and small plots, with many stones and thin soil, and very poor natural conditions. However, because 90 percent of the land in the cooperative is cultivated with new-style walking plows, chemical fertilizers are properly used, and all seeds are mixed with medicines such as Wangtong, Ceresan, and 666, and when crops are infested with pests, sprayers and DDT can be used for prevention and control. Therefore, in the first year of running the cooperative, the yield per mu was 93 jin more than in 1950, and in 1952, the yield per mu was 16 jin more than in 1951; by 1953, the yield per mu reached 533 jin and 12 liang, more than twice that before the war. The reason for these achievements, as cooperative member Li Lifu said: "If it weren't for the Communist Party leading us to organize, and if it weren't for the worker elder brothers making new-style agricultural implements for us, there would be no way to improve our production. We have produced more grain, supported industrial construction, which is beneficial to the country and even more beneficial to ourselves."
    After studying the general line, we have become more aware of the benefits of industrialization and the prospects for rural economic development. We collectively sold more than 36,900 jin of surplus grain to the state, and led the entire village to sell more than 58,900 jin of surplus grain to the state; most of the proceeds from the sale of grain were used to expand reproduction and deposited in the bank. In order to adapt to the needs of industrial development, support national industrial construction, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, we must do three things well in 1954:
    First, increase the production of more grain to sell to the state and support industrial construction. Our agricultural cooperative has now expanded to 84 households. We have now formulated a production increase plan for 1954 and a production plan for the first quarter, and we must learn from the advanced experience of high-yield areas, strengthen political and ideological leadership, give full play to the production enthusiasm of cooperative members, cultivate meticulously, process and fertilize more, and strive to increase production by another 50 jin per mu on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. The whole cooperative can increase production by more than 30,000 jin, and sell 45,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.
    Second, appropriately expand the planting area of cash crops. This year, the entire cooperative will plant 100 mu of industrial raw materials, etc., sign a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative, and sell 7,000 jin of hemp skin, 2,400 jin of hemp seed oil, and timber and other industrial raw materials to the state to support national industrial construction.
    Third, sign a supply and marketing contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase 73 large and small agricultural implements, 600 jin of fertilizer powder, 120 jin of bone fertilizer, as well as cloth, kerosene, salt, matches and other daily necessities.

    山西壶关冯海科农业合作社写信给全国工人
    保证今年要增产粮食和工业原料
    亲爱的全国工人老大哥：
    每当我们一想起三年来生产发展的情况，就忘不了你们的伟大援助。三年前，我们生产比较差，全村每亩平均产量只二百七十斤。一九五一年我们成立了农业生产合作社，用上了你们造出的新式农具和药械，改进了耕作技术，生产就大大提高了。全社四十四户的三百四十五亩地，虽然大部是山坡梯田，一共有大小二千八百多块，石多土薄，自然条件非常不好。但是，因为社里百分之九十的地都用新式步犁耕，适当地使用了化学肥料，籽种全部用王铜、赛力散、六六六等药剂拌过，庄稼发生虫害时还能用喷雾器和滴滴涕防治，因此，办社头一年就比一九五○年每亩多产九十三斤，一九五二年又比一九五一年每亩多产十六斤；到一九五三年每亩就产到五百三十三斤十二两，超过战前两倍多。获得这些成绩的原因，正如社员李里富说：“要不是共产党领导咱组织起来，要不是工人老大哥给咱造出了新式农具，咱们的生产就没办法提高。咱们多打了粮食，支援了工业建设，对国家有利，对自己更有利。”
    经过总路线的学习，我们更认识了工业化的好处和农村经济发展的前途，集体售给国家余粮三万六千九百余斤，并带动全村卖给国家余粮五万八千九百斤；卖粮款大部用于扩大再生产和存到银行里。为了适应工业发展的需要，支援国家工业建设，巩固工农联盟，一九五四年我们要做好三件工作：
    第一，增产更多的粮食卖给国家，支援工业建设。我们农业社已扩大到八十四户。现在已订出了一九五四年增产计划和第一季度生产计划，并要学习各地丰产先进经验，加强政治思想领导，充分发扬社员的生产积极性，精耕细作，加工加肥，争取在去年丰产的基础上每亩再增产五十斤，全社共可增产三万余斤，卖给国家余粮四万五千斤。
    第二，适当扩大经济作物播种面积。全社今年要播种工业原料等一百亩，与供销社订立合同，卖给国家麻皮七千斤、麻籽油二千四百斤及木料等工业原料，支援国家工业建设。
    第三，与供销社要订立供销合同，购买大小农具七十三件，肥田粉六百斤，骨肥一百二十斤，以及布匹、煤油、食盐、火柴等日用品。
