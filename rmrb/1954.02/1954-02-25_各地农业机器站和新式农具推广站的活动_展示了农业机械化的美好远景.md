    Activities of Agricultural Machine Stations and New-Style Farm Implement Promotion Stations
    Demonstrate the Bright Prospects of Agricultural Mechanization
    The activities of agricultural machine tractor stations and new-style farm implement promotion stations across the country are demonstrating the bright prospects of agricultural mechanization to farmers.

    In 1953, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and local agricultural departments focused on piloting eleven machine tractor stations in areas with a relatively good foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, large land area and a small population, and a relative lack of livestock power and farm implements. They also established thirty tractor work teams within agricultural technology guidance stations that mainly used new-style farm implements; and nine farm tractor cultivation teams attached to state-owned farms. In addition, after several years of effort, 591 new-style farm implement promotion stations have been established nationwide. These agricultural machine tractor stations, tractor work teams, and new-style farm implement promotion stations, which are entirely socialist in nature, have all signed contracts with organized farmers to use machines and new-style farm implements to cultivate their land. In the past year, the eleven machine tractor stations alone have carried out mechanical operations such as plowing and harrowing on the cultivated land of five collective farms, fifty-eight agricultural production cooperatives, thirty-nine mutual aid teams, and agricultural experiment stations of nine provinces, special districts, and counties. The crops cultivated by the various machine tractor stations, tractor teams, and new-style farm implement promotion stations for the farmers were mostly higher in yield than those of ordinary local farmers. The yields of grain and cotton cultivated by the various machine tractor stations for organized farmers were more than 30 percent higher than the yields of local farmers. Last year, nearly 80 percent of the more than 200 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 Chinese mu) of paddy rice cultivated by the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, were cultivated by machines from the Huachuan Machine Tractor Station. Due to the appropriate depth of plowing of the paddy fields by machine, followed by the use of a disc harrow to break up the soil clods, plus the improvement of cultivation techniques, the average yield of paddy rice per hectare in the whole village reached 12,000 jin, more than double the yield of paddy rice sown by individual farmers using old-fashioned farm implements. The yield of paddy rice cultivated by the station for the Sanwanzi Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Chang Fengwu Agricultural Production Cooperative was about 30 percent higher than the yield of paddy rice cultivated by local farmers using old farm implements. The more than 12,000 mu of corn and millet cultivated by the Machine Tractor Station of Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, for the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm yielded 271 jin of raw grain per mu, which was more than 33 percent higher than the yield of the best mutual aid teams in the area, and more than 47 percent higher than that of individual farmers.

    The machine operations organized by tractor stations and other organizations have also greatly improved labor efficiency, saving a large amount of manpower and animal power for cultivators, which can be used for land processing and sideline production. For example, when the Pingluobao Machine Tractor Station in the suburbs of Shenyang City was sowing wheat last spring, it used a tractor to pull a seeder to sow wheat for the Zhou Chengxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative. Even when the machine was not working well, it still sowed 100 mu of wheat in ten hours. If old-fashioned farm implements were used to cultivate this land, it would take fourteen days to complete the sowing. Last autumn, the Keshan Machine Tractor Station in Heilongjiang Province used a Soviet-style large threshing machine to thresh 210 hectares of wheat for the Heping Collective Farm, which only took a little over four days to complete. If the usual number of rollers were used for threshing, it would take a month. Therefore, the whole village saved manpower and animal power and made preparations for harvesting the large fields in advance. The Huachuan Machine Tractor Station in Songjiang Province used combine harvesters to help farmers rush to harvest wheat before the rainy season, which resulted in 22 percent more yield than manual harvesting and roller threshing.

    The work of the machine tractor stations, tractor teams, and new-style farm implement promotion stations in various places has been warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers. In particular, the bumper harvest of crops cultivated by machines has greatly educated and encouraged the farmers, and promoted the consolidation and development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Northeast China achieved a bumper harvest of paddy rice cultivated by machines, more than 40 farmers immediately joined the farm. Last year, there were only seven agricultural production cooperatives in the Pingluobao District in the suburbs of Shenyang City. After a year of cultivation by the agricultural machine station, farmers, in order to use machines and improve production as soon as possible, established 35 new agricultural production cooperatives throughout the district. Because the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm achieved increased production through machine cultivation, it not only further strengthened the work confidence of the members, but also the agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and many individual farmers in the nearby Lujiazhuang, Nantian Gong, and other villages voluntarily requested to join the farm. Last autumn, when the tractor cultivation team of the Fangqiuhu Farm in Anhui Province was sowing wheat for the Li Shulan Mutual Aid Team, the team members expressed their willingness to quickly merge their land and organize an agricultural production cooperative so that they could use machines for cultivation next year, because the land plots were small and machine cultivation was inconvenient. After visiting the Beijing Machine Tractor Station, the members of the Liang Gui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bajiaozhuang in the suburbs of Beijing City praised it endlessly. Member Zhou Rui said: "After this visit, my mind is clear. I know the benefits of being organized and mechanized."

    各地农业机器站和新式农具推广站的活动
    展示了农业机械化的美好远景
    全国各地农业机器拖拉机站和新式农具推广站的活动，为农民展示了农业机械化的美好远景。
    一九五三年，中央人民政府农业部和各地农业部门在互助合作基础较好、地多人少、畜力和农具比较缺乏的地区，重点试办了机器拖拉机站十一处，又在以使用新式农具为主的农业技术指导站中，成立拖拉机工作队三十处；在国营农场中附设了农场拖拉机代耕队九处。另外，经过几年来的努力，全国已建立了五百九十一个新式农具推广站。这些完全属于社会主义性质的农业机器拖拉机站、拖拉机工作队和新式农具推广站，都和组织起来的农民订立了合同，用机器和新式农具为他们进行耕作。一年来，仅十一处机器拖拉机站，就给五个集体农庄、五十八个农业生产合作社、三十九个互助组和九个省的、专区和县的农事试验场的耕地进行了耕耙等机械作业。各个机器拖拉机站、拖拉机队和新式农具推广站为农民代耕的庄稼，大都高于当地一般农民的产量。各个机器拖拉机站为组织起来的农民耕作的粮食和棉花的产量，要高于当地农民产量百分之三十以上。松江省桦川县星火集体农庄去年耕种的二百多垧（每垧十五市亩）水稻，有近百分之八十是由桦川机器拖拉机站用机器耕作的。由于用机器翻耕的稻田深度适当，翻后又用圆盘耙把土块耙碎，再加上改进栽培技术，使全庄平均每垧水稻产量达到一万二千斤，比单干农民用旧式农具播种的水稻产量高一倍多。该站为三湾子农业生产合作社和常凤梧农业生产合作社耕作的水稻产量，比当地用旧农具耕作的水稻产量高百分之三十左右。山西省长治专区机器拖拉机站给中苏友好集体农庄耕作的一万二千多亩玉米、谷子等，每亩产原粮二百七十一斤，高出当地最好的互助组产量的百分之三十三以上，较个体农民高百分之四十七以上。
    拖拉机站等组织的机器作业，还大大提高了劳动效率，使耕作者节省出大批人力和畜力，用来进行土地加工和副业生产。如沈阳市郊平罗堡机器拖拉机站在去年春耕播种时，以一台拖拉机牵引一台播种机，为周承祥农业生产合作社播种小麦，在机车不好使的情况下，十小时还把一百亩小麦种完，如果用旧式农具耕作这些土地，就需要十四天才能种完。黑龙江省克山机器拖拉机站在去年秋收时，用苏式大型脱粒机为和平集体农庄的二百一十垧小麦脱粒，只四天多就打完了，如果用通常数量的磙子打，就需要一个月的时间，因此全庄节省了人力畜力，提前做好收割大田的准备工作。松江省桦川机器拖拉机站用联合收割机帮助农民在雨季前抢收小麦，比人割磙打多收百分之二十二。
    各地机器拖拉机站、拖拉机队和新式农具推广站的工作，受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。特别是机器耕种的庄稼获得丰收后，大大教育和鼓舞了农民，并促进了农业互助合作组织的巩固和发展。东北区星火集体农庄机器耕种的水稻获得丰收后，立即有四十多户农民加入农庄。沈阳市郊平罗堡区去年仅有七个农业生产合作社，经过农业机器站一年来的代耕，农民为了早日用上机器，提高生产，全区已新成立了三十五个农业生产合作社。中苏友好集体农庄因机器耕种获得增产，不但进一步坚定了庄员的工作信心，而且附近鹿家庄、南天贡等村的农业生产合作社、互助组和不少单干农民，都自愿要求加入农庄。安徽省方邱湖农场拖拉机代耕队去年秋天给李树兰互助组种麦时，因地块小机器耕种不方便，该组组员都表示要赶快合并土地，组织农业生产合作社，以便下年使用机器耕种。北京市郊八角庄梁贵农业生产合作社社员参观北京机器拖拉机站后，个个赞美不绝；社员周瑞说：“这一瞧，心里就透亮了，知道组织起来和机械化的好处了。”
