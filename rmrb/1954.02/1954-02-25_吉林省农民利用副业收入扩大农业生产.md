    Jilin Province Farmers Use Sideline Income to Expand Agricultural Production
    The broad masses of farmers in Jilin Province are using the income from winter sideline production to add carts and buy horses, expanding agricultural production. According to incomplete statistics, farmers throughout the province have earned more than 280 billion yuan from diverse sideline productions such as pig raising, transportation, weaving, and alkali boiling. Farmers have used most of this income for agricultural investment. According to preliminary statistics from eight counties including Guoqian Banner, they have used sideline income to buy more than 3,200 horses, 3,800 head of cattle, hundreds of sheep, and a total of more than 1,800 rubber-tired carts, spoke-wheeled carts, and iron carts, and repaired more than 100 old carts. This has laid a solid material foundation for this year's agricultural production. Some disaster-stricken areas have returned to their original state through winter production and have made some preparations for this year's production. Panshi County used winter production income to repair and build more than 1,000 houses, basically solving the housing problem for disaster victims. The masses in the disaster area of ​​Shulan County earned a total of 1.27 billion yuan, purchased more than 680,000 jin of millet and sorghum, solved the problem of winter clothing for more than 3,900 people, and also purchased some draught animals. The Zhai Feng'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bakashu Village, the county, suffered the most severe flooding last year, with an average yield reduction of more than 2,000 jin per hectare. In winter production, all male and female labor forces were mobilized, with a reasonable division of labor, and the total winter income reached about 26 million yuan, which, in addition to compensating for agricultural losses, also increased a large amount of income.

    吉林省农民利用副业收入扩大农业生产
    吉林省广大农民利用冬季副业生产的收入，添车买马，扩大农业生产。据不完全统计，全省农民从养猪、运输、编织、熬碱等多样性副业生产中，已收入二千八百多亿元，农民们把这些收入大部用于农业投资。据郭前旗等八个县的初步统计，已用副业收入买进马三千二百多匹，牛三千八百多头，羊数百只，胶皮车、花轮车、铁车共一千八百多台，修补旧车一百多台。这为今年的农业生产打下了雄厚的物质基础。部分受灾地区经过冬季生产已恢复原状，并为今年生产作了一些准备。磐石县用冬季生产收入修补和新建了一千多间房屋，灾民住屋问题基本解决。舒兰县灾区群众共收入十二亿七千多万元，购买了小米、高粱六十八万多斤，解决了冬衣三千九百多件，还买进了部分耕畜。该县八棵树村翟凤安农业生产合作社去年遭受水灾最重，平均每垧地减产二千多斤。在冬季生产中，把男女劳动力全部发动起来，合理分工，全冬季收入约达两千六百多万元，除弥补农业歉收外，还增加了大批收入。　（胡长清）
