Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 10th: Currently, agricultural workers at machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union are extensively engaged in competitions and are enthusiastically preparing for spring plowing. In many areas of the southern states, tractors have already begun to move into the fields. Collective farmers are transporting fertilizer to the fields, preparing seeds for spring sowing, and actively learning new agricultural production techniques. In this year's spring plowing, Soviet agricultural workers have much more powerful technical equipment than in previous years. In 1953, Soviet industry supplied 150,000 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per unit), 42,000 combines, and more than 2 million other agricultural machines and tools to machine tractor stations throughout the country. Machine tractor stations and collective farms in various regions have also increased the number of specialized personnel. Since the resolution of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee was promulgated, 100,400 agronomists, livestock breeders, and other technical personnel have gone to work in collective farms throughout the country. Nearly 21,000 engineers and technicians are working at machine tractor stations throughout the country. In addition, factories and institutions in various cities have launched a movement to help the countryside on a voluntary basis. In Moscow, 1,600 institutions and enterprises are helping the countryside with economic, political, and cultural education. Soviet agricultural workers, facing further prosperity, are about to begin spring plowing with new strength.

At the same time, collective farms in various regions have successively formulated production plans for further developing agriculture and animal husbandry this year. The production plan of the Voroshilov Collective Farm in the Yarichik District of the Chuvash Autonomous Republic stipulates that the grain yield per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) of land should be increased to 22 quintals, an increase of 4.4 quintals compared to 1953; the planting area and yield per unit area of potatoes and vegetables should be increased and improved; the milk production per dairy cow should be increased to 2,200 kilograms, an increase of approximately 600 kilograms compared to 1953; and the collective farm's annual cash income should reach 3.5 million rubles, an increase of nearly 1.5 million rubles compared to last year. The New Nikolaev Machine Tractor Station in the Krasnodar Territory and the collective farms served by the station decided that this year they would increase the yield per hectare of winter wheat to 27 quintals, corn to 33 quintals, and sunflowers to 21 quintals.

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: Factories and scientific research institutions throughout the Soviet Union are constantly designing and manufacturing many new machines to further mechanize potato and vegetable planting and animal husbandry work.

In terms of potato cultivation mechanization, the Soviet Union recently manufactured a four-row potato ridging and soil cultivation machine. It has four parts, each equipped with a device that can simultaneously apply mineral fertilizers on both sides. During ridging, it can simultaneously perform weeding, inter-row loosening, ridging, and topdressing of mineral fertilizers. This machine is operated by one person and can cultivate 10 to 12 hectares (15 mu per hectare) of potato fields per day. The Kuibyshev Machine Manufacturing Factory recently manufactured the "KAR-2" potato harvesting combine. This combine can harvest two rows of potatoes at the same time. It digs the potatoes out of the soil, removes the stems, leaves, and soil, and then loads them into large baskets. It can replace the labor of dozens of people and can harvest 5 hectares of potatoes every ten hours. Engineers at the Altai Tractor Factory recently designed a device called a creeper for the "DT-54" tractor, enabling the "DT-54" tractor to plant potatoes using the square-cluster planting method.

In terms of vegetable planting mechanization, the Moscow Experimental Factory of the All-Union Institute of Agriculture recently manufactured a "SPH-4" four-row combined machine for planting tomatoes, cabbage, and other vegetables using the square-cluster planting method. When planting seedlings, the tractor pulling this machine moves along the surveyed line set on the land. There is a knot every 60 to 70 centimeters on the surveyed line, and these knots hit the metal bucket on the seeder. As the shaft on the machine rotates, the metal bucket containing peat humus clods with seedlings falls onto the furrow opener. The furrow opener opens four parallel furrows on the ground. A special lever opens the bottom of the metal bucket, so that every 60 to 70 centimeters, four peat humus clods fall into the furrows at the same time. This new machine can plant 45,000 seedlings with peat humus clods on two hectares of land every ten hours. This year, the Soviet Union plans to produce 200 of these machines for collective farms and state farms.

In terms of animal husbandry mechanization, the Soviet Agricultural Machinery Research Institute recently designed a combine for silage of pasture grass, corn, sunflowers, and other crops. After cutting the crops, this combine can transport them to the press by conveyor belt for pressing, then load them into the chopper for chopping, and finally unload them onto the vehicle connected to the combine. It can ensilage one and a half hectares of crop stalks per hour. Soviet engineers have also designed a new feed processing combine and the "ELPU-1" steam power unit. The new feed processing combine mechanizes the entire process of processing tubers and root feeds. It first washes and chops the root and tuber feeds, then sends them to a specially equipped bucket for steaming, then mixes them with concentrated feed, and automatically separates them into certain portions by a special device. This combine can process 500 kilograms of feed per hour. The "ELPU-1" steam power unit can supply electricity and heat to livestock farms. It can generate 200 to 250 kilowatt-hours of electricity and a large amount of steam during each work shift. This steam can heat 1,000 to 1,200 liters of water per hour for preparing feed, washing utensils, etc. The remaining steam and hot water can also heat the collective farm's hotbeds and greenhouses.

    苏联农业劳动者积极准备春耕
    工厂制出许多种植马铃薯和蔬菜的新机器
    【新华社莫斯科十日电】目前，苏联各地机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄的农业劳动者，正在广泛展开竞赛，热情充沛地进行春耕的准备工作。在南方各州的许多地区，拖拉机已开始向田野出动。集体农民正在向田间运送肥料，准备春播用的种子，并积极学习新的农业生产技术。在今年的春耕中，苏联农业劳动者有着比往年强大得多的技术装备。一九五三年，苏联工业为各地机器拖拉机站补充了十五万台（每台以十五匹马力计算）拖拉机，四万二千台联合机和二百多万台其他农业机器和农具。各地机器拖拉机站和集体农庄还增加了大量的专门人材。自从苏共中央一九五三年九月全体会议的决议颁布以来，已有十万零四千个农学家、饲畜家以及其他技术人员到各地集体农庄去工作。到各地机器拖拉机站工作的将近有二万一千个工程师和技术人员。此外，各城市的工厂和机关都开展了义务帮助农村的运动。莫斯科就有一千六百个机关和企业帮助农村进行经济、政治和文化教育的工作。面临着进一步繁荣的苏联农业劳动者，就要凭借着新的力量开始春耕了。
    同时，各地的集体农庄已先后制订了今年进一步发展农业和饲畜业的生产计划。楚瓦斯自治共和国雅里齐克区伏罗希洛夫集体农庄今年的生产计划规定：每公顷（合十五市亩）土地的谷物单位面积产量要提高到二十二公担，比一九五三年增加四点四公担；马铃薯、蔬菜的播种面积和单位面积产量都要增大和提高；每头乳牛的产奶量要提高到二千二百公斤，比一九五三年约增加六百公斤；农庄全年的现金收入要达到三百五十万卢布，比去年将近增加一百五十万卢布。克拉斯诺达边疆区的新尼古拉耶夫机器拖拉机站和该站所服务的各集体农庄决定：今年要把每公顷冬小麦的单位面积产量提高到二十七公担，玉蜀黍提高到三十三公担，向日葵提高到二十一公担。
    【新华社十一日讯】苏联各地工厂和科学研究机关不断设计和制造出许多新机器，使马铃薯和蔬菜种植及饲畜工作进一步机械化。
    在马铃薯耕作机械化方面，苏联最近制造了一种四行马铃薯中耕培土机。它有四个部分，每部分装有一个两面能同时施放矿质肥料的装置。中耕时，它可以同时做除杂草、行间松土、培土和追施矿质肥料的工作。这种机器由一个人操使，每天可以中耕十到十二公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）的马铃薯田地。古比雪夫机器制造工厂不久以前制造出“卡尔—二”式马铃薯收获联合机。这种联合机同时可以收获两行马铃薯。它把马铃薯从土中挖起，去掉上面的茎叶和泥土，然后再装入大篮中。它可以代替几十个人的劳动，每十小时能收获五公顷马铃薯。阿尔泰拖拉机工厂的工程师最近为“德特—五四”式拖拉机设计了一种叫缓行器的装置，使“德特—五四”式拖拉机能够用正方穴播法来栽种马铃薯。
    在蔬菜种植机械化方面，全苏农业研究所莫斯科实验工厂，最近制造出一种用正方穴播法种植番茄、甘蓝和其他蔬菜的“CPH—四”式四行联动机。栽种菜秧时，曳引这种机器的拖拉机沿着设置在土地上的量准线走动。量准线每隔六十到七十公分有一结点，这些结点打动播种器上的金属斗。机器上的轴一转动，盛有带着菜秧的泥炭腐植泥块的金属斗就落到开沟器上。开沟器在地上开出四条平行的沟。有一个特别装置的杠杆把金属斗的底打开，这样，每隔六十到七十公分，金属斗内就同时有四块泥炭腐植泥块落入沟中。这种新机器每十小时可以在两公顷土地上种四万五千棵附有泥炭腐植泥块的菜秧。今年苏联计划为集体农庄和国营农场生产二百台这种机器。
    在饲畜业机械化方面，苏联农业机器研究所最近设计了一种青储牧草、玉蜀黍、向日葵等作物的联合机。这种联合机把农作物割下后，可以由运输带把它们送到压榨器上压榨，然后再装到切削器内切削，最后卸到连挂在联合机上的车上。它每小时可以青储一公顷半农作物茎杆。苏联工程师还设计了一种新式饲料加工联合机和“尔普—一”式汽力装置。新的饲料加工联合机把块茎和块根饲料加工的整个过程都机械化了。它先把块根和块茎饲料洗净、切碎，再把它们送入一种特别装置的桶中蒸热，然后把它们和精饲料混合，并由一种特殊装置把它们按一定的分量自动分开来。这种联合机每小时可加工五百公斤饲料。“尔普—一”式汽力装置可以为饲畜场供应电力和热。它在每一个工作班的时间内可以发出二百到二百五十瓩时的电力和大量的蒸汽。这些蒸汽每小时可以加热一千到一千二百公升水，以调制饲料、洗涤器具等。剩余的蒸汽和热水还可以为集体农庄的温床和温室加热。
