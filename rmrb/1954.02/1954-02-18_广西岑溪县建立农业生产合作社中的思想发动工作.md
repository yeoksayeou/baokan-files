In Cenxi County, Guangxi Province, five new agricultural production cooperatives have been established. In the early stages of their establishment, the main ideological problems reflected by the members were: first, a lack of deep understanding of the general line, leading to blind participation; second, fear of reduced income and losses after joining the cooperative. Therefore, deeply studying the general line and specifically addressing the fear of losses are currently the primary keys to building successful agricultural production cooperatives.

In the work of establishing cooperatives, Cenxi County first used specific facts to conduct a profound comparative education on the two paths for farmers. In the discussion at Li Kaidi Cooperative, three typical examples were found: one was middle peasant Li Shiqiu, who, due to a small labor force and a sick wife, was exploited by usurious loans in the famine months of 1951, eventually leading to land mortgaging and bankruptcy. The second was middle peasant Gao Xingjian, a family of nine cultivating eight mu of land, owning a large water buffalo (worth 1.4 million yuan) and a meat pig (worth 440,000 yuan), living well, but suddenly encountering disaster in September last year when the buffalo died of pestilence, and the pigs and chickens also died, leading to bankruptcy within a few days. After bankruptcy, he was fortunate to receive assistance from the credit cooperative, borrowing 500,000 yuan to buy back a buffalo, avoiding exploitation by usurious loans. The third example was middle peasant Li Zhenwen (who has risen to the level of a rich peasant), who used his surplus capital to engage in hoarding soybeans and oil, also making tofu, and has begun to buy land.

Discussing these three typical examples allowed the masses to understand from vivid examples that the capitalist path is a painful path, recognizing the principle of the big fish eating the small fish. Then, comparing the small-scale peasant economy with the agricultural production cooperative, such as what would have happened to Gao Xingjian without the help of the credit cooperative? Everyone helped him calculate an account. If the 500,000 yuan he borrowed was a usurious loan, it would be equivalent to ten dan of grain in principal. Borrowing in September and repaying in November, the total principal and interest would be fifteen dan. His late rice income was twenty-four dan, repaying fifteen dan, and after deducting investment, seeds, and public grain, there would be no grain left. However, if Gao Xingjian was in an agricultural production cooperative, it would be different. The cattle would be guaranteed in value by the cooperative; if the cattle died, the cooperative would be jointly responsible. Luo Jinchang said: "It would be impossible for Gao Xingjian to bear 150 jin alone, but if our entire cooperative of twenty-nine households divide it, we can pick it up with one hand." This powerfully illustrated that agricultural production cooperatives can use collective strength to overcome various natural disasters and diseases, avoiding the harms of capitalism and moving towards collective prosperity.

Secondly, when studying the advantages of mutual aid and cooperation, in addition to summarizing the achievements of mutual aid teams and pointing out the contradictions that mutual aid teams cannot solve due to decentralized management and collective labor, it is necessary to continuously educate the members with the advantages that agricultural production cooperatives have already demonstrated.

Li Kaidi Cooperative has a total of ninety-nine mu of land, of which eleven mu are cultivated soil fields. In the mutual aid team, due to the limitations of decentralized management, the collective strength could not be used to change the soil quality. After turning into a cooperative, this became possible. The entire cooperative has sixty laborers, planning to spend one day accumulating green manure (already underway) and one day shoveling sod and piling manure, for a total of two days, to complete the task of piling 1,500 dan of fertilizer. Using this 1,500 dan of fertilizer can change the soil quality of the eleven mu of cultivated soil fields. The entire cooperative has five fish ponds. Under decentralized management, on the one hand, due to the limitations of funds, it was not possible to raise more fish; on the other hand, it was necessary to take care of agriculture and not specialize in management, so the income was not large. After unified management by the cooperative, collective strength can be used to solve the difficulty of investment; and two members with experience in fish farming can be assigned to specialize in management, and the income can be doubled. The entire cooperative has twelve mu of dry land. Under decentralized management, some households with little labor only planted once a year, or could not plant in time, resulting in very low income. After turning into a cooperative, they plan to plant economic crops such as soybeans and peanuts uniformly, and can also uniformly process and fertilize to increase yields. These facts all demonstrate the advantages of agricultural production cooperatives.

Thirdly, it is necessary to conduct socialist future education for the members. Emphasize that the agricultural production cooperatives we are currently establishing are of a semi-socialist nature, and will be developed into agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature in the future (that is, collective farms). The members of Li Kaidi Cooperative visited the state-owned Xijiang Machinery Farm, and everyone was most interested in tractors. Therefore, we used tractors to promote the future of socialism. Socialist production is collectivization and mechanization. The scattered and backward individual economy cannot carry out large-scale production. Only agricultural production cooperatives can carry out large-scale production because agricultural production cooperatives are uniformly managed. Although the current cooperatives are still of a semi-socialist nature, they can be gradually developed and gradually transition to agricultural production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature.

Finally, it is necessary to promote national industrialization. Without industrialization, there will be no tractors, and no good material and cultural life. In short, without industrialization, we cannot reach socialism. At the same time, it is also necessary to link the cooperative to selling grain to the state and doing a good job in production, producing more grain to support national industrialization.

In general, studying the general line should not be done generally, but should be constantly linked to reality, combining abstract principles with specific facts, combining immediate interests with long-term interests, and combining personal interests with national interests. In this way, the glory of the general line can penetrate the hearts of the people and illuminate the road forward for farmers.

As for solving the fear of losses, we adopted two methods of accounting:

The first method is to mobilize the members to calculate the increased production after turning into a cooperative. Li Kaidi calculated six items of increased production after turning into a cooperative: (1) Transforming eleven mu of cultivated soil fields, increasing production by 1,100 jin per year; (2) Managing dry land, increasing production by 550 jin; (3) Processing and fertilizing 17.89 mu of lean land, increasing production by 1,800 jin; (4) Managing fish ponds, increasing the value of grain by 5,500 jin; (5) The mutual aid team originally had a brick kiln, which, when operated by the cooperative, can fire three kilns a year, increasing the value of grain by 3,300 jin; (6) Raising pigs, increasing the value of grain by 1,200 jin. The total increased production is 13,450 jin. Fish ponds can accumulate 500 dan of pond mud per year, brick kilns can obtain 96 dan of ash after firing three times, and raising pigs can obtain 2,200 dan of manure and water.

The greatest advantage of calculating increased production is to allow members to see the prospect of increased production and believe that production can be increased after turning into a cooperative. When calculating, it is necessary to calculate among the key members first, so that the key members have a basis, and then calculate among the members. The calculation must go through full discussion by the members, and it must be calculated realistically, so that everyone believes that it can be done, in order to persuade people.

After calculating the first account, the fear of losses cannot be completely resolved. Because although the members believe that agricultural production cooperatives can increase production, they do not know whether they themselves will increase production. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to calculate the second account.

The second method of accounting is to preliminarily determine production and preliminarily determine the profit distribution ratio, and calculate the income accounts of each household. (1) First calculate the possible income account for this year. After discussion by the masses, see how much production can be increased on the basis of last year? How much is actually obtained after deducting the investment portion? (2) According to the principle of profit distribution within the determined production, calculate how much the land and labor profit distribution each account for? (3) Add the sideline income to the labor portion (all sideline income belongs to the labor force), and calculate the amount that each labor force should receive by averaging the labor force of the entire cooperative; (4) According to the land and labor of each household, calculate the income of the whole household, and then compare it with last year's income (investment and payment of work points should be excluded), to see if the income has increased.

Calculating this account allows members to know the bottom line of their income after joining the cooperative, and can specifically check whether the determined profit distribution ratio is appropriate. When the actual income of the entire cooperative increases, but the income of individual members decreases, or the labor profit distribution is too high and the land remuneration is low, this will harm the interests of farmers with little labor and more land; or the actual income of the entire cooperative has not reached the determined production amount, which may be because the land remuneration is too high, which will dampen the enthusiasm for production of those with more labor. Whenever such problems are encountered, the profit distribution ratio should be adjusted according to the actual situation. After Li Kaidi Cooperative converted all the land in the cooperative into standard mu, the determined production per mu was 700 jin. The proportional profit distribution within the determined production is: the actual income in 1953 was 67,928 jin of grain. If the production per mu increases by 50 jin in 1954, the annual income will be 72,980 jin, with an average of 737 jin per mu. According to this number, distributed proportionally, the income of each household has increased compared to 1953, and the labor income is 37 jin more than the land income. After repeated consideration by the members, it was believed that the originally stipulated distribution ratio was relatively reasonable.

Facts have proved that in cooperatives that have been accounted for, the members have a bottom line in their minds, and the fear of losses has been basically resolved. Due to the solution of this serious ideological problem, the enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperative is even higher. On this basis, studying the general line repeatedly is even more beneficial.

After initially solving the ideological problem, attention should also be paid to explaining policies and mastering policies. There are many specific policies for agricultural production cooperatives, and they cannot all be conveyed to the members at once. They should be conveyed step by step as each step is reached. First, it is necessary to explain the policy of how land is invested as shares and how dividends are distributed after investment. Many members believe that half of the profit distribution is to divide the land income into half for land and half for labor; they do not know that the land income, after deducting investment and public accumulation funds, is distributed proportionally within the determined production, and all income exceeding the determined production belongs to the labor force. When explaining policies, men generally accept them easily, while women find them difficult to accept; young people accept them easily, while old people find them difficult to accept. Therefore, in addition to general explanations, it is also necessary to hold women's meetings and elderly meetings separately for repeated explanations. Only when policies are explained clearly can everyone voluntarily join the cooperative.

When grasping the land and labor profit distribution policy, the main spirit is to ensure that the income of each member does not decrease compared to before joining the cooperative, and that it is conducive to the development of production. When deciding on the profit distribution ratio, what is easily produced is that cadres want to increase the labor remuneration, and members want to increase the land remuneration. Our cadres proceed from the idea of expanding the socialist component, and the members proceed from their level of awareness and practical needs, which often forms a conflict between the requirements of the cadres and the members. Therefore, the responsibility of the leaders lies in appropriately grasping the spirit of the policy, starting from the level of awareness of the masses, fully promoting democracy, and allowing the masses to discuss and negotiate themselves.

    广西岑溪县建立农业生产合作社中的思想发动工作
    谢奕
    广西省岑溪县新建了五个农业生产合作社。在建社初期，社员反映的主要的思想问题：一是对总路线的认识不深，入社带有盲目性；一是怕入社后，收入少会吃亏。因此，深入地学好总路线，具体地解决怕吃亏的思想，是当前建好农业生产合作社的首要关键。
    岑溪县在建社工作中，首先是用具体事实向农民进行了深刻的两条道路的对比教育。李开棣社在讨论中，找了三个典型——一个是中农李世球，因为劳动力少，妻子病，在一九五一年荒月时，受了高利贷的剥削，以后利上起利，终致当田而破产了。一个是中农高兴鉴，全家九人，耕八亩田，有大水牛一头（值一百四十万元），肉猪一条（值四十四万元），半大猪一条（值二十万元），生活过得好，但是在去年九月间，突然遇到灾难，牛发瘟死了，猪也死了，鸡也死了，前后数天的时间，破产了。破产后，幸得信用合作社的帮助，贷到五十万元，买回了一头牛，避免了高利贷的剥削。另一个典型是中农黎贞文（已上升为富农），他利用他的剩余资本，从事囤积黄豆、油，兼做豆腐生意，并已开始买田。
      讨论这三个典型，使群众从活生生的事例中，体会到资本主义的道路是一条痛苦的道路，认清了大鱼吃小鱼的道理。然后再将小农经济与农业生产合作社比较，如高兴鉴如果没有信用合作社的帮助会怎样呢？大家帮他算了一个账，假如他贷那五十万元是高利贷的话，折谷本十担，九月借十一月还，连本带利便要十五担。他的晚稻收入二十四担，还债十五担，再除投资、种子、交公粮等便没有谷了。但是，高兴鉴如果在农业生产合作社便不同了，耕牛由社保本保值；牛死了，社内共同负责。罗金昌说：“要高兴鉴一人担一百五十斤，他担不起，我们全社二十九户分开来担，用一个手便拈起了。”这样，有力地说明了农业生产合作社可用集体力量来克服各种自然灾害和疾病等的袭击，避免了资本主义的危害，而走向集体富裕的道路。
    其次，在学习互助合作的优越性时，除了总结互助组的成绩，并指出互助组有分散经营与集体劳动所不能解决的矛盾外，还要不断地用农业生产合作社已经表现出来的优越性来教育社员群众。
    李开棣社共有九十九亩土地，其中有十一亩是翻土田。在互助组时，由于分散经营的限制，不能用集体的力量来改变土质。转社以后，便有这个可能了。他们全社共有六十个劳动力，计划用一天时间积绿肥（已经进行），一天时间铲草皮、堆肥，总共两天时间，便可完成堆肥一千五百担的任务。用这一千五百担堆肥便可以把十一亩翻土田的土质改变过来。全社有鱼塘五口，在分散经营时，一方面因资金的限制，不能多养鱼；另方面，又要照顾农业不能专门经营，收入是不大的。由社统一经营后，可以用集体力量，解决投资困难；又可以分出两个有养鱼经验的社员专门管理，收入可以大二倍。全社有十二亩旱地，在分散经营时，有些劳力少的一年只种一次，或不能及时种下，收入很低；转社后，他们计划统一种上黄豆、花生等经济作物，而且可以统一加工加肥，提高产量。这些事实，都显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。
    再次，必须对社员进行社会主义前途教育。着重说明：目前我们所建立的农业生产合作社是半社会主义性质的，将来还要发展到完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（就是集体农庄）。李开棣社的社员参观了国营西江机械农场，大家最感兴趣的是拖拉机，因此我们就从拖拉机来宣传社会主义的前途，社会主义的生产，就是集体化、机械化。分散的落后的个体经济不能进行大规模的生产，只有农业生产合作社才可以进行大生产，因为农业生产合作社是统一经营的。目前合作社虽然还是半社会主义性质的，但是可以逐步发展，逐步过渡到完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。
    最后，就要宣传国家工业化。没有工业化，便没有拖拉机，也没有美好的物质文化生活。总之，没有工业化，便到不了社会主义。同时，还要联系到社要卖粮给国家和搞好生产，多打粮食，来支援国家工业化。
    总的来说，学习总路线，不要一般的学，要不断地联系实际，将抽象的道理与具体的事实结合起来，将眼前的利益与长远的利益结合起来，将个人的利益与国家的利益结合起来。这样总路线的光辉才能深入人心，照耀着农民前进的道路。
    至于解决怕吃亏的思想，我们采用了两个算账的办法：
    第一个办法，是发动社员来算转社后的增产账。李开棣算转社后的增产账有六项：（一）改造翻土田十一亩，每年增产一千一百斤；（二）经营旱地，可增产五百五十斤；（三）十七亩八分九厘瘦田加工加肥，可增产一千八百斤；（四）经营鱼塘，折谷可增五千五百斤；（五）互助组原有瓦窑一个，由社经营，一年可烧三窑，折谷可增三千三百斤；（六）养猪折谷可增一千二百斤。以上共可增产一万三千四百五十斤。鱼塘每年可以积塘泥五百担，瓦窑烧三次可得灰九十六担，养猪可得粪水二千二百担。
    算增产账最大的好处，就是使社员看见增产的前途，相信转社后可以增产。算时要先在骨干中算，算好了使骨干有一个底子，再到社员中去算。算账必须经过社员充分的讨论，要算得切实，使大家相信能够做到，以便说服人。
    算了第一个账，怕吃亏的思想还不能完全解决。因为社员虽然相信农业生产合作社可以增产，但自己是否增产呢？却摸不到底了。因此，必须接着算第二笔账。
    第二个算账的办法，就是初步定产，初步确定分红比例，算各家各户的收入账。（一）先算今年可能的收入账，经过群众讨论，看看在去年基础上能够增产多少？除去投资部分，实得多少？（二）根据定产以内分红原则，算出土地与劳动力分红各占多少？（三）劳力部分加上副业收入（副业收入全部为劳力所有），用全社劳动力平均，算出每个劳动力应得之数；（四）根据各家各户的土地与劳动力，算出全户的收入，再与去年收入（要除投资与付工分数）比较，看看收入是否增加。
    算这个账，可使社员摸到入社后的收入的底，又可具体检查所定分红比例是否确当。当全社的实际收入增加，而个别社员收入减少了，或者是劳力分红过高，土地报酬低了，这样就会损害劳力少、土地多的农民的利益；或者是全社实际收入没有达到定产数，那可能是土地报酬高了，这样就会打击劳动力多的生产积极性。凡是碰到这样的问题，就应该根据实际情况来调整分红比例。李开棣社将全社土地折成标准亩后，每亩定产七百斤，定产以内比例分红是：一九五三年的实际收入六万七千九百二十八斤谷，如果一九五四年每亩增产五十斤，则全年将可收入七万二千九百八十斤，平均每亩七百三十七斤，根据这个数目按比例来分配，每户的收入与一九五三年比较，都有增加，劳力所得比土地所得多了三十七斤。经过社员的反复考虑，认为原来规定的分配比例是比较合理的。
    事实证明：凡是经过算账的合作社，社员的心中都有了底，怕吃亏的思想基本上得到了解决。由于这个严重思想问题的解决，群众的入社的情绪更加高涨了。在这个基础上，再反复学习总路线，好处更大。
    初步解决了思想问题，还要注意交代政策，掌握政策。农业生产合作社的具体政策很多，不能一下子全部搬给社员，应是做到那一步，便交代那一步。首先要交代土地如何入股，入股后如何分红的政策。很多社员以为对半分红，是将土地的收入，土地一半，劳力一半；不知道土地收入，除投资与公积金外，定产以内按比例分红，定产以外归劳动力所有。交代政策时，一般是男人易接受，妇女难接受；青年人易接受，老年人难接受。因此，除了一般的交代之外，还要单独地召开妇女会与老人会反复解释。只有政策交代清楚了，才能做到人人自愿入社。
    在掌握土地与劳力分红政策时，主要的精神是要使每个社员的收入不致比入社前减少，并有利于发展生产。在决定分红比例时，容易产生的是：干部想把劳力报酬提高些，社员想把土地报酬提高些。我们干部是从扩大社会主义成份的思想出发，社员是从他的觉悟水平与实际要求出发，这样往往形成了干部与社员的要求相对立。因此，领导者的责任，就在于恰当地掌握政策精神，从群众的觉悟水平出发，充分发扬民主，让群众自己讨论协商。
