    From Battalion Commander to Section Chief
    I don't remember when I saw a picture of Yan Changjiu: the background was the arch of the continuous arch dam of the reservoir, and the sky with floating clouds above. He stood on the construction site in front of the arch, with his hands behind his back, a short and sturdy figure, full of spirit.
    Last year, on December 30th, a clear day. The clear water of the Pi River normally washed the beach. On the beach, the sky-blue cloth curtain was pulled up, and a red banner with white characters was hung:
    "The People's Congress of the Sixth Detachment of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir."
    Many workers in brand-new Lenin suits and overalls, military workers wearing "August 1st" military caps, and workers' family members—old ladies, young women, and children—were all particularly excited. Today, they will elect their beloved to be the people's representative. I listened to the ballot counting for a full hour, all chanting the same name: Yan Changjiu. The ballot counting only stopped when the teller recorded 796 votes.
    Squinting, I carefully aimed at the background of the venue, and I saw that five arches on the west bank had been poured to the top, with red flags flying on the top.
    Many people in front of Yan Changjiu were applauding, and several young girls were presenting him with flowers... Suddenly, a group of military workers and workers crowded around, lifting him very high, and then putting him down, lifting him up and down until he laughed so hard that his eyes were squinted and he couldn't even catch his breath. This Yan Changjiu, the section chief of the Sixth Section of the Fozi Ridge Project, was the publicly elected representative.
              ×　×　×
    He was originally a battalion commander who had been suppressing bandits in the Dabie Mountains for many years and had been wounded in action. In June 1952, with the reorganization of the troops into a water conservancy division, he became the leader of the carpentry team.
    Is it simple to ask someone who has been accustomed to ten years of military life to manage more than two hundred carpenters from all over the country? Even though he was mentally prepared: "The superiors want me to do this! Well, if the motherland needs me on the front lines in the future, I will be transferred back to the army to be the battalion commander of a engineering battalion... If there is no war, I will always contribute my strength to the construction cause. This is the responsibility of a Communist Party member." However, at that time, the west bank of the Pi River had just been cleared, and the carpentry team had just settled down. People were needed to open up the wilderness, and mud-walled thatched houses needed to be built. The carpenters couldn't find a whole job to do all day long, and they were just nailing doors and windows, making tables, stools, and furniture... There were few houses and many people, and the carpenters were squeezed into a mass. Daily necessities and tools were placed in a mess, and people were arguing all day long, arguing to the team headquarters:
      "My family members are here, how is the house?"
    "Do I still have to run several miles to carry the rice? Captain, I'll pay five thousand to hire someone..."
    Once work was over, no one would sit in the workers' dormitory. They would all stroll on the roads in the mountain bends and markets. It was nothing like the army.
    Yan Changjiu didn't understand technology, only "platoon and squad offensives," machine guns and rifles. He had nothing to say to those young technicians and workers who demanded progress. He only talked about battle stories, winning their admiration.
    Yan Changjiu knew that college students respected "old revolutionaries," but what about the set of scientific and technological knowledge that college students possessed? He didn't touch it at all, and even listening to terms like × inch square, diagonal bolts, and steel retaining rings was enough to torture him. "A soldier can still do this!" He always loved to play with the binoculars seized from the front lines, and he always loved to drink with his old comrades-in-arms and eat noodles. He felt particularly heartbroken when he had to turn in a Canadian pistol that he had used for many years. In a word, he missed the front lines.
    People didn't come to him either, saying: "He has battle stories to tell; he doesn't solve engineering problems."
    Yan Changjiu said: "I have become a grand administrator."
    At that time, the work area was carrying out an environmental sanitation campaign. He ran to a worker's dormitory and personally pulled a long rope for them, hung up each person's nameplate, and asked everyone to take out the washing utensils stuffed under the bunk and put them in order, hanging the towels in the washbasin one by one on the rope, gesturing with his fist: "Look! Look! Two fists apart, how good is that, neat and beautiful!"
    He also followed the habit of army life, requiring everyone's bedding to be folded with the opening facing inwards and the back facing outwards, how wide and how long, but the cotton quilts that the carpenters brought from home could not be folded neatly no matter what. Some elderly workers never brushed their teeth all year round, and their yellow teeth were filled with thick rice paste, and a puff of air would spray when they spoke. Yan Changjiu stared at an old man in his fifties and said:
    "You have to buy a toothbrush! In collective life, you have to be hygienic!"
    "I've never used this before," the old man shook his head, opening his big mouth: "Captain, look, I don't brush my teeth, and I haven't lost a single tooth!" Everyone laughed.
    A worker named Zhao Quansheng also said: "My family never paid attention to hygiene, and no one died..."
    He wanted everyone to share the food, and someone said: "I still have to spend money to buy bowls, and wash an extra bowl, it's too troublesome."
    In short, there were problems everywhere.
    He thought, can this still look like a team? The whole team had two hundred and eighteen people, with only two Party members and eight Youth League members. Even a small group meeting for the team leaders to make self-criticism couldn't be held. He angrily brought Zhao Quansheng over and severely criticized him, asking him to make a self-criticism in the small group meeting. In this way, the dormitory of this small group changed its appearance: saws and axes hung on one side of the earthen wall, washbasins were placed on tripods, and cotton quilts were folded uniformly. Yan Changjiu beamed with joy and said to the representatives sent to "observe and learn" from each group:
    "Look how good this is, neat and clean, when people go in, they have energy, it's so exciting!"
    Each group did it in this way.
            ×　×　×
    But, can a carpentry team leader be satisfied with this?
    Yan Changjiu was still depressed. He thought: Is construction even more difficult than war? During the war years, once, in order to cover the retreat of the brigade, he, the machine gunner, and the communicator were left behind and were chased by the enemy. They fought and retreated, suddenly his foot was hit by something, and he pulled it sideways. He felt a dizzy spell in his head, and knew that the enemy was still chasing behind. He struggled to stand firm, gritted his teeth, and dragged his calf hit by a bullet. Go! The communicator, Hu Dagezi, carried him on his back. As soon as he carried him away, the machine gun went silent, and the machine gunner was shot down to the ground. Yan Changjiu resolutely told the communicator to drag him down and carry him away; Hu Dagezi was strong, carrying one person and tucking away a machine gun, walking and firing a Mauser pistol. Yan Changjiu fiercely endured the pain, staggering and retreating. He could already hear the enemy panting behind him, and there were only a few steps away, so he put the Mauser pistol on his shoulder, "De! De! De!" He thought: "When the bullets are gone, there is still a knife!" He turned his head and saw that the enemy was lying on the ground and would not chase him anymore.
    "Can a soldier be blocked by 'difficulties'?" He often thought this way, and said this way: "Can I smack my lips and shake my head in front of the project?"
    In the spring of 1953, hundreds of flowers bloomed on the ridge. On the dam site on the west bank where the river water had been drained, steel and concrete piles were built like Western-style buildings. One after another, continuous arch dams were built on the Pi River. Each pile and arch had to rise to an elevation of 127.9 meters above sea level in order to completely control the raging floods. The most urgent tasks on the west bank were the seventh and eighth piles, which had already been built to an elevation of 75.7 meters. In order to install flood discharge pipes in April, they had to rush to increase the height by five meters. Various types of work were waiting for the carpenters to erect the wooden formwork, otherwise the cement and steel tying would be delayed, which would greatly affect the progress of other piles.
    So, can you say that the captain can still not use his brains?
    One day, it was drizzling. I saw the labor scene on these two piles, and I was really surprised. People didn't know who had encouraged them, but in such a chilly spring rainy day, they were so hot that they couldn't wear their clothes. The carpenters who were raising the height were wearing single clothes, carrying large materials weighing one or two hundred pounds on their shoulders, and went up on single planks; a six-inch nail in the hands of the old carpenters, with a "pada" of an axe, fell down more than half, and then completely sank in; the young Xiaoba group was hanging wooden forms on the pile, sorting out the wooden shell panels, only to see the wooden boards "pa! pa!" flying down;... At this time, I looked up and saw a soldier in a single military uniform on a platform next to a pile wall, directing the work, soaked in rain and sweat. I didn't greet him. At this time, non-staff personnel called him, either he couldn't hear or he ignored you, and I watched him thoughtfully. He was Yan Changjiu.
    When the workers got off work, he was still immersed in wet clothes, standing on the construction site, looking at the day's labor achievements, wondering what other ideas he was thinking about. I walked up to him and gave him a nudge on the elbow, and he turned his head. I asked with a smile:
    "You've gotten into it, haven't you!"
    "Hey! Not simple?" He blinked his eyes: "We should follow the mass line. You see, originally our equipment warehouse was in Hedong, but we moved it over, and as soon as the materials are closer, everyone's enthusiasm is high. This is like the ammunition depot in the rear, if it is too far away from the front, it will affect the battle!" He pointed to the mixing plant again: "The big-bellied mixer is like a cannon, it doesn't move. The road to transport materials up is the 'road of advancement'. In the past, the labor organization was unreasonable, and there were too many people in the small construction site to squeeze in. Now the labor organization has also changed, and the enthusiasm is even higher..."
    On the way back to the team, I asked him how he got into it? He said:
    "Hey! Didn't you go to the reservoir headquarters meeting that time?" I nodded. He said: "The superiors said that the carpentry team is now the vanguard. If the peach blossom flood comes and there is a leak in the flood discharge, not only the technical captain will be responsible, but the administrative captain will be even more responsible." He imitated the tone of a political commissar: "Commissar × said with a shake of his head: The Party cannot forgive you. If you don't understand, you won't understand it for the rest of your life!"
    "How is it today?" As soon as he arrived at the team headquarters, he excitedly asked a young technician:
    "We've caught our breath." The man said.
    Hearing these words, he cracked his mouth, squinted his eyes, and laughed ha ha ha! As if he had never had any worries before.
    That night, he told me even more excitedly: "You see, originally it would take a day and a half to build a platform, but today it only took two and a half hours; originally, one group could hang up to twelve wooden form shells in one shift, but today, they hung sixty-eight at once; which group did it? The Xiaoba group did it. They have many Youth League members, and their enthusiasm is great. In the past, the master craftsmen didn't give them whole jobs, they only did some hanging slides and carrying wood... Hey! Once they do the big jobs, their energy comes... They set a new record."
    From then on, Yan Changjiu talked not only about how to kill the enemy, but also about how to race against the flood. Young technical cadres, pattern makers, and workers also often came to him to talk about engineering problems.
              ×　　×　　×
    Soon, he became the section chief of the Sixth Section of the Fozi Ridge Project.
    In the summer, the Pi River became furious. After the rain, mountain torrents broke out, and the flood with a flow rate of 3,300 cubic meters per second rushed like ten thousand horses across the unfinished continuous arch dam, taking away wood, thatched houses, and machines, and bending steel sheet piles... Afterwards, the people of Fozi Ridge said: "The project was washed away by the flood for three months."
    In order to enable the reservoir to store water before the flood season in 1954, the work area implemented a parallel flow operation method, and various types of work were mixed and formed into work sections. The Sixth Section specialized in pouring the circular arched arches, which was the most technical, but no one had any experience. The project department quota required them to pour two and a half times a month, raising the height by six meters each time. The height could be raised by fifteen meters per month.
    Yan Changjiu went to the construction site every day. He observed the workers pulling wooden formwork on the arch, squeezed together on it. Some were busy without rest, while others were idle with their bare hands, unable to exert their strength. The helpers—temporary workers—were always looking up under the arch, waiting for the wooden formwork to be pulled up. "This is like a platoon ambushing in a narrow valley, squeezed into a lump, hindering each other, unable to deploy firepower..." he thought. He also went to the platform to observe the cement workers, where the work was also uneven, everyone wanted to work faster and increase production for the country, but the carpentry progress was too slow, so they had to transfer the idle cement workers out to carry materials. The cement workers had many opinions. "We could have opened dozens more carts of materials: this..."
    A team leader of the first carpentry team, which usually had the highest work efficiency, also reflected:
    "Section Chief, using twenty-four technicians and twenty factory workers on one arch in one shift is too wasteful."
    "Yes! How do you think it should be changed?"
    "I say using one team or one and a half teams of technicians is enough."
    "Your team has high work efficiency anyway. If you reduce the number of technicians, can everyone still do it?"
    But, he had already accepted the opinions put forward by the carpenters in his heart, and went deeper into the construction site to study and observe without slackening. After about ten days, he relied on the problems he saw and the reflections of some workers, and then consulted with the technical cadres. Everyone agreed that the number of technicians could be reduced, but there were different opinions on how to combine them. Yan Changjiu felt that this "rationalization proposal" of the working masses was advanced, so he boldly decided to improve the labor organization. From various divergent opinions, he decided to adopt a method of using one team of technicians as two teams, and inserting temporary workers into the technicians.
    "Why?" He explained to the technicians and carpentry team leaders: "According to the current combination, some technicians are also like temporary workers, they have to be idle; temporary workers, hope to learn some big jobs, inserting them can learn technology, reducing technicians, each technician can play a role, and can also take apprentices... In this way, the enthusiasm for increasing production must be even higher."
    "Then how many technicians and temporary workers should be used?" A technician in the technical department of the project department asked, holding a pen.
      "Six technicians and four temporary workers make up a team..."
    This decision was "tested typically" in the fourth team. As a result, what originally took four teams sixteen hours and two shifts to complete was shortened to two teams eight hours and one shift to complete, and the enthusiasm of the workers was indeed improved.
    Is this still the old battalion commander who could only tell battle stories before? Yes, it's still him. Now, in every engineering meeting, after listening to some technicians saying "difficulties" and saying "no confidence," he always comes up with his own methods. In October, when discussing the work plan, people always asked suspiciously about his "three pulls and three pours" (that is, pulling wooden formwork and pouring cement to increase the height three times in a month):
      "Don't blindly rush ahead! Do you have any confidence at all?"
    "I have confidence, no problem!" He counted on his fingers, telling everyone how much work each type of work could complete in one shift, and how this part or that part of the project could be completed in just a few hours, or even shortened... It seemed that everything was in the palm of his hand. To be honest, he even thought it might be possible to achieve "four pulls and four pours"!
    When the third arch reached the top, at the celebration meeting to celebrate the early reaching of the top, a water conservancy expert who was nearly sixty years old said excitedly: "China's and the Far East's first arch has reached the top!" The political commissar of the Fozi Ridge Reservoir personally awarded a big red flag, and Yan Changjiu accepted this red flag.
    This flag fluttered high on the top of the third arch. Many workers scrambled to climb up, asking to take a photo. Knowing clearly that the camera lens was facing upwards from below the arch where even talking could not be heard, and people would be so small that they would look like ants and could not be seen, but people still laughed so hard that they couldn't catch their breath, just like I didn't take a breath when I quickly moved the lens.

    从营长到段长
    晓鹰
    记不清什么时候，我见过阎长久的一张像片：背景是水库连拱坝的拱，顶上是飘云的天空，他就站在拱前工地上，背着手，矮而结实的个子，是那样有精神。
    去年十二月三十日，一个晴朗的日子。渒河碧清的水照常的冲刷着沙滩。沙滩上，天蓝色的布幕拉起来了，还挂上一块红底白字的横额：
    “佛子岭水库第六区队普选大会。”
    许多穿着簇新的列宁装、工装，戴着平整的鸭舌帽的工人，戴“八一”军帽的军工，工人的家属——老大娘、少妇、小孩子等，都格外兴奋。今天，他们要推选自己心爱的人当人民代表。我听唱票的足足唱了一个钟头，都是唱的同一个名字：阎长久。直到记票员记到七九六票，唱票的才歇嘴。
    我眯着眼细瞄这会场的背景时，只见西岸有五个拱都浇到顶了，顶上飘着红旗。
    阎长久的前面许多人在鼓掌，几个年青的姑娘向他献花……忽然间，一群军工、工人拥过去，把他抬得很高，又放下来，一上一下的抬得他笑成迷眼，连气都喘不过来了。这位佛子岭工程第六段段长阎长久就是公选出来的代表。
              ×　×　×
    他原是一个营长，在大别山区剿了多年的匪，也挂过彩。一九五二年六月，随着部队改编成水利师，他当了木工队长。
    要一个过惯了十年军事生活的人，去管理二百多个来自各地的木工，你说简单吗？纵然，他在思想上有这样的准备：“上级要我干这嘛！也好，将来祖国前线需要，调我回部队的时候，当个工兵营营长……要是没有战争，就永远在建设事业上贡献自己的力量，这是共产党员应有的责任。”可是，那时候，渒河西岸刚清基，木工队刚安家，荒山野岭要人开，泥墙草房要人盖，木工整天捞不到做整活，净是钉门窗、做桌、凳、家具……房少人多，木工们挤成一疙瘩，生活用具、工具都放得乱七八糟的，成天有人吵架，一吵吵到队部里：
      “我的家属来了，房子到底怎么样？”
    “吃的米还要跑几里路去背？队长，我出五千，雇人……”
    工作一完，没有一个坐在工人宿舍里的，他们都到山弯里、市场上逛马路去了。一点不像部队里那样。
    阎长久不懂技术，只懂“班排进攻”，机枪步枪，对于那些年青的要求进步的技术人员和工人没有什么可讲，净扯战斗故事，赢得他们啧啧羡慕。
    阎长久知道大学生尊敬“老革命”，大学生的一套科学技术呢？他却不沾边，连听听×寸方、对销螺丝、钢围令也够受了。“当兵的还能干这个！”他老爱玩那些前线缴来的望远镜，老爱跟老战友打酒，擀面条吃，特别是觉得用了多年的一支加拿大手枪上缴了多痛心。一句话，怀恋着前方。
    人家也不来找他，说：“要听他的战斗故事，有；工程找他也不解决问题。”
    阎长久说：“我当大事务长了。”
    那时工区正搞环境卫生运动。他跑到一个工人宿舍里，亲自给他们拉好一条长绳，挂上各人的名牌，要大家把塞在铺下的洗脸用具都拿出来放齐，把面盆里的毛巾一条一条挂在绳上，用拳头比划着：“看！看！隔两个拳头，这有多好，又整齐，又美观！”
    他还依照部队生活的习惯，各人的被褥也要口朝里，背朝外，摺得多宽，多长，可是，木工从家庭里带来的棉被怎么也叠不齐。有几个老年工人终年不刷牙，黄板牙里米饭糊得多厚，讲话喷股气。阎长久盯着一个五十多岁的老头说：
    “你要买一把牙刷！集体生活，要讲卫生！”
    “这玩艺我没使过”，老头摇摇头，张着大嘴：“队长，你看我不刷牙，牙齿一颗也没掉啊！”说得大家哈哈笑。
    有个工人赵泉生也说：“我家里从来不讲卫生，也没死个人……”
    他要大家分菜吃，有人说：“还要花钱买碗，多洗个碗，这太麻烦。”
    总之，到处有问题。
    他想，这还能像个队？全队二百十八人，总共只有两个党员，八个团员，要分队长开个小组会检讨，也开不起来。他恼火地找来赵泉生，狠狠的批评了一顿，要他在小组会里检讨。这样，这个小组的宿舍里就改了样子：锯子、斧挂在一边土壁上，面盆放在三脚架上，棉被一律摺叠。阎长久眉飞色舞，给各组派来“观摩”的代表说：
    “你们看这样多好，又周整，又干净，人一进去，就有精神，多带劲！”
    各组就照这样子做了。
            ×　×　×
    但是，一个木工队长，这样能满足吗？
    阎长久还是苦闷。他想：建设还比战争困难？在战争的年月里，有一次，他为掩护大队的退却，他和机枪手、通讯员落在后面，给敌人撵上了，他们边打边退，忽然脚给什么打了一下，朝横里一掣，头一阵昏，知道敌人还在跟后撵呢。他使劲站住，咬着牙，拖着给子弹打中的小腿，走！通讯员胡大个子把他背着走。刚背走，机枪哑了，机枪手给射倒在地上，阎长久坚决叫通讯员把他拖下来，背了走；胡大个子力大，背了一个人，掖了一枝机枪，边走边打驳壳枪。阎长久狠狠地忍住痛，一歪一歪的退走，他已经听到敌人在后面喘气了，已经没有几步远了，就把盒子枪搁上肩，“得！得！得！”他想：“子弹打完了，还有把小刀！”他回头一看，敌人躺在地上，再也不撵上来了。
    “一个军人还能给‘困难’挡住吗？”他常常这样想，这样讲：“自己能在工程面前啧嘴摇头吗？”
    一九五三年春天，岭上百花盛开，抽干了河水的西岸坝址上，钢筋、混凝土的垛子像洋楼一样建筑起来了，一座一座的连拱坝筑在渒河上。每一座垛、拱都要升到拔海一二七点九高程，才能完全控制汹涌的洪水。西岸最紧张的是七、八两个垛，已经筑到七十五点七的高程了，为了四月份安装泄洪管，要抢高五公尺，各种工种等待木工把木模壳立起来，否则水泥、扎铁都将延工了，对其他垛子的工程进度影响很大。
    这样，你说队长还能不动脑筋？
    有一天，天洒着牛毛细雨，我见了这两个垛上的劳动场面，真感到惊奇。人们不知受了谁的鼓舞，在那样春寒料峭的阴雨天，热得衣服都穿不住。升高的木工，穿着单衣，肩扛一、二百斤的大料，在独木板上，踋颠颠上去了；六寸钉在老木匠手里“拍哒”一斧头，落下一大半，再一下完全陷下去；年青的小八组在垛上吊木模，整理木壳板，只见木板“拍！拍！”飞下来；……就在这时，我抬头望见一个垛壁旁边一个平台上，一个身穿单军装的给雨水、汗水淋得湿透的军人在那里指挥着。我没有招呼他，这时，非工作人员喊他，他不是听不见，就是不睬你，我沉思地望着他。他就是阎长久。
    工人们下班了，他还浸在湿衣服里，站在工地上，望着一天的劳动成绩，不知还想着什么点子。我走近了他，掣了他一下留拐，他才扭过头来。我笑嘻嘻地问：
    “你钻进去了吧！”
    “嗨！不简单？”他眨眨眼睛：“应当走群众路线。你看，本来我们器材仓库在河东，把他搬过来了，出料一近，大家情绪就高。这好比后方的弹药库，它离前方过远，要影响战斗啊！”他又朝拌和厂指了一指：“大肚子拌和机好比大炮，不动的。运料上去的路途，就是‘前进道路’，过去劳动组合也不合理，工地小人多挤不开，现在劳动组合也变了，情绪更高……”
    在回队的路上，我问他怎么钻进去的？他说：
    “嗨！那次水库指挥部开会，你没有去？”我点点头。他说：“上级说木工队现在是先锋队，要是桃花水来，泄洪出了漏子，不但技术队长要负责，行政队长更要负责。”他模仿着一个政委的口气：“×政委头一摆说：党不能原谅你们。不懂，你不钻进去，一辈子也不懂！”
    “今天怎么样啊？”他一到队部里，兴高采烈的问一个年青的技术员：
    “喘过气来了。”那人说。
    他听了这句话，裂着嘴，眯着眼，笑得哈哈哈！像从来没有过愁苦一样。
    当晚，他更兴奋地告诉我：“你看，本来搭好平台得一天半，今天只花两个半钟点；本来，一个组一班顶多吊十二块木模壳，今天，一下吊了六十八块；那个组干的呢？小八组干的。他们青年团员多，劲头大，从前，老师傅不给他们干整活，净是干些挂滑槽，背木料……嗨！大活一干啊，劲都来了……搞了个最高纪录。”
    从此，阎长久讲的不只是怎样杀敌人，而是怎样与洪水赛跑。年青的技术干部、翻样师、工人也常常来找他讲工程问题了。
              ×　　×　　×
    不久，他就当了佛子岭工程第六段段长。
    夏季里，渒水发了怒。雨后山洪暴发，三千三百秒公方的流量的大水像万马奔腾的冲过没有筑好的连拱坝，带走了木料、草房子，带走了机器，冲弯了钢板桩……事后，佛子岭的人们说：“工程给洪水冲走了三个月。”
    为了使水库在一九五四年汛期前能够蓄水，工区实行平行流水作业法，各个工种混合编成工段，第六段专门浇筑圆拱形的拱，技术性最高，但谁也没有经验。工程处定额，要他们每月浇二次半，每次升高六公尺。每月可升高十五公尺。
    阎长久天天到工地去。他观察拱上拉木模壳的工人，挤在上面，有的忙得不歇，有的徒手闲扯，使不上劲，帮手——临时工也老在拱下仰着头，等着木模壳拉上去。“这像一个在狭窄的山谷里打伏击的排挤成一疙瘩，互相妨碍，展不开火力……”他这样想。他又到平台上去观察水泥工，那里也是忙闲不匀，人人想干得快些，给国家增产，就是木工进度太慢了，只好把宕工的水泥工人调出去背料。水泥工意见纷纷。“我们本来可以多开几十车料的：这……”
    一个平时工作效率最高的木工一组组长也反映：
    “段长，一个拱上班用二十四个技工，二十个厂工，太浪费了。”
    “对！你看怎么改吧？”
    “我说用一个组或者一个半组技工就够了。”
    “你的组工作效率本来就高，减少技工，大家是不是能干得了？”
    但，他心里已经接受了木工们提的意见，更不放松的深入工地去研究，去观察。大约经过了十天，他凭自己看到的问题，凭有些工人的反映，再和技术干部商量。大家一致认为可以减少技工，但怎么组合，各人的意见不一。阎长久觉得工人群众这种“合理化建议”是先进的，他就大胆的决定改进劳动组合，他从各种纷歧的意见中决定采取一组技工当两组用，把临时工插到技工中去。
    “为什么呢？”他向技工、木工小组长们解释：“照现在的组合，有的技工也像临时工一样，要宕；临时工呢，巴望能学些拉大活，把他插上去，可学技术，把技工减少，每个技工都能发挥作用，还能带徒弟……这样增产情绪一定更高。”
    “那么采用几个技工？几个临时工？”一个工程处技术室里的技术员握着钢笔问。
      “六个技工，四个临时工组成一组……”
    这个决定，就在第四组“典型试验”了，结果原来四个组十六小时二班完成的，缩短为二个组八小时一班完成了，工人情绪果然都提高了。
    这还是以前只能讲战斗故事的老营长吗？是的，还是他。现在，他在每次的工程会议上，静听了一些技术人员叫“困难”说“没把握”以后，他总是拿出他的办法来。十月份，讨论作业计划时候，人家对他的“三拉三浇”（即一个月内拉木模壳、浇水泥升高三次）总是怀疑地问：
      “不能盲目冒进啊！到底有没有把握啊？”
    “有把握，没问题！”他扳着指头，向大家讲了各种工种一班完成多少工作，这部分或那部分工程只要几小时完成，或者还可缩短……等等。好像什么都在他的手掌心里。说实话，他甚至想还有可能做到“四拉四浇”哩！
