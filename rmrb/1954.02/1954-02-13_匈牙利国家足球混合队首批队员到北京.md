Xinhua News Agency, February 12th:
The first group of eighteen members of the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team, led by leader Adam Joseph, arrived in Beijing by plane on the afternoon of the 12th at the invitation of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government of our country, to visit and play friendly matches in our country.

Those who welcomed them at the airport included Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the Central People's Government, Huang Zhong, Deputy Secretary-General, and more than sixty football team members from the Central Institute of Physical Education.

Also at the airport to welcome them were personnel from the Hungarian Embassy in China.

The People's Republic of Hungary has won high international prestige in sports, and won third place in total scores at the 15th International Olympic Games in 1952. The Hungarian football team (national mixed team) also won the world championship at this event. In November 1953, they were invited to London, England, to compete against a mixed team of British professional football players, and they defeated the previously undefeated British professional football mixed team with an absolute advantage of six to three, writing a new page in the history of world football.

This time, the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team has come to our country and will play friendly matches with our football teams in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places.

    匈牙利国家足球混合队首批队员到北京
      【新华社十二日讯】应我国中央人民政府体育运动委员会邀请，前来我国访问和作友谊比赛的匈牙利国家足球混合队首批队员十八人由领队阿达姆·约瑟夫率领已在十二日下午乘飞机到达北京。
    到机场欢迎的有中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠、副秘书长黄中以及中央体育学院的足球队队员共六十多人。
    到机场欢迎的还有匈牙利驻我国大使馆使馆人员。
    匈牙利人民共和国在体育运动方面曾获得崇高的国际声誉，曾在一九五二年第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会上获得总分第三名。匈牙利的足球队（全国混合队）在这次运动会上并荣获世界冠军。在一九五三年十一月应邀赴英国伦敦和英国职业足球队混合队比赛，他们以六比三的绝对优势击溃了过去九十年来常胜不败的英国职业足球队混合队，写下了世界足球运动史上新的一页。
    这次匈牙利国家足球混合队来到我国，将在北京、上海等地和我国各足球队作友谊比赛。
