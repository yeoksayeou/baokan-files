The Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province, in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, mastered the method of running agricultural production cooperatives well to drive the development of mutual aid teams, and consolidating and improving mutual aid teams to prepare conditions for new agricultural production cooperatives, enabling the mutual aid and cooperation movement to be well developed.

The Changzhi Special District launched the mutual aid and cooperation movement during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Last year, the number of peasant households organized throughout the special district reached 74 percent of the total number of peasant households in the special district. Since 1951, because more than 900 agricultural production cooperatives have been successively established on a trial basis, these cooperatives have all exceeded the output of mutual aid teams and individual farmers to varying degrees. In addition, they have all contacted the surrounding mutual aid teams, allowing mutual aid teams to visit the cooperatives, and holding liaison meetings with the leaders of mutual aid teams, etc., to spread production technology and experience in work point calculation, so that the mutual aid teams have been further improved and consolidated. The agricultural production cooperatives in six counties of the special district have helped more than 7,600 mutual aid teams improve their management and farming methods through these methods, so that the mutual aid teams have been developed. From last winter to January 18 this year, 2,752 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the special district, and more than 81,000 new peasant households have participated. Because Changzhi Special District has paid attention to the development of mutual aid teams in the past, most of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives have a good foundation of year-round mutual aid teams. According to the statistics of 1,080 newly established cooperatives: those that have risen from a complete mutual aid team to an agricultural production cooperative account for 27.7 percent, and the rest are based on two or three mutual aid teams absorbing individual farmers. Because these new cooperatives have experience in collective labor during the mutual aid team period, they immediately formulated an annual production increase plan after the establishment of the cooperatives, and quickly invested in the first quarter's production. After the agricultural production cooperatives put into production, they drove the local mutual aid teams to launch small-scale production competitions, and also helped the mutual aid teams to formulate production plans, so that the mutual aid teams were developed again. In Changzi County, more than 3,300 individual farmers joined the mutual aid teams during the establishment of the cooperatives, and the number of peasant households organized in the county increased from the original 74.5 percent to 80 percent.

    办好农业合作社带动互助组，提高互助组打下建社基础
    山西长治专区互助合作运动得到很好发展
    山西省长治专区在互助合作运动中，掌握了办好农业生产合作社带动互助组的发展和巩固提高互助组为新建农业生产合作社准备条件，使互助合作运动得到很好的发展。
    长治专区在抗日战争时期即展开了互助合作运动。去年全专区组织起来的农户已达全专区农户总数的百分之七十四。从一九五一年开始，因为陆续试办了九百多个农业生产合作社，这些社都在程度不等的范围内超过互助组和单干农民的产量，加上它们又都联系了周围的互助组，让互助组到社里参观，和互助组组长开接头会等，传播生产技术和评工计分的经验，使互助组得到进一步提高和巩固。该专区六个县的农业生产合作社通过这些办法，帮助了七千六百多个互助组改进了经营管理和耕作方法，使互助组得到发展。去冬到今年一月十八日止，该专区又新建立了农业生产合作社二千七百五十二个，新参加的农户有八万一千多户。因为长治专区过去注意互助组的发展，所以新建的农业生产合作社绝大部分都有常年互助组的良好基础。据一千零八十个新建社的统计：由一个完整的互助组上升为农业生产合作社的占百分之二十七点七，其余都是以两个或三个互助组为基础吸收单干农民组成的。这些新社因为有在互助组时期的集体劳动的经验，建社后都立即订出全年增产计划，很快地投入了第一季度的生产。农业生产合作社在投入生产后，带动了当地互助组展开小型生产竞赛，还帮助互助组制订生产计划，使互助组又得到发展。长子县在建社中，就有三千三百多户单干农民加入互助组，全县组织起来的农户由原来的百分之七十四点五增加到百分之八十。　　　（新华社）
