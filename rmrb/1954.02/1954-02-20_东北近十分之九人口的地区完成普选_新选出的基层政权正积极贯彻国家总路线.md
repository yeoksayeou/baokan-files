By the end of January this year, 87.3% of the population in the Northeast region had completed grassroots election work. The grassroots elections in the six cities of Dalian, Fushun, Benxi, Anshan, Changchun, and Harbin, as well as the two provinces of Jilin and Rehe, have been fully completed. More than 96% of the population in Songjiang Province has completed the elections. Other provinces and cities that have not yet completed grassroots elections are currently actively carrying them out. The grassroots governments in vast urban and rural areas that have completed the grassroots elections are actively working to implement the national general line.

In cities, the grassroots governments after the general election have strengthened the leadership of the working class. Worker representatives account for the largest proportion of the newly elected people's representatives and members of the people's government. In the people's congresses of various districts in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun and other cities, worker representatives account for more than 40% to 50%. In urban and industrial areas, after the propaganda of the general line, the government has begun to proactively establish close ties with industrial and mining enterprises to strengthen the government's leadership and guarantee role in economic construction, and strive to realize the national general line. For example, after the People's Congress of Shengli District in Fushun City made resolutions to continue carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign in factories and mines based on the characteristics of the industrial and mining areas, the leading cadres of the district government went deep into the factories and mines to study with the leading cadres of the factories and mines how to implement the resolutions of the congress in order to ensure the effective promotion of factory and mine production. After the hot rolling section of the No. 2 workshop of the Electric Porcelain Factory implemented the resolution, the quality of the products was significantly improved.

In the vast rural areas, the grassroots governments produced through the general election are also striving to implement the national general line and general task during the transition period. In villages that have completed the grassroots elections, the national general line during the transition period has been publicized to the peasants through the village people's congresses, which has powerfully promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, in Hongqi Village, Yongji County, Jilin Province, due to the improvement of government work and the active leadership of the Party after the general election, the broad masses of the people have realized the brilliant prospects of socialism and the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation. After the general election, six new agricultural producers' cooperatives were established in the village. It is estimated that this year the number of peasant households organized in the village will account for 89% of the total number of households in the village. For example, in Xingye and Minle villages in Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, after the general election, not only were the year-round mutual aid teams further consolidated and developed, but also each established an agricultural producers' cooperative. Many villages also educated farmers through the people's congresses to sell surplus grain to the state to support the country's large-scale economic construction. Farmers in Jijiayoufang Village, Tenth District, Nongan County, Jilin Province, originally planned to sell 300 tons of grain to the state. After the propaganda of the general line, the farmers voluntarily sold 600 tons of surplus grain to the state. In the grain purchase work, cadres and people's representatives took the lead and played an exemplary role. After selling grain, the peasants actively purchased means of production to expand production. For example, the masses in Hongqi Village, Yongji County, bought 19 rubber-tired carts, 24 horses, 9 cattle, and 26,400 jin of chemical fertilizer, laying the foundation for increasing agricultural production this year.

Through the people's congresses, various places in Northeast China have also carried out the education of the national general line policy to handicraft industry and capitalist industrial and commercial operators, and some towns have also solved some of the problems existing in handicraft production. When the people's congresses were held in various districts of Shenyang City, in light of the ideological situation of the industrial and commercial operators, the policies were fully explained in group discussions and speeches at the congress, and some of the capitalists' incorrect understandings were criticized. Shen Minglun, a representative of industrial and commercial circles, said in a panel discussion: "After the general line was announced, I was not sure about it, but now I understand the bright future of private industrial and commercial operators, and I guarantee to manage well in the future." Li Muhan, a representative of industrial and commercial circles, also expressed his determination to expand the business of the iron factory and add two more machines. After the People's Congress of Shanhe Town, Songjiang Province, was held, the town people's government, in order to solve the problem of residents engaging in handicraft production, organized cadres to conduct an in-depth investigation into the number of rope-making machines on the streets, and jointly made a plan with the director of the street residents' committee, and signed a production and sales contract with the district cooperative. By the end of last year, the town's masses had produced 150,000 grass bags and earned 400 million yuan.

    东北近十分之九人口的地区完成普选
    新选出的基层政权正积极贯彻国家总路线
    东北区至今年一月底止，已有占人口百分之八十七点三的地区完成了基层选举工作。旅大、抚顺、本溪、鞍山、长春、哈尔滨六市及吉林、热河二省的基层选举工作已全部完成；松江省百分之九十六以上人口的地区已经完成；其他尚未完成基层选举工作的省、市，目前正在积极进行。已经完成基层选举的广大城乡的基层政权，正积极为贯彻国家总路线而努力。
    在城市中，普选后的基层政权加强了工人阶级的领导。在新选的人民代表和人民政府委员中，工人代表占了最大的比重。沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等市内各区的人民代表中，工人代表都占百分之四十到五十以上。在城市、工矿地区，经过总路线的宣传，政府开始主动地与工矿企业取得紧密的联系，以加强政权对于经济建设的领导和保障作用，为实现国家总路线而努力。如抚顺市胜利区人民代表大会根据工矿区的特点，作出了继续开展厂矿增产节约竞赛等项决议后，区政府的领导干部即深入厂矿与厂矿领导干部研究如何贯彻大会决议，以保证切实推动厂矿的生产的问题。电瓷厂第二车间热轧工段贯彻决议以后，产品质量有了显著提高。
    在广大的农村中，经过普选所产生的基层政权，也为贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务而奋斗。在完成基层选举的村屯，大都通过村人民代表大会向农民宣传了国家在过渡时期的总路线，有力地推动了互助合作运动的发展。如吉林省永吉县红旗村，普选后由于政府工作的改进与党的积极领导，广大群众认识了社会主义的灿烂远景和互助合作的优越性。全村在普选后新建立了六个农业生产合作社，今年全村组织起来的农户预计将占全村总户数的百分之八十九。又如松江省五常县兴业、民乐两村，普选后不但常年互助组得到进一步的巩固和发展，而且各成立了一个农业生产合作社。许多村屯并通过人民代表大会教育农民把余粮卖给国家，以支援国家大规模的经济建设。吉林省农安县十区纪家油房村农民原计划卖给国家三百吨粮食，经过总路线的宣传之后，农民自愿把六百吨余粮卖给了国家。在购粮工作中，干部和人民代表以身作则，起了带头作用。农民们卖粮以后又积极购买了生产资料，扩大生产。如永吉县红旗村群众买进了十九台胶皮车、二十四匹马、九头牛、二万六千四百斤化学肥料，为今年农业增产打下了基础。
    东北各地通过人民代表大会也对手工业和资本主义工商业者进行了国家总路线政策的教育，有些城镇并解决了手工业生产中存在的若干问题。沈阳市各区召开人民代表大会时，均结合工商业者的思想情况，在小组讨论和大会发言中，全面交代了政策，批判了资本家的一些不正确认识。工商业代表沈明伦在小组会上说：“总路线公布后，我心里不摸底，这回明白了私营工商业者的光明前途，今后保证好好经营。”工商业代表李慕汉并表示决心扩大铁工厂的营业，再增加两台机器。松江省山河镇人民代表大会开完后，镇人民政府为了解决居民从事手工业生产问题，组织干部深入街道调查有多少打绳机，并同街道居民委员会主任共同作了计划，与区联社订了产销合同。该镇群众到去年年底就已生产了十五万条草袋，收入了四亿元。
