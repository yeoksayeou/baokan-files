Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 17th: According to TASS, Moscow, February 16th, a "Pravda" commentator published a commentary entitled "Why are Western Countries Obstructing the Five-Power Conference?" stating that in the past few days, the four foreign ministers held four secret meetings to discuss the first item on the agenda, "Measures to ease international tensions and convene a conference of the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China."

Speaking of the Indochina issue, the commentator listed many facts to illustrate that certain individuals in Western countries, especially the United States, are in fact deliberately delaying the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue as much as possible. The commentator emphasized: It is very obvious that they are trying to realize the slogan that the United States once trumpeted – "Let Asians fight Asians." The American ruling clique is exerting strong pressure on France, wanting to force it to continue the war in Indochina.

Analyzing the Western newspapers' comments on the secret meetings of the four foreign ministers, the commentator said that in fact the representatives of the three countries still adhere to their original unrealistic attitude and refuse to recognize China's rights as a major power. The only aspect they are willing to concede is: to allow China to participate in some kind of "Far East Conference" as an "invited" country – with the same status as the South Korean puppet government. Obviously, this attitude does not stem from a desire to solve pressing international problems, but from very different considerations.

One cannot ignore the claim of the bourgeois newspapers that the People's Republic of China must provide some "real evidence" to prove its peaceful intentions in Southeast Asia before it can be considered to convene a conference to discuss ending hostilities in Indochina. The remarks of those who put forward such "preconditions" are as if it were not the French expeditionary force that had waged an eight-year war in Indochina up to now, but the Chinese army, although everyone knows that in fact this war was launched by France three years before the founding of the People's Republic of China. The reason why certain French people want to make such absurd and unfounded accusations against China is to cover up the increasingly direct interference of the United States in the Indochina war.

The facts show that the representatives of the three Western countries are still stubbornly obstructing the convening of a five-power conference to formulate measures to ease international tensions and resolve pressing international issues – including Asian issues.

As for the Soviet delegation's attitude towards the five-power conference, at the beginning of the foreign ministers' meeting, it was reasonable, clear, and in line with the interests of all peace-loving people. Many Western newspapers, especially French newspapers, pointed out that the Soviet attitude is in line with the interests of all countries that strive to resolve pressing international issues (first of all, Asian and Far Eastern issues, including the Indochina issue). The Soviet Union recognized that in addition to the Soviet Union, the United States, the People's Republic of China, France, and Britain, other relevant countries could also participate in such a conference. Regarding the discussion of the Korean issue, the Soviet Union advocated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea, and other relevant countries should participate in the meeting. When discussing the restoration of peace in other parts of Asia, representatives from these regions can be invited to participate in the meeting.

The commentator concluded that this is the truth. The facts undoubtedly prove that the Soviet proposal truly makes it possible to resolve a series of pressing international problems. This is in line with the interests of all peace-loving people. This proposal paves the way for resolving conflicts in the Far East, especially the Indochina war. The near future will prove whether the representatives of Western countries are happy to take advantage of this concrete opportunity, or whether they would rather let the "cold" war or actual war in this part of the world continue forever.

### “真理报”评论员评四国外长会议秘密会议  指出美英法仍在顽固阻挠召开五大国会议

    “真理报”评论员评四国外长会议秘密会议
    指出美英法仍在顽固阻挠召开五大国会议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：“真理报”评论员以“西方国家为什么阻挠五大国会议”为题发表评论说，在过去几天中，四国外长举行了四次秘密会议来讨论第一项议程“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”。
    评论员在谈到印度支那问题时，列举许多事实说明西方国家特别是美国的某些人士事实上故意尽量拖延印度支那问题的和平解决。评论员着重指出：十分明显，他们正企图实现美国曾大吹大擂的口号——“让亚洲人打亚洲人”。美国统治集团正对法国施用强大压力，想强迫它继续在印度支那进行战争。
    评论员分析西方报纸关于四国外长会议秘密会议的评论说，事实上三国代表仍然固守他们原来的不现实的态度，拒绝承认中国作为一个大国的权利。他们愿意让步的唯一的方面是：让中国以“被邀请”国家的身份——以和南朝鲜傀儡政府同等的地位，参加某种“远东会议”。显然，这种态度不是从解决迫切的国际问题的愿望出发的，而是从十分不同的考虑出发的。
    大家不能忽视资产阶级报纸的一种说法，就是中华人民共和国必须提出一些“真正的证据”说明它对东南亚的和平意图，然后才能谈得上召开会议来讨论结束印度支那敌对行动问题。提出这种“先决条件”的人的言论，就好像到现在为止在印度支那进行了八年战争的不是法国远征部队，而是中国军队似的，虽然大家都知道，实际上这个战争是法国在中华人民共和国成立以前三年就发动的。某些法国人士所以要对中国进行这样荒谬而没有根据的指责，是想掩饰美国对于印度支那战争的越来越直接的干涉。
    事实说明，三个西方国家的代表仍在顽固地阻挠：召开五大国会议，以拟定措施来缓和国际紧张局势，并解决迫切的国际问题——包括亚洲问题在内。
    至于苏联代表团对五大国会议的态度，在外长会议一开始的时候，就是合理、明晰而且符合所有爱好和平人民的利益的。有许多西方报纸、尤其是法国报纸指出，苏联的态度符合所有力图解决迫切的国际问题（首先是亚洲与远东问题，包括印度支那问题）的国家的利益。苏联承认除了苏联、美国、中华人民共和国、法国与英国以外，其他有关国家也可以参加这样一个会议。关于对朝鲜问题的讨论，苏联主张让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、南朝鲜以及其他有关国家参加会议。在讨论恢复亚洲其他部分的和平的时候，可以邀请这些地区的代表参加会议。
  评论员最后说，事实就是这样。事实毫无疑问地证明，苏联的建议真正使一连串迫切的国际问题的解决成为可能。这是符合所有爱好和平人民的利益的。这个建议为解决远东冲突、特别是印度支那战争铺平了道路。不久的将来就能证明，西方国家的代表是乐于利用这种具体的机会呢，还是最愿意使世界这一部分的“冷”战或实际战争永远继续下去呢。
