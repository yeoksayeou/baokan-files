Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 9th (TASS dispatch)

Today, it is possible to summarize some of the results of the discussion on the German question.

The Soviet government has put forward a draft proposal for a "Treaty of Peace with Germany." We have also proposed "preparing a treaty of peace with Germany and convening a peace conference on a treaty of peace with Germany."

The war ended nine years ago. Why should the situation in which the German people do not know what they can expect from a peaceful settlement continue?

The governments of the United States, Britain, and France would do well to clarify their views on the peace treaty issue, just as the Soviet government has done. This issue should no longer be evaded.

The Soviet government has suggested that a peace conference to discuss a peace treaty with Germany be convened no later than October 1954.

The Soviet delegation’s proposals on the German question are based on the actual possibility of completing the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany this year. Not only the German people are concerned about this, but also the people of other European countries, especially the people of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, France, and Britain. The people of these countries suffered the most from German aggression and made invaluable contributions to the victory over Nazism. It is important that, in addition to our four countries, other countries that participated particularly actively in the war against Hitler's Germany, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece, should not only participate in the peace conference to discuss the draft peace treaty with Germany, but also express their opinions in the process of preparing the treaty.

Of course, German representatives should also participate in this peace conference. It must be ensured that German representatives can participate in every stage of the preparation of the treaty. Before the formation of a provisional all-German government, representatives from East and West Germany may participate in the drafting of the draft peace treaty with Germany.

The Soviet government proposes to authorize the deputies of the four foreign ministers to draft a draft peace treaty with Germany within three months. The deputy ministers can start working immediately after the end of this conference.

The three governments have not yet put forward their draft peace treaty with Germany. They have not even mentioned the possibility of starting to prepare this treaty immediately.

These questions await answers.

The Soviet government has raised the issue of reducing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war.

So far, only Mr. Dulles has commented on this issue. The meaning of his speech is nothing more than that he opposes the Soviet proposal to reduce West Germany's financial and economic obligations. He spoke of the "amazing progress" in the recovery of the West German economy. However, for some reason, he did not mention that the level of industrial production in East Germany is already higher than in West Germany. Nor did he mention that the number of unemployed people in West Germany has reached two million and is continuing to increase. East Germany has no unemployment.

Dulles evaded our proposal to reduce occupation costs, which is an important issue. What is the reason that the German Democratic Republic was able to reduce occupation costs to 4.5 percent of budget revenue in 1954, while West Germany's occupation costs amounted to 9.6 billion marks, rising to 34.5 percent of budget revenue? Why do you oppose the Soviet proposal to reduce the occupation costs of the Federal Republic of Germany to 5 percent of budget revenue? It is worth noting that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany does not support the Soviet proposal to reduce occupation costs either. It seems that this government is not concerned about reducing the sharply increasing tax burden on West German residents. Otherwise, this position should be understood as meaning that much of the money under the occupation costs item in the budget is currently being used for the rearmament of West Germany.

These questions should be answered clearly.

The Soviet government has put forward its views on the issue of unifying Germany and holding free all-German elections to elect an all-German parliament and form an all-German government. The three Western powers have also expressed their views on this issue.

The Soviet government believes that we should not delay taking possible practical steps to bring the two parts of Germany closer together. This is an important prerequisite for the reunification of Germany.

To this end, we propose that our four countries should help the German people take practical measures to bring East and West Germany closer together. We believe that the formation of a provisional all-German government by representatives of the parliaments of West and East Germany, with the participation of other democratic groups, is fully in line with this goal. The provisional all-German government will exercise limited functions. Its main task is to hold all-German elections in truly free conditions - free from the pressure of foreign occupation forces - in a short period of time. After the elections, an all-German National Assembly can be formed this year, which can formulate an all-German constitution and form an all-German government with full powers. That is to say, Germany will be reunified on a democratic basis, a normal parliamentary system will be established, and an all-German government that can represent the free will of the German people will be formed.

Some people tell us that it is impossible to get Germans from the two parts of Germany, East and West, to sit down at the same table, allegedly because the political systems of the two parts of Germany are different.

It cannot be denied that the political systems of East and West Germany are indeed different. But shouldn't we promote the rapprochement between East and West Germany to help and accelerate the unification of Germany? Is it possible that, because of the differences in political systems, Germans in the two parts of the divided Germany do not even have the possibility of uniting and acting together for the common interests of the German people and for the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis?

Think about it, we represent countries with very different political systems, but aren't we discussing the German question and other issues at this Four Foreign Ministers Conference? If the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are trying to jointly solve certain complex international problems, then why can't the representatives of the two parts of Germany reach an agreement on the issue of restoring German unity? It cannot be ignored that if the participants in this conference are representatives of four countries, that is, representatives of different countries, then, in the case of East and West Germany, it is only a matter of a meeting and joint work between representatives of the people of the same country - the German people.

Some people also tell us that there are neither communists nor democrats in the West German government who are prepared to work with communists, so it seems that there is no possibility of communists and non-communists participating in a government together, even on a temporary basis. However, these arguments are also without any sufficient reason. The experience of post-war Europe proves that this is not the case. There are now many countries in which national and state life is unimaginable without the participation of communists in the government. Why can't communists and non-communists participate in a provisional all-German government at the same time to jointly ensure truly free all-German elections? The results of such elections could establish an all-German National Assembly, which would elect a full-power government in accordance with the free will of the German people. The three-power plan proposed by Mr. Eden does not help this normal democratic development, but hinders the unification of Germany. This plan would make us argue endlessly over the "five stages" of German unification. At the same time, this plan would indefinitely delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and all practical measures to unify Germany.

The Soviet delegation considers it necessary to draw everyone's special attention to a basic democratic principle; it is on this principle that the Soviet delegation suggests unifying Germany as soon as possible. We proceed from the recognition of this principle: the unification of Germany should be carried out by the Germans themselves, and not by the foreign occupation authorities. Since the plan of the three Western powers advocates that all-German elections should be completely controlled by the occupation authorities, we oppose this plan.

In order to guarantee the freedom of all-German elections and prevent any pressure from foreign occupation forces on the elections, the Soviet government proposes to reach the following agreement: before the all-German elections, the occupation forces in East and West Germany should be withdrawn, except for a limited number of troops. At our conference, some people opposed the withdrawal of the occupation forces, but their arguments were contrived and without any serious basis.

Our conference has recognized that the solution of the German question should be closely linked to the task of ensuring European security. This is in line with the interests of ensuring lasting peace in Europe and with the four countries' previous agreements on the German question. In view of the importance of this issue, I must once again remind you of Article 7 in the Soviet government's draft on a peace treaty with Germany:

"Germany shall guarantee that it will not join any alliance or military alliance aimed against any country that participated with its own troops in the war against Germany."

From the point of view of the interests of peace, it is impossible to explain the opposition to this principle. However, there has been such opposition here.

We believe that it is wrong for a unified Germany to form any military bloc with Eastern European countries to oppose Western Europe. We also believe that it is wrong for a unified Germany to join any military bloc of Western European countries to oppose Eastern Europe.

But now some people are trying to do this.

Dragging West Germany into the "European Defence Community" as stipulated in the Paris Treaty is contrary to the interests of European security. This treaty attempts to drag West Germany into the Western European military bloc. This is not in line with the interests of consolidating peace in Europe. We believe that this is a step in planning a new war in Europe.

Here, some people have tried more than once to prove that the plan to drag West Germany into the "European Defence Community" does not tie the hands of the Germans in the cause of unifying Germany, and insist that this plan does not deprive the future unified Germany of its freedom.

We declare once again that this statement is not in accordance with the facts. This can be seen from the following points:

First, it is known that the Paris Treaty on the "European Defence Community" and the Bonn Treaty on the future relations between the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany are closely related. According to the Bonn Treaty, these two treaties shall come into effect simultaneously. At the same time, Article 128 of the Paris Treaty stipulates that this treaty shall be valid for a period of fifty years from the date of its implementation.

We cannot imagine that the drafters of the Paris Treaty would delay the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany for fifty years. From this, it can be seen that they intend to maintain the Paris Treaty even after concluding a peace treaty with a unified Germany. Mr. Bidault's speech on February 4 can prove this, he said:

"Regarding the fifty years, it shows a clear fact, that is to say, the European federal constitution is not a temporary plan, but a plan that we hope will exist for a long time."

However, after concluding a peace treaty with a unified Germany, a separate West Germany will not exist. From this, it can be seen that some people want to impose the obligations of the Paris Treaty on a unified Germany as well. That is to say, they want to decide in advance that a unified Germany will be bound by the Paris Treaty, which was unilaterally prepared and concluded by the three Western powers and the Bonn government.

Second, the plan to incorporate West Germany into the "European Defence Community" is unacceptable to the peace-loving people of Europe because its purpose is to revive German militarism. If West Germany participates in this plan, it means that it is no longer a peace-loving country. The establishment of the "European Defence Community," that is, the establishment of a Western European army including West German troops, means that a dangerous hotbed of aggression is being rebuilt in Central Europe.

Mr. Bidault reminded us that this "is not a temporary plan." We believe that the "non-temporary" nature of this plan will sooner or later turn this "plan" into a serious threat, threatening not only Germany's eastern neighbors, but also its western neighbors, this Germany will re-establish an army led by Hitler's generals.

As for the claim that the completion of the "European Defence Community" plan will never constrain a unified Germany, we can explain how unconvincing it is with the following words.

If the plan to establish a Western European army, including the West German Defence Force, is realized in the near future, it means that West Germany has already been remilitarized while talks on the unification of Germany are still in progress. This would create a situation in which West Germany would lose its peace-loving nature and adopt a policy of remilitarization. Such a West Germany cannot join a unified Germany, because everyone knows that peace-loving East Germany refuses to pursue a policy of remilitarization, and it is impossible to unite with a remilitarized West Germany. West Germany should not implement a policy of remilitarization, so that there will be full conditions to unify the divided Germany. If West Germany implements a policy of remilitarization, it will make the reconstruction of German unification impossible for a considerable period of time.

Third, there is also the declaration of the three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, signed by Mr. Acheson, Mr. Eden, and Mr. Schuman on May 27, 1952. This declaration, which is attached to the Paris Treaty, is inevitably linked to the plan to establish a West German army, and therefore to the plan to revive West German militarism.

According to this declaration, the United States and Britain, although unwilling to let their troops participate in the Western European army, have assumed a special obligation to maintain the "integrity" and "unity" of the "European Defence Community." In discussing the attitude of the United States and Britain towards this issue, the declaration said in a threatening tone:

"If any action from any quarter threatens the integrity and unity of this group, the two governments will regard this as a threat to their own security. They will take action in accordance with Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty." In addition, the two governments also declared their determination to "station such troops on the European continent, including the Federal Republic of Germany, as they deem necessary and appropriate to contribute to the common defence of the North Atlantic region, taking into account their obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, the integrity of the European Defence Community, and their special responsibilities to Germany."

From this, it can be seen that, according to this declaration, once West Germany joins the "European Defence Community," it actually loses its right to withdraw from this group without the consent of the United States and Britain. This declaration directly prohibits West Germany from having such an attempt, even at the risk of using force.

From all this, where does the so-called unified Germany really get freedom of action? These words are unfounded.

We should face reality. If the plan on the "European Defence Community" is realized, West Germany will adopt a policy of remilitarization and revive the army led by Hitler's generals. In this case, no country in Europe, especially Germany's neighbors, will feel safe and have confidence in tomorrow.

Such a plan is undoubtedly not in the interests of the German people themselves. This plan only conforms to the plans of some people who want to make the people of Europe fight for them in the future. It pulls a part of the German people into these adventurous plans. But, at the same time, it also creates an insurmountable obstacle to the reunification of Germany.

The Soviet position is based on a fundamental desire - to promote the consolidation of peace and the security of Europe. It is not too late now, we should all prevent a dangerous hotbed of aggression from re-emerging in the heart of Europe. We should not have the idea of ​​pitting Western European countries against Eastern European countries. The people of Europe, as well as their true friends outside Europe, are equally concerned about ensuring the security of the people of all European countries.

The treaty on the so-called "European Defence Community" was concluded by six countries: France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany. For some reason, these six Western European countries out of the thirty-two countries in Europe named their plan the "European" group, and they wanted to call the armies of these six countries the "European Army." In fact, it is not even right to call it the Western European Army, because some Western European countries do not belong to this "group."

All this proves that the "European Defence Community" has nothing in common with the true security interests of the entire Europe. And everyone sees that this "group" is aimed at Eastern European countries, at the Soviet Union, it is only a tool of the North Atlantic military group.

In this case, it is appropriate to ask the following question: What do the governments of France, Britain, and the United States have to say about ensuring European security, about the true security of the people of all European countries? The people of all European countries are concerned about the answer to this important question.

We believe that implementing the plan to establish a "European Army" and actually restoring German militarism means taking a path that does not strengthen peace but prepares for another war in Europe. The Soviet government suggests abandoning this plan, which is not in line with the interests of world peace.

Our task is to ensure the peace and security of the people of all European countries, promote the consolidation of peace in the world, and enable European countries to achieve these goals through collective efforts.

    德国问题和三国的立场
    ——莫洛托夫九日在四外长会议上的发言
    今天，已经可以把讨论德国问题的一些结果加以总结了。
    苏联政府已经提出了“对德和约草案”的建议。我们还提出了“准备对德和约及召开关于对德和约的和平会议”的建议。
    战争结束已经九年了。为什么还让那种德国人民不知道他们从和平解决中可以期望些什么的形势继续下去呢？
    美国、英国和法国政府最好也像苏联政府一样，对和约问题阐明自己的观点。不应再规避这个问题了。
    苏联政府已经建议，不迟于一九五四年十月召开讨论对德和约的和平会议。
    苏联代表团提出自己关于德国问题的建议，其根据是：目前有实际可能在今年完成准备和缔结对德和约的工作。关心这件事的不仅有德国人民，还有欧洲其他各国人民，特别是苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、法国和英国的人民。这些国家的人民遭受德国侵略的灾害最重，对战胜纳粹主义作出了不可估价的贡献。重要的是：除了我们四国以外，其他一些曾特别积极地参加反对希特勒德国的战争的国家，如波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、希腊等，不仅应参加讨论对德和约草案的和平会议，而且也可以在准备和约的过程中表示自己的意见。
    当然，德国代表也是应该参加这个和平会议的。必须注意，应保证德国代表能参加准备和约的每一阶段。在临时的全德政府组成以前，可由东德和西德的代表参加对德和约草案的草拟工作。
    苏联政府建议授权四国外交部部长助理在三个月内草拟出对德和约草案。各部长助理可在这次会议结束以后立即开始工作。
    三国政府到现在还没有提出它们的对德和约草案。它们在这里连立即着手准备这个和约的可能性也丝毫没有提到。
    这些问题等待着回答。
    苏联政府提出了减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政与经济义务的问题。
    到现在只有杜勒斯先生对这个问题发表了意见。他发言的意思不外是：他是反对苏联关于减轻西德财政与经济义务的建议的。他说到西德经济的恢复有“惊人的进展”。但是，为了某些原因，他不提东德工业生产的发展水平已经高于西德。他也不提西德的失业人数已达二百万，而且在继续增加。而东德是没有失业现象的。
    杜勒斯对我们关于减低占领费的建议避而不谈，而这是一个重要问题。德意志民主共和国在一九五四年能够把占领费减至预算收入的百分之四点五，而西德的占领费却达九十六亿马克，即上升为预算收入的百分之三十四点五，这是什么缘故呢？苏联建议将德意志联邦共和国的占领费减至预算收入的百分之五，你们为什么反对呢？值得注意的是：德意志联邦共和国政府也不支持苏联关于减低占领费用的建议。看来这个政府对于减轻西德居民急剧增长的赋税负担是不关心的。再不然这种立场就应这样来理解：预算中的占领费项下许多钱目前已经用于西德的重新武装了。
    应当明确地答复这些问题。
    苏联政府对统一德国和进行全德自由选举以选出全德议会、组成全德政府这一问题已经提出了自己的观点。西方三国也对这个问题表示了看法。
    苏联政府认为，不应拖延采取可能的实际步骤使德国东西两部接近。这是重新统一德国的重要前提。
    为此，我们建议，我们四国应帮助德国人民来采取实际措施，使东德和西德接近起来。我们认为，由西德和东德议会的代表在其他民主团体的参加下组成临时的全德政府，是完全符合这个目标的。临时的全德政府将行使有限制的职能。它的主要任务是：在短时期内在真正自由的条件——不受外国占领军压力的条件下进行全德选举。选举后，在今年就可以组成全德国民议会，它可以制订全德宪法，并组成具有全权的全德政府。这就是说，德国在民主的基础上恢复了统一，建立正常的议会制度，组成能代表德国人民自由意志的全德政府。
    有人对我们说，无法使东德和西德两部分的德国人同坐到一张桌子上来，理由据说是德国这两部分的政体不同。
    不能不同意，东德和西德的政体的确不同。但是，难道我们就不应该促进东德和西德接近，来助成和加速德国的统一吗？难道因为政体的不同，分裂的德国的两部分的德国人连为德国人民的共同利益，为在和平、民主的基础上重新统一德国而联合起来行动的可能性都没有了吗？
    大家想想，我们所代表的就是政体极不相同的国家，但我们不正就在这个四国外长会议上讨论德国问题和其他问题吗？如果美国、英国、法国和苏联的外交部长是在想共同解决某些复杂的国际问题，那么为什么就不能让德国两部分的代表来对恢复德国统一的问题达成协议呢？不能不注意的是：如果说，参加这个会议的是四个国家的代表、也就是说各个不同国家的代表，那么，拿东德和西德来说，这不过是同一个国家的人民——德国人民的代表的会面和共同工作的事情而已。
    有人又对我们说，西德政府中既没有共产党员，也没有准备和共产党员一起工作的民主人士，因此似乎就谈不到有共产党人和非共产党人共同参加一个政府的可能，即使是临时参加也好。可是，这些论调也是没有任何充足的理由的。战后欧洲的经验证明情况不是这样。现在有不少国家，如果没有共产党参加政府，它们的民族生活和国家生活是不可想像的。为什么共产党人和非共产党人不能同时参加临时的全德政府来共同保证举行真正自由的全德选举呢？这种选举结果就可以建立全德国民议会，由这个议会选出符合德国人民自由意志的全权政府。艾登先生所提出的三国计划不是有助于这种正常的民主发展，而是阻碍着德国的统一。这个计划会使我们为统一德国的“五个阶段”而争吵不休。同时，这个计划会使缔结对德和约和统一德国的一切实际措施无限期地拖下来。
    苏联代表团认为有必要请大家特别注意一个基本的民主原则；苏联代表团就是根据这个原则，建议尽速统一德国的。我们从承认这个原则出发：德国的统一应由德国人自己来进行，而不应由外国占领当局来进行。西方三国的计划既然主张全德选举完全要由占领当局掌握，我们就反对这个计划。
    为了保证全德选举的自由以及防止外国占领军对选举施行任何压力，苏联政府建议达成下列协议：在全德选举前，在东德和西德的占领军，除留下数量有限的部队外，都应撤离。在我们的会议上有人反对撤退占领军，然而他们的论据是硬凑的，没有什么认真的根据。
    我们的会议已经承认，德国问题的解决应当和保障欧洲安全的任务紧密地联系起来研究。这既符合于保障欧洲持久和平的利益，也符合于四国以前对德国问题的协议。鉴于这个问题的重要，我必须再一次提醒：在苏联政府关于对德和约的草案中，我们特别重视第七条：
      “德国应保证它自己不加入任何旨在反对任何一个曾以自己的军队参加对德作战的国家的联盟或军事同盟。”
    从和平的利益看来，反对这个原则是无法解释的。可是，这里就曾经有过这种反对意见。
    我们认为，统一以后的德国和东欧国家结成任何军事集团来反对西欧是不对的。我们同样认为，统一以后的德国加入西欧国家的任何军事集团来反对东欧，也是错误的。
    但现在已经有人在企图这样做。
    如巴黎条约所规定的那样，把西德拖入“欧洲防务集团”，其目的是和欧洲安全的利益背道而驰的。这个条约企图把西德也拖入西欧军事集团。这是不符合巩固欧洲和平的利益的。我们认为这是策划欧洲新战争的一个步骤。
    这里有人不止一次地企图证明把西德拖入“欧洲防务集团”的计划并不在统一德国的事业中束缚住德国人的手，并且硬说这个计划并不剥夺将来统一后的德国的自由。
    我们再一次宣布：这种说法是不符合事实的。这可从下列几点看出来：
    第一，大家知道，关于“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎条约和关于美英法三国和西德的未来关系的波恩条约，有密切的关系。根据波恩条约，这两个条约要同时生效。同时，巴黎条约第一二八条规定：这个条约从实施之日起，有效期限为五十年。
    我们不能设想这种情况：巴黎条约的制订人要把对德和约的缔结拖延五十年。由此可见，他们打算甚至在和一个统一的德国缔结和约后，还保持巴黎条约。皮杜尔先生二月四日的发言可作证明，他说：
    “关于五十年这一点，表现了一个明显的事实，就是说欧洲联邦宪法并不是一个暂时的计划，而是我们希望其长期存在的计划。”
    但是，在和一个统一的德国缔结和约后，单独的西德就不会存在。由此可见，有人想把巴黎条约的义务也加于统一的德国。这就是说，他们要事先决定统一的德国受西方三国与波恩政府片面准备并缔结的巴黎条约的约束。
    第二，把西德并入“欧洲防务集团”的计划是欧洲爱好和平的人民所不能接受的，因为它的目的是复活德国军国主义。如果西德参加这个计划，就意味着它不再是一个爱好和平的国家。建立“欧洲防务集团”，即建立包括西德军队在内的一支西欧军，就意味着一个危险的侵略温床又在欧洲中部重建起来。
    皮杜尔先生提醒我们说，这“并不是一个暂时的计划”。我们认为，这个计划的“非暂时性”迟早会使这个“计划”变成一个严重的威胁，受到威胁的不仅是德国东部的邻国，而且还有它的西部的邻国，这个德国将重新建立起一支以希特勒将领为首的军队来。
    至于说“欧洲防务集团”计划的完成绝不会约束一个统一的德国，我们可以用下面的话来说明它是多么不能令人信服。
    如果建立包括西德国防军在内的西欧军的计划在最近将来得以实现，那就意味着在关于统一德国的会谈还在进行的时候，西德已经重新军国主义化了。这就会造成使西德失去其爱好和平的性质并采取重新军国主义化政策的形势。这样的西德就不能加入统一的德国，因为大家知道，爱好和平的东德是拒绝奉行重新军国主义化的政策的，而且是不可能与重新军国主义化了的西德统一起来的。西德不应该执行重新军国主义化的政策，这样，才会有充分条件去统一分裂了的德国。西德如果执行重新军国主义化的政策，就会在相当时期内使重建德国的统一无法实现。
    第三，还有由艾奇逊、艾登和舒曼三位先生签署的美英法三国一九五二年五月二十七日的宣言。这个附在巴黎条约上的宣言不可避免地是与建立西德军队的计划，因而也是和复活西德军国主义的计划，联系在一起的。
    根据这个宣言，美英两国尽管不愿让自己的军队参加西欧军，却承担了特别的义务，要维持“欧洲防务集团”的“完整”和“团结”。宣言在谈到美国和英国对这个问题的态度时，以威胁的口吻说：
     “如果来自任何方面的任何行动威胁了这个集团的完整和团结，两国政府将认为这是对它们本身安全的威胁。它们将按北大西洋公约第四条采取行动。”此外，两国政府还宣布决心要“在欧洲大陆上，包括德意志联邦共和国在内，驻扎这样的军队，因为它们考虑到它们根据北大西洋公约所承担的义务，考虑到欧洲防务集团的完整对它们的利害关系以及它们对德国的特殊责任，认为对北大西洋地区的共同防务作出贡献是必要的和适当的。”
    由此可见，根据这个宣言，西德一旦加入“欧洲防务集团”，实际上就失去它在未得到美英同意的情况下退出这个集团的权利。这个宣言直接禁止西德有这种企图，甚至不惜用武力来禁止。
    从这一切看来，所谓统一的德国确会得到行动自由，又从何说起呢？这些话都是毫无根据的。
    我们应该面对现实。如果关于“欧洲防务集团”的计划得以实现，西德就会采取重新军国主义化和复活以希特勒将领为首的军队的政策。在这种情况下，欧洲就没有一个国家，特别是德国的邻国，会感到安全，会对明天有信心。
    这样的计划无疑也是不符合德国人民本身利益的。这个计划只符合于有些人想使欧洲人民在将来为他们作战的计划。它把德国人民中的一部分拉入这些冒险计划。但是，同时，它也给德国的重新统
  一造成了不可逾越的障碍。
    苏联的立场本着一个根本的愿望——促进和平的巩固和欧洲的安全。现在为时还不算太晚，我们大家应该防止在欧洲的中心又重新产生一个危险的侵略温床。我们不应该有使西欧国家和东欧国家对立起来的想法。欧洲人民以及他们在欧洲以外的真正的朋友们，以同等的程度关心着保障欧洲各国人民的安全。
    关于所谓“欧洲防务集团”的条约是由法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡和西德六个国家缔结的。欧洲三十二个国家中的这六个西欧国家，为了某些原因竟给它们的计划取名为“欧洲”集团，他们要把这六个国家的军队称为“欧洲军”。实际上即使称它为西欧军都是不行的，因为有些西欧国家并不属于这个“集团”。
    这一切证明：“欧洲防务集团”和整个欧洲的真正安全的利益并无共同之处。而且每一个人都看到，这个“集团”的矛头是指向东欧国家、指向苏联的，它只是北大西洋军事集团的工具。
    在这种情况下，提出下面这个问题是适当的：关于保障欧洲安全，关于欧洲各国人民的真正安全，法英美三国政府要讲什么话吗？欧洲各国人民对这个重要问题的答复都关心。
    我们认为，执行建立“欧洲军”的计划和实际恢复德国军国主义，就是意味着走这样一条路：不是加强和平而是在欧洲准备另一次战争。苏联政府建议放弃这种不符合全世界和平利益的计划。
    我们的任务是保障欧洲各国人民的和平与安全，促进全世界和平的巩固，使欧洲各国有可能以集体的努力达到这些目的。
