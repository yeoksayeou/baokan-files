Collective and Mechanized Farming Transforms Saline-Alkali Wasteland into Granary
　　Rice Yields Continuously Increase at Lutai and Other Three Farms

　　The Lutai, Hangu, and Qinghe state-owned mechanized farms have supplied the state with large quantities of commercial grain. Last year, these three farms planted a total of 59,639 mu of rice, producing more than 38.7 million jin of paddy rice. After deducting the seeds needed for this year's production and the food for the workers, etc., the remaining amount, approximately 90 percent of the total production, or more than 35 million jin of grain, has been sold to the state. This figure, if calculated on the basis of each household having ten mu of paddy fields, each mu producing 400 jin of rice, and 20 percent being commercial grain, is equivalent to the total commercial grain of more than 40,000 individual farmers. This fully demonstrates the superiority of large-scale, mechanized, and collectivized production in supplying the state with large quantities of commercial grain.

　　These three farms are all located in the coastal areas of the Bohai Bay in Hebei Province, where the soil is heavily saline-alkali. The Lutai Farm was originally a rice farm established by the Japanese invaders. It was abandoned for many years due to sabotage by the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, the People's Government gradually carried out restoration and reconstruction work. The Hangu and Qinghe farms were newly built rice farms after liberation. These places were originally saline-alkali wasteland. In the past few years, due to the initial learning and application of advanced Soviet agricultural science and technology and experience, the implementation of reasonable land division, the establishment of new-style irrigation and alkali-washing equipment, the use of tractors and agricultural machinery, the implementation of comprehensive agricultural technologies such as autumn plowing, deep plowing, reasonable close planting, and improved fertilization and irrigation methods, and the application of advanced Soviet rice dry direct seeding methods, the soil properties of some land have been improved, and thus the unit area yield of rice has been continuously increased. In 1953, the rice production of the three farms was 50 to 100 percent higher than that of the nearby masses, establishing an advanced banner in agricultural production.

### 集体化机械化耕作使盐碱荒地变成粮仓  芦台等三农场水稻产量不断提高

    集体化机械化耕作使盐碱荒地变成粮仓
    芦台等三农场水稻产量不断提高
    芦台、汉沽、清河三个国营机械化农场供应了国家大量的商品粮食。这三个农场去年共种植五万九千六百三十九亩水稻，生产了三千八百七十多万斤稻谷，除去今年生产需用的种子和职工的食用等以外，其余约占生产总数百分之九十的三千五百多万斤粮食已经全部卖给了国家。这个数字，如以每户十亩水田、每亩产水稻四百斤、按百分之二十的商品粮食计算，相当于四万多个个体农户的商品粮总数。这充分说明了大规模、机械化、集体化生产能为国家供应大量商品粮食的优越性。
    这三个农场都在河北省渤海湾盐碱较重的海边地区。芦台农场原系日寇设置的水稻农场。后经国民党反动派的破坏，荒芜多年。解放后，人民政府才进行了逐步恢复和改建的工作。汉沽和清河两农场都是解放后新建的水稻农场，这些地方原为一片盐碱荒地。几年来由于初步学习和运用了苏联先进的农业科学技术和经验，实行了合理的土地区划，建立了新式的扬水灌溉洗碱设备，使用了拖拉机和农业机械，贯彻了秋耕、深耕、合理密植及改进施肥与灌溉方法等综合性的农业技术，并应用了苏联先进的水稻旱直播方法等，使有的地的土壤性质已经改良了，因而水稻的单位面积产量不断提高。一九五三年三个场的水稻的生产都比附近群众高出百分之五十至百分之一百，在农业生产上树立了先进的旗帜。
