    Students in Beijing's primary and secondary schools, numbering 350,000, have begun their enjoyable winter vacation. Schools across the city began their break around January 24th. The Beijing Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Beijing Student Union are particularly concerned about the vacation life of primary and secondary school students, and have organized a variety of recreational and sports activities to attract their widespread participation. The eight joint middle school entertainment performance evenings sponsored by the Dongdan District Working Committee of the Youth League in Beijing are currently underway, with more than 800 students participating in the performances, featuring more than 30 programs including dance, folk music, and poetry recitations. Many school student organizations' skating teams have become one of the main contents of physical exercise during the winter vacation. Some schools have organized visiting groups to travel to the Summer Palace, the Western Suburban Park, Beihai Park, the Temple of Heaven, and the Working People's Cultural Palace to appreciate the winter scenery of the capital. Some school students are actively preparing to participate in the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs during the Spring Festival, and to invite the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing to have a get-together with them during the Spring Festival. Students from Beijing No. 12 Girls' Middle School and other schools are preparing to visit agricultural production cooperatives and factories in the near suburbs; and are preparing to hold discussions with farmers and workers in order to further study the general line by understanding the lives of the working people. The Beijing "Children's Palace" will organize meetings between children and well-known figures such as model workers; and will prepare to hold science lectures for children and screen science films. The geology group of the "Children's Palace" will go to Sanjiadian to collect chrysanthemum stones and visit the Mentougou Coal Mine. After the Spring Festival, the "Children's Palace" will also organize literary and artistic performances for children and hold an art exhibition for junior high school students. Reading literary works is also very common among students in Beijing during the holidays. Many of them are reading excellent Soviet works, such as "Far from Moscow" and "People of the Stalin Era." They eagerly hope to use the noble moral qualities of the Soviet people as their own learning model. (Xinhua News Agency)
