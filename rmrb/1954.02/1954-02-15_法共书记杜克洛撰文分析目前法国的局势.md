    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 13th: French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos published an article titled "France on the Move" in the February issue of the British journal "Labour Monthly," providing a comprehensive analysis of the current situation in France.

    Duclos wrote: At the closing session of the French Communist Party Central Committee meeting on June 17, 1953, the General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Maurice Thorez, said: "Now a powerful national force has emerged in France, which will determine the direction of the situation, which will enable the policy of peace and national independence, the policy of freedom and social progress, to achieve victory in our country." Shortly thereafter, the facts unequivocally confirmed this prediction.

    Beginning on August 7th, three million workers held a large-scale strike against decrees affecting worker employment. The majority of workers persisted for three weeks, bringing national life to a virtual standstill. Although these strikes were betrayed by the leaders of the Socialist Party unions and Catholic unions, the idea of workers acting in unison was decisively enhanced during the course of this strike.

    The peasant struggle, which has lasted from July until now, is one of the most significant peasant struggles in France since the Great French Revolution of 1789. These struggles have taken many different forms: holding rallies, boycotting transactions, and, most importantly, setting up thousands of obstacles on highways. They protested the sluggish sales of products and the decline in selling prices.

    Duclos pointed out that it is very important to see the general sympathy for these struggles. Different social strata are united by a common desire to change the status quo. As Thorez said: "Workers, employees and civil servants, merchants and handicraftsmen, intellectuals, veterans and war invalids, as well as women and young people—all recognize that their special demands are linked to the general demand for a complete change in French policy."

    Duclos continued: In 1953, the National Peace Council’s propaganda on ending the disastrous Indochina War, preventing the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties, and implementing a policy of negotiated solutions to international disputes, attracted more people than before. Today, different classes are strongly advocating the implementation of an independent national policy. This is the result of the contradictions and conflicts in the North Atlantic Treaty policy pursued since 1947, the result of the increasingly widespread recognition that improving the living conditions of the working masses depends on changing foreign policy, and the result of the achievements of the peace camp, which have made those who believe that war is inevitable reconsider their views.

    Duclos mentioned the parliamentary debate on the "European Defense Community" issue at the end of November 1953 and the election of the President of the Republic in December. He said that on these two issues, it not only showed the chaos within the French ruling group, but also showed the great difficulties suffered by the big bourgeoisie in their anti-people rule. In addition to the Communist Party, divisions and conflicts occurred between and within parties. Although the forces advocating maintaining the status quo and the forces demanding a new policy still maintain a balance, the indignation of the broad masses is taking effect.

    Duclos continued: At the last Communist Party Congress, General Secretary Thorez said: "Once class relations change, they will inevitably affect the parliament and the government." This great political vision is getting closer and closer. As long as we make greater efforts and unite all those who want change more boldly, it will be very possible to realize the fighting alliance of the working class and the peasantry. ...

    It is necessary to formulate a line among all workers by putting forward slogans that meet the urgent demands and conform to the interests of all. These slogans are: stipulating guaranteed minimum wages, adjusting wages and salaries; prohibiting the closure of factories; drastically reducing military expenditures; meeting the demands of peasants; respecting democracy and freedom; immediately conducting peace negotiations with Ho Chi Minh to end the Indochina War; opposing the Bonn and Paris treaties. The last item seems particularly urgent.

    Duclos concluded: Restoring France's legitimate status in resolving international issues, especially the German issue, is currently the key to the rapidly developing political battle. In this battle, the Communist Party knows very well that only by uniting the forces of the working class, Republicans, and patriots can the direction of French policy be completely changed.

    法共书记杜克洛撰文分析目前法国的局势
    【新华社柏林十三日电】法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛在二月份的一期英国“劳动月刊”上，发表以“法国在前进中”为题的文章，对目前法国的局势作了全面的分析。
    杜克洛写道：一九五三年六月十七日在法国共产党中央委员会会议的闭幕会上，法国共产党总书记莫里斯·多列士曾说过：“现在法国开始出现了强大的民族力量，它们将决定局势发展的方向，这将使和平与民族独立的政策、自由与社会进步的政策在我国取得胜利。”不久以后，事实便确凿地证实了这种预见。
    自八月七日开始，三百万工人举行了反对影响工人就业的法令的大罢工，大多数工人坚持了三周之久，使得全国的生活实际上陷于瘫痪。这些罢工虽然被社会党工会和天主教工会的领袖们出卖了，但是在这次罢工的过程中，工人们一致行动的思想有了决定性的提高。
    从七月一直持续到现在的农民斗争，是法国一七八九年大革命以来一次最重大的农民斗争。这些斗争采取了种种不同的形式：举行集会，抵制交易、最重要的是在公路上设下数以千计的障碍物。他们抗议产品滞销和卖价下跌的现象。
    杜克洛指出，十分重要的是要看到普遍同情这种种斗争的情绪。不同的社会阶层在要求改变现状的共同愿望之下团结起来了。如多列士所说：“工人、雇员和公务员、商人和手工业者、知识分子、退伍军人和战争残废者以及妇女和青年——所有的人们都认识到，他们的特殊要求是与完全改变法国政策的总的要求联系在一起的。”
    杜克洛接着写道：在一九五三年，全国和平理事会关于结束祸国殃民的印度支那战争、阻止批准波恩和巴黎条约和执行通过协商解决国际分歧的政策的宣传，比以前吸引了更多的人。今天，不同的阶层都在有力地主张执行独立的国家政策。这是自从一九四七年以来所奉行的北大西洋公约政策中的矛盾冲突的结果，是大家日益普遍地认识到劳动群众生活条件的改善有赖于改变外交政策的结果，是和平阵营得到成就的结果，这些成就使那些相信战争不可避免的人们重新考虑他们的看法。
    杜克洛提到一九五三年十一月底议会关于“欧洲防务集团”问题的大辩论和十二月共和国总统的选举。他说，在这两个问题上，不仅表明了法国统治集团内部的混乱，也表明了大资产阶级在反人民的统治中遭受了巨大的困难。除了共产党外，在党派与党派之间，在各党派内部都发生了分歧与冲突。虽然主张维持现状的力量与要求奉行新政策的力量之间仍然保持均势，广大人民的愤慨却正在发生作用。
    杜克洛继续写道：在上次共产党代表大会上，总书记多列士曾说：“阶级关系一旦发生变化，必然会对议会和政府发生影响。”这种伟大的政治远景已经越来越近了。只要我们尽更大的力量，更大胆地团结所有希望改变的人们，那么，实现工人阶级和农民的战斗联盟就是非常可能的。……
    必须根据迫切的要求提出一切人们共同的、符合于所有人们的利益的口号，从而在全体工人中形成一条战线。这些口号是：规定有保证的最低工资，调整工资和薪金；不准关闭工厂；大量削减军费；满足农民的要求；尊重民主与自由；立即与胡志明进行和平谈判以结束印度支那战争；反对波恩与巴黎条约。最后这一项特别显得迫切。
    杜克洛最后写道：恢复法国在解决国际问题，主要是解决德国问题中的合法地位，这就是目前在迅速发展着的政治战斗中的关键，在这个战斗中，共产党知道得很清楚，只有团结工人阶级的力量、共和人士和爱国者才能迫使法国政策的方向完全改变。
