    The Chinese Artists Association has decided to hold the Second National Art Exhibition in Beijing in October this year and has now begun soliciting works. The works solicited this time include paintings (Chinese painting, oil painting, watercolor, sketches, New Year pictures, comics, serial cartoons, illustrations, etc.), prints, sculptures, arts and crafts designs, and architectural designs. Members and non-members of the association may submit entries. The works should mainly be creations after the Second National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers in October last year, but excellent works since 1950 can also participate. The deadline for submissions is the end of August this year.
    The First National Art Exhibition was held during the First National Congress of Literary and Art Workers in 1949. The content of the exhibition mainly consisted of art creations during the Liberation War and the early post-liberation period. In the past five years, the face of the motherland has been constantly changing, and new art reflecting the people's lives and struggles has made significant progress. The widespread distribution of New Year pictures and serial cartoons shows that the new art has been welcomed by the broad masses of working people. Chinese painting, oil painting, sculpture, arts and crafts, etc., have also begun to be connected with the lives of the masses. Because these works are closely related to the people's various aspects of life and struggle, they have played a considerable role in stimulating the labor enthusiasm and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses, and in coordinating various social reform movements. Holding the Second National Art Exhibition is to review the strength of art; to allow art works to meet the broad masses and absorb the opinions and criticisms of the masses; to exchange art creation experiences from various places in the past five years, so that the quality of art creation can be further improved to meet the growing cultural needs of the people.

    第二届全国美术展览会开始征集作品
    中国美术家协会决定今年十月在北京举办第二届全国美术展览会，现已开始征集作品。这次征集的作品，包括绘画（国画、油画、水彩、素描、年画、漫画、连环画、插图等）、版画、雕塑、工艺美术设计、建筑设计等。该会会员和非会员都可应征。作品以去年十月中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会以后的创作为主，但一九五零年以来的优秀作品也可参加。征集期间到今年八月底截止。
    第一届全国美术展览会是在一九四九年第一次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会时举行的，展览会的内容主要是解放战争时期和解放初期的美术创作。近五年来，祖国的面貌不断变化，反映人民生活和斗争的新美术有显著进步。年画、连环画的普遍发行，说明新的美术已为广大劳动人民所欢迎。国画、油画、雕塑、工艺美术等也开始和群众生活发生了联系。由于这些作品紧密地联系着人民各方面的生活和斗争，在激发群众的劳动热情和爱国热情方面，在配合各种社会改革运动方面，都起了相当作用。举办第二届全国美术展览会就是为了检阅美术方面的力量；使美术作品和广大群众见面，吸收群众的意见和批评；交流五年以来各地的美术创作经验，使美术创作质量获得进一步的提高，以适应人民群众不断增长的文化需要。　（新华社）
