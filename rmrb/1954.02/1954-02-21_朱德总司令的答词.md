To the Head and Deputy Heads of the Delegation, Esteemed Representatives, and Comrades:

The people of the entire nation have dispatched their representatives to visit the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) throughout the country, conveying the profound concern of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country for the PLA. This is a tremendous honor and encouragement for all commanders and fighters of the PLA. On behalf of all commanders and fighters of the PLA, I extend our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the people of the whole country, the CCP, the Central People's Government, and our great leader Chairman Mao. I also extend a warm welcome and sincere thanks to the representatives of the delegation.

Under the leadership of the CCP and Chairman Mao, the PLA, together with the people of the whole country, has undergone a long and arduous struggle to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China. We achieved the great victory of the revolution and established the People's Republic of China. After the liberation of the mainland, the PLA vigilantly guards the coasts and borders of the motherland, strengthens our national air defense, and stands ready to crush the harassing activities of imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang. This is to consolidate the people's democratic power and safeguard the smooth progress of the nation's construction. At the same time, following Chairman Mao's instructions, we are carrying out the modernization of national defense, constantly improving the military, political, and cultural level of the troops. On the basis of the army, we have established a considerably strong air force, navy, and various technical arms. A portion of the PLA has also participated in agricultural and industrial production, supporting the country's socialist construction. The reason we are able to accomplish the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the people of the motherland is due to the wise leadership of the CCP, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. It is also due to the deep concern and enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, and the result of our learning from the advanced Soviet military experience.

Chairman Mao often taught us that the PLA is the army of the people, a revolutionary army serving the people under the leadership of the CCP. We should support the government, cherish the people, resolutely implement government policies and decrees at all times and places, and maintain a humble attitude and a spirit of criticism and self-criticism. We have faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's instructions. However, in our army, there are still some individuals who do not understand the significance of the responsibility the people of the whole country have given us. After the national victory, complacency and arrogance have grown. In addition, there are also individuals who violate government laws and decrees, and infringe upon the interests of the masses. These are absolutely not allowed in our people's army and must be quickly corrected. In the future, we must continue to deeply study the general line, enhance the socialist ideological consciousness of the troops, strengthen the unity within our army, strengthen the unity between the army and the government and the people, and strive to thoroughly implement the general line and build our country into a great socialist nation.

American imperialism is still occupying our Taiwan, systematically destabilizing the Korean armistice, and continuing to pursue its arms expansion and war preparation policies in the Far East and Europe. The Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang and lurking counter-revolutionaries are also constantly exploiting every opportunity to undermine our great cause of socialist construction. Therefore, we must strengthen the modernization of national defense, diligently study the advanced military science and technology of the Soviet Union, and maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times to protect the security of the motherland and the smooth progress of socialist construction.

Thank you to the CCP, the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country for your condolences and care!

Resolutely implement the Party's general line during the transition period!

Strive for the country's socialist industrialization and the modernization of national defense!

We must raise our vigilance and strive to protect the security of the motherland and ensure the smooth progress of national socialist construction!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao, the creator and organizer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the great leader of the Chinese people!

    朱德总司令的答词总团长、副总团长、各位代表、各位同志：
    全国人民派遣自己的代表，到全国各地慰问中国人民解放军，传达中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛主席和全国人民对中国人民解放军的深切关怀，这是给予中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员极大的荣誉和鼓舞。我代表中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员，谨向全国人民、中国共产党、中央人民政府和伟大的领袖毛主席致以崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢，并向代表团的各位代表表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的谢意。
    中国人民解放军在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，和全国人民一起，经过长期艰苦奋斗，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治，取得了革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。全国大陆解放后，中国人民解放军警惕地守卫着祖国的海岸和边疆，加强我国领空的防御力量，随时准备粉碎帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪帮的侵扰活动，以巩固人民民主政权，保卫祖国建设事业的顺利进行。同时，又遵循着毛主席的指示，进行国防现代化的建设，不间断地提高部队军事、政治、文化水平，并在陆军的基础上，建立了相当强大的空军、海军和各种技术兵种。中国人民解放军的一部还参加了农业和工业生产，支援了国家的社会主义建设。我们之所以能够完成祖国人民所给予的光荣任务，是由于中国共产党，中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导，是由于全国人民深切的关怀和热烈的支援，同时也是由于我们学习了苏联先进军事经验的结果。
    毛主席经常教导我们，中国人民解放军是中国人民的子弟兵，是在中国共产党领导下为人民服务的革命军队，我们应该随时随地都拥护政府，爱护人民，坚决执行政府的政策法令，并保持谦逊的态度和批评与自我批评的精神，我们是忠实地执行了毛主席这个指示的。但是在我们军队中，也还有个别人员，不了解全国人民所给予我们的责任的重大，在全国胜利之后，滋长了居功骄傲和自满情绪；另外，也还有个别的人员，存在着违反政府法令，违犯群众利益的行为，这些都是我们人民军队所绝对不能容许的，必须迅速地加以改正。今后我们必须继续深入总路线的学习，提高部队的社会主义思想觉悟，增强我军内部的团结，增强军队与政府和人民之间的团结，为彻底实现总路线，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    美帝国主义仍然侵占着我国的台湾，有计划地使朝鲜停战处于不稳定状态，并在远东和欧洲继续执行其扩军备战政策。蒋介石残余匪帮以及潜伏的反革命分子，也时刻在利用一切机会，来破坏我们社会主义建设的伟大事业。因此，我们必须加强国防现代化的建设，努力学习苏联的先进军事科学和技术；时刻保持高度警惕，以保卫祖国的安全和社会主义建设的顺利进行。
    感谢中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛主席和全国人民对我们的慰问和关怀！
    坚决执行党在过渡时期的总路线！
    为国家的社会主义工业化和国防现代化而奋斗！
    我们一定要提高警惕，为保卫祖国的安全，保障国家社会主义建设的顺利进行而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民解放军的创造者、组织者，中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
