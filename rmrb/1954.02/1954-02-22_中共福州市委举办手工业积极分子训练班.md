The CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee, in order to comprehensively promote the general line of the state's transition period among the vast number of handicraft workers and artisans, specially held a training class for handicraft industry activists within the municipal party school, in order to gain experience and prepare key personnel. Sixty-six people from among the handicraft workers who were party members, Communist Youth League members, and grassroots trade union cadres participated in the training class.

Through recollection and comparison, the students realized the achievements of implementing the general line over the past four years and the benefits it brought to everyone, and recognized the close relationship between the implementation of the general line and each individual. Therefore, their enthusiasm for learning was very high. Everyone in the class compared their economic, political, and cultural lives before and after liberation. Everyone said that the suffering before liberation and the benefits received after liberation could not be fully described in three days and three nights. Among the sixty-six people in the class, nine died of starvation before liberation, four were forced to hang themselves, twenty-nine households were forced to sell their children due to poverty, and thirty-five survived by eating sweet potatoes and coarse grains. After liberation, one person was named a labor model, twenty-three were elected as district people's representatives, thirty joined the party, and fifty-three joined the Communist Youth League. The number of those eating sweet potatoes and coarse grains also decreased year by year. Before liberation, eighteen households among the students lived in leaky houses and twenty in dilapidated houses. After liberation, some repaired their houses, built new houses, and bought houses.

Through comparison and calculation, the students further clarified the direction of development of the handicraft industry. Lin Shuzhen, a female worker in the toothbrush industry, said: "After our Xiaoqiao District Toothbrush Production Cooperative was organized, we implemented scientific division of labor and adopted assembly line operations, which doubled production efficiency, expanded the cooperative's public funds, and improved the lives of its members. At the same time, the cooperative also plans to use machines for production in the future. Through the education of this fact, I have further recognized the correct direction for the development of the handicraft industry." Some students also recalled the benefits of the handicraft industry accepting state processing orders and "linking up" with the state-owned economy. Before the Yongmei Towel Factory in Da'gen District of Fuzhou accepted state processing, its products had no sales channels, its capital turnover was difficult, and it only operated for ten days a month, directly affecting the lives of the workers. Sometimes each worker could only get 60,000 yuan in wages per month. Since accepting processing from the Fuzhou Wholesale Station of the Provincial Department Store, it has been able to maintain a normal production of more than 300 dozens of towels per month, and the average monthly wage of workers can reach 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Everyone agreed that the handicraft industry should also actively and steadily take the road of cooperation under the leadership of the state-owned economy and gradually incorporate it into the state's planned track in the future.

During the study, many handicraft workers criticized some ideas that were not in line with the general line in the past. Ding Guangtian, a worker in the wood lacquer industry, watched a Soviet movie in the past and saw that almost all production in the Soviet Union was mechanized. He was worried that handicrafts would not be viable in the future, and he could not sleep after returning home. Now, he understands that the socialist transformation of handicrafts is gradual, and handicrafts can slowly move from semi-mechanized to fully mechanized after implementing cooperation. Handicraft workers can gradually master new technologies, and handicraft workers also have a bright future.

### 中共福州市委举办手工业积极分子训练班

    中共福州市委举办手工业积极分子训练班
    中共福州市委会为了在广大手工业工人与手工业者中全面开展国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，特在市委党校内举办了手工业积极分子训练班，以便取得经验和准备骨干。参加训练班的有手工业工人中的党、团员和工会基层干部六十六人。
    学员们通过回忆、对比，认识到四年多来贯彻总路线的成就和带给大家的好处，认识到贯彻总路线和每一个人的密切关系，因而学习情绪非常高涨。班上每一个人都对比了一下解放前后经济生活、政治生活、文化生活。大家都说，解放前受的罪和解放后得到的好处，真是三日三夜都说不完，全班六十六人的家中，解放前饿死的有九人，被迫吊死的四人，为生活所逼出卖儿女的二十九户，靠吃蕃薯和杂粮过活的三十五户。解放后有一人被评为劳动模范，有二十三人当选为区人民代表，入党的有三十人，入团的有五十三人。吃蕃薯和杂粮的也一年年减少。解放前学员中住漏房子的有十八户，破房子的二十户，解放后有修理房子、盖新房子和买房子的。
    通过对比、算账，学员们对手工业的发展方向，也进一步明确了。牙刷业女工林淑贞说：“我们小桥区牙刷生产合作社组织起来后，实行科学分工，采用流水作业法，生产效率提高了一倍左右，社内公共资金扩大了，社员生活也改善了；同时，合作社将来还准备用机器生产。通过这一事实的教育，我进一步认清了手工业的正确发展方向。”有的学员还回忆了手工业接受国家加工订货、和国营经济“挂钩”的好处。福州市大根区永美号毛巾厂接受国家加工以前，产品没有销路，资金周转困难，一个月只开十天工，直接影响工人生活，有时每个工人一个月仅能拿到六万元工资；自从接受省百货公司福州批发站的加工后，已能维持每月生产毛巾三百多打的正常情况，工人工资每月平均可拿到二十万元到三十万元。大家一致认为：手工业今后也应当在国营经济的领导下，积极而稳步地走合作化的道路，逐步纳入国家的计划轨道。
    在学习中，不少手工业工人批判了过去存在的一些不符合总路线的思想。木漆业工人丁光钿过去看了苏联电影，见到苏联生产差不多都是机械化，就顾虑将来手工吃不开，回去睡不着觉。现在，他明白手工业社会主义改造是逐步的，手工业可以在实行合作化以后慢慢地由半机械到全机械。手工业工人可以逐渐掌握新的技术，手工业工人也有远大前途的。
