Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 4th: February 4th is the Tibetan New Year. Before the festival, people from all social strata and patriotic organizations in Lhasa sent letters of condolence to the soldiers building the Kangzang Highway. The letters were filled with the Tibetan people's love for the road-building soldiers. The Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association said in its letter: You are opening up a smooth road for us in the icy and snowy, high mountains and ridges. You are creating happiness for us for generations with your own blood and sweat. Because this avenue not only closely unites the Tibetan and Han nationalities, but also connects the economic and cultural ties between the border areas and the hinterland of the motherland. Losang Sandan, the Jicho Khenpo of the Tibetan local government, and Taiji Jiang Lejin, also in the name of the chairman and vice chairman of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, wrote to the road-building troops, hoping that the soldiers would make persistent efforts to strive for the early opening of the entire Kangzang Highway. Tibetan teachers and students of the Tibetan Military Region Cadre School and representatives of the Preparatory Committee of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation unanimously praised the heroic achievements of the road-building troops in their letters of condolence. Teachers and students of Lhasa Primary School said that they would learn from the spirit of the People's Liberation Army in building Tibet and contribute their own strength to the construction of Tibet. Awa Tsering, a 75-year-old Tibetan poet, wrote a poem congratulating the Spring Festival to the soldiers of the road construction troops. The poem said: "The Kangzang Highway is advancing day by day, bringing a happy and bright prospect to Tibet. The splendid construction of the new China makes the old people also become young."

    拉萨市藏族各阶层人士和爱国团体
    在春节前夕写信慰问康藏公路筑路战士
    【新华社拉萨四日电】二月四日是藏历的春节，拉萨市藏族各阶层人士和爱国团体在节日的前夕曾纷纷写信慰问修筑康藏公路的战士。慰问信上都充满了藏族人民对筑路战士的热爱。拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会的信中说：你们在冰天雪地、高山峻岭中正为我们开辟平坦的大道，你们用自己的血汗，为我们世世代代创造了幸福。因为这条大道，不仅把藏汉族紧密地团结起来，而且沟通了边疆和祖国腹地间经济、文化的联系。西藏地方政府机巧堪布洛桑三旦和台吉江乐金也以拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会正、副主任委员的名义，向筑路部队写信，希望战士们再接再厉，为争取康藏公路全线早日通车而努力。西藏军区干部学校的藏族教员、藏族学员和拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会筹备委员会的代表们，在慰问信中一致赞扬筑路部队的英雄功绩。拉萨小学的教员和学生们表示他们要向人民解放军学习建设西藏的精神，要在西藏的建设事业中贡献出自己的力量。西藏七十五岁的老诗人阿瓦擦珠给修路部队的战士们写了一首祝贺春节的诗，诗里说：“康藏公路一天天向前进，给西藏带来了幸福光明的远景，新中国辉煌灿烂的建设，使老年人们也变年青”。
