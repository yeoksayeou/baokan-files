Agricultural Labor Model Wang Yucai Writes to Industrial Labor Models Meng Tai, etc.
Resolves to Run Agricultural Cooperatives Well and Increase Cotton and Grain Yields

To the three industrial labor models, Meng Tai, Wang Chonglun, and Zhang Mingshan:

I am an ordinary farmer, cultivated by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and have become a provincial agricultural labor model and a member of the provincial and banner (county) People's Governments. In 1952, under the leadership of the Party, I led the masses to establish an agricultural production cooperative of eleven households. By 1953, it had grown to forty-five households. In recent years, because we have organized ourselves and used the new-style farm tools and chemical fertilizers made by our worker brothers, grain yields have increased year by year, and our lives have improved year by year. Last year, all our cooperative members actively engaged in production and overcame difficulties. Of the 590 mu of land in the cooperative, 510 mu were deeply ploughed with new farm tools, and the crops grew particularly well. At harvest time, the average yield was 345 jin per mu. Although 39.5 mu of cotton suffered from insect pests in the summer, we used sprayers and insecticides made by our worker brothers to control them, and the cotton grew better than others', yielding more than 310 jin per mu. In total, last year's production increased by more than 30 percent compared to the previous year. We have already sold the surplus grain to the state.

After studying the General Line, we learned that the country is gradually transitioning to a socialist society, and everyone is extremely happy! Isn't the Communist Party leading our revolution precisely to build a socialist society and eventually reach a communist society? We saw in the newspapers that the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Company had built three great projects: the seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace. We saw the contributions that you and other industrial labor models have made to national construction... We deeply know that your creations are of great significance for developing heavy industry. And as heavy industry develops, the national defense of the motherland can be further consolidated, light industry can be further developed, and we farmers can use more and better agricultural machines, chemical fertilizers, and insecticides, as well as inexpensive and good-quality daily necessities. Last year, we used horse-drawn farm tools, and our cooperative members are all grateful to the worker brothers for making furniture for us, and we also hope that the worker brothers will build tractors for us in the future to help us further increase production and live a better life like the Soviet farmers. If we want the country to achieve socialist industrialization quickly, we farmers also have a responsibility. We are determined to further improve agricultural production cooperatives, actively improve technology, increase yields, produce more grain and more industrial raw materials, and support national construction and our worker brothers. We have already planned our production increase for 1954, striving to increase grain and cotton yields by another 25 percent on the basis of the bumper harvest of 1953, and sell more grain and cotton to the state to support national industrial construction.

Worker Comrades: Although you are engaged in industrial construction in the cities and we are engaged in agriculture in the countryside, our ideals and goals are the same, both for realizing a socialist society. Let us join hands and move towards our common goal.

Wang Yucai, Agricultural Labor Model of Rehe Province, Director of the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative of Kalaqin Left Banner

    农业劳动模范王玉才给工业劳动模范孟泰等写信
    决心办好农业合作社并提高棉粮产量孟泰、王崇伦、张明山三位工业劳动模范：
    我是一个普通农民，在共产党和毛主席的培养下，当了省的农业劳动模范及省、旗人民政府的委员。一九五二年，在党的领导下，我带领群众成立了一个十一户的农业生产合作社，一九五三年已发展到四十五户。几年来，由于我们组织起来，并使上了工人老大哥制造的新式农具和化学肥料，粮食就一年比一年打的多，生活也一年比一年好了。去年，我们全体社员积极生产，克服困难。全社的五百九十亩土地中，有五百一十亩用新农具深翻，庄稼长得特别好，秋收时每亩平均打了三百四十五斤。夏天虽然三十九亩半棉花发生了虫害，但我们使用工人老大哥制造的喷雾器、杀虫药剂来防治，结果也比别人的长得好，每亩摘了棉花三百十多斤。总计去年比前年增产了百分之三十以上。我们已把余粮卖给了国家。
    学习了总路线以后，我们知道了国家正在逐步过渡到社会主义社会去，大伙乐极啦！共产党领导着咱们革命，不就是为了建设社会主义社会最后到共产主义社会吗？我们在报纸上看到鞍钢的工人同志们修建了无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉三个伟大的工程，看到了你们和其他工业劳动模范对国家建设的贡献……。我们深深地知道：你们的创造，对发展重工业有着重大的意义；而重工业发展了，祖国的国防才能进一步巩固，轻工业才能进一步发展，我们农民也才能使上更多、更好的农业机器、化学肥料和杀虫药械和价廉物美的日用必需品。去年，我们使上了马拉农具，我们的社员都感谢工人老大哥给我们制造了家具，并且还希望工人老大哥在以后给我们造出拖拉机来，帮助我们进一步提高生产，过上苏联农民那样的美好生活。要想使国家很快地达到社会主义工业化，我们农民也有责任。我们决心进一步办好农业生产合作社，并积极改进技术，提高产量，多打粮食和多生产工业原料，支援国家建设和工人老大哥。我们已经把一九五四年的增产计划订好了，争取在一九五三年的丰产基础上使粮食、棉花的产量再提高百分之二十五，把更多的粮食、棉花卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。
    工人同志们：虽然你们在城市搞工业建设，我们在农村搞农业，但咱们的理想和奋斗目标却是一个，都是为了实现社会主义社会。让咱们携起手来，向着我们的共同目标前进吧。
    热河省农业劳动模范  喀喇沁左旗红旗农业生产合作社主任  王玉才
