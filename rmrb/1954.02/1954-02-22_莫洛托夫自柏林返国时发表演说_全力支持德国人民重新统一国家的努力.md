V.M. Molotov and Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl delivered brief speeches.

The full text of Molotov's speech is as follows:

Dear Comrade Chairman, dear friends:

As I leave Berlin, I feel it is my duty to express my deep gratitude to the government of the German Democratic Republic and to all our German friends for their hospitality and support to the Soviet delegation during the Berlin Conference.

Please allow me to express my confidence that the German people will certainly be able to overcome all the obstacles that still exist on the road to the reunification of Germany. This is the main task of all democratic and peace-loving forces among the German people. This is in line with the interests of consolidating peace.

In this regard, the Soviet Union will give the German people its wholehearted support.

Long live Soviet-German friendship!

Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl then delivered a reply.

Grotewohl said: The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has given the German people an extremely valuable lesson. That is: the German people can solve their own problems themselves. At present, a major task facing us is to expand cooperation between Germans and deepen understanding between Germans. It is also our task to call on all the German people to oppose the Bonn and Paris military treaties. We will unite all the German people in this struggle.

Grotewohl finally asked Molotov to convey his greetings to the Soviet people and expressed that the citizens of the Democratic Republic of Germany are determined to contribute all their strength to the struggle for national goals and the maintenance of peace.

    敬爱的主席同志、亲爱的朋友们：
    在我离开柏林的时候，我认为我有责任对德意志民主共和国政府和所有德国朋友表示深切的感谢，感谢他们在柏林会议期间对苏联代表团的殷勤款待和支持。
    请允许我表示我的信心：德国人民一定能够克服德国重新统一的道路上还存在的一切障碍。这是德国人民中一切民主和爱好和平的力量的主要任务。这是符合于巩固和平的利益的。
