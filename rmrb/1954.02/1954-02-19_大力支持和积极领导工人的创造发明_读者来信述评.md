Vigorously Support and Actively Lead Workers' Inventions and Creations
-- Reader's Letters and Commentary
Liu Bang

The mass movement of workers' inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals has, under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for the transition period, entered a new high tide. According to the letter from the Industry Department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, statistics from only 29 factories in Taiyuan City show that since September of last year, workers have submitted a total of 7,372 rationalization proposals and tips. Among these, 3,020 have been effectively implemented, creating a value of 12.66951 billion yuan according to incomplete statistics. After workers in the electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant submitted rationalization proposals, the steel saved from September to November was used to cast 31 tons and 823 kilograms of castings. As a result of workers actively creating and finding tricks, the small two-way ground roller in the rolling steel department of the plant was automated, and the mud wall for blocking the iron outlet of the No. 1 blast furnace in the ironmaking department was semi-automated. Reader Hu Cunlin wrote that the employees of the Fushun Mining Bureau's Laohutai Mine submitted a total of 892 rationalization proposals throughout the year, with 827 submitted from September to November. The valuable actions of the workers, inspired and motivated by the socialist vision, to consciously improve labor productivity and create more wealth for the country, play a significant role in ensuring the completion of production tasks and accelerating the speed of national socialist industrialization. Every enterprise cadre should vigorously support and enthusiastically assist them.

However, judging from the information provided in many readers' letters, not all factory and mine enterprise cadres can correctly treat the workers' creative enthusiasm. For example, there are still bureaucratic figures who blatantly stifle rationalization proposals. Reader He Jiang wrote that scraping wooden carriage panels in the passenger car section of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory used to be done entirely by manual labor. This was an important but difficult job for the factory. Workers found the work very strenuous, and efficiency and quality were low. Song Rui, a carpenter in the factory, had been working on using an automatic planer to replace manual labor since 1950. After painstaking research, he initially succeeded. The automatic pneumatic planer could not only replace heavy physical labor but also improve efficiency by one time and ensure quality. However, the cadres of the factory ridiculed and attacked him. Chief Engineer Wang Yinchun said to Song Rui, "At your age, you've never seen a little donkey not eat grass!" Jin Zhiming, the former head of the production planning section, poured cold water on Song Rui's face, saying, "The automatic pneumatic planer can never plane patterns on the carriage panels." During the research process, Song Rui needed some materials from the factory, but the administrative side always delayed giving them to him for two or three months. This tool was successfully developed in early December last year. Song Rui urged the administrative side six times to support him, install the automatic pneumatic planer, and put it into production, but there has been no response to this day.

As for the phenomenon of treating workers' inventions and creations and rationalization proposals with procrastination, perfunctory responses, and passive attitudes, this is also quite common. Reader Hu Shiren wrote that the Pinggui Mining Bureau accumulated more than 980 rationalization proposals from employees last year. Employees of the Fushun Mining Bureau submitted 3,352 inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals last year, but 640 of them are still "under review and processing." Some workers in Shanghai say: "Asking for a divination from a clay Bodhisattva, you might get a good or bad fortune; when a rationalization proposal is submitted, it just disappears without a trace." Reader Sun Linggui wrote that the "cargo location map" created by employees of the Dongjiao Station of the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau was tested at the station in July last year. The results showed that it not only eliminated the phenomenon of pulling the wrong goods and cargo yard congestion, which caused the backlog of cars and prolonged stop times, but also solved the difficulty of calculating storage fees. On September 15th last year, the station submitted this rationalization proposal to the business section of the sub-bureau, requesting its promotion, but the cadres of the business section stuffed the report into a drawer, and that was the end of it. Adopting this "soft soak" attitude towards employees' rationalization proposals actually stifles and suppresses the creative wisdom and political enthusiasm of employees.

In addition, there is another type of leader who only vigorously calls on employees to invent and create, but does not do any specific leadership and organizational work, resulting in the inability to guide workers' creative enthusiasm to focus on solving key production problems. For example, reader Hu Yu wrote that Gu Zhenjiang, an old worker of the Building and Maintenance Team of the Qiqihar Railway Administration, after listening to the report on the general line and the instructions from the higher authorities on invention and creation, was determined to dedicate all his energy to the Party and the people. However, because the leadership took a laissez-faire attitude towards the work of workers submitting rationalization proposals, he blindly put his efforts into researching the "national salvation plane" and "universal bed," which were not scientifically sound. He squeezed out sleep time to draw dozens of drawings, and of course, it was still ineffective in the end. The vast majority of rationalization proposals in the engineering and construction departments of the Qiqihar Railway Administration were "drilled" out by the workers themselves, and very few technicians participated in joint research. The enthusiasm and wisdom of the workers cannot be correctly guided by the leaders, resulting in the result of "thousands of rationalization proposals, but no progress in production," thus frustrating the enthusiasm of the workers.

Promoting advanced experiences, supporting inventions and creations, and rationalization proposals are one of the main methods for leading cadres of state-owned enterprises to rely on the masses of workers to improve their work and complete tasks; it is one of the important signs of whether enterprise cadres maintain a keen sense of new things and whether they truly rely on the masses of workers. Stalin once taught us to attach importance to "the expansion of the creative initiative and magnificent labor upsurge of millions of workers on the front of socialist construction." Today, as our country is gradually transitioning to socialism, all kinds of enterprise workers who do not believe in the creative wisdom of the masses of workers and adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards rationalization proposals should deeply understand this famous saying of Stalin.

    大力支持和积极领导工人的创造发明
    ——读者来信述评
    柳梆
    工人群众的发明、创造和合理化建议运动，在国家过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下，又迈进了一个新的高潮。根据中共太原市委员会工业部来信反映，仅太原市二十九个工厂的统计，去年九月以来，工人群众共提出合理化建议和窍门七千三百七十二件；其中已行之有效的达三千零二十件；创造价值据不完全统计，达一百二十六亿六千九百五十一万元。太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部工人提合理化建议后所节余的钢水，在九月至十一月份共已铸成铸件三十一吨八百二十三公斤。工人积极创造找窍门的结果，该厂轧钢部小型的二道地辊自动化了，炼铁部一高炉堵铁口泥墙半自动化了。读者胡存琳来信说：抚顺矿务局老虎台矿职工全年共出现合理化建议八百九十二件。其中九月至十一月提出的占八百二十七件。职工群众在社会主义远景的鼓舞、激励下，自觉地为提高劳动生产率和给国家更多地创造财富的可贵行动，对于保证完成生产任务和加快国家社会主义工业化的速度有着重大的作用。每一个企业干部都应该大力支持和热情帮助。
    但是，从许多读者来信所提供的情况来看，并不是所有的厂矿企业干部都能正确对待工人的创造热情。例如还有这样明目张胆地扼杀合理化建议的官僚主义者。读者贺江来信说，长辛店机车车辆修理厂客车场刮木皮车帮，过去完全用人力，是该厂既重要又难干的活儿。工人干活时非常费劲，效率和质量都很低。该厂木工宋瑞从一九五○年就琢磨用自动刨子代替人力。经他苦心钻研，初步研究成功后，采用自动风刨不仅可以代替繁重的体力劳动，且能提高效率一倍并保证质量。但是该厂干部反而对他进行讽刺和打击。总工程师王荫春说宋瑞“活这么大年纪，还没有看见过小驴不吃草”！前生产计划科科长金志明当面给宋瑞泼冷水：“自动风刨绝对不能在车帮上刨出花来。”在研究过程中，宋瑞要一些厂里现有的材料，行政方面总是拖上两三个月才给他。去年十二月初这一工具已经研究成功了。宋瑞曾六次催促行政方面支持他，把自动风刨安装起来，投入生产，但到现在还没有下文。
    至于用推拖敷衍、消极应付的手法来对待工人群众的发明创造和合理化建议的现象，也是不少的。读者胡世仁来信说：平桂矿务局去年共积压职工合理化建议九百八十余件。抚顺矿务局的职工，去年提出了三千三百五十二件发明创造和合理化建议，但至今还有六百四十件在“审核处理”中。上海市部分工人中流行着这样的话：“向泥菩萨求签，也有上签下签；合理化建议提上去，就是无声无息。”读者孙龄贵来信反映：北京铁路分局东郊车站职工创制的“货位图”，去年七月在该站试验结果，不仅消灭了拉错货物及货场堵塞造成积压车皮、延长停站时间等现象，而且解决了过去无法计算囤存费的困难。去年九月十五日该站把这件合理化建议呈报到分局商务科，要求推广，但商务科的干部把报告往抽屉里一塞，便“万事大吉”了。对职工的合理化建议采取这种“软泡”的态度，实际上窒息和扼杀了职工的创造智慧和政治热情。
    另外还有一种领导者只是轰轰烈烈地号召职工发明创造，但是却不做任何具体的领导和组织工作，结果使工人的创造热情不能被引导去集中解决生产关键问题。如读者胡钰来信说：齐齐哈尔铁路管理局建筑大修队老工人古振江，在听了总路线的报告和上级关于发明创造的号召以后，决心把自己的全部精力贡献给党和人民。但是，因为领导方面对待工人提合理化建议的工作采取放任自流的态度，以致他盲目地把心血放在研究实际上不合科学原理的“救国刨”和“万能床”上，他挤出睡眠时间画了几十张图样，最后当然还是得不到效果。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局工务、建筑部门的许多合理化建议，绝大部分是工人自己“钻”出来的，很少有技术人员参加共同研究。工人的热情和智慧不能被领导者加以正确引导，造成“合理化建议千千万，生产依然无进展”的结果，因而挫折了工人们的热情。
    推广先进经验、支持发明创造和合理化建议，是国家企业的领导干部依靠工人群众改进工作、完成任务的主要方法之一；是衡量企业干部对新鲜事物是否保持锐敏的感觉和是否真正依靠工人群众的重要标志之一。斯大林曾经教育我们要重视“工人阶级千百万群众在社会主义建设战线上创造发起作用和雄伟劳动热潮的扩展”。在我国正逐步过渡到社会主义的今天，各色各样的不相信工人群众的发明创造智慧和对合理化建议采取官僚主义态度的企业工作人员，应该深切地领会斯大林这一名言。
