    Xinhua News Agency, February 7th Dispatch from Paris via TASS: An increasingly broad segment of the French public is rising up to fight for peaceful negotiations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to end the Vietnam War. In this struggle, communists and members of other parties have established united action.

    "l'Humanité" wrote that the secretaries of the federation committees of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement in the Vosges department jointly issued a letter to the residents. The letter said: "Negotiations are necessary. We believe that negotiations are also possible. The Korean negotiations are proof of this, and there is no reason to conclude that the Ho Chi Minh government would refuse to hold negotiations. Negotiations must be held by both belligerent parties, namely: the French government and the Ho Chi Minh government; the government should consider any method that helps to start negotiations and can bring the negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion."

    Signatures are now being widely collected for this letter to the residents.

    法国广大人民要求通过谈判结束侵越战争
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：法国愈来愈广泛的公众起来斗争，要求和越南民主共和国政府举行和平谈判以结束越南战争。在这一斗争中，共产党员和其他党派的党员之间建立起了一致的行动。
    “人道报”写道，共产党、社会党和人民共和党的孚日省的省委会书记联合发表了告居民书。告居民书中说：“谈判是必要的。我们相信，谈判也是可能的。朝鲜的谈判就是一个证明，而且没有丝毫理由来断定，胡志明政府会拒绝举行谈判。谈判必须由交战国双方来举行，即：法国政府和胡志明政府；政府对于任何有助于开始谈判并能使谈判得到完满结果的方法，都应当加以考虑。”
    现在正为这一告居民书广泛征集签名。
