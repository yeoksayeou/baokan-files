Xinhua News Agency, 10th – As the people's armies of Vietnam and Laos achieve successive victories on a broad front, French Minister of National Defense Pleven and French Chief of Staff Ély hastily flew from Paris to Saigon on the 9th.

Pleven's trip aims to salvage the precarious situation in which French troops are being beaten everywhere. Before Pleven left Paris, the French government's Defense Committee held a secret meeting on the 6th. The French Prime Minister's Office issued a statement saying that Pleven could "make military decisions on the spot" in Indochina. Upon arriving in Saigon, Pleven immediately demanded that the Indochinese puppet governments "participate enthusiastically" in the war. On the same day, he rushed to Luang Prabang, the capital of Laos, where the war situation is critical. Before Pleven's arrival in Indochina, the French government had successively sent French Union Secretary of State Jacquinot, Secretary of State for the Army Dechèvigne, and Army Chief of Staff Blanc, among other military and political leaders, to rush there to hold frequent and chaotic consultations and inspections with French Commander-in-Chief in Indochina Navarre, French High Commissioner in Indochina Dejean, and puppet Bảo Đại. The rapid development of the war situation is so seriously unfavorable to the French army that many reports from Paris and Saigon indicate that the French authorities and their puppets' feelings of frustration, despair, and loss of confidence have reached their peak. The Paris correspondent of the British "Scotsman" reported that at the recent French cabinet meeting, some ministers had to "frankly say that they do not see any hope in the foreseeable future of ultimately defeating the Viet Minh forces by achieving an irresistible military advantage." The Paris "Liberation" wrote on the 9th: "French public opinion is now unanimous, and everyone hopes to end the Indochina War." The report also said that after seven years of war, "enough blood has been shed, enough destruction has been done, and enough poverty has been suffered. Hundreds of billions of francs have been wasted in vain. The French economy's legs are dragging heavier and heavier shackles. Enough is enough! We must negotiate." However, the French authorities have not abandoned their policy of continuing the war, especially as the American authorities have recently more actively insisted on fighting on. US Secretary of Defense Wilson believed on the 9th that a "military victory rather than a negotiated peace" should be achieved. When a French spokesman announced Pleven's mission to Saigon on the 8th, he also said that Pleven would hold talks there with US Army Commander in the Pacific O'Daniel to discuss the overall war situation in Indochina. O'Daniel is currently in Washington "listening to the (American) government's comprehensive instructions on its views on the current Indochina War." He is mainly holding talks with a committee designated by Eisenhower, headed by US Deputy Secretary of Defense Roger Keyes and Under Secretary of State Smith, to specifically plan the US's policy of participating in the Indochina War. According to United Press, the US government's purpose in sending O'Daniel to meet with Pleven is to "stipulate a deadline" for the French aggression in the Indochina War, requiring the French army to "launch a full-scale offensive" after the rainy season this year (the rainy season in Indochina will begin in April or May and end in October) and "end this war." United Press said: "In the next rainy season, the United States is expected to step up the supply of war materials to Indochina in order to have sufficient ground and air materials to supply the increased French Union forces in the next offensive."

    法政府按照美国意旨要继续印度支那战争
    普利文到达西贡准备和美国将军商谈全盘战局
      【新华社十日讯】当越南和寮国的人民军队在广阔的战线上节节胜利之际，法国国防部长普利文和法国总参谋长埃利已在九日匆忙由巴黎飞到西贡。
    普利文此行目的在于拯救目前法国军队处处挨打的危局。在普利文离开巴黎之前，法国政府的国防委员会在六日举行了秘密会议，法国总理公署发表声明说，普利文在印度支那“可以当场作出军事决定”。普利文到达西贡时即要求印度支那各傀儡政府“热诚地参加”战争。他在当天就赶到战局危急的寮国首都琅勃剌邦。在普利文到印度支那之前，法国政府即曾先后派了法兰西联邦成员国关系次长雅盖、国防部陆军次长德谢维涅及陆军参谋长布朗等军政首脑，慌忙赶到那里去，和法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔、法国驻印度支那高级专员德让以及保大等傀儡进行了频繁而慌乱的会商和视察。战局的迅速发展对法国军队是这样严重的不利，以致来自巴黎和西贡的许多消息都指出：法国当局及其傀儡们的沮丧绝望和失掉信心的情绪发展到了顶点。英国“苏格兰人报”驻巴黎记者报道说：在最近举行的法国内阁会议上，有些部长们也不得不
  “坦白地说，他们看不见在可以预见的将来，有什么希望能靠取得无可抗拒的军事优势来最终挫败越盟军队。”巴黎“解放报”九日写道：“法国舆论现在已经一致了，大家都希望结束印度支那战争。”该报又说，在进行了七年的战争以后，“血也流得够了，破坏得也够了，贫穷折磨也受够了。白白浪费了数以千亿计的法郎。法国经济的腿拖上了越来越重的镣铐。这种情况够了！我们必须进行谈判。”然而，法国当局目前并没有放弃它继续战争的政策，特别是美国当局最近更积极地坚持打下去。美国国防部长威尔逊在九日认为应当“取得军事胜利而不是谈判和平”。法国发言人在八日宣布普利文到西贡去的任务时还说，普利文将在那里和美国驻太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔举行会谈，讨论印度支那的全盘战局。奥丹尼尔目前在华盛顿“听取（美国）政府对目前印度支那战争的看法的全面指示”。他主要是和由艾森豪威尔指定的、以美国国防部副部长罗杰·凯斯以及副国务卿史密斯为首的专门策划美国参与印度支那战争的政策的委员会进行会谈。据合众社透露：美国政府派奥丹尼尔与普利文会谈的目的，是要给法国侵略印度支那战争“规定一个期限”，要法军在今年的雨季（印度支那的雨季将在四五月份开始，在十月间结束）之后“展开全面进攻”、“结束这场战争”。合众社说：“在下一个雨季中，预料美国将加紧以战争物资供应印度支那，以便在下一次的攻势中有充分的地面与空中的物资去供应增加了的法兰西联邦军队。”
