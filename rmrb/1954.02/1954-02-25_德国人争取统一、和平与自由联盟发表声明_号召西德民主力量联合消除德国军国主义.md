Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 24th: According to TASS, the Standing Committee of the League of Germans Fighting for Unity, Peace, and Freedom held a meeting in Dusseldorf on February 20th. The meeting determined the League's future political direction and issued a statement on the results of the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

The statement said: "The Berlin Conference clearly proved that resolving the German question is first and foremost a matter for the Germans themselves. All democratic forces in West Germany should draw a practical conclusion from this and unite to eliminate the main obstacle to restoring German unity by peaceful means – the 'European Defence Community' and German militarism. The joint communique of the Four Foreign Ministers exposed the deception of the initiators and propagandists of the 'European Defence Community'."

The statement pointed out that the Bonn government is pursuing an anti-national policy, preventing Germans from expressing and explaining their opinions at the Berlin Conference.

    号召西德民主力量联合消除德国军国主义
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟常务委员会于二月二十日在杜塞尔多夫举行会议。会议决定了联盟今后的政治方向并就柏林四外长会议的结果发表了一个声明。
    声明说：“柏林会议清楚地证明了，解决德国问题首先是德国人自己的事。西德的一切民主力量应该从这里得出一个实际的结论，并且联合起来消除用和平方式恢复德国统一的主要障碍——‘欧洲防务集团’和德国军国主义。四国外长的联合公报暴露了‘欧洲防务集团’的倡议者及其宣传者的欺骗性。”
    声明指出，波恩政府所奉行的是反民族的政策，它不让德国人在柏林会议上发表和解释他们的意见。
