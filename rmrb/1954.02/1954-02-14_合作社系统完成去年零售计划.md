The national supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperative systems overfulfilled the 1953 retail plan and basically completed the procurement plan. The retail plan was fulfilled by about 119%, an increase of nearly 63% compared with 1952. Among them, cotton cloth increased by 60% compared with 1952, edible salt increased by 52%, and chemical fertilizers increased by 24%. The procurement plan was fulfilled by about 99%, an increase of 36% compared with 1952.

Beginning in 1953, many supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives across the country, due to insufficient estimation of market conditions, once inappropriately tightened retail outlets and reduced the variety of goods, causing retail sales to decline. After the summer and autumn, due to a clearer understanding of the principle of serving agricultural production and actively organizing local sources of goods; launching the increase production and practice economy movement, and improving business management; especially under the illumination of the general line of the transition period, a clear understanding of the division of labor in business with state-owned commerce was achieved, and further close integration with state-owned commerce was realized. This has led to a continuous increase in the turnover of cooperatives.

In 1953, cooperatives in various places attached importance to the principle of combining with local handicrafts, paid attention to organizing and developing local sources of goods, and further implemented the principle of "local materials, local processing, and local supply." After the autumn of 1953, cooperatives in most provinces across the country held internal materials exchange fairs. According to statistics from 312 grassroots cooperatives and 276 counties, 19 special districts, 3 provinces, and 3 large regional materials exchange fairs, the total transaction volume reached 15,762 billion yuan. The materials exchange fair held by the East China Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives had a total transaction volume of 200 billion yuan, of which handicrafts and local and special products accounted for 99%. By organizing local sources of goods, cooperatives in various places have generally increased the variety of goods they operate. In November last year, most grassroots cooperatives in Shandong Province increased their commodities by about 30 to 100 types, and some increased by more than 150 types. Cooperatives in various places attached importance to the supply of agricultural production materials last year, and the quantity and variety have increased significantly. In addition to continuing to operate fertilizers, various places have also vigorously supplied various small farm tools, livestock, carts, timber, bricks, and tiles. Due to the emphasis on organizing local sources of goods, supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives in various places have further strengthened their ties with handicraft production cooperatives. The output value of national handicraft production cooperatives in 1953 increased by 73.3% compared with 1952, and the products were mainly sold to state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives. Taking April last year as an example, 46% of the products of national handicraft production cooperatives were sold through supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, 50% in East China, and 63% in Northwest China.

The division of labor and cooperation between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce also made great progress in 1953. State-owned commercial enterprises in various places have strengthened their business leadership over cooperatives, adopted methods such as sending commodity catalogs and commodity samples to cooperatives, or establishing commodity communication networks in cooperatives, to strengthen their ties with cooperatives. In many areas, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives jointly held meetings and signed agreements or contracts. These methods have been of great help to the development of cooperative business.

The increase production and practice economy movement in 1953 promoted the improvement of business management and improved the quality of work in cooperatives in various places. Cooperatives in many areas have created and promoted advanced experiences such as setting up stalls on market days, exhibiting commodities, and sending salespersons to the countryside to deliver goods and purchase goods locally. In some areas, cooperatives have implemented a "joint work system," which has increased turnover. Due to the improvement of business management, the expense ratio of the supply and marketing business of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives decreased in the third quarter of last year compared with the second quarter. The supply business expense ratio decreased from 6.51% to 3.99%, and the sales business expense ratio decreased from 11.24% to 11.07%. These have played a significant role in the completion of the retail plan and the procurement plan.

The work of the national supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives in 1953 still had shortcomings, especially insufficient understanding of the improvement of farmers' enthusiasm for production and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and a lack of in-depth investigation and research into the changes in rural purchasing power and the actual needs of farmers. These need to be improved in the future.

### 合作社系统完成去年零售计划

    合作社系统完成去年零售计划
    全国供销合作社和消费合作社系统超额完成了一九五三年零售计划，并基本上完成了收购计划。零售计划约完成百分之一百一十九，比一九五二年增加近百分之六十三。其中棉布比一九五二年增加百分之六十，食盐增加百分之五十二，化学肥料增加百分之二十四。收购计划约完成百分之九十九，比一九五二年增加百分之三十六。
    一九五三年开始，全国不少供销、消费合作社由于对市场情况估计不足，曾一度不适当地紧缩零售机构，减少商品品种，使零售额呈现下降趋势。夏秋以后，由于进一步明确认识了为农业生产服务的方针，积极组织地方货源；开展了增产节约运动，改善了经营管理；特别是在过渡时期总路线的照耀下，明确认识了和国营商业在经营上的分工，并和国营商业有了进一步的密切结合。这就使合作社的营业额获得了不断的上升。
    各地合作社在一九五三年都重视了与当地手工业结合的方针，注意组织和开辟地方货源，进一步贯彻了“就地取材，就地加工，就地供应”的原则。一九五三年秋后，全国大部省份的合作社都召开了合作社内部的物资交流会。据三百一十二个基层合作社和二百七十六个县、十九个专区、三个省和三个大区性的物资交流会的统计，成交总额达一万五千七百六十二亿元。全国合作总社华东区办事处召开的物资交流会上，成交总额达二千亿元，其中手工业品和土产品、特产品占百分之九十九。通过组织地方货源，各地合作社普遍增加了经营品种。山东省大部分基层合作社在去年十一月份都增加商品三十种到一百种左右，有的增加一百五十余种。各地合作社在去年都重视了农业生产资料的供应工作，数量、品种都增加不少。各地除继续经营肥料外，还大力供应了各种小农具及牲口、大车、木材、砖瓦等。由于重视了组织地方货源的工作，各地供销合作社和消费合作社都进一步密切了与手工业生产合作社的联系。全国手工业生产合作社一九五三年产值比一九五二年增加百分之七十三点三，产品主要是销给国营商业和供销合作社。以去年四月份为例，全国手工业生产合作社的产品通过供销合作社、消费合作社推销的占百分之四十六，华东区占百分之五十，西北区达百分之六十三。
    国营商业和合作社商业的分工配合，一九五三年也有很大进步。各地国营商业加强了对合作社的业务领导，采用送商品目录、商品样本给合作社，或在合作社里建立商品通讯网等办法，加强与合作社的联系。不少地区的国营商业部门和合作社共同举行会议，订立了协议或合同。这些办法，都对合作社业务的开展有很大帮助。
    一九五三年的增产节约运动，推动各地合作社改善了经营管理，提高了工作质量。许多地区的合作社创造和推广了集日摆摊、展览商品和代销员送货下乡、就地收购等先进经验。有些地区的合作社推行了“连带上班制”，增加了营业额。由于改善了经营管理，全国合作总社供应和推销业务的费用率，去年第三季度比第二季度都有所降低，供应业务费用率由百分之六点五一降低到百分之三点九九，推销业务费用率由百分之十一点二四降低到百分之十一点零七。这都对零售计划和收购计划的完成起了很大作用。
    一九五三年全国供销合作社、消费合作社的工作还是有缺点的，特别是对农民生产积极性提高和互助合作运动发展这一情况认识不足，对农村购买力的变化以及农民实际需要缺乏深入的调查研究，这都需要在今后努力加以改进。
