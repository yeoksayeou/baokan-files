Xinhua News Agency, February 10th: The delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA), selected to extend greetings to the People's Liberation Army (PLA), arrived in the capital this afternoon, led by General Xie Youfa, the head of the delegation.

Those who welcomed them at the station included: Mei Gongbin, Zhou Xinmin, and Xin Zhichao, Deputy Secretaries-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Liu Guanyi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Resist America, Aid Korea General Association; Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission; representatives from various democratic parties; and numerous artistic workers from the military.

The CPVA delegation consists of heroes, models, and meritorious individuals selected from various units and arms of the CPVA. The delegation also includes an art troupe. The delegation and art troupe together comprise more than six hundred people.

Before the delegation returned to the country, the leading organs of the CPVA held a farewell meeting. General Yang Dezhi, Deputy Commander of the CPVA, and General Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department, delivered reports to all members of the delegation, instructing them to convey the deep concern and high respect of all commanders and combatants of the CPVA to the fraternal PLA, and to learn humbly from the PLA.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency reporters Jiang Qingzhao, Yu Fengyuan, and Ji Zhaopu: The CPVA delegation includes outstanding senior commanders, distinguished heroes, models, and meritorious individuals. The representatives come from the front lines of various units on the northern edge of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, from the east and west coasts of Korea, and from various arms such as artillery, tanks, engineering, railway, logistics, and hospitals, as well as various work posts. Among these representatives are many heroic figures well-known to the people of the motherland, including first-class hero and special-class meritorious individual Yang Yucai, second-class hero and special-class meritorious individual Yi Caixue, second-class hero and first-class meritorious individual Zhang Furong, second-class hero and first-class meritorious individual Shen Zhihong, second-class hero and first-class meritorious individual Shang Yanfa, and second-class hero and first-class meritorious individual Huang Zaiyu. The representatives also include Liu Si, a second-class hero and first-class meritorious individual from the artillery; Yang Aru, the tank commander of Tank No. 215, a first-class meritorious individual from the tank corps, who was awarded collective special-class merit; Lu Yaowen, a special-class meritorious individual who created a gasoline-saving method and became a model for cherishing the assets of the motherland; Zhao Hongjun, a battalion chief of staff who was awarded first-class merit for railway repair tasks; Zhang Chuanxin, a model engineer and squad leader who opened mountains and built roads; Yang Jinsheng, a first-class meritorious individual who cleared mines and rescued vehicles; and female meritorious individuals Xu Dehua, Zhao Huijuan, Zhu Yong, and Zhang Xianneng.

When the representatives left their units, their comrades warmly saw them off and repeatedly urged them: "Report our situation well to the PLA elder brothers," "Be sure to convey our best wishes to the elder brothers." Each representative regarded returning to the country to extend greetings to the PLA as a glorious and important task. Combat hero Yi Caixue said: "I feel extremely honored to be able to extend greetings to the PLA elder brothers this time. We have been abroad for more than three years and have achieved victory together with the Korean people and army. However, without the PLA elder brothers diligently guarding the frontiers and coastal defenses of the motherland and protecting the motherland's economic construction, our victory would not have been possible. We have always looked forward to this day when we can personally return to the country to thank and salute the PLA elder brothers." Combat hero and platoon leader Wang Zhanshan, who commanded a platoon to defeat twenty-eight counterattacks by the enemy, ranging from a platoon to two battalions in strength, during last year's Korean summer counterattack campaign, and who persisted in commanding despite being wounded four times. His platoon eliminated more than four hundred enemy soldiers. Wang Zhanshan said that he would tell the PLA about these deeds. He said: "We have learned the PLA's spirit of patriotism and heroic fighting style, so we have achieved victory. In the future, we will continue to work hard to learn from the PLA to defend the motherland and world peace." Zhang Furong, the flag bearer who planted the red flag on Jiaoyan Mountain during last year's Korean summer campaign, said that he would tell the PLA comrades guarding the coastal defenses of the motherland how the news of the PLA's annihilation of more than 3,300 remnant bandits who had infiltrated Dongshan Island last summer encouraged the CPVA fighting in the Kim Seong area of Korea. Engineering model Zhang Chuanxin said: "I want to tell the PLA elder brothers stationed on the Kangzang Plateau many things, let them know how much we like to sing the song 'Singing of Erlang Mountain', this song encouraged us to open up many mountains, build many bridges, and construct many roads!" The representatives will also follow the entrustment of their comrades, humbly learn from the PLA elder brothers, learn from the PLA's experience in regularization and modernization of training and education, and the experience of cultural and theoretical study, learn the spirit and style of hard struggle of the frontier and coastal defense forces, and learn the PLA's noble qualities of being forever loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people.

Accompanying the CPVA delegation back to the country to extend greetings are many excellent art troupes and performing teams of soldiers who have grown up in combat. They have prepared many wonderful programs for the PLA, including the song and dance "Planting the Red Flag on Old Baldy Mountain," the Beijing drum "The Great Soldier Qiu Shaoyun," the Shandong Allegro "Young Hero Hu Xiudao," and Sichuan storytelling, crosstalk, and dances depicting the combat life of various arms, as well as famous Korean songs and excellent folk dances.
