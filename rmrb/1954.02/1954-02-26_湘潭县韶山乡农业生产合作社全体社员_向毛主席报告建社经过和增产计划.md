Respected Chairman Mao:

With extremely joyful hearts, we report to you: under the glorious illumination of the general line, the first agricultural producers' cooperative in your hometown—Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan—has been established. Our agricultural producers' cooperative was formed on the foundation of the Liu Xiuhua and Tian Meisheng mutual aid teams, and absorbed two individual farming households. These two mutual aid teams were established in 1951 and already had a certain foundation of mutual assistance. After studying the general line, everyone further clarified the necessity of socialist transformation of agriculture and the path that farmers should take. After applying, the higher authorities carefully considered that our conditions for transitioning to a cooperative were mature and the demand was urgent, so they approved our establishment of an agricultural producers' cooperative and sent a work team to assist us. From January 16th to February 7th, after full deliberation and handling some issues in the transition to a cooperative, we also formed a cooperative affairs committee and elected Liu Xiuhua as the director, and Mao Hanzhang and Tian Meisheng as the deputy directors.

Chairman Mao, we understand that we are a pilot agricultural producers' cooperative in the area, and whether we run it well or badly will have a great impact. Therefore, we resolutely implement the principle of "only allowing it to be run well, and not allowing it to be run badly," so that nearby farmers can see the benefits of agricultural producers' cooperatives with their own eyes, further enhance their enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation, and actively improve production. The fundamental sign of running the cooperative well is to produce more grain and increase income. After detailed discussion, we decided that the entire cooperative's 95.655 mu of fields should increase production by 18% on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. This year, the average yield per mu should be 700 jin of grain. In order to achieve this goal, all cooperative members are determined to work actively and guarantee to achieve the following points:

\t1. Unify the allocation of labor, on the one hand, clearly divide the work according to technology, and on the other hand, divide the area into two production groups (production responsibility areas) to fully leverage strengths and labor efficiency.

\t2. Accept advanced farming techniques, improve working methods, and achieve planting according to local conditions. All fields should be made into suitable seedling beds, achieving sparse sowing, even transplanting, and dense planting of seedlings, with 300 jin of seeds sown per mu of seedling bed. According to sunlight and water conservancy conditions, promote double-cropping rice on 40.31 mu of fields, and adopt dense planting of seedlings on 20 mu of single-cropping rice, and adopt frame-supported rice dense planting (row and plant spacing of one foot) on 35 mu of single-cropping rice.

\t3. Cultivate meticulously, deeply plow densely. Generally, the fields are plowed to a depth of four inches; in the past, only one plowing was done in the width of one rice seedling cluster, now three plowings are done in the width of two rice seedling clusters. Levee fields are plowed three times and harrowed six times, high bank fields are plowed four times and harrowed eight times. Carefully clear the field ridges, pull weeds, and prevent pests.

\t4. Apply more fertilizer and apply fertilizer reasonably. The entire cooperative already has green manure in 63.9 mu of fields and 514 dan of pig and cow manure; it is planned to accumulate more than 6,000 dan of manure, ash, lime, sod, and enclosure soil, averaging 72.8 dan per mu of field (excluding grass seeds), and apply fertilizer in stages according to the nature of the field.

\t5. Increase sideline income and reduce grain consumption. After the cooperative's land has harvested the nine-seed three-harvest (planted in September, harvested in March) crops, all of it will be planted with sweet potatoes; it is planned to reclaim another ten mu of wasteland to plant sweet potatoes. Make good use of the vegetables in the garden, and plant more spring and summer early-harvest crops. This will not only increase the income from miscellaneous grains and appropriately reduce the staple food consumed by people; at the same time, it can solve the feed for the 31 pigs, 24 ducks, and 40 chickens raised by the entire cooperative. All the cooperative's labor force will be fully invested in production during the busy farming season, and after the busy farming season, five or six laborers will be drawn out to help the supply and marketing cooperative grind rice, or participate in other construction work.

    湘潭县韶山乡农业生产合作社全体社员
    向毛主席报告建社经过和增产计划敬爱的毛主席：
    我们怀着极度愉快的心情向您报告：在总路线的光辉照耀下，您的故乡——湘潭韶山乡第一个农业生产合作社成立了。我们的农业生产合作社是由刘秀华、田梅生两个互助组为基础，吸收了二户单干农民组织起来的。这两个互助组在一九五一年成立，已经有了一定的互助基础，学习总路线后大家更进一步明确了对农业进行社会主义改造的必要性和农民应该走的道路。经过申请，上级慎重考虑到我们转社的条件已经成熟，要求又迫切，批准了我们办农业生产合作社，并且派工作组来协助。从一月十六日起到二月七日，经过充分酝酿，处理转社中的一些问题，并且还组成了社务委员会，选出了刘秀华担任社长，毛汉章、田梅生担任副社长。
    毛主席，我们懂得我们是当地试办的一个农业生产合作社，办好办坏影响很大。所以，我们坚决贯彻“只许办好，不许办坏”的方针，使附近的农民亲眼看到农业生产合作社的好处，进一步提高互助合作的热情，积极搞好生产。办好社的根本标志是多打粮食，增加收入。经过我们详细讨论，决定全社九十五亩六分五厘五毫田，要在去年丰产的基础上再增产百分之十八，今年平均每亩田要产谷七百斤。为了达到这个目的，全体社员决心积极劳动，并保证做到以下几点：
    一、统一调配劳动力，一方面按技术明确分工，另一方面按地域分成两个生产小组（生产责任区），以充分发挥特长和劳动效力。
    二、接受先进耕作技术，改良工作方法，做到因地种植。全部的田都做合式秧田，做到稀播、匀插，分蔸密植，每亩秧田下种三百斤。按照阳光、水利条件，推广四十亩三分一厘田的双季稻，并将二十亩田的单季稻采用分蔸密植，三十五亩田的单季稻采用架子禾密植（行株距离一尺）。
    三、精耕细作，深耕密犁。一般田犁到四寸深；过去一个禾蔸宽的地方只有一犁，现在做到二个禾蔸宽的地方犁三犁。垅田三犁六耙，高岸田四犁八耙。仔细铲田塍，扯杂草，预防虫害。
    四、多施肥，合理施肥。现在全社已有六十三亩九分田的绿肥和五百十四担猪、牛粪；计划再积粪肥、草木灰、石灰、草皮、圈土等六千多担，每亩田平均七十二点八担（草籽在外），按田的性质分期下肥。
    五、增加副业收入，减少粮食消耗。社内的地收完九种三收（九月种三月收）的作物后，全部种红薯；准备再开十亩荒地种红薯。把园里的菜作好，多种春夏早收作物。这样不但增加了杂粮收入、适当减少了人吃的主粮；同时可以解决全社所喂的三十一只猪、二十四只鸭、四十只鸡的饲料。全社劳动力在农忙时全力投入生产，在农忙后抽出五、六个劳动力来帮供销合作社碾米，或参加其他建设工作。湘潭韶山乡农业生产合作社全体社员
