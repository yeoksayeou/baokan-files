Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 17th: Indian newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' participation in the war of aggression against Indochina.

    The "Hindustan Times" published an editorial on the 16th, saying: What will be the result of American aid to France? "Korea is an example." The newspaper pointed out: "It is useless for France to hope that others will pull it out of the abyss it has fallen into. As long as it suggests a truce to Dr. Ho Chi Minh directly or through a neutral country, the Indochina War can be stopped. Prolonging the war will not mean victory, but only mean France's losses at home and abroad, making France completely unable to play a role in international affairs."

    The "National Herald" published an editorial on the 14th entitled "Syngman Rhee's Self-Recommendation," saying that Syngman Rhee had already expressed his willingness to send troops to Indochina to participate in the war through "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces" Hull. Hull believes that South Korea sending troops to Indochina to fight has "certain benefits." The newspaper pointed out: Hull's so-called "certain benefits" are partly because "this can reduce the burden on France, because the hopes placed on the Bao Dai Vietnamese army have not been realized"; however, "more importantly, this measure means: for the benefit of Western countries, Asians are being driven to fight Asians in the name of the United Nations."

   Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: TASS, Paris, February 16th: The long-lasting Vietnam War has brought great suffering to the French people, thus arousing increasingly firm opposition from French politicians and social figures. The call for the start of Vietnam negotiations is becoming more and more frequent in France.

    According to "Le Monde", Mendes-France, a prominent figure in the Radical Socialist Party, said in Vernon: "Only through direct negotiations between the belligerent countries can the Indochina War be ended." Social Party member of parliament, Nacherand, also advocated the immediate start of Indochina peace talks. Speaking at a meeting of the Socialist Party's Perpignan branch, he criticized the French government's actions and advocated that France must pursue an independent policy.

    The Socialist Party's organ, "Le Populaire de Paris," emphasized that the military and political situation in Vietnam is very serious for France. The newspaper wrote: "Hasn't the time come to learn from events and try to find a path for negotiations?"

   Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: The American "Baltimore Sun" recently published an article from London by Lord Winster, who had visited Paris. This article acknowledged that the French public generally hates the United States for causing France to continue to be trapped in the Indochina War and demands negotiations to end this costly war.

    The article said: "This war (the Indochina War) has been fought for eight years, and now France says: 'This war has been messed up.'... All I see from this war is disappointment, discouragement, and anger. If France has to negotiate, I believe most French people would be happy. People's hatred of the war has been growing rapidly, and this hatred has become very obvious among members of parliament."

    The article continued: "They believe that the United States and Britain are shamelessly watching the French army being held back overseas, away from Europe, while trying to blackmail France to agree to Germany's rearmament. At the same time, the French army's casualties in Indochina have been much more severe than the UN forces' casualties in Korea. In their view, why can't the soldiers be allowed to go home, stop the waste of manpower, and carry out some reorganization of the domestic military situation to deal with the dangers contained in Germany's rearmament?"

    法政界和社会人士日益反对进行侵越战争
    【新华社新德里十七日电】印度报纸对美国参加侵略印度支那战争表示不满。
      “印度斯坦时报”十六日发表社论说：美国援助法国会得到什么结果，“朝鲜就是一个例子”。该报指出：“法国希望别人把它拉出它已经陷入的深渊，是没有什么用处的。只要它直接或通过中立国向胡志明博士建议停战，印度支那战争就可以停止。拖延战争并不会意味着胜利，只会意味着法国在国内和国际的损失，使法国在国际事务中完全不能起作用。”
    “国民先驱报”十四日以“李承晚的自荐”为题发表社论说：李承晚已经通过“联合国军总司令”赫尔表示愿意派遣军队到印度支那去参战。赫尔认为南朝鲜派遣军队到印度支那去作战有“某些好处”。该报指出：赫尔所谓有“某些好处”，一方面是因为“这样能够减轻法国的负担，因为寄托于保大越南军队身上的希望没有实现”；但是，“更加重要的是这个措施意味着：为了西方国家的利益，以联合国的名义驱使亚洲人打亚洲人。”
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎十六日讯：延续了很久的越南战争给法国人民带来巨大痛苦，因而引起法国政界人士和社会人士日益坚决的反对，要求开始举行越南谈判的呼声在法国愈来愈频繁。
    据“新闻报”报道，激进社会党的著名人士孟戴斯—弗朗斯在维农市说：“只有通过交战国的直接谈判，才能结束印度支那战争。”社会党议员纳歇朗也主张立即开始举行印度支那和平谈判。他在社会党柏平尼昂支部的会议上发表演说时，抨击法国政府的所作所为，主张法国必须执行独立的政策。
      社会党机关报“巴黎人民报”着重指出，越南的军事局势和政治局势使法国感到十分严重，该报写道：“从事件中吸取教训，尽力设法找到谈判道路的时候难道还没有到来吗？”
   【新华社十七日讯】美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”最近刊登了曾到巴黎访问的温斯特勋爵自伦敦寄出的一篇文章，这篇文章承认法国公众普遍憎恨美国使法国继续陷于印度支那战争，并要求用谈判来结束这场伤亡惨重的战争。
      文章说：“这场战争（印度支那战争）已打了八年了，现在法国说：‘这场战争是打糟了’。……我从这场战争中看到的只是失望、灰心与愤怒。如果法国不得不谈判的话，我相信大多数法国人都会高兴。人们对于战争的憎恨一直在迅速增长，这种憎恨在议员中间变得很明显。”
    文章接着说：“他们认为，美国和英国一面无耻地眼看法军被牵制在海外，离开欧洲：一面却企图敲诈法国，使它同意德国的重新武装。同时，法军在印度支那的伤亡已经比联合国军在朝鲜的伤亡惨重得多。在他们看来，为什么不能让士兵们回家，停止人力的消耗，对国内的军事局势进行某种整顿，来对付德国重新武装所包含的危险呢？”
