In Yuci County, Shanxi Province, Jinxiang Township, the general election work is closely integrated with production. As of now, not only has it successfully completed the population survey, voter registration, and representative election work, but it has also made significant achievements in manure accumulation and spring wheat sowing preparations.

When the general election work began in the township in mid-January, cadres and the masses worried that the general election would delay production, or said, "The current cadres are good enough, why bother with elections?" After discovering these problems, the work team held meetings with party member cadres and the masses respectively, educating the cadres and the masses to correctly understand the relationship between the general election and production, and to understand the possibility and necessity of combining the two. At the same time, they used the example of the landlord class element Li Shengzhi's attempt to settle scores with Guo Gou Lian regarding the fruits of his liberation to educate people, and used recollection and comparison methods to politically calculate three accounts, so that cadres and the masses recognized the relationship between the people's democratic regime and the development of production and the improvement of people's lives. Zhang Yuzhong, the youth league branch organization member of Yang Village, said, "If we don't work hard and let the knives fall into the hands of bad people, our own heads will be cut off without us even knowing what happened! We won't be able to keep the good times we have now." This aroused the cadres and the masses to pay attention to the general election work and actively participate in the general election activities.

After the cadres and the masses were mobilized, in order to closely integrate the general election and production, unified arrangements were made from the organizational leadership. First, a township election committee was established, and a work plan was formulated. Under the unified leadership of the election committee, unified work teams were organized by village (that is, all cadres from the Party, government, and League departments in the township were completely integrated), with twelve or thirteen people in large villages and seven or eight people in small villages. Each village cadre was collectively led and assigned responsibilities. In this way, not only was the production work and the election work unified from the organizational leadership, overcoming the opposition of the three tasks of general election, production, and the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, but also avoiding the work team's monopoly and substitution of the general election work.

Jinxiang Township has a total of 15,895 mu of land. After the grain purchase, the masses' enthusiasm for increasing wheat production has greatly increased. The whole village plans to sow more than 5,000 mu of spring wheat this year, with 70 dan of fertilizer applied per mu, an increase of 20 dan compared to last year. Therefore, the main demand of farmers in production is currently manure accumulation. According to the masses' habit of pulling manure to accumulate fertilizer in the morning, the work team determined that the time from morning to before lunch was the time for manure accumulation and production, and the time after lunch was the time for election activities, and helped Zhang Pingan Agricultural Production Cooperative and Yao Guangsheng Mutual Aid Group formulate short-term production plans, driving the mutual aid groups and individual farmers to greet the general election with practical actions. The work team cadres, whether in meetings, investigations, or registration, tried their best to be more attentive and walk more, so as not to make the masses walk more and delay work. For example, when reviewing the qualifications of voters, the newly established agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups were conducting reviews of the composition of members and group members. They used agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups as units to divide voter groups, and at the same time conducted reviews of voter qualifications and cooperative (group) member composition, so that the two tasks were combined. Later, the deliberation of representative candidates was combined with the deliberation and evaluation of agricultural production cooperative cadres, which the masses were very satisfied with.

Due to unified leadership and clear division of labor, the general election was closely centered on production. Now, the general election work in the township has smoothly completed the population survey, voter registration, representative election, and other tasks. Moreover, through the general election, the production of the entire township has been greatly promoted. Under the leadership of Zhang Pingan Agricultural Production Cooperative and Yao Guangsheng Mutual Aid Group, many large carts in the township go to Yuci city every day to pull manure and accumulate fertilizer. According to the land of the whole township, a total of 1,112,650 dan of fertilizer is needed, and 890,000 dan have been completed. The remaining 220,000 dan can be completed before spring plowing and sowing. The original plan was to accumulate 397,500 jin of fuel for the winter, and 358,000 jin have been accumulated. Great progress has also been made in mutual assistance and cooperation. Last year, the number of organized households only accounted for 54 percent of the total population. Now, an agricultural production cooperative with 26 households has been established, and many new mutual aid groups have been established. The number of organized households has reached 70 percent. Now, the people of the whole township are full of confidence to do a good job in the grass-roots elections, and strive to increase the average yield of grain per mu from 325 jin last year to 368.5 jin this year, in order to produce more grain to support the country's economic construction.

    山西省榆次县近城乡
    普选工作密切结合生产进行
    山西省榆次县近城乡普选工作紧密结合生产进行，截至目前，不仅圆满地完成了人口调查、选民登记、代表选举等项工作，并在积肥和春麦播种等准备工作上做出了显著成绩。
    一月中旬普选工作在该乡开始时，干部和群众耽心普选会耽误生产，或说：“现在的干部就好，还选什么呢？”工作组发现这些问题后，分别召开了党员干部和群众会议，教育干部和群众正确认识普选与生产的关系，认识两者可能结合和必须结合的道理。同时，又以去年地主阶级分子李生枝向郭狗练倒算翻身果实的事例进行教育，用回忆对比的方法从政治上算了三笔账，使干部和群众认识了人民民主政权对发展生产和改善人民生活的关系。杨村青年团支部组织委员张玉重说：“要是不好好干，让刀把子握到坏人手里，就会闹得自己的脑袋叫人割走，还不知道是怎回事哩！现在的好光景也就保不住了。”这样就引起了干部、群众对普选工作的重视，积极投入普选活动。
    干部和群众发动起来后，为了使普选、生产紧密结合，便从组织领导上作了统一安排。首先成立了乡选举委员会，制订了工作计划，在选举委员会的统一领导下，以村为单位，组织了统一工作组（即把党、政、团各部门在乡的所有干部完全编在一起），大村十二、三人，小村七、八人。各村干部都是集体领导，分工负责。这样，不仅把生产工作与选举工作从组织领导上统一起来，克服了普选、生产、建立农业生产合作社三项工作的对立，而且避免了工作组对普选工作的包办代替。
    近城乡共一万五千八百九十五亩土地，粮食收购后，群众增产小麦的积极性大大提高。全村计划今年播种五千多亩春麦，每亩施肥七十担，比去年增加二十担，所以农民当前在生产上的主要要求是积肥。工作组根据这种情况，依照群众早晨拉粪积肥的习惯，确定早晨至午饭前是积肥生产时间，午饭后是选举活动时间，并帮助张平安农业生产合作社、药光胜互助组制订了短期生产计划，带动互助组和个体农民以实际行动迎接普选。工作组干部不论在开会、调查、登记等方面，都尽量做到多用心、多走路，不让群众多走路，多误工。如在审查选民资格时，新建的农业生产合作社和互助组正在进行社员、组员成分的审查，他们便以农业生产合作社和互助组为单位，划分选民小组，同时进行选民资格和社（组）员成分的审查，使两项工作结合进行。后来酝酿代表候选人，又和酝酿评选农业生产合作社干部结合起来，群众非常满意。
    由于统一领导，明确分工，普选紧紧围绕生产进行，现在该乡的普选工作已顺利地完成了人口调查、选民登记、代表选举等工作。而且通过普选，又大大推动了全乡的生产。全乡群众在张平安农业生产合作社、药光胜互助组带头下，每天有很多大车到榆次城内拉粪积肥，按全乡土地计算，共需肥料一百一十一万二千六百五十担，现已完成八十九万担，所欠二十二万余担，春耕播种前可全部完成。原计划冬季积燃料三十九万七千五百斤，现已积下三十五万八千斤。在互助合作方面也取得很大成绩。去年组织起来的户数只占总人口的百分之五十四，现在成立了一个二十六户的农业生产合作社，和新建立了许多互助组，组织起来的户数已达百分之七十。现在全乡人民正满怀信心地要搞好基层选举，并争取今年每亩土地要在去年平均产粮食三百二十五斤的基础上，增产到三百六十八斤半，以便生产更多的粮食支援国家经济建设。
