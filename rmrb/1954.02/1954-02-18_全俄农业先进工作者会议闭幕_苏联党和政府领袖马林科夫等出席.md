Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The All-Russian Conference of Advanced Agricultural Workers, convened on the 11th by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, concluded on the 15th, according to TASS.

The Soviet Party and government leaders Malenkov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Saburov, Pervukhin, Shvernik, Suslov, Pospelov, and Shatalin attended the closing ceremony of the conference.

The conference discussed the report made by P. Lobanov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation and Minister of Agriculture, "On Increasing the Yield per Unit Area of Crops and the Productivity of Livestock." Speakers at the meeting included chairmen of collective farms, agronomists, advanced tractor drivers, administrative personnel of agricultural departments, and agricultural scientists. They talked about the achievements of collective farms in the Russian Federation in developing the public economy, exchanged advanced experiences in increasing crop yields per unit area and livestock productivity, and the implementation of the resolutions of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on measures for the further development of Soviet agriculture. Generálov, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm near Moscow, said that his collective farm had exceeded the level of livestock development stipulated in the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee by two to two and a half times in 1953. The average milk yield per cow was 4,370 kilograms. The farm's vegetable crops also yielded a bumper harvest, averaging 520 quintals of cabbage, 300 quintals of cucumbers, and 200 quintals of tomatoes per hectare (equivalent to fifteen mu). The total income of the collective farm reached more than 5.2 million rubles. In addition to receiving a large amount of agricultural products, many farmers' families also received 200,000 rubles in labor day remuneration. Kolentkov, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Chuvash Autonomous Republic, reported on his experience in developing production, saying that the grain yield per hectare on his farm is now much higher than that of nearby farms. From 1950 to 1953, the farm averaged 32 quintals of grain per hectare, but by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1955), the grain yield per hectare will increase to 50 quintals. Petrikov, chairman of the "Third Five-Year Plan" Collective Farm in the Moscow Region, pointed out, when talking about vigorously developing vegetable cultivation, that due to the further utilization of waste heat from factories to heat greenhouses, his farm will be able to supply Moscow with 500 tons of fresh vegetables in 1954. Attendees also listened attentively to the speech of Maltsev, a Stalin Prize winner and director of the "Zavety Lenina" Collective Farm Experimental Station in the Kurgan Region. He provided many valuable suggestions on how to further increase yield per unit area. In his farm, the soil is tilled to a depth of 40 to 50 centimeters once every four to five years. Fields are cultivated annually with a disc harrow. Due to the adoption of this cultivation method, despite unfavorable weather conditions in 1953, his farm still harvested an average of more than 2,000 kilograms of wheat per hectare on 1,500 hectares of land.

Before the closing of the conference, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a lengthy speech, which was warmly welcomed by the participants.

The conference finally adopted a letter to all agricultural workers in the Russian Federation, calling on them to launch a socialist competition to successfully implement the resolutions of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee on measures for the further development of Soviet agriculture, to supply the residents with more food, and to supply the light industry with more raw materials.

    全俄农业先进工作者会议闭幕
    苏联党和政府领袖马林科夫等出席
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和俄罗斯联邦共和国部长会议在十一日召开的全俄罗斯农业先进工作者会议，已于十五日闭幕。
    苏联共产党和政府的领袖马林科夫、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、萨布罗夫、别尔乌辛、什维尔尼克、苏斯洛夫、波斯伯洛夫和夏塔林参加了会议的闭幕式。
    会议讨论了俄罗斯联邦部长会议第一副主席、农业部部长帕·洛巴诺夫所作的“关于提高农作物单位面积产量和牲畜产品生产率”的报告。在会上发言的有集体农庄主席、农艺师、先进的拖拉机手、农业部门的行政人员和农业科学工作者。他们谈到了俄罗斯联邦集体农庄发展公有经济的成就，交流了提高农作物单位面积产量和牲畜产品生产率方面的先进经验，以及苏共中央一九五三年九月全体会议关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的决议的执行情况。莫斯科附近的斯大林集体农庄主席盖涅拉洛夫说：他的集体农庄在一九五三年就超过苏共中央九月全会的决议中所规定的饲畜业发展水平两倍到两倍半。每一头乳牛平均挤奶四千三百七十公斤。农庄的蔬菜作物也获得了丰收，平均每一公顷
  （合十五市亩）收五百二十公担甘蓝，三百公担黄瓜和二百公担番茄。集体农庄的总收入达五百二十多万卢布。许多农民的家庭，除了得到大量的农产品以外，还得到了二十万卢布的劳动日报酬。楚瓦斯自治共和国斯大林集体农庄主席科伦特科夫在报告发展生产的经验时说：他的农庄现在每公顷谷物的单位面积产量要比附近农庄的产量多得多。在一九五零年到一九五三年间，农庄每公顷平均收三十二公担的谷物，但到第五个五年计划结束时（一九五五年），每公顷谷物的单位面积产量将增加到五十公担。莫斯科州“第三个五年计划”集体农庄主席彼特里科夫在谈到大力发展蔬菜种植业的情况时指出：由于进一步利用工厂的废弃热力来加热温室，在一九五四年内，他的农庄将能供应莫斯科五百吨新鲜蔬菜。与会者还十分注意地听取了斯大林奖金得奖人、库尔干州“扎维蒂·列宁纳”集体农庄实验站站长马尔采夫的发言。他提供了许多关于进一步提高单位面积产量的宝贵意见。在他的农庄中，每四、五年中有一次要把土壤耕四十到五十公分深。每年用圆盘中耕机来耕田。由于采用了这种耕作方法，一九五三年尽管风雨不调，他的农庄还在一千五百公顷土地上，每公顷平均收获了二千多公斤小麦。
    会议闭幕前，苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫发表了长篇演说，受到与会者的热烈欢迎。
    会议最后通过了告俄罗斯联邦全体农业工作者书，要求他们展开社会主义竞赛，胜利执行苏共中央一九五三年九月全体会议关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的决议，以更多的食品供应居民，以更多的原料供应轻工业。
