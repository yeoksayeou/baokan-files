    Xinhua News Agency, February 25th dispatch from London: The British Labour Party is experiencing a serious split between its Parliamentary Labour Party and its National Executive Committee on the issue of the rearmament of West Germany.
    According to newspaper reports, the Labour Party's highest leading body, the National Executive Committee, held a meeting on February 24th to discuss the Labour Party's stance on the issue of arming West Germany during the House of Commons debate on February 24th and 25th regarding the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. Significant differences arose during the discussion. In the final vote, the proposal put forward by the right-wing leadership group headed by Attlee and Morrison to support the rearmament of West Germany within the "European Defense Community" was passed by a majority of only four votes (fourteen votes to ten). Another proposal advocating for postponing discussions on the rearmament of West Germany received eleven votes, and was rejected by only two votes. During the vote, four of the twelve executive committee members from the trade union group (selected by the Trades Union Congress, which is controlled by the Labour Party's right-wing leadership group) opposed the proposal to support the rearmament of West Germany, and another four supported the proposal to postpone discussions on the rearmament of West Germany. The majority obtained by the proposal to support the rearmament of West Germany, which will become the Labour Party's official policy, was so small, and most of the trade union group's members did not vote in support. Therefore, this vote is actually regarded as a "moral defeat" for the right-wing leadership group headed by Attlee and Morrison.
    This is the second serious setback suffered by the Labour Party's right-wing leadership group in twelve hours. Prior to this, on February 23rd, the Labour Party's parliamentary group also held a meeting. After a fierce debate, the meeting finally voted on the proposal put forward by Attlee and Morrison to support the rearmament of West Germany, and barely passed it with a narrow majority of nine votes (one hundred and thirteen votes to one hundred and four votes). Before this, the proposal put forward by Wilson, the former Labour government's trade minister, to postpone discussions on the rearmament of West Germany was rejected by only two votes. Among the members of parliament who voted against the proposal to support the rearmament of West Germany, there were some belonging to the party's right-wing group.
    Reuters pointed out when reporting the results of the vote on the 23rd: If it were not for bringing in a group of Labour members of the House of Lords who supported the rearmament of West Germany to participate in the vote, the right-wing leadership group's resolution "might well have been overturned. The large number of dissenting votes shows that the Labour Party remains deeply divided on the German question. ... Parliamentary figures pointed out that this vote is not only a rejection of the leadership in Parliament but also domestically." After the Labour Party National Executive Committee meeting on the 24th, Reuters commented on the fact that some members of the trade union group also participated in opposing the proposal to rearm West Germany within the "European Defense Community," saying that this "once again emphasizes the seriousness of the Labour Party's split. It proves that, in the party's innermost committee, as in the party's parliamentary group, the dispute over the German question is far more than just Bevan's rebellion."
    Last year, the Labour Party passed a resolution vaguely advocating that West Germany should be rearmed only after both East and West have made further efforts to seek the reunification of Germany. After the Western countries' foreign ministers obstructed this Berlin foreign ministers' conference from reaching an agreement on the German question, the party's right-wing leadership group believed that the time had come to openly support the rearmament of West Germany. However, the opposing faction, taking into account the opinions of the broad base of Labour Party members, believed that efforts should continue to be made to seek a negotiated solution to the German question.

### 英国工党在重新武装西德问题上发生分裂

    英国工党在重新武装西德问题上发生分裂
    【新华社二十五日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党议会党团和工党全国执行委员会在重新武装西德的问题上发生了严重的分裂。
    据报纸消息，英国工党最高领导机构全国执行委员会在二月二十四日举行会议，讨论二月二十四日和二十五日下院就柏林四国外长会议的结果进行辩论时工党对武装西德问题应采取的立场。讨论中发生了重要的分歧。最后表决结果，以艾德礼和摩里逊为首的右翼领导集团提出的支持在“欧洲防务集团”内重新武装西德的提案只以四票（十四票对十票）的多数得到通过。另外一项主张延期讨论重新武装西德问题的提案得到了十一票的支持，只以二票被否决。表决时，委员会中工会集团（工党右翼领导集团控制下的职工大会所选派）的十二名执行委员，有四名反对支持重新武装西德的提案，另四名赞成延期讨论武装西德问题的提案。这个将成为工党正式政策的支持重新武装西德的提案得到的多数如此之少，而且工会集团的委员也大多数未曾投票支持，因此，这次表决实际上被认为是以艾德礼及摩里逊为首的右翼领导集团的一次“精神上的失败”。
    这是工党右翼领导集团在十二小时内遭到的第二次严重挫折。在这以前，二月二十三日，工党议会党团也开了会议。经过激烈的争论之后，会议最后就艾德礼和摩里逊提出的支持重新武装西德的提案进行表决，仅以九票（一百十三票对一百零四票）微弱的多数勉强通过了这个提案。在这之前，前工党政府贸易大臣威尔逊提出的延期讨论重新武装西德的提案仅以两票之差遭到否决。在投票反对支持重新武装西德的提案的议员中间，包括了一部分属于该党右翼集团的议员。
    路透社在报道二十三日的表决结果时指出：若不是因为拉了一批赞成重新武装西德的上院工党议员参加表决，右翼领导集团提出的决议案“很可能已被推翻。反对票数目之大说明，工党在德国问题上仍然深刻地分裂。……议会人士指出，这次表决不仅是在国会里面而且是在国内对领导的一次拒斥。”在二十四日的工党全国执行委员会会议之后，路透社评论表决中有若干工会集团的委员也参加反对在“欧洲防务集团”中重新武装西德的提案一事说，这“又一次着重说明工党分裂的严重程度。它证明，在该党的最内层的委员会中，和在该党的议会党团中一样，关于德国问题的争执远不只是比万派的反抗而已。”
    工党在去年曾通过一项决议，暧昧地主张在东西双方作过进一步努力以求重新统一德国之后，才应重新武装西德。在西方国家外长阻挠了这次柏林外长会议取得德国问题的协议之后，该党右翼领导集团认为公开支持重新武装西德的时机已经到来。但是反对的一派考虑到工党广大下层党员的意见，认为应该继续寻求协议解决德国问题的努力。
