    Shuikoushan Mining Bureau in Hunan Province resolutely implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and recovered a large amount of lead oxide from discarded ore sand.
    Shuikoushan is one of China's rich lead and zinc producing areas. Before liberation, foreign imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to make more money, took away the ore with higher zinc and lead content, but piled up the ore with lower content extracted from the mining and beneficiation process all over the mining area as waste sand. After years of sun and wind, more than half of these "waste sands" underwent varying degrees of oxidation, turning into lead oxide and zinc oxide. These oxidized minerals contain about 2.4 percent lead and 7.5 percent zinc, of which the oxidized part accounts for about half.
    After liberation, in order to increase social wealth, the People's Government established a flotation workshop to specifically float the "waste sand." However, due to the lack of domestic experience in processing oxidized minerals, although a large amount of lead and zinc ore sand was recovered from the "waste sand," a large amount of lead oxide could not be recovered. This not only wasted the country's useful resources, but also affected the completion of the flotation workshop's production tasks and the supply of raw materials to the lead smelting workshop.
    In October 1952, Soviet expert Andegraf came to the flotation workshop. He deeply regretted the waste of this valuable resource, and suggested to the bureau leaders that they use the sulfuration method to recover the lead oxide, and introduced three flotation procedures in detail. According to the suggestions of the Soviet expert, the leaders of Shuikoushan Mining Bureau immediately organized forces and began experimenting in November of the year before last. After more than 300 times, they finally succeeded in the experiment. The results of the on-site trial selection in March last year showed that the highest recovery rate of flotation of lead oxide concentrate from discarded tailings reached 55.5 percent, and the highest grade reached 52.98 percent lead; the general recovery rate reached about 50 percent, and the concentrate grade reached more than 30 percent lead, which meets the smelting requirements.
    Because of the success of this experiment, the workshop floated more than 300 tons of lead oxide concentrate from the "waste sand" last year, which can be smelted into dozens of tons of crude lead. It has increased the production of a large amount of valuable non-ferrous metals for the country and created technical experience for the recovery of oxidized minerals in the mineral processing sector of China's non-ferrous metal industry. Now, the workers in the workshop are experimenting with flotation of zinc oxide from "waste sand."

### 水口山矿务局从“废砂”中收回大量氧化铅

    水口山矿务局从“废砂”中收回大量氧化铅
    湖南水口山矿务局浮选车间坚决执行苏联专家建议，从废弃的矿砂中收回大量氧化铅。
    水口山是我国蕴藏丰富的铅锌产地之一。解放前，外国帝国主义和国民党反动派为了多赚钱，把含锌含铅较高的矿石开走了，却把采选出来含量较低的矿石当作废砂堆遍了整个矿区。这些“废砂”经过长年的日晒风吹，一半以上起了不同程度的氧化作用，变成氧化铅、氧化锌了。这些氧化矿物含铅约百分之二点四，含锌百分之七点五，其中氧化部分又占一半左右。
    解放后，人民政府为了增加社会财富，建立了浮选车间，专门浮选“废砂”。但因国内没有处理氧化矿物的经验，虽然从“废砂”中收回了大量铅锌矿砂，却有大量的氧化铅不能收回来。这不但浪费了国家有用的资源，而且影响浮选车间生产任务的完成，影响炼铅车间原料的供应。
    一九五二年十月，苏联专家安德格拉夫来到了浮选车间，他十分惋惜这种宝贵资源的浪费，建议局领导上利用硫化法把氧化铅收回来，并详细地介绍了三种浮选程序。水口山矿务局领导上根据苏联专家的建议，立即组织力量，从前年十一月间开始试验，经过三百多次，终于试验成功。去年三月间在现场试选的结果，从废弃的尾砂中浮选氧化铅精砂，最高收回率达到百分之五十五点五，最高品位达到含铅百分之五十二点九八；一般的收回率达到百分之五十左右，精砂品位达到含铅百分之三十以上，合乎冶炼要求。
    因为这一试验的成功，去年该车间从“废砂”中浮选了氧化铅精砂三百余吨，可炼成数十吨粗铅。为国家增产了大量珍贵的有色金属，也为我国有色金属工业选矿部门收回氧化矿物创造了技术经验。现在，该车间职工正在试验从“废砂”中浮选氧化锌。
