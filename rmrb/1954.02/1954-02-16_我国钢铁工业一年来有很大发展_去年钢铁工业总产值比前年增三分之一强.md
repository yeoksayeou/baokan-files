Xinhua News Agency, February 15th:

    China's state-owned and joint state-private steel industry achieved rapid development in 1953. Last year, the total output value of the national state-owned and joint state-private steel industry increased by 35.8 percent compared to 1952; the output and variety of various products exceeded any previous year in history. Compared to 1952, the national state-owned and joint state-private steel industry saw an increase of 15 percent in pig iron production, 30.4 percent in steel production, and 25.5 percent in steel product production. The rapid growth of these major product outputs strongly supported the country's economic construction. The increase in pig iron production in 1953 alone could supply the steelmaking and machinery casting industries in Shanghai for two years.
    In 1953, China's steel industry supplied more products than any previous year to nearly two thousand factories, mines, enterprises, and other units across the country. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone increased its supply of steel products to national ordering units by 47 percent compared to 1952, and by twelve times compared to 1949. Last year, China's steel industry supplied the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government with more than double the amount of heavy rails for railway construction compared to 1952. Machine manufacturing plants concentrated in Shenyang, Shanghai, and other places, the hundreds of kilometers of high-voltage power transmission line projects erected in the Northeast, machine manufacturing plants, power plants, and textile mills under construction in Taiyuan, Harbin, Zhengzhou, Fushun, and other places, as well as projects such as the Gejiu Tin Mine, the Fuxin Coal Mine, and the Inner Mongolia Forest Railway, all received large amounts of pig iron, steel products, and other steel products supplied by the steel industry. In 1953, China's steel industry also supplied a large number of products to the construction of national agriculture and water conservancy projects. All light rails and reinforcing steel needed for the country's largest Huai River management project, the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, and the Guanting Reservoir water conservancy project were supplied by the domestic steel industry. The pig iron and steel needed by state-owned and some local state-owned agricultural machinery manufacturing plants across the country in manufacturing new agricultural implements were also promptly supplied by the domestic steel industry.
    Many steel products that China used to rely on foreign imports for were manufactured by domestic steel plants in 1953. According to statistics from the Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government alone, the supply of new specifications of steel products to various places in 1953 increased by more than one hundred types compared to 1952. Last year, the number of new steel grades smelted by steel plants in various places also increased significantly. According to statistics from the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau, excluding Anshan Iron and Steel Company, domestic steel plants smelted a total of 187 steel grades in 1953, of which 20 were successfully trial-smelted in 1953. Among these new steel grades are alloy structural steel for tractors, textile machines, cylinders, heavy machinery, and drill rod joints, spring steel for various springs on automobiles and trains, and hard alloys for cutting alloy material tools. In addition, many new products also appeared in the forging and rolling of special steel in 1953, such as hexagonal steel for screw caps and rock drill rods, spring steel wire for automobiles and trains, and hard alloy drill bits for mining and rock drilling tools, which were previously unable to be produced domestically.
    In 1953, the capital construction projects of the national steel industry all successfully completed their plans. The main projects completed and put into production last year included two automated blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, six small blast furnaces of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, and two small blast furnaces of Longyan Iron Mine in terms of ironmaking; the mechanized and automated large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the wire rod branch of Tianjin Steel Plant in terms of steel rolling; and four coke ovens of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in terms of coking. The commissioning of these projects greatly strengthened the lineup of China's steel industry. After the projects completed by Anshan Iron and Steel Company last year were put into production, according to design capacity, the production capacity of pig iron there can be increased by 80 percent, coke by 73 percent, and steel products by 88 percent. After the large-scale rolling mill starts production, the steel rails, seamless steel pipe billets, and large steel products needed by China in the first five-year plan can be partially supplied. After the seamless steel pipe plant starts production, although its output and variety cannot fully meet the needs of all parties, the seamless steel pipes urgently needed in China's geological exploration and machinery manufacturing industries can be initially met. After the six small blast furnaces of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant were put into production, the pig iron needed in Shanghai and East China regions was supplied most conveniently.
    The vast number of workers and staff in steel plants across the country have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in implementing the national construction plan. Over the past year, steel rolling workers have learned from the advanced experience of the famous labor model Zhang Mingshan in transforming old equipment, thereby initially improving labor conditions and increasing production efficiency. Ironmaking workers have improved furnace repair technology, shortening the overhaul time of the eight blast furnaces overhauled last year by an average of 30 percent compared to the plan, increasing pig iron production by 23,000 tons for the country. With the improvement of operating skills, the labor productivity of the national steel industry is rapidly increasing, and the cost of various products is constantly decreasing. According to statistics, the average value produced by each production worker at Anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1953 increased by 28.3 percent compared to the average in 1952; the various factories and mines under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau also increased by an average of 15.5 percent. The profits turned over to the state by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1953 increased by 45 percent compared to 1952. This figure is equal to the company's entire capital construction investment in 1953 and can be used to build five seamless steel pipe plants like the one that just went into production last year. The profits turned over to the state by various factories and mines under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau last year exceeded the state's investment in the bureau's capital construction. The continuous decline in the cost of various products has made it possible for the state to reduce the prices of steel and other products in 1954. According to preliminary calculations, among the products that the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau plans to supply to various places in 1954, steel products alone can reduce the average expenditure of ordering units by 2.5 percent.

    我国钢铁工业一年来有很大发展
    去年钢铁工业总产值比前年增三分之一强
    【新华社十五日讯】我国国营和公私合营钢铁工业一九五三年获得了迅速的发展。去年，全国国营和公私合营钢铁工业的总产值，比一九五二年增长了百分之三十五点八；各种产品的产量和品种，都超过了历史上任何一年。和一九五二年相比，全国国营和公私合营钢铁工业的生铁产量增长了百分之十五，钢增长百分之三十点四，钢材增长百分之二十五点五。这些主要产品产量的迅速增长，有力地支援了国家的经济建设。只是一九五三年增长的生铁一项，就可供应上海市炼钢和机械铸造业两年的需要。
    一九五三年，我国钢铁工业以比以往任何一年更多的产品，供应了全国近两千个厂矿、企业及其他单位的需要。只是鞍山钢铁公司供应全国订货单位的钢材，就比一九五二年增加了百分之四十七，比一九四九年增加了十二倍。去年，我国钢铁工业供应中央人民政府铁道部修筑铁路的重轨，比一九五二年增加了一倍以上。集中在沈阳、上海等地的机器制造厂，架设在东北地区的数百公里长的高压输电线工程，正在太原、哈尔滨、郑州、抚顺等地建设的机器制造厂、发电厂和纺织厂，以及个旧锡矿，阜新煤矿和内蒙森林铁路等工程都得到了钢铁工业供应的大量生铁、钢材及其他钢铁产品。一九五三年，我国钢铁工业还以大量的产品，供应了全国农业和水利工程的建设。全国规模最大的治淮、荆江分洪和官厅水库等水利工程需要的全部轻轨、钢筋，都是由国内钢铁工业供应的。全国各地国营及部分地方国营农业机械制造厂在制造新式农具中需用的生铁和钢材，也得到了国内钢铁工业的及时供应。
    过去我国依赖国外进口的许多钢铁产品，一九五三年已由国内钢铁厂制造出来。仅据中央人民政府重工业部销售局的统计，一九五三年供应各地新规格的钢材，就比一九五二年增加了一百多种。去年各地钢铁厂冶炼的新钢种，也有很大数量的增加。据钢铁工业管理局统计，除鞍山钢铁公司外，一九五三年内国内钢铁厂冶炼的钢种已共达一百八十七种，其中一九五三年新试炼成功的有二十种。这些新的钢种中，有作拖拉机、纺织机、汽缸、重型机械、钻探机钻杆接头的合金结构钢，有作汽车、火车上各种弹簧用的弹簧钢，有作切削合金料工具的硬质合金等。此外，在特殊钢的锻轧方面，一九五三年也出现了不少新产品，其中如作螺丝帽、凿岩机钻杆用的六角钢，汽车、火车上用的弹簧钢丝，作采矿凿岩工具用的硬质合金钎头等，也都是过去国内不能生产的。
    一九五三年内，全国钢铁工业的基本建设工程，都胜利地完成了计划。去年建设完工并投入生产的主要工程，炼铁方面有鞍山钢铁公司的两座自动化炼铁炉，马鞍山炼铁厂的六座小型炼铁炉，龙烟铁矿的两座小型炼铁炉；轧钢方面有鞍山钢铁公司机械化自动化的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，天津钢厂的盘条分厂；炼焦方面有鞍山钢铁公司的四座炼焦炉。这些工程的投入生产，大大增强了我国钢铁工业的阵容。鞍山钢铁公司去年建设完工的工程投入生产后，按照设计能力，可使那里的生铁的生产能力增长百分之八十，焦炭增长百分之七十三，钢材增长百分之八十八。大型轧钢厂开工生产后，我国在第一个五年计划中需要的钢轨、无缝钢管管坯和大型钢材，可以得到部分供应。无缝钢管厂开工生产后，它的产量和品种虽然不能全部供应各方面的需要，但目前我国地质钻探和机械制造工业中急需的无缝钢管，也就能够初步满足了。马鞍山炼铁厂六座小型炼铁炉投入生产后，上海和华东各地需要的生铁，得到了最近便的供应。
    全国各地钢铁厂的广大职工，在执行国家建设计划中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。去年一年来，轧钢工人们学习了著名劳动模范张明山改造旧设备的先进经验，因而初步改善了劳动条件，提高了生产效率。炼铁工人提高了修炉技术，使去年大修的八个高炉的检修时间，平均较计划缩短了百分之三十，为国家增产了两万三千吨生铁。随着操作技术的改进，全国钢铁工业的劳动生产率正在迅速提高，各种产品的成本不断下降。据统计，鞍山钢铁公司一九五三年每个生产工人平均生产的价值，比一九五二年平均增加了百分之二十八点三；钢铁工业管理局所属各厂矿也平均增加了百分之十五点五。鞍山钢铁公司一九五三年向国家上缴的利润，比一九五二年增多百分之四十五。这个数字等于它一九五三年基本建设的全部投资，可以用来建设五个像去年刚刚投入生产的无缝钢管厂。去年钢铁工业管理局所属各厂矿给国家上缴的利润，比国家对该局基本建设的投资还多。各种产品成本的不断下降，就使国家在一九五四年有可能降低钢材及其他产品的价格。据初步计算，钢铁工业管理局计划在一九五四年供应各地的产品中，只钢材一项，就可使订货单位平均减少开支百分之二点五。
