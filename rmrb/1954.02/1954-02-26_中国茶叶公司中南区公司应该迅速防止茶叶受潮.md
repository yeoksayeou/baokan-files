    The China Tea Company, Central-South District, Should Quickly Prevent Tea from Getting Damp

    Wang Guanglu of the China Tea Company, Taiyuan Sales Office, writes: On October 21st of last year, the China Tea Company, Central-South District, sent our office a truckload of tea. Upon inspection, we found that some of it was severely damp. The main reason was that the tea was not dried to the proper extent before leaving the factory; it was also poorly stored and transported, and was soaked by rainwater. This tea could no longer be consumed, and the state lost nearly 20 million yuan. We informed the Central-South District Company of the dampness and its causes in a letter. However, in November, among the fifth batch of tea sent by the company (both flower roll tea and brick tea), some was still damp because it had not been dried before leaving the factory. We quickly informed the company of the dampness again. But on January 9, 1954, we received the sixth batch of flower roll tea from the district, and most of it was still damp and moldy. The China Tea Company, Central-South District, is not inspecting and improving its work based on the information we provided, causing a series of losses to the state. This behavior of not cherishing state property is extremely wrong. We hope they will conduct a thorough investigation and correct it in future work.

    中国茶叶公司中南区公司应该迅速防止茶叶受潮
    中国茶叶公司太原营业处王广禄来信：去年十月二十一日，中国茶叶公司中南区公司发给我处茶叶一车。经我处检查，其中有一部分已经受潮很严重。主要原因是茶叶加工时，没有烘干到适当程度就出厂了；在储存和运转途中又保管不善，受了雨水浸蚀。这些茶叶已不能再食用，国家损失了将近两千万元。我们将茶叶受潮情况及原因函告中南区公司。但在十一月份，该公司发来第五批茶叶（花卷茶和砖茶两种）中，仍有一部分因出厂时没烘干而受了潮。我们又很快把受潮情况函告该公司。但是在一九五四年一月九日，我们收到该区发来的第六批花卷茶中，还是有大部分已受了潮霉。中国茶叶公司中南区公司不根据我们反映的情况检查改进工作，使国家遭受一连串的损失。这种不爱护国家财产的行为是十分错误的。希望他们作深刻的检查，并在今后工作中加以改正。
