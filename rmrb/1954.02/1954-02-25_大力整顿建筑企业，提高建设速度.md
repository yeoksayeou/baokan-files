    In 1954, the scale of China's basic construction projects is even larger than last year, and the technical requirements are also more complex than last year. Judging from the development trend of national construction, the scale of construction will increase year by year in the future, and the complexity of technology will also increase year by year. It is impossible to complete such arduous tasks without a strong, well-organized construction team that masters advanced technology.

      Over the past year or so, our country has made great progress in terms of construction strength. Various departments and regions have established engineering companies and engineering teams of various natures according to different construction tasks. This force has played a huge role in completing the 1953 national basic construction plan and laid the foundation for future construction work. However, it must also be recognized that most of the existing construction enterprises in our country have developed in a short period of time, and mainly expanded in 1953. Due to the short establishment time, most construction enterprises have not had time to carry out serious rectification. Many enterprises have unsound management structures and low management levels, and political work is weak, resulting in many undesirable phenomena in construction projects, such as chaotic on-site management, slow progress, low quality, and huge waste. This situation is not compatible with the requirements of the development of basic construction projects in our country. Therefore, all basic construction departments must, starting from 1954, vigorously rectify construction enterprises and actively improve the technical level and business management level of construction enterprises.

    In rectifying construction enterprises, the first requirement is to vigorously improve the professional technical strength of construction enterprises, which is an important aspect of improving the technical level. Judging from the overall balance between this year's basic construction tasks and construction strength, most construction enterprises have a surplus of civil engineering workers, while there is a shortage of special technical trades, especially a lack of various machine installation workers. If we do not vigorously find ways to increase the strength of special technical trades, it will seriously affect the completion of key engineering tasks. Therefore, this year, the main strength of various industrial, transportation, and water conservancy departments should be placed on cultivating and improving professional construction strength. We should absorb the experience of advanced construction enterprises and gradually set up various professional (such as mechanical installation, electrical installation, mining, furnace construction, pipeline, line, seaport, dock, dam, etc.) engineering companies in a focused manner according to the nature of the construction projects of each department. In principle, the number of fixed civil engineering workers should no longer be increased, but their technical and professional level should be improved on the existing basis. Construction enterprises with insufficient civil engineering strength should also make appropriate adjustments to the existing strength as much as possible.

    Another aspect of improving the construction technical level is to improve the level of mechanization and factory production of construction enterprises in a planned and focused manner. At present, many construction enterprises do not pay much attention to this issue. Some engineering departments use machinery inefficiently, even leaving construction machinery idle and unused, and are accustomed to handicraft production methods. We must recognize that without gradually implementing mechanized and factory construction, we cannot guarantee the quality and technical requirements of the project, and it will greatly delay the progress of engineering construction. Therefore, in this year's key projects, mechanized construction must be appropriately implemented in lifting and transportation in a planned manner, and factory construction must be implemented in concrete prefabrication, metal structure, and wood processing in a certain proportion, to gradually improve the technical level of construction enterprises and lay the foundation for the industrialization of construction enterprises.

    The second content of rectifying construction enterprises is that the management structure and management system of construction enterprises must be rectified in accordance with the principles of the production area management system. Because the production cycle of construction projects is long, the work procedures and construction conditions vary greatly, the types of projects are numerous, and workers of various different trades are concentrated on a construction site to work together, it is even more important to reasonably stipulate the construction organization and management system, organize flow-line operations and parallel operations, and enable various trades and various procedures to cooperate with each other seamlessly. At present, the low quality, large waste, and slow progress of many projects in basic construction are due to the fact that our many construction enterprises have unsound organizational structures, chaotic on-site management, unclear responsibilities, and unreasonable labor organization, in addition to poor planning, design errors, and delays. In order to change this situation, it is necessary to implement the administrative responsibility system in accordance with the principles of the production area management system and improve the organization of construction enterprises.

    To implement the area management system, on the one hand, construction enterprises are required to establish management organizations at all levels according to the characteristics of construction engineering operations; and establish a management responsibility system at all levels on the basis of the area management system to clearly unify administrative leadership, technical leadership, technical supply, labor deployment, financial management, and other responsibilities to the person in charge of each level of organization. At the same time, in order to ensure the realization of the administrative responsibility system, engineering companies and construction sites should set up certain functional organizations as assistants to the company manager or construction site director to complete various specialized tasks under unified leadership. On the other hand, construction forces must be allocated in accordance with the principles of the area system. At present, many engineering companies have implemented the principle of worker specialization in worker organization, which is very necessary to improve the technical level of workers. However, many engineering companies overemphasize the fixedness of worker professional groups, or professional workers of many different natures are vertically led by various professional companies, which affects the unified dispatch and unified command of the company and construction site labor force, affects the coordination of various work procedures and various trades, and greatly affects construction progress and engineering quality. In order to overcome this contradiction, according to the experience of advanced engineering departments, for a company with a fixed construction task, it should be equipped with the required worker groups of various trades according to a certain process of the project, and appropriately fixed down in accordance with the principles of the production area management system, and uniformly commanded and led by a company or construction site.

    The central link in implementing the area management system is to strengthen the leadership of work sections, strengthen the work foreman responsibility system, and enhance the role of work foremen in construction. The work foreman is the direct organizer and leader in completing the work section tasks, and the quality of his leadership is the key to determining the quality of construction management. Therefore, strengthening the leadership responsibility of work foremen has become the most important condition for improving and enhancing the level of enterprise management.

    The third content of rectifying construction enterprises is to conscientiously implement the construction operation plan. The construction operation plan is compiled based on the engineering progress plan, construction organization design, and on-site construction conditions. Its main task is to make unified arrangements for engineering progress, labor deployment, technical supply, and finance, organize various projects and various work procedures in parallel operations and flow-line operations, and at the same time, according to the engineering progress indicator chart, compile supply plans for labor deployment, materials, prefabricated parts, equipment, tools, etc., and through these plans, coordinate and connect the work of various projects and various departments into an organic whole to carry out balanced construction. In 1953, various departments initially implemented the operation plan. Although the content was very rough, and some companies only had brief engineering progress indicator charts, the effect was great. In 1954, all engineering departments must prepare construction operation plans before construction. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the operation plan, there must also be a scheduling organization and scheduling system to closely grasp the entire situation of the project and promptly discover various problems in construction and solve them in a timely manner.

    The fourth content of rectifying construction enterprises is to gradually implement the economic accounting system in construction enterprises and improve the business management of construction enterprises in accordance with the principles of the economic accounting system. The economic accounting system in an enterprise is not only to passively account for the results of the enterprise's economic activities, but more importantly, to use this method and weapon to discover problems and shortcomings in our management work, so as to actively improve our management work and enable all economic activities of the enterprise to be carried out in a planned and purposeful manner. For example, the serious waste phenomenon that exists in construction enterprises is mainly because we have not actively done some basic work in implementing the economic accounting system, so there are no reasonable quotas, no budgets, and no idea how much labor, materials, and equipment are needed to complete a project, and how much investment is ultimately needed. This makes it impossible to rationally use national construction funds, resulting in a large amount of waste and backlog.

    In order to overcome this serious shortcoming, it is urgently necessary for various engineering departments to carry out a series of organizational work in establishing an economic accounting system, such as establishing a construction budget system, strengthening the planning of financial costs and material supply, and gradually implementing a contracting system for both labor and materials. Before the start of construction projects in 1954, all engineering departments should prepare construction budgets on the basis of existing quotas. Because without a construction budget, the use of finance, materials, and labor cannot be managed in a planned manner, waste will still be difficult to avoid, and financial management and financial supervision cannot be realized. In addition, various engineering departments should also actively organize and compile construction quotas. Construction quotas are the basis for preparing construction budgets and project cost plans. Without reasonable construction quotas, it is impossible to prepare construction budgets and cost plans. In order to prepare construction quotas well, the engineering departments of the central ministries and various regions should seriously organize the existing quotas this year and raise them to a more advanced and reasonable level to lay the foundation for promoting the economic accounting system.

    Finally, all construction enterprises must vigorously promote construction organization design. Construction organization design is the main basis for construction site layout and preparation work and the preparation of construction operation plans, and is an important condition for ensuring the smooth completion of engineering progress. The reason why many construction sites in basic construction departments have chaotic management, uncoordinated various trades and procedures, and failure to guarantee progress and quality is that there is no construction organization design. Therefore, all construction departments, especially key projects, should carefully prepare construction organization designs before construction, provided that conditions permit, in order to correct the confusion and passive phenomena in the course of the project.

    The above are just a few main issues that should be paid attention to in rectifying construction enterprises in terms of management. In addition to this, there are many other tasks that must also be carried out in coordination, such as strengthening the political work on the engineering site, especially using the current winter training to conduct education on the general line and general tasks to improve the political awareness of employees; improving the work of the Party, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, etc.

    Construction enterprises undertake the huge task of national basic construction. The major enterprises and projects that began construction during China's first five-year plan are an important foundation for realizing the country's socialist industrialization. The quality and completion time of these projects have a decisive effect on the speed of China's industrialization and the proportion of industry, and have a decisive effect on changing China's economic outlook. Therefore, all construction enterprises must recognize the great significance of rectifying business and rapidly improving technical level and management level, and work hard to do this work well, so as to successfully complete the heavy and complex tasks entrusted to construction enterprises by the state and strive to accelerate the speed of China's industrialization.

    大力整顿建筑企业，提高建设速度
    一九五四年我国基本建设工程的规模比去年更加扩大了，技术要求也比去年更为复杂。从国家建设发展的趋势来看，今后建设的规模还将逐年增大，技术的复杂程度也将逐年增高，要完成这样艰巨的任务，没有一支强大的、组织严密的、并掌握先进技术的建筑队伍，是不可能的。
      一年多来，我们国家在建筑力量方面已有很大的发展，各部门与各地区都依据不同的建设任务，建立了各种性质的工程公司和工程队。这一力量对完成一九五三年国家的基本建设计划起了巨大的作用，并给今后的建设工作打下了基础。但是，也必须认识，我国现有的建筑企业，大部分是在短时间内发展起来的，而且主要是在一九五三年内壮大起来的。由于成立时间短促，极大部分的建筑企业还来不及进行认真的整顿，许多企业的管理机构还不健全，管理水平很低，政治工作薄弱，以致造成了建筑工程中现场管理混乱、进度迟缓、质量低下及浪费很大等许多不良的现象。这种状况和我国基本建设工程发展的要求是不相适应的。因此各基本建设部门必须从一九五四年开始，大力整顿建筑企业，积极提高建筑企业的技术水平和经营管理水平。
    在整顿建筑企业中，首先要求大力提高建筑企业的专业技术力量，这是提高技术水平的一个重要方面。根据今年基本建设任务与建筑力量总的平衡情况看，大部分建筑企业的土木建筑工人已有多余，而特种技术工种则感不足，特别是缺乏各种机器安装工人。如不大力设法增加特种技术工种的力量，必将严重地影响重点工程任务的完成。因此，今年各工业、交通、水利部门的主要力量，应该放在培养与提高专业性的建筑力量方面，应该吸取先进建筑企业的经验，按各部门建设工程的性质，逐步地有重点地设置各种专业性的（如机械安装、电气安装、采矿、筑炉、管道、线路、海港、船坞、堤坝等）工程公司。一般的土木建筑的固定工人，原则上应不再增加，而应在原有的基础上提高他们的技术业务水平。少数土木建筑力量不足的建筑企业，也应尽可能就已有的力量进行适当的调配。
    提高建筑技术水平的另一方面，就是有计划、有重点地提高建筑企业施工的机械化和工厂化的水平。现在许多建筑企业还不很重视这个问题，有些工程部门使用机械的效率很低，甚至把施工机械闲置不用，习惯于手工业的生产方式。我们必须认识，不逐步实行建筑工程的机械化和工厂化施工，就不能保证工程质量与技术要求，并将大大延缓工程建设的进度。所以，在今年的重点工程中，必须有计划地在起重、运输方面适当地实行机械化施工，和在混凝土预制、金属结构、木材加工方面实行一定比例的工厂化施工，以逐步提高建筑企业的技术水平，打下建筑企业工业化的基础。
    整顿建筑企业的第二项内容，就是必须按照生产区域管理制度的原则来整顿建筑企业的管理机构与管理制度。由于建筑工程的生产周期长，工序和施工条件变化大，工程种类繁多，以及各种不同工种的工人集中在一个施工现场协同工作，所以如何合理地规定施工组织与管理制度，组织流水作业和平行作业，使各个工种、各个工序能够互相衔接地协同动作，就更加显得重要。目前基本建设中许多工程质量低，浪费大，进度迟缓，除了计划不周，设计错误和拖延等原因外，更直接的原因之一就是由于我们许多建筑企业组织机构不健全，现场管理混乱，责任不明，劳动组织不合理。为了改变这种情况，就必须按照生产区域管理制的原则贯彻实行行政责任制，改善建筑企业的组织。
    贯彻区域管理制，一方面要求建筑企业根据建筑工程作业的特点，建立各级管理机构；并在区域管理制的基础上建立各级管理责任制度，把行政领导、技术领导、技术供应、劳动调配、财务管理等责任明确地统一到每一级机构的负责人身上。同时为了保证行政责任制的实现，工程公司与工地应当设置一定的职能机构，作为公司经理或工地主任的助手，在统一的领导之下分别完成各种专职的工作。另一方面必须按照区域制的原则来配备施工力量。目前许多工程公司在工人组织上实行了工人专业化的原则，这对提高工人技术水平是十分必要的。但有许多工程公司过分强调工人专业小组的固定化，或者许多性质不同的专业工人分别由各个专业公司垂直领导，这样就影响了公司与工地劳动力的统一调度统一指挥，影响了各个工序各个工种互相协调地作业，大大影响了施工进度与工程质量。为了克服这个矛盾，依据先进工程部门的经验，对于一个有固定建设任务的公司，应当按工程的一定的工艺过程，配备其所需要的各工种的工人小组，并按生产区域管理制度的原则适当地固定下来，统一由一个公司或工地指挥领导。
    贯彻区域管理制的中心一环是加强工段的领导，加强工长责任制，提高工长在施工中的作用。工长是完成工段任务的直接组织者与领导者，他领导的好坏是决定施工管理好坏的关键。因此，加强工长的领导责任，就成为改善与提高企业管理水平最重要的条件。
    整顿建筑企业的第三个内容，就是认真贯彻执行施工作业计划。施工作业计划是根据工程进度计划、施工组织设计及现场施工条件等来编制的。其主要任务是把工程进度、劳动调配、技术供应和财务等作统一的安排，把各个工程各个工序按平行作业与流水作业的方法组织起来，同时根据工程进度指示图表编制劳动调配、材料、预制品、设备、工具等供应计划，并通过这些计划，把各个工程、各个部门的工作互相配合衔接成一个有机的整体，进行均衡的施工。一九五三年各个部门已初步实行了作业计划，虽然内容很粗略，有些公司只有简略的工程进度指示图表，但效果是很大的。一九五四年各工程部门在施工前都必须编制好施工作业计划。为了保证作业计划的顺利执行，还必须有调度机构与调度制度，严密地掌握工程进行的全部情况，及时发现施工中的各种问题，并及时地加以解决。
    整顿建筑企业的第四个内容，是必须在建筑企业中逐步地实行经济核算制，按照经济核算制的原则来改善建筑企业的经营管理工作。企业中的经济核算制不只是消极地核算企业经济活动的结果，更重要的是要运用这一方法和武器来发现我们管理工作中的问题和缺点，从而积极地改善我们的管理工作，使企业的一切经济活动能有计划有目的地去进行。例如目前建筑企业中存在的严重的浪费现象，主要就是由于我们还没有在实行经济核算制方面积极地做一些基础工作，因而没有合理的定额，没有预算，对完成一件工程究竟需要多少人工，多少材料，多少设备，最后究竟需要多少投资，心中无数，这样就使得国家建设资金不能合理使用，造成了大量的浪费与积压。
    为了克服这个严重的缺点，目前各工程部门迫切需要在建立经济核算制方面进行一系列的组织工作，如建立施工预算制度，加强财务成本和物资供应等的计划工作，逐步实行包工包料制度等。在一九五四年工程开工之前，各工程部门均应在现有定额基础上编制施工预算。因为如果没有施工预算，财务、材料与劳动力的使用就不能实行有计划的管理，浪费仍难避免，财务管理与财务监督也就不能实现。此外，各工程部门还应积极地整理与编制施工定额。施工定额是编制施工预算和工程成本计划的依据，没有合理的施工定额，就无法编制施工预算与成本计划。为了编好施工定额，今年中央各部与各地区的工程部门都应认真地将现有的定额进行一次整理，把它提高到更先进更合理的水平，以打下推行经济核算制的基础。
    最后，各建筑企业还必须大力推行施工组织设计。施工组织设计是施工现场布置与准备工作以及编制施工作业计划的主要根据，是保证顺利完成工程进度的重要条件，基本建设部门中许多施工现场管理混乱，各种工种、工序不协调，进度与质量不能保证，其原因之一就是没有施工组织设计。因此，各施工部门，特别是重点工程，凡条件具备的，都应在施工前认真编好施工组织设计，以纠正工程进行中的忙乱与被动现象。
    以上只是整顿建筑企业在管理方面应注意的几个主要问题，除此以外，还有许多工作也必须配合进行，如加强工程现场的政治工作，特别是利用现时冬训进行总路线总任务的教育，以提高职工的政治认识；健全党、工会、青年团的工作等。
    建筑企业担负着国家基本建设的巨大任务。我国第一个五年建设计划内开始建设的重大企业与工程，是我国实现国家社会主义工业化的重要基础，这些工程质量的好坏，完成的迟早，对我国工业化的速度和工业的比重有决定的作用，对改变我国的经济面貌有决定的作用。因此，各建筑企业必须认识到整顿业务、迅速提高技术水平与管理水平的重大意义，努力做好这一工作，以便胜利地完成国家交给建筑企业的繁重复杂的任务，争取加快我国工业化的速度。
