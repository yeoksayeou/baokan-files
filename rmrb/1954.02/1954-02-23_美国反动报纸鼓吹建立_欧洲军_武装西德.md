Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 21st: According to TASS, newspapers in the United States, reflecting the views of the American ruling clique, are attempting to use the results of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to justify the American plan to arm West Germany and establish a "European Army." The American newspapers are categorically asserting that the Soviet Union is responsible for the failure to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian questions. They are taking the opportunity to advocate for the continued expansion of armaments and the vigorous construction of a "European Army." As for the Soviet proposals on the German and Austrian questions, which were rejected by the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France, the newspapers are intentionally avoiding discussing them.

    At the same time, the newspapers' commentaries reveal a sense of unease regarding Western public opinion's disagreement with the U.S. policy of establishing military blocs and militarizing Germany. The Western people's reaction to the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Berlin Conference has clearly alarmed the American ruling clique. Russell, the Washington correspondent for the "New York Herald Tribune," pointed this out. He wrote: "American officials admit that the Eisenhower administration originally hoped to use the Berlin Conference to prove that 'Soviet foreign policy is unreasonable,' but this hope has been dashed." Dulles asserted that the outcome of the Berlin Conference increased "the hope of European unification," which is "the hope of establishing a European Army." Regarding this point, Russell wrote: "But Washington still believes that the establishment of a six-nation European army faces greater obstacles." Russell continued, saying that some senior officials in Washington "very much doubt that the French National Assembly will approve the European Defense Community treaty in the near future."

    MacHenry, the Paris correspondent for the "New York Herald Tribune," expressed obvious unease because French public opinion opposes blindly following American policy and opposes the American demand for the rapid ratification of the "European Defense Community" treaty. This reporter said that those who oppose the "European Army" believe that: once the "European Defense Community" treaty is ratified, the atmosphere will immediately become tense, and thus the opportunity to establish a more friendly relationship between East and West will be lost... If the Geneva conference fails, a depressed and defeated atmosphere will envelop France, and relations between France and the United States will become tense as a result.

    Middleton, the London correspondent for the "New York Times," also pointed out that Europe opposes Eden and Bidault's submission to American policy at the Berlin Conference. He said, "Eden may" face "severe criticism" from the left-wing Labour Party "when he reports to the House of Commons next week," and "his following of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at the Berlin Conference will be criticized."

    美国反动报纸鼓吹建立“欧洲军”武装西德
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：反映美国统治集团意见的美国报纸，企图用四国外长会议的结果来说明美国武装西德和建立“欧洲军”的计划是正当的。美国报纸一口咬定，德国问题和奥地利问题没有达成协议应由苏联负责。他们并乘机鼓吹继续扩充军备和竭力建成“欧洲军”。至于为美英法三国代表团所拒绝的苏联对于德国及奥地利问题的建议，各报却有意不谈。
    同时，对于西方国家舆论不同意美国建立军事集团和使德国军国主义化的政策，各报的评论显露出不安的情绪。西方国家人民对于苏联在柏林会议上提出的建议的反应，显然使美国统治集团着慌了。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻华盛顿记者鲁塞尔指出了这一点。他写道：“美国官方人士承认，艾森豪威尔政府在柏林会议之前本来希望能借这个会议证明‘苏联的外交政策是没有道理’的，但是这种希望落空了。”杜勒斯断言，柏林会议的结果增加了“欧洲统一的希望”，也就是“建立欧洲军”的希望。鲁塞尔就这一点写道：“但是华盛顿仍然认为，欧洲六国军队的建立遭到了更大的阻碍。”鲁塞尔接着说，华盛顿某些高级官员“非常怀疑法国国民议会会在最近批准欧洲防务集团条约”。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”驻巴黎记者麦克亨表现出明显的不安，因为法国舆论反对盲从美国的政策，反对美国关于迅速批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的要求。这个记者说，反对“欧洲军”的人认为：“欧洲防务集团”条约一旦批准，气氛立即就会紧张起来，因而就会失去东西方之间建立更友好的关系的机会……如果这次日内瓦会议破产，消沉失败的气氛就会笼罩法国，而法美之间的关系也就会随着紧张起来。
   “纽约时报”驻伦敦记者密德尔顿也指出，欧洲反对艾登和皮杜尔在柏林会议上屈从美国的政策。他说，“艾登下周在下院报告的时候可能”遭到左翼工党的“严厉抨击”，“他在柏林会议上追随美国国务卿杜勒斯的行为将遭到批评”。
