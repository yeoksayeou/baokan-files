The Happy Life Now

    In Xianqiupeng Village, Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, 37 out of 48 households have joined the Zhou Linwang Agricultural Production Cooperative. After the autumn harvest last year, the farmers of the Zhou Linwang Cooperative had their homes filled with grain and their eaves hung with corn, presenting a scene of abundance.

    With the increase in production and income, the material and cultural life of the cooperative members has greatly improved. In the past year, the cooperative, in addition to adding more than 200 hoes, one winnowing machine, and two waterwheels, also made more than 130 sets of unlined clothes, 9 cotton quilts, 14 cotton-padded jackets, 3 woolen sweaters, bought 2 sanitary shirts, 15 Lenin suits, 21 pairs of rain boots, and built 10 new tile-roofed houses. Eighteen children in the cooperative are now attending school (only three before liberation), and the cooperative also subscribes to newspapers such as "Farmers' Masses." In winter, after a hard day's work, the members happily study and read newspapers under the bright kerosene lamps. Sometimes, the adults chat and laugh together, while the lively children sing and dance under the light. Shao Xinfu's mother said, "In the past, we closed our doors and windows before dark, and it was all darkness; now we light lamps at night, study, and sing, making it lively and joyful. Xianqiupeng Village has truly changed dynasties!" Nineteen households in the cooperative were formerly poor peasants and five were hired laborers. Since organizing, they have all risen to the level of middle peasants, and the original middle peasants are living even better. As the members often say, "We no longer have to worry about not having enough to eat or wear!"

    Before Organizing

    Xianqiupeng Village is surrounded by barren yellow mud mountains, and there is a mountain stream east of the village. Before 1952, after every heavy rain, the mountain water around the village would converge from the mountain stream, often submerging the entire village. The crops that the farmers worked hard to plant all year round were often washed away by mountain floods. In years with heavy rainfall, due to land being flooded, even planting a single crop three or four times would not yield any returns. The little fertilizer applied to the land was mostly washed away by the water, and each mu of land could yield at most 180 to 200 jin of grain. Therefore, the lives of the farmers were extremely difficult before liberation.

    After liberation, in early 1951, Xianqiupeng Village implemented land reform, and the farmers were allocated land. However, mountain floods continued to cause harm, and there was a severe lack of draught cattle, fertilizer, farm tools, and labor. The farmers still faced many difficulties in production and life that could not be resolved. Although hired laborer Wu Zhangwen was allocated 6.5 mu of land during the land reform, he had no seeds, fertilizer, or draught cattle. His production was very delayed, the harvest in the fields was low, and he still had to rely on cutting firewood to make a living. The old farmer Jiang Zhonglu was allocated 2.4 mu of land during the land reform, but because he lacked draught cattle and farm tools, he had not yet tilled the land when others were already planting. In addition, due to a lack of fertilizer, he only harvested 250 jin of grain in the autumn. Wu Changqi's one mu of land and Jiang Zhonglu's five thatched huts were destroyed by mountain floods, and Wang Maigu's 1.75 mu of land was planted three times after being washed away, but yielded nothing. According to a survey of 26 households in 1951, each mu yielded an average of only 260 jin of grain, and the better ones yielded only about 300 jin per mu.

    Found the Road to Prosperity

    In 1952, the farmers of Xianqiupeng Village found the road to prosperity. Labor model Zhou Linwang, after returning from a meeting in the county, publicized the benefits of organizing production to the farmers. He first organized nine households to form a mutual aid team. At that time, it was spring plowing season, and seven of the nine team members lacked food. However, because organizing production saved labor, the team was able to send three laborers to work outside on short-term jobs and contract for more than ten mu of land outside the team, earning more than five dan of rice in total. The team members also demonstrated the spirit of friendship and mutual assistance, finally solving the problem of food shortage during the spring famine, carrying out spring plowing and sowing in a timely manner, and generally plowing more than individual farmers. The farmers personally saw that the difficulties in life and production of the Zhou Linwang mutual aid team were solved by organizing, and the crops grew very vigorously. So, four more mutual aid teams were organized one after another.

    After the mutual aid teams were organized, the production enthusiasm of the team members was very high. However, based on decentralized management and collective labor, they encountered many difficult problems that could not be solved. They often argued endlessly over work evaluation and accounting, and the sequence of production. At this time, the team members heard that organizing an agricultural production cooperative could solve these problems. Everyone believed that listening to the Communist Party would not be wrong, and that it would be better to organize sooner rather than later. Therefore, in June 1952, the agricultural production cooperative was established, mainly based on the Zhou Linwang mutual aid team.

    After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, in 1952, with the help of the People's Government, two flood control dams were first built in the south and west of the village, which laid the foundation for the development of production in Xianqiupeng Village. Cooperative member Wu Zhangwen said, "My lifelong wish has come true today!" Others said, "The cooperative has just been organized and has already eliminated a major disaster for our village." Under the call of the patriotic production increase campaign, all the members of the cooperative put forward the slogan of "turning barren land into fertile land" and "guaranteeing to increase production by 20% compared to 1951," carrying out summer weeding and fertilization, and generally applying more than 20,000 dan more of grass ash and other fertilizers than in 1951. The cooperative also paid special attention to pest control this year. As a result, an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved in 1952. The total autumn harvest of the cooperative was 122,171 jin of grain, averaging 441 jin per mu, an increase of more than 30% compared to 1951, more than double the yield before liberation, and 15% more than the local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. In 1953, the cooperative further发挥了the role of organizing, completely unified the management of land, selected and replaced improved varieties, cultivated strong seedlings, plowed more and deeper, and generally achieved appropriate close planting and rational fertilization. This year, the average yield of rice per mu was 497 jin, an increase of more than 10% compared to 1952, 15% more than the best local mutual aid team, and more than 20% more than the best individual farmers. The net income of the entire cooperative was more than 1,100 jin per person. Zhou Licheng, who increased his income the most, had 5.5 mu of land. In 1951, when he was farming individually, his net income was 1,442 jin of rice. In 1953, after joining the cooperative, his net income was 5,803 jin of rice, more than three times the amount when he was farming individually. The farmers of the Zhou Linwang Cooperative deeply realized the benefits of collective labor. In the summer of 1953, when the rice was heading and needed water, it did not rain for more than 50 consecutive days, and 283 mu of land in the cooperative were generally affected by drought. They were determined to overcome the severe natural disaster. When the fields at the bottom of Pingtang dried up, they drew water from the ditches to irrigate them. When the fields at the back slope dried up, they connected six waterwheels to pump water and save the rice twice. Rich peasant Gong Jisheng had 2.7 mu of land there, but because he lacked labor, he did not pump water, resulting in a 30% reduction in yield. The cooperative members said, "'Labor' is stronger than 'capital,' and the cooperative is better than a rich peasant." When the fields at the Old Buddha Hall dried up, they connected seven waterwheels to move the water over the mountain twice, saving the rice. Individual farmer Zhou Shanggen had three mu of land there, and he could have moved the water with two waterwheels, but because he lacked labor, he did not move the water, resulting in no harvest. After fighting the drought in this way, the crops of the entire cooperative had a bumper harvest. Last year, when the early rice was ripe, the cooperative had to harvest the early rice, pump water to fight the drought, and also plant late rice and corn. Various production tasks were squeezed together. However, because the cooperative implemented scientific division of labor with more than 80 people, male laborers were responsible for pumping water to fight the drought, harvesting, and planting; women were responsible for dragging rice straw, collecting ash, and assisting in pumping water; the elderly raised pigs and collected dog manure; and older children went out to graze cattle. Therefore, they achieved simultaneous drought resistance, harvesting, and planting, and ensured that the autumn planting area was expanded by 25%. In addition, after the cooperative concentrated the use of land and labor, 283 mu of land usually only required 28 full laborers to cultivate (the cooperative had 45 full laborers), and the remaining labor force was used for sideline production. In 1953, these surplus laborers went out to help others dig mountains, make oil, and burn lime, earning 25,000 jin of grain, which further increased the cooperative's production funds, making it possible to apply sufficient fertilizer to the late rice fields. As a result, each mu of late rice fields yielded more than 100 jin more grain than the average local farmers. Planting crops in different plots according to the soil quality was also an important reason for increasing yields. Farmers outside the cooperative enviously said, "The cooperative's fields are all一片莲子(lotus leaf fields), 一片中稻(mid-season rice), 一片晚稻(late-season rice), growing neatly and uniformly, it's really good."

    周林旺农业合作社走上富裕的道路

    现在的愉快生活
    浙江省龙游县贤求朋村有四十八户人家，参加周林旺农业生产合作社的，就有三十七户。去年秋收以后，周林旺社的农民，家家户户粮食堆满仓，苞萝挂满堂，呈现一片丰收的景象。
    随着生产的提高，收入的增加，社员们的物质生活和文化生活大大改善了。去年一年，全社除添置锄头二百多把，风车一部，水车两部外，还新做单裌衣服一百三十多套，棉被九条，棉袄十四件，毛线衣三件，买卫生衣二件，列宁服十五套，雨鞋二十一双，新建瓦房十间。全社有十八个儿童上了学（解放前只有三个），社里还订有“农民大众”等报。冬天，社员们在白天辛勤劳动以后，晚上就在明亮的煤油灯下愉快地学习、读报。有时，大人们在一起谈笑，活泼的孩子们就在灯下唱歌跳舞。邵新富的娘说：“过去天没黑，就关门闭户，一片黑暗；现在晚上张灯点火，学习、唱歌，热闹欢天，贤求朋村真是改朝换代啦！”全社农民，以前有十九户是贫农，五户是雇农，组织起来以后，现在都已经上升为中农，原有的中农生活就过得更好了。正如社员们常说的：“再也不愁没吃没穿啦！”
      组织起来以前
    贤求朋村周围都是黄泥荒山，村东有条山溪。一九五二年以前，每当大雨以后，村周围的山水就由山溪汇流而来，往往淹没整个村庄；农民一年辛勤劳动所种的庄稼，常被山洪冲毁。雨水多的年分，因土地被淹，一熟作物种三、四次也得不到收益。全村土地上所施用的一点肥料，大都被水冲走，每亩地顶多只能收谷子一百八十斤到二百斤。所以，解放前农民生活十分困苦。
    解放后，一九五一年初，贤求朋村实行了土地改革，农民分到了土地。但是山洪仍然为害，耕牛、肥料、农具、劳力等等都很缺乏，农民在生产和生活上仍有很多困难不能解决。雇农吴樟文在土地改革中虽然分了六亩五分田，但种子、肥料、耕牛一无所有，生产很不及时，田里收成低，还得靠砍柴糊口；老农姜中禄在土地改革时分了二亩四分田，因为缺乏耕牛、农具，别人已经种田了，他还没有耕田，加以缺乏肥料，到秋收时只收了二百五十斤谷子。吴昌其的一亩田和姜中禄的五间茅屋被山洪冲毁，汪麦古的一亩七分五田被冲后种了三次，还是颗粒无收。据一九五一年二十六户的统计，每亩平均只收到二百六十斤谷子，其余较好的，每亩也只收到三百来斤。
      找到了走向富裕的道路
    一九五二年，贤求朋村的农民找到了走向富裕的道路。劳动模范周林旺从县里开会回来，就对农民宣传组织起来生产的好处。他首先组织九户农民成立了一个互助组。当时正是春耕的时候，九户组员就有七户缺粮食吃。但由于组织起来生产节省了劳动力，组里就抽出三个劳动力出外打短工，又替组外包耕了十多亩田，共赚回大米五担多；组员们又发挥了友爱互助的精神，终于解决了春荒缺粮的问题，及时地进行了春耕播种，并普遍做到了比个体农民多耕一次。农民亲眼看到，周林旺互助组生活和生产中的困难问题，由于组织起来得到了解决，庄稼也长得很茁壮，就先后又组织了四个互助组。
    互助组组织起来以后，组员的生产积极性很高。可是在分散经营、集体劳动的基础上，又碰到许多解决不了的困难问题。他们往往为了评工找账，生产先后，争吵不休。在这时候，组员们听到说组织农业生产合作社可以解决这些问题。大家认为听共产党的话不会错，还是早组织起来好，所以在一九五二年六月，就以周林旺互助组为主，成立了农业生产合作社。
    农业生产合作社成立后，一九五二年在人民政府的帮助下，首先在村南村西做好了两条防洪水坝，这就给贤求朋村发展生产打下了基础。社员吴樟文说：“我一辈子的愿望今天实现啦！”也有的说：“合作社刚组织起来就给咱村除了一大祸害。”在爱国增产竞赛的号召下，全社社员提出了“把瘦田变肥田”“保证要比一九五一年增产二成”的口号，进行夏耘施肥，一般都作到耕三耘四，施用的草灰等肥料比一九五一年增加二万多担。这一年社里并特别注意了防虫工作。结果，一九五二年得到空前的丰收，全社秋庄稼共打谷子十二万二千一百七十一斤，平均每亩四百四十一斤，比一九五一年增产三成多，比解放前增产一倍多，比当地互助组和单干农民增产一成半。社里一九五三年更加发挥了组织起来的作用，完全统一经营管理土地，选换良种，培育壮苗，多耕深耕，普遍作到适当密植，合理施肥。这年每亩平均产稻谷四百九十七斤，比一九五二年又增产一成多，比当地最好的互助组增产一成半，比最好的单干农民增产二成以上。全社纯收入每人可得到一千一百斤以上。增加收入最多的周立成，他有五亩五分田，一九五一年单干时纯收入是稻谷一千四百四十二斤，一九五三年参加社后的纯收入是稻谷五千八百零三斤，比单干时增加了三倍多。集体劳动的作用周林旺社的农民深深体会到了农业生产合作社的好处。一九五三年夏天，稻子正在抽穗，需要水分的时候，却一连五十多天不下雨，社内二百八十三亩田普遍受旱。他们决心要战胜严重的天灾。平塘底的田干了，他们就从沟洞里车水来浇，后坂的田干了，他们就用六架水车接起来，两次车水救稻。富农龚继生在那里有二亩七分田，因劳力不足没有车水，结果减产三成。社员们说：“‘劳力’比‘资本’强，合作社赛过富农。”老佛殿的田干了，他们就用七架水车连接起来，两次把水搬过山头，救出了稻子。单干农民周尚根在那里有三亩田，用二张车就可把水搬来，但因劳力不足，没有搬水，结果颗粒无收。经过这样和旱灾作斗争后，全社庄稼都获得了丰收。去年在早稻成熟时，社里又要割早稻，又要车水抗旱，还要种晚稻和苞萝，各种生产工作都挤在一起。但由于社里八十多个人实行科学分工，男整劳动力负责车水抗旱，收割，下种；妇女负责拖稻草、撮灰，配合车水；老年人养猪，拾狗粪；大点的孩子就出去放牛，所以，做到了边抗旱、边收割，边下种，并且保证扩大了秋种面积百分之二十五。此外，社里土地劳力集中使用以后，二百八十三亩田，平常只要二十八个整劳动力耕种就可以（社内有整劳动力四十五个），其余的劳动力就用来搞副业生产。一九五三年这些多余的劳动力出去帮别人挖山、打油、烧石灰，就赚回稻谷二万五千斤，使社里的生产资金更增加了，在晚稻田中就有条件施用足够的肥料，结果，每亩晚稻田比当地一般农民增产了一百多斤谷子。社里按照土质，分片种植作物，也是提高产量的重要原因。社外农民羡慕地说：“合作社的田都是一片莲子，一片中稻，一片晚稻，长得齐刷刷的，真是好。”
