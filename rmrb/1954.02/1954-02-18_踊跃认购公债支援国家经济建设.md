Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Bonds to Support National Economic Construction
Taking the Road to Happiness

Song Chuan-yi, a seventy-two-year-old model worker and family member of a revolutionary martyr in the suburbs of An Dong City, participated in the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. When he returned to China from Korea, he was very happy to hear that the state was going to issue economic construction bonds. He remembered that when he was about to return home from Korea, the volunteer comrades had said to him: Old man! Tell the people of the motherland when you get back, you don't have to worry about what's happening outside the gate, just concentrate on building our motherland! He thought to himself: If we have the strength, what else should we do but work hard to build the motherland! He calculated that of the seventeen million yuan he had in the bank, he would use some to buy shares in the credit cooperative and decided to buy ten million yuan in bonds.

Song Chuan-yi's seventeen million yuan had been saved since 1951. He never spent his money recklessly, and as soon as he had money, he deposited it in the bank. People said to him: Why are you so careful at your age! Some said: Old Song is saving up for his coffin! In fact, Old Song was thinking: Only when the country is well-built, with more factories and mines, can we live a better life. But how do we take this happy road? We have to rely on everyone's efforts, rely on everyone's increasing production and practicing thrift, to carry out construction.

She Saw the Future

Sun Ping is a female cadre. Before liberation, because her father was unemployed, she and her younger sisters and brothers were sent to children's homes, and her mother washed clothes and made shoes for others, and the whole family spent twelve years in semi-starvation.

After the liberation of Ningxia in 1949, her father and her sisters all joined the workforce. The worn-out quilts of more than ten years had all been replaced with new ones. In March 1952, her father became ill and did not recover until April of the following year. During this long period, he not only enjoyed free medical treatment but was also paid a salary. Whenever her family mentioned these things, they were grateful to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party.

After the People's Government issued national economic construction bonds, she thought about the past and the present, and also about the future: If the national economic construction is accelerated, the material and cultural living standards of the people will be further improved. So she decided to buy two and a half million yuan of bonds.

Supporting National Industrialization is Still Important

The workers of the First Tunneling Team of the Xi'an Tunneling Engineering Team, who created the glorious record of advancing one hundred meters per month in rock excavation in Northeast China, discussed the purchase of national economic construction bonds in three groups on January 14.

As workers' productivity increased, their lives gradually improved. Yang Qing, Liu Fuxing, Leng Decheng, Zong Yicheng, Shao Youku, and more than a dozen other rock excavators all planned to buy a pair of beautiful leather shoes from Hengyang, Zhejiang, and other places, but when they heard about the issuance of construction bonds, these young men decided not to buy leather shoes and save the money for leather shoes to buy bonds. The worker Li You thought about it all night on the 13th: not only should he buy bonds, but he would also work with everyone in February to complete the task of advancing two hundred meters per month in twenty-five days. The worker Liu De was about to get married. When he heard that the state was issuing economic construction bonds, he proposed to save fifteen thousand yuan from the money for buying wedding supplies to buy bonds. Wang Fenglin and Huang Keqin, who were skilled at drilling holes, had originally planned to make a new set of clothes, but now they decided to do it later. Advanced producers Yang Baochang, rock loading machine operators Mao Fengkui and Li Quanhe, planned to buy a good watch each in February, but this time they said: "Let's not buy them for now, let's buy them in March or April."

In a very short time, the forty-seven workers of the First Tunneling Team purchased eight and a half million yuan of bonds.
Conscious Patriotic Behavior

Man Jin, a lead printing technician in the machine workshop of the Heilongjiang Daily Printing Factory, received a letter from his mother a few months ago, asking him to go home for the Spring Festival. Man Jin was very happy to see the letter. He immediately wrote a reply to his family, saying that he would definitely go back for the Spring Festival. Since then, he has been saving some money every month to prepare for his trip home. By January 10th of this year, he had saved more than five hundred thousand yuan.

On January 18th, the staff of the Heilongjiang Daily held a meeting to call on everyone to actively subscribe to bonds. After the meeting, he thought: Should I go home? Or should I buy bonds? Later, he thought: Buying bonds is to support national construction, it is our patriotic action to implement the general line, and it is beneficial to both the country and ourselves. So he calculated a detailed account himself: The round-trip fare to Changchun would cost two or three hundred thousand yuan, and it would also delay production for seven or eight days. The next morning, he said to the workshop director: "I have decided not to go home, and save five hundred thousand yuan to buy bonds. I will write another letter to my family and mail a photo. If my mother misses me, she can look at the photo, and it won't be too late to go home later."

Let "It" Also Serve the Country

There is a forty-nine-year-old mail clerk in the Northeast Institute of Geology. He joined the revolution in 1926 and was transferred in October 1952. People call him "Old Red Army." For twenty-eight years, he has always maintained the fine style of hard work and plain living of a revolutionary fighter, and he never wasted a penny, so the money in his canvas money bag increased month by month. When others saw it, they said that the "Old Red Army" had sweated the money. He smiled and said: "It's enough to have food and clothing! The money given by the country can't be spent casually."

One morning, the "Old Red Army" was counting money on the bed. Wang Jingmin, who worked with him, saw it and asked him: "You have saved so much money. Now that the government is issuing construction bonds, you should take the money out and use it for national construction!" Xiao Li also said: "Buying bonds and saving money are both good." As soon as the Old Red Army heard this, he knew that these two young men were mobilizing him, so he deliberately asked them to talk about the policies. Xiao Li, who was quick to speak, was in high spirits when he first talked about the benefits of saving money and was about to talk about buying bonds when the "Old Red Army" said: "No need to talk about it, buying bonds is to accumulate funds and accelerate national industrialization, isn't it!" Then he said: "How could I not understand these issues! After participating in the revolution for so many years, even scrap iron has been turned into steel. I have been preparing to buy bonds for a long time. This money has never seen the sun in my hands, so this time I will let it go out and do some service for the country." The "Old Red Army" took out all six million yuan of his savings, bought four and a half million yuan of bonds, and sent one and a half million yuan to the bank for savings.

She Figured it Out

Liu Kaihong, a worker at the Gaokeng Mine of Pingxiang Coal Mine, had just come out of the mine when he saw the news about the issuance of construction bonds in the newspaper. He thought: It is very important to purchase bonds to accumulate funds for national construction. If all the workers in the mine buy one hundred thousand yuan each, that number would be quite large.

That afternoon, Liu Kaihong listened to the trade union chairman's report on the general line and understood the important significance of national industrialization. He was very happy and went home and said to his wife, Chen Guizhen: "Now that the state is issuing economic construction bonds, I will not only work hard, but also buy 500,000 yuan of bonds to set an example." Chen Guizhen did not agree. She muttered: "What's the point of buying so many bonds, buying ten or eight thousand yuan is enough..."

A few days later, Chen Guizhen also listened to the report on the general line and came back and said to Liu Kaihong: "Now the country is carrying out large-scale economic construction. When the Soviet Union started construction, it also relied on thrift and frugality to accumulate funds. We must also learn from them, practice thrift and frugality, and buy more bonds. I originally planned to buy a pair of galoshes and make a woolen trousers for the Spring Festival, but now that I have something to wear, I have decided not to do it anymore and save money to buy bonds." Liu Kaihong said: "You also understand the principles, and you are progressing fast. Bonds can be purchased in installments, and I want to buy more." The two of them calculated that they could save 150,000 yuan per month besides eating, burning coal, and pocket money. Finally, the two of them decided to buy one million yuan of bonds.

    踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设
    走幸福的道路
    安东市郊区烈属劳动模范七十二岁的宋传义，曾参加中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团去过朝鲜，当他从朝鲜回到祖国的时候，听说国家要发行经济建设公债，心中真是高兴。想到在朝鲜要回国时，志愿军同志们曾对他说：老大爷！你回去告诉祖国人民吧，大门外的事情不用你们操心，你们只管好好建设咱们的祖国吧！他心想：咱们有力量不用来加劲建设祖国还干什么呢！他核计了一下，在银行存的一千七百万元，除了用一部分钱入信用合作社的股外，决定买一千万元的公债。
    宋传义老大爷这一千七百万元，是从一九五一年就开始攒的。他有了钱从来不肯胡花一个，一有钱就存到银行里去。人家说他：这么大岁数还仔细个啥！也有的说：老宋头是在攒棺材本啊！其实，宋老大爷是在想：国家建设好了，工厂、矿山多了，咱们才能过更好的生活。可是这幸福的路怎么走呢？就得靠咱们大家出力量，靠大家增产节约，进行建设。
    她看到了将来
    孙平是个妇女干部。解放以前，因为父亲失业，她和妹妹弟弟们都被送到儿童教养院，母亲给别人洗衣服做鞋，全家在半饥饿的日子里磨过了十二年。
    一九四九年宁夏解放以后，她爸爸和她们姐妹几个人都参加了工作。十几年的破被子都换成了新的。一九五二年三月，她爸爸生了病，一直到第二年四月才好，这么长的时间里，不仅享受着公费医疗待遇，还发给薪金。家里人一提起这些事，都感激毛主席和共产党。
    人民政府发行了国家经济建设公债以后，她想了想过去和现在，也想到了将来：如果加速了国家经济建设，人民的物质和文化生活水平将会更加提高。所以她决定购买二百五十万元的公债。
    还是支援国家工业化要紧
    创造了东北掘岩月进百公尺光辉纪录的西安掘井工程队第一掘进队的工人们，在一月十四日分三伙讨论了购买国家经济建设公债的事。
    工人们因为生产率提高，生活也逐步得到改善。杨清、刘福兴、冷德成、宗义成和邵有库等十几个掘岩工人，都打算从衡阳、浙江等地买双漂亮的皮鞋穿，可是一听到发行建设公债，这帮小伙子就决定不买皮鞋了，把买皮鞋的钱省下来，购买公债。工人李有，在十三日晚上想了一宿：不但要买公债，还要在二月里和大家一起用二十五天的时间完成月进二百公尺的任务。工人刘德不久就要结婚，听到国家发行经济建设公债，便提出要在买结婚用品的钱中节省出十五万元购买公债。打眼能手王凤林和黄克勤原先都打算多做一套新衣服，现在决定以后再做。先进生产者杨宝昌、装岩机手毛凤奎和李全和，计划在二月里各买一块好手表，这回他们说：“咱们先不买，等三、四月再买。”
    第一掘进队的四十七名工人，在很短的时间里，购买了八百五十万元的公债。自觉的爱国行为
    黑龙江日报印刷厂机器车间铅印技工满金，在几个月前接到了他妈妈的来信，让他回家过春节。满金见信以后，心里挺高兴。马上就给家里写了一封回信，说过春节一定回去。从那以后，他每月领工薪都积蓄一些钱，准备回家时候用。到今年一月十日，已经积蓄了五十多万元。
    一月十八日，黑龙江日报职工开了个会，号召大家踊跃认购公债。会后他就想：是回家呢？还是买公债？后来他想：买公债是支援国家建设，是我们执行总路线的爱国行动，对国家对自己都有好处。于是他自己又算了个细账：回长春来回路费得二、三十万元，还要耽误七、八天生产。第二天早晨，他就对车间主任说：“我决定不回家了，省下五十万元钱买公债。再给家写封信邮张像片，我母亲要想念我，就看看像片好了，以后再回家也不晚。”
    让“它”也为国家服务
    东北地质学院有个四十九岁的收发员，他在一九二六年参加了革命，一九五二年十月转业，人们都称他“老红军”。他二十八年如一日，始终保持着革命战士的艰苦朴素的优良作风，从不肯浪费一个钱，所以他的帆布钱袋里的钱月月在增加。别人看见都说“老红军”把钱都捏出汗来了。他便笑着说：“能吃上穿上就行呗！国家给的钱，不能随便胡花一个。”
    有一天早晨，“老红军”正在床上数钱，和他一起工作的王景民看到了，就问他：“你积蓄了那么多钱，现在政府发行建设公债，该把钱拿出来用到国家建设上去啦！”小李也说：“买公债和储蓄都行。”老红军一听，这两个小伙子是在向他作动员工作，于是就故意让他们给讲讲政策。快嘴的小李正在热情高涨的时候，先讲了储蓄的好处，正要往下讲买公债，“老红军”说：“不用讲了，买公债是积累资金，加速国家工业化是不是！”接着他说：“这些问题我哪能不懂！参加革命这么多年，废铁也炼成了钢。我早就准备买公债了。这些钱到我手就没见过阳光，这回也叫它出去替国家服点务。”“老红军”把积蓄的六百万元都拿出来，四百五十万元买公债，一百五十万元送银行储蓄。
    她想通了
    萍乡煤矿高坑工人刘凯洪刚从井下出来，就看到报上登着发行建设公债的消息。他盘算着：购买公债为国家建设积累资金很重要，如果全矿工人每人买十万元，那个数目也就不小。
    当天下午，刘凯洪听工会主席报告了总路线，知道国家工业化的重要意义，心里很高兴。回到家里就对他爱人陈桂贞说：“现在国家发行经济建设公债，我不但要安心工作，还要买五十万元公债，起个带头作用。”陈桂贞心里不大同意。她嘟囔着：“买那么多公债做什么，买十万八万的就算了……”
    过几天，陈桂贞也听了总路线的报告，回来对刘凯洪说：“现在国家正在进行大规模的经济建设，苏联开始建设的时候，也是靠省吃俭用积累资金的，我们也要学他的样，省吃俭用，多买些公债。以前我打算过春节时再买一双套鞋，做条呢裤子，现在有穿的，决定不再做了，省下钱来买公债。”刘凯洪说：“你也懂理了，还算你进步快。买公债可以分期付款，我想多买一些。”他们俩算了算：除了吃饭、烧煤和零用以外每月还可以节省十五万元。最后他俩决定买一百万元公债。
