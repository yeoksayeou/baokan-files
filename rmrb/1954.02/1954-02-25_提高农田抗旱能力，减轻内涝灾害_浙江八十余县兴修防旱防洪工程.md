Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, February 19th: Farmers in over eighty counties in Zhejiang Province are building water conservancy projects for drought and flood prevention based on local natural conditions. After these projects are completed, they will improve the drought resistance of 3.5 million mu of farmland and reduce waterlogging disasters. According to incomplete statistics, more than 5,000 large and small water conservancy projects have already been completed in the thirty-two counties of the Jiaxing, Jinhua, Ningbo, and Quzhou Special Districts, where construction started earlier.

This year, farmers in various parts of Zhejiang Province have shown great enthusiasm for building water conservancy projects to develop agricultural production. Farmers in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas are actively building ponds, dams, and small reservoirs on the mountains to prevent drought. In Dongyang, Yongkang, and Xindeng counties alone, more than 600 new and repaired reservoirs of various sizes have been built, and more than 400 are under construction. Farmers in more than ten counties in the Jinhua Special District are selecting suitable areas to build small reservoirs. The farmers of Zhuji County have built 15 relatively large reservoirs. Once these reservoirs are completed, more than 17,000 mu of paddy fields will be protected from drought, and it is estimated that grain production will increase by more than 2.3 million jin per year. Farmers in the plains are dredging rivers and reinforcing dikes, mainly for flood prevention. In Jiangshan District and Yi, Tianran, and other five townships in Yin County, about 3,000 farmers are jointly excavating and repairing a 24-li-long major river every day. After the river is repaired, more than 50,000 mu of farmland along the river will be protected from alkali tide intrusion, and it is estimated that grain production will increase by at least 2.5 million jin per year.

In the construction of farmland water conservancy, various parts of Zhejiang Province are also paying attention to combining it with the development of mutual aid and cooperation. In many villages in Xindeng County, scientific division of labor is generally carried out by mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the construction of water conservancy projects. This not only improves the quality of the project and work efficiency but also revitalizes mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In order to ensure that the repair of the major river and spring plowing and production are not delayed, the farmers of Jiangshan District and Tianran and other five townships in Yin County have organized more than 350 temporary mutual aid teams.

    提高农田抗旱能力，减轻内涝灾害
    浙江八十余县兴修防旱防洪工程
    【新华社杭州十九日电】浙江省八十多个县的农民，正根据各地的自然条件，兴修防旱、防洪等水利工程。这些工程完工后，将使三百五十万亩农田提高抗旱能力和减轻内涝灾害。现在，动工较早的嘉兴、金华、宁波、衢州等四个专区的三十二个县，据不完全统计，已完成大小水利工程五千多处。
    今年，浙江省各地农民兴修水利发展农业生产的热情很高。山区和半山区农民在山地积极修塘、筑堰和兴建小型蓄水库等防旱工程。仅东阳、永康、新登三个县，新挖和修好的大小蓄水塘就有六百多口，正在兴修的有四百多口。金华专区的十多个县的农民，正在选择有条件的地区兴建小型蓄水库。诸暨县农民兴建的规模较大的蓄水库就有十五座，这些水库完工后，将使一万七千多亩稻田免受旱灾，估计每年可增产二百三十多万斤粮食。平原地区的农民正以防洪为主疏浚河道，培修堤防。鄞县姜山区和益、天然等五个乡，每天有三千左右的农民联合挖修一条二十四里长的大河，这条河修好后，将使沿河一带五万多亩农田免受碱潮侵袭，估计每年至少可增产粮食二百五十多万斤。
    浙江省各地在兴修农田水利中，并注意和发展互助合作相结合。新登县许多乡村在兴修水利中，普遍以互助合作组织为单位进行科学分工。这不仅提高了工程质量和工作效率，而且也使互助合作组织活跃起来。鄞县姜山区、天然等五个乡的农民，为了使修大河和春耕生产两不误，就组织了三百五十多个临时互助组。
