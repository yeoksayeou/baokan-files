Backward Area Transformed into Advanced Area
    ——A Record of the Working Style of Xue Weixiang, Member of the Fifth District Committee of the CCP Hunyuan
    Shi Xiaoyou, Zhang Changzhen
    On a mountain ridge in the eastern mountainous area of Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province, lie several small mountain villages named Qiaomai Chuan, Shuigou, Huangjiapo, and Da Shitouling. In the past, these small mountain villages were very backward in agricultural production due to a long-term lack of leadership from the county and district.
    In the spring of 1952, the Fifth District Committee of the CCP Hunyuan County discovered this situation and sent Xue Weixiang, the district committee's propaganda member, to lead the work in this area. In less than two years, he enabled this area to enthusiastically launch the mutual aid and cooperation movement like other areas. The mutual aid and cooperation in Qiaomai Chuan village even became a model for the entire county's mutual aid and cooperation movement. In Shuigou and Huangjiapo villages, more than 90 percent of farmers participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Even the worst-performing villages, such as Luanlingguan and Da Shitouling, had two to three permanent mutual aid teams. In the mutual aid and cooperation, the rough farming techniques in the mountainous area were also improved. As a result, the land yield in this area has increased significantly. Taking Qiaomai Chuan as an example, the average yield per mu of land in the past was less than four dou, but in 1952 it increased to more than five dou. Although it suffered from various disasters in 1953, the average yield was still around four and a half dou. Due to the increase in agricultural production, the lives of farmers have also been improved. When local farmers talk about these changes, in addition to thanking the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, they especially mention the achievements of Xue Weixiang, a member of the District Committee.

    A Cadre Beloved by the Masses
    When Xue Weixiang first came to work in Qiaomai Chuan and other villages, like some cadres, he was busy holding meetings and giving reports, so the masses and cadres became increasingly estranged from him day by day. At this time, Xue Weixiang felt both aggrieved and distressed. Once, Xue Weixiang held a full sub-district branch instructor meeting in Sha Getuo Village, and Li Weiguo, the branch instructor of Luanlingguan, did not come. Xue Weixiang was very angry, thinking: Li Weiguo is too outrageous. As soon as the meeting was over, Xue Weixiang didn't even bother to eat, and ran to Luanlingguan in one breath. When Xue Weixiang found Li Weiguo, he asked him head-on, "Everyone else attended the meeting, why didn't you go?" Li Weiguo was already feeling bad because of his family's financial difficulties, and said angrily, "Lao Xue, you really don't care about people's lives, you only know how to call me to meetings, don't you know that I don't even have anything to cook at home (meaning no food to eat), and you don't give me two jin of naked oats after the meeting." After Li Weiguo finished speaking, he braced himself and waited for Xue Weixiang to criticize him. But Xue Weixiang just walked back and forth with his head down, without saying a word, and only said after a long time, "Let's talk about it later!" Then he hurried away. This made Li Weiguo feel baffled.
    After Xue Weixiang went back, he couldn't sleep all night, and recalled a scene when he was a village cadre: "When I was a village cadre, my family also lived from hand to mouth, but some district cadres didn't care about this and assigned me a lot of work, so I couldn't produce for several days, and my family had nothing to eat... Now that I'm a district cadre myself, I don't care about the production and life of the cadres and the masses, no wonder the village cadres and the masses are increasingly unwilling to approach me."
    Xue Weixiang felt very sad when he thought of this, but also very excited. Li Weiguo's two sentences were like a lesson for him, making his heart brighten.
    From then on, Xue Weixiang cared about the production and life of cadres and the masses. Not only did he always consider the production and life of cadres and the masses when assigning work, but he also paid attention to learning the working style and working methods of the mass line. Therefore, Xue Weixiang established a deep relationship with the masses. The masses and cadres in the village praised Xue Weixiang as "old people and young people can talk to him, and women can also talk to him." This enabled Xue Weixiang to often discover problems from the masses and solve them together with the masses.
    There is such a story:
    In the summer of 1952, Xue Weixiang assisted the People's Government in distributing relief grain in Santiao Yan Village. After a preliminary investigation of the situation of the disaster-stricken households, they put forward a list of disaster victims for distributing relief grain. When the list was announced at the meeting, someone sighed "Ah!" Xue Weixiang thought: There must be a problem here. So he hurriedly explained: "This is not the final list, everyone can still change their opinions." But no one spoke, and Xue Weixiang knew that this problem could not be solved for a while. After the meeting, Xue Weixiang conducted investigations with many people, but to no avail. Xue Weixiang thought: This matter may be related to the village cadres, so he went to Tang Da Ba, who dared to raise opinions to the cadres. Xue Weixiang asked Tang Da Ba: "Tang Laoda, do you think this distribution of relief grain is fair?" Tang Da Ba answered in one breath: "Fair, fair!" Xue Weixiang asked again: "Isn't someone having an opinion?" Tang Da Ba said with dissatisfaction: "Hum! What do you mean by having an opinion about the government's affairs?" Xue Weixiang said: "Tang Laoda, the People's Government distributes relief grain to help disaster-stricken households tide over the disaster and improve production, so the relief grain must be distributed fairly." Tang Da Ba said: "That's the way it is, but the people who handle things don't do it that way." Tang Da Ba also said: "It's a long story, this has to be said about the things of the year before. The year before, when the People's Government registered the land, the village cadres hid a part of the land in the whole village. For example, Li Youcai, a member of the branch committee, originally had forty-six mu of land, but only reported eight mu to the People's Government. If the land is hidden, the burden of public grain will not be fair. Although you also saw that the crops of these 'severely affected households' were hit by hail, you didn't see that they still have a large piece of land on the mountain ridge with good crops..." The more Tang Da Ba said, the more nervous and excited Xue Weixiang became. The masses' sigh of "Ah!" made him discover so many problems.

    To Improve Production, Mutual Aid and Cooperation Must Be Improved
    Xue Weixiang knew that to improve agricultural production, mutual aid and cooperation must be improved. Otherwise, in the future, the poor will be poor, the rich will be rich, there will be more poor and fewer rich, and we will go back to the old road. Xue Weixiang also understood that in order to improve mutual aid and cooperation, he must first make a "model" in Qiaomai Chuan Village, and then promote it to Shuigou and other villages.
    Although Xue Weixiang already had a high prestige in these mountain villages, and everyone believed that he was doing things for everyone. But when he raised the issue of mutual aid and cooperation, no one expressed a willingness to participate in mutual aid and cooperation. Some people were even whispering behind their backs: "Will organizing work out? I've only heard about it, but I haven't seen it. I'm afraid it's better for everyone to do their own thing." Even the party members were not very enthusiastic about mutual aid and cooperation. So, according to everyone's reaction to mutual aid and cooperation, Xue Weixiang first educated the party members within the party and criticized the capitalist ideas of individual party members. Then, through the party members, he persuaded and educated the general farmers. After learning, the party members' awareness was raised, and five party members and more than a dozen non-party activists organized three temporary mutual aid teams. After the fertilizer delivery work was over, Xue Weixiang helped these mutual aid teams summarize the achievements of this mutual aid, so that everyone saw the benefits of mutual aid. In this way, people who originally said "organizing is nonsense" also changed their attitudes and began to care about the production situation of the mutual aid team. Later, because the mutual aid team could sow seeds and hoe seedlings ahead of the general farmers, more and more people participated in the mutual aid team.
    On the other hand, Xue Weixiang helped the mutual aid teams solve problems at any time, so that they could be consolidated. Once, the Zhang Lian mutual aid team quarreled over the issue of work points. Xue Weixiang hurried to understand the situation with several branch committee members. It turned out that Lei Ping (a party member) in this group owed the group more than 20 work points and did not pay them back; in addition, everyone had opinions on the current unreasonable work point recording method. At this time, Xue Weixiang and the branch committee members criticized Lei Ping's mistakes based on the principle of "mutual benefit" and asked him to pay back the work points. Then Xue Weixiang led everyone to learn the "dead points and live evaluation" work point recording experience introduced in the newspaper and established a "daily clearing and monthly settlement" work system. In this way, everyone was very satisfied. During the autumn harvest, everyone was anxious to harvest their own crops, and each did their own thing. After Xue Weixiang and the village branch committee discovered this problem, they discussed solutions with the heads of the mutual aid teams overnight. With more people and more wisdom, they finally came up with the method of "harvesting by work and guaranteeing output," so that the mutual aid team went from just showing signs of disintegration to consolidation again.
    The "model" of mutual aid and cooperation in Qiaomai Chuan Village was established, and Xue Weixiang promoted the mutual aid and cooperation experience of Qiaomai Chuan to the farmers in Shuigou, Huangjiapo, Da Shitouling, Zhaobi and other villages. Soon, these villages also established mutual aid teams in groups of three or two. Later, Xue Weixiang gradually spread the problems encountered by the mutual aid team in Qiaomai Chuan Village and the solutions to these villages. During the autumn harvest in 1952, Xue Weixiang and the village branches organized more than a thousand farmers to visit the autumn harvest of the Qiaomai Chuan mutual aid team, using the living example of Qiaomai Chuan Village "organizing more food production" to educate and encourage the farmers in various villages. So that the mutual aid teams in these villages had new development.

    Mobilize Women to Participate in Agricultural Labor
    In the summer of 1952, Xue Weixiang realized in the process of leading mutual aid and cooperative production that women were a great force, and if they were mobilized, agricultural production could be done better. In the summer of this year—1952, it just happened to rain hail, which damaged a lot of crops. When Xue Weixiang went to Santiao Yan Village to lead the masses to replant, he found that there were many things to do. The crop fields damaged by the hail had to be replanted, the undamaged crops had to be thinned, and flood control dams had to be built. But there were many tasks and few people to do them. Xue Weixiang decided to first mobilize women in this village to participate in agricultural labor, so he held a women's symposium. As a result of the symposium, only a few women were willing to participate in agricultural labor. At this time, Xue Weixiang calculated the detailed accounts and explained the pros and cons to everyone. He said: "The crop fields hit by hail have to be replanted, the undamaged crops have to be thinned, and flood control dams have to be built. There are so many tasks, and everything has to be done. If women don't go to the fields, they can't be completed or done well. Then there will be less food production, and the whole family will be in trouble." After Xue Weixiang's mobilization, some more women were willing to participate in agricultural labor. After the meeting, Xue Weixiang once again persuaded and educated everyone through activists. In this way, all the women who could work in the village participated in agricultural labor. Women contributed half of the effort in repairing flood control dams. Later, Xue Weixiang used the experience of organizing women to participate in agricultural labor in Santiao Yan Village to mobilize women in Shuigou, Da Shitouling, Huangjiapo and other villages to go to the fields.
    Although the women in Qiaomai Chuan Village also participated in agricultural labor, they always got up, collapsed; collapsed, and got up again; got up, and collapsed again...
    During the summer harvest in 1953, Xue Weixiang was determined to mobilize the women in this village again and consolidate them. Thinking of the situation where women in other villages were able to persist in participating in agricultural production, Xue Weixiang asked and answered himself: "Why is the women's work in Da Shitouling Village done so well?" "The women cadres are active!" "Who are these women cadres?" "Strong adults over thirty years old, with no family restrictions!"
    "Most of the women cadres in Qiaomai Chuan are young, and the problem is probably here." Xue Weixiang started to discuss this issue with Liu Yulian, the women's federation cadre in this village. Liu Yulian told him that the women in Qiaomai Chuan Village could not be mobilized because the older women did not allow the younger women to participate in social activities, so the younger women were sulking and not working in the fields.
    The next day, Xue Weixiang called a meeting of women. He first explained that there were many tasks at hand, and the men were too busy, so the women should participate in agricultural labor. The young people were silent, and several older women said vaguely: "It's good to go to the fields, as long as the young people are willing!" Xue Weixiang said directly: "Auntie, the young people are willing to go to the fields, and the young people are also willing to live a better life. The reason why the young people don't go to the fields now is because the old people don't let them come out to study. Young people studying is not like some people think they want to grow wings and fly. Literacy is a good thing. Take yourself as an example. Because you are illiterate, you don't know much. It is very convenient for young people to read a letter or a newspaper to their families after they are literate. Old people can know things outside. You see, which one is more cost-effective..."
    Before Xue Weixiang finished speaking, some older women couldn't hold back their breath. Their faces were red and white, but they were thinking in their hearts: How did Lao Xue know these things... However, what people say is also reasonable. At this time, the young women also said: Lao Xue is right, as long as you don't say anything salty or light, we guarantee to go to the fields. When the old people heard what their daughters-in-law and daughters said, they also replied: That's how things should be done. Lao Xue has explained the truth thoroughly.
    Xue Weixiang "struck while the iron was hot," and called a meeting of party members and league members in the evening, mobilizing them to go back to persuade the old people in their families and mobilize their wives to take the lead in going to the fields. The next day, more than fifty women in the village went to the fields.

              ×　×　×
    Xue Weixiang has many advantages. He can care about the suffering of the masses, has the thoughts and feelings of sharing weal and woe with the masses, can deeply connect with the masses, and starts from the immediate interests that the masses are most concerned about and urgently need to solve, patiently educates the masses, mobilizes the masses, and gradually improves the ideological awareness of the masses; can work through the party branch and give play to the core role of the branch. He wholeheartedly serves the people, so he has achieved many successes in his work, so he is loved by the masses.

    落后区变成了先进区
    ——记中共浑源五区区委委员薛维祥的工作作风
    石效由、张长珍
    山西浑源县东部山地的一道山梁上，有几个名叫荞麦川、水沟、黄家坡、大石头岭等的小山村。过去，这些小山村因为长期缺乏县区的领导，所以农业生产都很落后。
    一九五二年春天，中共浑源县五区区委发现了这一情况，就派遣区委宣传委员薛维祥去领导这个地区的工作。不到两年光景，就使这个地区和其他地区一样热烈地开展了互助合作运动，荞麦川村的互助合作还成为全县互助合作运动的榜样；水沟、黄家坡两村有百分之九十以上的农户参加了互助合作组织，就是工作最差的乱岭关、大石头岭等村也都有了两个到三个的常年互助组。在互助合作中，山地的粗糙的耕作技术也有了改进。因此，这个地区的土地的产量就有了较显著的提高。以荞麦川来说，过去每亩土地平均产量还不到四斗，一九五二年就提高到五斗以上。一九五三年虽然遭受了各种灾害，但平均产量仍在四斗半左右。由于农业生产的提高，农民生活也就得到了改善。当地农民谈起这些变化来，除了感激共产党和人民政府的领导外，就都要特别提到区委委员薛维祥的工作成绩。
    为群众热爱的干部
    薛维祥初到荞麦川等村工作时，和某些干部一样，也是忙着开大会，作报告，因此群众和干部一天天跟他疏远起来。这时，薛维祥心里又委屈又苦恼。有一次薛维祥在沙圪坨村召开全小区支部教员会议，乱岭关的支部教员李维国就不来。薛维祥很生气，心想：李维国太不像话了。会一散，薛维祥饭也顾不上吃，一口气跑到乱岭关。当薛维祥找到李维国时，劈头一句就问：“别人都到会，你为什么不去？”李维国因为家里生活困难，心里正不好过，也生气地说：“老薛，你真不管人的死活，只知道叫我去开会，你不知道我家里还没有揭锅的呀（没有饭吃的意思），开完会你又不给我二斤莜面。”李维国说完了，硬着头皮等薛维祥批评。薛维祥却只是低着头走来走去，一言不发，停了老半天才说了一句：“以后再谈吧！”他就匆匆地走了。这可弄得李维国莫名其妙。
    薛维祥回去后一夜没有睡着觉，就回忆起他自己当村干部时的一段情景来：“我当村干部时，家里也是现吃现闹的，但是有的区干部就不管这一套，给我布置了许多工作，弄得我几天不能生产，家里没有吃的……现在我自己当了区干部，也不关心干部和群众的生产和生活，怪不得村干部和群众越来越不愿意接近我了。”
    薛维祥想到这里很难过，但也很兴奋，李维国的两句话等于给他上了一堂课，使他心里亮堂起来了。
    从此薛维祥就关心干部、群众的生产和生活问题了。不仅在布置工作时，总要考虑到干部、群众的生产和生活问题，而且还注意学习群众路线的工作作风和工作方法。因此薛维祥和群众建立了深厚的感情。村里的群众和干部都称赞薛维祥是“老随老，小随小，男人能跟他呱啦（谈话）在一起，妇女也能跟他说上话。”这样就使薛维祥能够经常从群众中发现问题，并和群众一起来解决问题。
    就有这么一个故事：
    一九五二年夏天，薛维祥协助人民政府在三条彦村发放救济粮。在初步调查了受灾户的情况后，他们就提出了一个发放救济粮的灾民名单。在大会上宣布名单时，下边有人“唉！”的叹了口气。薛维祥心想：这里边一定有问题。于是他忙着解释：“这不是最后的名单，大家有意见还可以变更。”可是没人说话，薛维祥知道这个问题一时是解决不了的。散会后，薛维祥向好多人进行了调查，但没结果。薛维祥心想：这事恐怕和村干部有关，他就去找敢给干部提意见的唐大疤。薛维祥问唐大疤：“唐老大，你说这次发救济粮公道不公道？”唐大疤一口回答说：“公道，公道！”薛维祥又问：“有人不是有意见吗？”唐大疤这才不满地说：“哼！政府的事，有意见没意见怎么呀！”薛维祥说：“唐老大，人民政府发放救济粮是为了帮助受灾户渡过灾荒，搞好生产，救济粮就要发得公道。”唐大疤说：“是这么回事，但是办事的人不是这么办的。”唐大疤又说：“话说来很长，这就要说到前年的事情。前年人民政府登记土地时，村干部把全村的土地隐瞒了一部分。比如支部委员李有才本来有四十六亩土地，但只向人民政府报了八亩。隐瞒了土地，公粮的负担也就不公道了。你们虽然也看到这些‘重灾户’的庄稼被雹子打了，但没有看到他们山梁上还有一大片地的庄稼长得好好的……。”唐大疤越说，薛维祥心里越紧张，也越兴奋。群众的一声“唉！”，就使他发现了这样多的问题。
    要搞好生产就要搞好互助合作
    薛维祥懂得要搞好农业生产一定要搞好互助合作。不然，将来还是穷的穷，富的富，穷的多，富的少，又走到老路上去。薛维祥还懂得为了搞好互助合作，必须先在荞麦川村做出个样子来，然后再向水沟等村推广。
    虽然薛维祥在这些山村里已有很高的威信，大家都相信他是为大家办事的。可是当他提出互助合作问题后，却没有一个人表示要参加互助合作，还有人在背地里叨咕着：“组织起来到底行不行呢？光听说，没见过，恐怕还是各干各的好。”就是党员也不大热心于互助合作。于是薛维祥根据大家对于互助合作的反应，先在党内对党员进行教育，并批判了个别党员的资本主义思想。然后通过党员去说服教育一般农民。经过学习，党员觉悟提高了，有五个党员和十多个非党积极分子组织了三个临时互助组。在送肥工作结束后，薛维祥就帮助这些互助组总结了这段互助的成绩，使大家看到了互助的好处。这样，原来说“组织起来是胡闹”的人也改变了态度，开始关心互助组的生产情况了。以后，因为互助组下种、锄苗都能作在一般农民的前头，参加互助组的人也就越来越多。
    另一方面，薛维祥随时帮助各互助组解决问题，使它们巩固下来了。有一次，张连互助组为了记工的问题吵起架来，薛维祥赶忙和几个支部委员去了解情况。原来是这个组的雷平（党员）欠下组里二十多个工不还；另外，大家对现在的不合理的记工方法也有意见。这时，薛维祥就和支部委员根据“互利”原则，批判了雷平的不对，并要他还工。接着薛维祥又领导大家学习了报纸上介绍的“死分活评”的记工经验，建立了“日清月结”的齐工制度。这样，大家很满意。秋收时，大家又都着急收割自己的庄稼，各干各的。薛维祥和村支部委员会发现这个问题后，连夜和各互助组长商量解决的办法。人多智广，终于想出了“按活轮收、产量保证制”的方法，使互助组由刚开始显露涣散的状态又走向巩固。
    荞麦川村的互助合作的“样子”做起来了，薛维祥就向水沟、黄家坡、大石头岭、照壁等村农民宣传了荞麦川的互助合作经验。不久，这些村子也都三个两个的成立了互助组。以后，薛维祥又把荞麦川村互助组所碰到的问题和解决的办法，陆续传播到这些村子。一九五二年秋收时，薛维祥和各村支部又组织千余农民去参观荞麦川互助组秋收的情形，用荞麦川村“组织起来多打粮食”的活榜样，教育和鼓舞了各村的农民。使这些村的互助组又有了新的发展。
    发动妇女参加农业劳动
    一九五二年夏天，薛维祥领导互助合作生产的过程中，发觉妇女是一支很大的力量，发动起来，就能把农业生产搞得更好。这年——一九五二年夏天，刚好下了一场雹子，打坏了不少庄稼。薛维祥到三条彦村去领导群众改种时，发觉要做的事情很多，被雹子打坏了的庄稼地要改种，未打坏的庄稼要间苗，防洪坝也得修建。但是活多人少做不过来。薛维祥决定先在这个村发动妇女参加农业劳动，他就召开了一个妇女座谈会。座谈结果，只有几个妇女愿意参加农业劳动。这时，薛维祥就给大家算细账，讲利害。他说：“雹子打了的庄稼地要补种、改种，没打的庄稼要间苗，防洪坝要修建。活就是这么多，样样都得做，妇女不下地就做不完做不好。那末就要少打粮食，少打粮食全家都得困难。”经薛维祥这末一动员，又有一些妇女愿意参加农业劳动了。会后，薛维祥又通过积极分子对大家再一次地进行了说服教育。这样，全村能劳动的妇女都参加了农业劳动。修防洪坝中，妇女就出了一半力气。以后，薛维祥又用三条彦村组织妇女参加农业劳动的经验，把水沟、大石头岭、黄家坡等几个村的妇女也都动员下了地。
    荞麦川村的妇女虽然也参加了农业劳动，但是总是起来了，垮下去；垮下去，又起来；起来了，又垮下去……。
    一九五三年夏收时，薛维祥决心把这个村的妇女再动员起来，并巩固下去。薛维祥想到其他村妇女能够坚持参加农业生产的情景，就自问自答着：“大石头岭村的妇女工作为什么就搞得好？”“是妇女干部积极呀！”“这些妇女干部都是些什么人呢？”“三十岁以上的壮年，家庭没有约束呀！”
  “荞麦川的妇女干部多数是青年，问题恐怕就在这里边。”薛维祥就和这个村的妇联干部刘玉莲扯起这个问题来。刘玉莲告诉他荞麦川村的妇女发动不起来，是因为老年妇女不让青年妇女参加社会活动，因此青年妇女赌气不下地劳动。
    第二天，薛维祥就召集妇女开会，他首先说明眼前的活很多，男人忙不过来，妇女应参加农业劳动。年青人不作声，有几个老年妇女就搭讪着说：“下地好，只要年青人愿意就行！”薛维祥就直接了当地说：“老大娘，年青人是愿意下地的，年青人也愿意光景过得更好。现在年青人不下地，就因为老年人不让她们出来学习。年青人学习不像有人所想的是想安上翅膀飞。识字是件好事，拿你们自个说，因为不识字，懂的事情就不多。年青人识了字，给家里念个信，读个报都是挺方便的，老年人就能知道外边的事情，你们核计核计，那个上算……。”
    薛维祥还没说完，有些老年妇女就沉不住气了，脸上红一阵、白一阵，但是心里却在想：这些事，怎么叫老薛知道了……。不过，人家说的也是在理。这时青年妇女也说开了：老薛说得对，只要再不咸言淡语的说，我们保证下地。老年人听媳妇、女儿们这一说，也答了腔：事情就是这样办，老薛已把道理说透啦。
    薛维祥“趁热打铁”，晚上又召集党员、团员开会，动员他们回去说服家里的老人，并动员自己的妻子带头下地。第二天，全村就有五十余名妇女下了地。
              ×　×　×
    薛维祥的优点是很多的。他能够关心群众疾苦，有着和群众休戚相关的思想和感情，能够深入地联系群众，并且从群众最关心最迫切要求解决的切身利益上着手，用活的事实，耐心地教育群众，发动群众，逐步提高群众的思想觉悟；能够通过党的支部去工作，发挥支部的核心作用。他衷心地为人民服务，所以他在工作中获得不少成绩，所以他受到群众的热爱。
