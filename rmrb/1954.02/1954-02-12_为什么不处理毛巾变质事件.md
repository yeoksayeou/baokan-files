Why the Towel Deterioration Incident Hasn't Been Dealt With

    Editor's Note: After the "People's Daily" published the report "North China People's Supervision Committee, Together with Relevant Agencies, Thoroughly Investigates the Tianjin Rubber Factory's Shoddy Work and Use of Inferior Materials Incident" and the editorial "Lessons from the Deterioration of Military Rubber Shoes" on January 14th, readers from all over the country, including volunteer soldiers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, workers, students, and cadres, have successively written letters expressing extreme anger at the relevant illegal and derelict individuals and the illegal behavior of private factories in this incident. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government promptly and seriously deal with the matter. Reader Wu Dehua, in addition to supporting this newspaper's exposure of the military rubber shoe deterioration incident, revealed in more detail the incident in which the Beijing Purchasing Station of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region entrusted the Beijing Department Store to process 80,000 dozens of towels, of which 60,000 dozens deteriorated and rotted, and demanded a thorough investigation and handling. It is hoped that the relevant departments such as the Beijing People's Supervision Committee, the Beijing People's Court, and the Beijing Department Store will deal with the towel deterioration incident as soon as possible. Wu Dehua's letter is as follows:

    Comrade Editor: I believe that your newspaper's report on the military rubber shoe deterioration incident is very necessary. I have also encountered incidents as exposed in your newspaper and deeply regret that the people's valuable resources are being squandered by bureaucratic elements. In order to improve our work, I want to reveal an incident in which the Beijing Purchasing Station of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region (hereinafter referred to as the Purchasing Station) entrusted the Beijing Department Store to process 80,000 dozens of towels in Beijing, of which 60,000 dozens deteriorated and rotted.

    In October 1951, the Beijing Purchasing Station of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region entrusted the Beijing Department Store to process 80,000 dozens of towels in Beijing (worth approximately 4 billion yuan). The company accepted this task and signed a processing contract with the Beijing Private Weaving and Dyeing Industry Towel Joint Operation Group (consisting of approximately 100 factories), agreeing to complete the task from November 1951 to March 1952. After the towels were processed, the cadres of the Department Store and the Purchasing Station did not carefully inspect them and blindly put them into storage as "qualified products." Later, the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region distributed a portion of these towels (approximately 40,000 dozens) to the troops, and the rest continued to be stored in the warehouse. The deterioration of the towels was quickly discovered by the soldiers. A soldier from a certain unit sent a damaged towel back to the Purchasing Station and said, "The towel has deteriorated and can only be used for two or three days."
   "Such good things can only be used for two or three days, what a pity! You are too irresponsible for the state's resources!" After receiving this feedback, the Purchasing Station, together with the former Beijing Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Beijing Department Store, organized a group to the warehouse of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region. They opened six packages (25 dozens per package) of towels based on the order of entry into the warehouse and different storage locations, and extracted 22 towels from different factory names and sent them to the China Textile Company for inspection. The inspection results showed that only three towels had a breaking strength (the standard for towel firmness, generally 40 pounds) of 40 pounds or more, while the rest were below 36 pounds, with the lowest being only 24 pounds. The inspection conclusion was that deteriorated towels accounted for 76.61% of the total. This was an incident caused by state workers treating military supply tasks with an extremely irresponsible attitude and giving manufacturers loopholes to exploit.

    After this incident occurred, the Purchasing Station and the Beijing Department Store did not jointly study how to recover the losses from the processing manufacturers, but instead blamed each other and shirked responsibility. Finally, the Beijing Department Store admitted that it had a greater responsibility (because it signed the contract with the processing factories and was directly responsible) and was willing to compensate the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region for the losses. The two parties signed an agreement in November 1952: First, the Beijing Department Store would compensate the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region for 23.39% of the price of the towels that had already been issued, to make up for the losses of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, totaling 519.41 million yuan. Second, all the remaining towels in the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region's inventory would be returned to the Beijing Department Store, and the company would convert them into cash for the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region at the original price. The Beijing Department Store sold the returned deteriorated towels as defective products, incurring a total loss of 697.15 million yuan. Combining the two items, the company suffered a total loss of 1.21656 billion yuan.

    Why did this batch of towels deteriorate and rot? Inspection confirmed that the main reason was that the manufacturers engaged in serious shoddy work and deception in the bleaching process of the towels. First, the manufacturers' production equipment was not good, so the volatility of the bleaching powder was small, and the towels were not easily bleached. In order to cheat for profit, the manufacturers added excessive bleaching powder during bleaching. Excessive bleaching powder damaged the cotton yarn fibers, causing the towels to lose their firmness. Second, after bleaching, the manufacturers did not even wash the towels with clean water, and the towels still contained a lot of bleaching powder impurities. Over time, the towels rotted. Third, most of the towels were allowed to freeze-dry by the manufacturers. After freeze-drying, they still contained a considerable amount of moisture, and they became moldy when the weather was hot. In order to make a profit, these manufacturers blindly undertook the processing task, and after undertaking it, they did not work conscientiously, which affected military supplies and caused such a large loss to the state's resources.

    The Beijing Department Store was responsible for signing the contract and inspecting and accepting the finished products for the processing of this batch of towels. The deterioration of this batch of towels was also the result of the company's bureaucracy. The company had two years of experience in supporting the production of private towel factories in Beijing. The company knew the technical and equipment conditions of private factories in Beijing. However, the company did not consider it and signed the contract; after the contract was signed, it did not conduct inspections. The company was also very sloppy when inspecting the finished products. The towels delivered by the manufacturers had a heavy bleaching powder content and a strong odor (when the staff of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce inspected the warehouse of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region, they casually shook out a lot of bleaching powder when they took out a towel), which proved that too much bleaching powder was added; many towels were yellow in some areas and white in others, which proved that they were not washed clean and were unevenly turned over. These situations were enough to prove the manufacturers' shoddy work, but they did not attract the attention of the company's inspection personnel! What is even more intolerable is that because there were Purchasing Station staff assisting in the inspection, the company's inspection personnel held the attitude of "as long as the Purchasing Station wants it, it's fine" and abandoned the responsibility of inspection. As a result, a large number of deteriorated towels were mixed into the state warehouse. It can be seen that those inspection personnel have lost the basic qualifications as state working cadres.

    The Beijing Purchasing Station of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region also did not pay enough attention to this task and simply relied on the Department Store. Although the station sent inspection personnel, they did not find so many deteriorated towels. The station stored this batch of deteriorated towels for several months without discovering it, and then sent most of them to the soldiers. It was not until the soldiers reported it that they realized that this batch of towels had deteriorated. It can be seen that they were also extremely irresponsible!

    The result of this incident: The Beijing Department Store lost more than 1.2 billion yuan and could not be reimbursed (because the superior company did not recognize it), so it had to let it remain on the books. For more than a year, not only has it tied up state funds, but the interest for more than a year is also considerable! Also, because the Beijing Private Weaving and Dyeing Industry Towel Joint Operation Group has been dissolved, the company has difficulty recovering losses from the relevant manufacturers, so it sent a complaint to the Beijing People's Court, but there has been no response to date. The relevant derelict personnel of the company have been "criticized" several times and are still working as before. The company only accepted one "lesson" from this incident: "Military supply tasks are too troublesome and the responsibility is too great. We will never dare to undertake military supply tasks again!" The Purchasing Station entrusted the company to process towels again in February last year, and gloves in December last year, but both were rejected by the company. What is even more strange is that although the state suffered such a large loss, the former Beijing Bureau of Industry and Commerce did not deal with this incident, but only reported the situation to the China Department Store, the Central Ministry of Commerce, and the Beijing People's Supervision Committee. And these agencies did not deal with it either. Why?

    From this incident, these agencies still have disregard for state property and serious bureaucratic style. It has been a year and a half, and this incident has not been given the due treatment, which is really intolerable. In order to be responsible for the state's resources and to correct the bureaucratic style, I demand that the relevant agencies conduct a thorough inspection of this incident and deal with it seriously.
                                                                                                                                                                                    Wu Dehua

    为什么不处理毛巾变质事件
    编者按：一月十四日本报刊登了“华北人民监察委员会协同有关机关彻查天津橡胶厂偷工减料事件”的报道和“军用胶鞋变质事件的教训”的社论以后，各地读者，包括志愿军战士、解放军战士、工人、学生和干部等相继来信，对该事件的有关违法失职分子和私营工厂的违法行为表示极大愤怒，一致要求人民政府迅速严肃处理。读者巫德华来信除拥护本报揭发军用胶鞋变质事件外，更详细地揭发了华北军区后勤部北京采购站委托北京市百货公司加工毛巾变质腐朽的事件，并要求彻查处理。希望北京市人民监察委员会、北京市人民法院和北京市百货公司等有关部门对毛巾变质事件尽快处理。巫德华来信如下：
    编辑同志：你报对军用胶鞋变质事件的报道，我认为非常必要。我也曾经遇到如你报所揭发的事件，深深痛惜人民的宝贵资财被官僚主义分子蹧蹋掉。为了改进我们的工作，我要揭发一件华北军区后勤部北京采购站委托北京市百货公司加工八万打毛巾，其中六万打变质腐朽的事件。
    一九五一年十月，华北军区后勤部北京采购站
  （以下简称采购站），委托北京市百货公司在北京加工毛巾八万打（约值四十亿元）。该公司接受了这一任务，即和北京市私营织染业毛巾联营组（约一百多家工厂组成）签订了加工合同，约定从一九五一年十一月到一九五二年三月完成任务。毛巾加工完成，百货公司和采购站的干部没有认真验收，即盲目作为“合格品”入库。以后，华北军区后勤部把这批毛巾的一部分（共约四万打）发到部队去，其余的继续保存在仓库里。毛巾发到战士手里，变质的情况很快被发现了。某部一战士寄回一条残破毛巾给采购站，并说：“毛巾变质，只能用两三天”，
   “这样好的东西，只能用两三天，太可惜了！你们对国家资财太不负责任了！”采购站接到这个反映，和前北京市工商局、北京市百货公司共同组织小组到华北军区后勤部仓库，依据入库先后和存放位置不同的毛巾打开六包（每包二十五打），并依据不同厂名抽出二十二条毛巾送到中国花纱布公司检验。检验结果：耐破力（即毛巾坚固的标准，一般毛巾耐破力标准是四十磅）达到四十磅以上的只有三条，其余都在三十六磅以下，最低的只有二十四磅。检验结论：变质毛巾占总数百分之七十六点六一。这是国家工作人员以极不负责的态度对待军需任务、给厂商钻了空子所造成的事件。
      这一事件发生之后，采购站和北京市百货公司不是共同研究如何向承当加工的厂商追回损失，而是互相埋怨，互相推诿责任。最后北京市百货公司承认自己责任比较大（因为他们和加工工厂签订合同，负直接责任），愿意赔偿华北军区后勤部的损失。双方在一九五二年十一月签订协议书：第一、华北军区后勤部已发出的毛巾，由北京市百货公司按价赔偿百分之二十三点三九，弥补华北军区后勤部的损失，计五亿一千九百四十一万元。第二、华北军区后勤部库存剩余毛巾，全部退给北京市百货公司，并由公司按价折款给华北军区后勤部。北京市百货公司把退回来的变质毛巾当残品出售，共损失六亿九千七百一十五万元。两项合并计算，该公司共损失十二亿一千六百五十六万元。
    这批毛巾为什么变质腐朽呢？检查证实，主要原因是厂商在毛巾的漂白制造过程中有严重的粗制滥造、偷工欺骗行为。第一，厂商的生产设备不好，以致漂白粉的挥发性小，毛巾不容易漂白。厂商为了骗取利润，进行漂白时滥加漂白粉。漂白粉加得过度，破坏了棉纱纤维，便使毛巾失去坚固性。第二，厂商进行漂白以后，竟然不用清水洗净，毛巾里还含有很多漂白粉杂质，日久变化，毛巾腐朽。第三，大部分毛巾是厂商任其冻干的，冻干以后还含有相当大的水分，天热还潮，毛巾霉烂。这批厂商为了利润，竟然盲目承当加工，承当以后又不老老实实进行工作，以致影响了军需，又使国家资财遭受这样大的损失。
    北京市百货公司负责这批毛巾加工的签订合同和成品检查、验收工作。这批毛巾腐朽，同时也是该公司的官僚主义的结果。该公司扶植北京私营毛巾工厂生产，已经有两年经验。北京私营工厂的技术、设备等条件，该公司是知道的。但该公司竟没有考虑，就签订了合同；合同签订后，又没有进行检查。该公司验收成品时，也非常马虎。厂商所交毛巾，漂白粉很重，气味很大（工商局工作人员到华北军区后勤部仓库检查时，随便拿出毛巾一抖，即抖出很多漂白粉），证明漂白粉加得过多；不少毛巾是黄一片、白一片的，证明漂洗未净，翻倒不匀。这些情况足能证明厂商的粗制滥造，竟然也没有引起该公司验收人员的注意！更令人不能容忍的，是因为验收时有采购站工作人员协助，该公司验收人员便抱了“只要采购站愿要就行”的态度，放弃验收的责任。于是，大批变质毛巾混入国家仓库。可见那些验收人员已经丧失了作为国家工作干部的起码条件。
    华北军区后勤部北京采购站，对这一任务也不够重视，只是单纯地依赖百货公司。该站虽然派出验收人员，对这样多的变质毛巾竟然没查出来。该站把这批变质毛巾储存了几个月没有发现，又把其中大部分发到战士手里，直到战士反映了，才知道这批毛巾变质。可见也是极不负责任！
    这一事件的结果：北京市百货公司损失了十二亿多元，无法报销（因为上级公司不承认），只好让它停留在账面上。一年多了，不但积压了国家资金，就是一年多的利息也是可观的！又因为北京市私营织染业毛巾联营组已经解散，该公司向有关厂商追回损失有困难，遂向北京市人民法院送了一个状子，但是直到现在没有回音。该公司的有关失职人员，被“批评”了几次，仍照老样子在工作。该公司从这一事件中只接受了一个“教训”：“军需任务太麻烦，责任太大，以后再也不敢承当军需任务了！”采购站在去年二月又委托该公司加工毛巾，去年十二月委托加工手套，都被该公司拒绝了。更奇怪的，是国家遭受这样大的损失，前北京市工商局对这一事件却不作处理，只把情况反映给中国百货公司、中央商业部和北京市人民监察委员会。而这些机关也不作处理。为什么？
    从这一事件来看，这些机关现在也还有着漠视国家财产和严重的官僚主义作风。一年半了，这一事件还没得到应有的处理，实在令人不能容忍。为了对国家资财负责，为了纠正官僚主义作风，我要求有关机关对这一事件进行彻底检查，并严肃处理。
