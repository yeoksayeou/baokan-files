    In my year or so of leading the school work at Beijing No. 35 Middle School, I have deeply realized what a glorious undertaking it is to cultivate a new generation with consciousness, knowledge, and sound physique. Every time thousands of lively and lovely students stand before me, I am always filled with excitement and pride.

    I study together with the teachers. Every time the teachers come down from the classroom and walk into the teaching and research office, I also bring my documents and notes to participate in their study. They quietly read the documents, or bury themselves in writing notes, or chat about problems. They recognize that educators must first be educated; to cultivate the next generation with new ideas and new qualities, they must first possess new ideas and new qualities themselves.

    At the beginning of their studies, the faculty and staff were not without difficulties. Many felt that their political level was not high, and they were busy with their work. I enlightened everyone's interest and enthusiasm for learning, and asked them to develop the habit of learning. At the beginning of each new study, I would talk to the teachers about the significance, methods, and steps of learning, so that everyone would pay attention to learning and master learning methods; I would also give guidance reports to teachers based on the difficult problems in learning. When there were difficult problems, I would also find comrades to study them together, or ask the higher authorities for instructions to clarify the problems. After studying the general line, the teachers launched a wave of enthusiasm for loving students and loving their work. When I saw the progress of the teachers, I felt unspeakably happy!

    I often approach the teachers and slowly get to know them. I feel that each of them is amiable, because "the teacher's world outlook, his conduct, his life, and his attitude towards every phenomenon influence all students in this way or that way" (Kalinin). I often talk to teachers through work and solicit their opinions. Sometimes I consult with teachers three or five times for a problem. They also enlightened me and helped me find solutions to problems. The teachers are constantly making progress. An old teacher who used to glare at and get impatient with students last semester is now able to treat students patiently and live with them often; a teacher who used to think that students with poor foundations were "hopeless" has helped a student who had been held back for four years to move up a grade through extracurricular tutoring; a new teacher who lacked experience has taught well with the help of comrades. Some teachers have studied the new textbooks for each grade of the undergraduate course, and some teachers have patiently tutored dozens of students with poor grades, guiding their homework. Many outstanding teachers have emerged in the work of improving teaching. Many teachers have been able to flexibly grasp new teaching methods and improve the methods of checking and correcting homework; some teachers have improved the methods of assigning homework, and some teachers have created many methods for review lessons.

    Young students are very lovely. When you see a student's new qualities grow up, when you see your students achieve better grades each time, when you hear a student answer your questions fluently and completely, you feel as happy and proud as a worker sees his excellent products and a farmer sees a good harvest. I wore a red scarf to participate in the Young Pioneers' squadron meeting. I said to them, "The motherland is like a big garden, and you are the beautiful flowers in the garden. The Party shines on every flower like the sun. Soon, these flowers will bear rich fruits."

    The students actively learn from the examples of young heroes in our country and the Soviet Union. The heroic images and patriotic behaviors of Huang Jiguang, Qiu Shaoyun, Zoya, Matrosov, Oleg, etc., have inspired their enthusiasm for learning and loving the collective, and made them understand: "One should live in such a way that your existence makes others live better." Under the guidance of the homeroom teacher and the help of the team, the students held many lively and educational class meetings. Through the activities of these class meetings, the students' spirit of collectivism and the habit of consciously abiding by discipline were gradually cultivated.

    Students respect and love their teachers. They often give their teachers precious gifts. They send New Year's greetings to teachers, write letters of appreciation... A language teacher taught while sick. When the students found out, they all stood up and asked him to rest, sent someone to take him back, and quietly reviewed the lesson themselves; a math teacher was sick, and when he fell asleep at night, the students covered him with their own quilts. All this encouraged the teachers and made them love the education cause and love the students even more. One teacher said in his summary: "Every time I enter the classroom and step onto the podium, when I see the children's smiling faces, my heart is filled with excitement and joy."

    The spirit of unity and friendship among the students is growing. A student in the first year of high school was sick, and the whole class cared for him, took turns to visit him, sent him food, and wrote him letters of appreciation; when he recovered, the whole class welcomed him with joy, some helped him copy notes, and some tutored him, so that he achieved excellent grades.

    I love my career, and for the sake of the young generation, I am willing to dedicate all my strength.

    为了培养新的一代
  　温寒江
    在北京第三十五中学一年多来的学校领导工作，使我深深地体会到培养有觉悟、有知识、体魄健全的新的一代是何等光荣的事业。每当上千活泼可爱的学生站在我面前时，我总是带着一种兴奋和骄傲的情感。
    我和教师们一起学习。每次教师们从课堂下来，走进教研室时，我也带着文件、笔记，参加教师的学习。他们安静地阅读文件，或埋头写笔记，或漫谈着问题。他们认识到：教育者必须先受教育；要培养具有新思想、新品质的下一代，必须自己先具备新思想和新品质。
    教职员在开始学习时不是没有困难的，许多人感到自己的政治水平不高，工作又忙。我就启发大家的学习兴趣和积极性，要求大家养成学习的习惯。每当新的学习一开始，我给教师们讲学习的意义、方法和步骤，使大家重视学习，掌握学习方法；又根据学习中的疑难问题，向教师做辅导报告。有了困难问题，我还找同志们一起来研究，或向上级请示，把问题弄清楚。学习了总路线，教师们掀起了热爱学生、热爱工作的热潮。当我看到教师们的进步时，我心里真有说不出的愉快！
    我常接近教师们，慢慢地熟悉他们。我感到他们每一个人都是可亲的，因为“教师的世界观，他的品行，他的生活，他对每一现象的态度都这样或那样影响着全体学生”（加里宁语）。我往往通过工作同教师们谈话，征求他们的意见。有时为了一个问题三番五次地同教师商量。他们也启发我，使我找到了解决问题的办法。教师们不断在进步着，一个上学期对学生还是瞪眼、发急的老教师，这个学期已能耐心地对待学生，并且和学生经常生活在一起了；一个过去认为基础不好的学生是“不可救药”的教师，通过课外辅导使一个留级四年的学生升级了；一个缺乏经验的新教师，在同志们帮助下把课教好了。有的教师研究了本科各学年的新教材，有的教师耐心地为几十个成绩不好的学生补习功课，指导作业。在改进教学工作中涌现了许多优秀教师。不少教师已能灵活地掌握新的教学方法，改进检查批改作业的方法；有的教师改进留作业的方法，有的教师创造了许多复习课的方法。
    青年学生是很可爱的。当你看到一个学生的新的品质成长起来的时候，当你每一次看到你的学生获得更优良的成绩的时候，当你听到一个学生流俐地、完满地回答了你的问题的时候，就像一个工人看到了自己的优良的产品、农民看到了丰收一样地感到愉快和骄傲。我戴着红领巾参加了少先队的中队会，我对他们说：“祖国像一个大花园，你们是花园里艳丽的鲜花，党像阳光一样地照着每一朵花，不久，这些花就要结出丰富的果实来。”
    学生们积极学习我国和苏联青年英雄的榜样。黄继光、邱少云和卓娅、马特洛索夫、奥列格等的英雄形象和爱国行为，鼓舞了他们爱学习、爱集体的热情，使他们懂得：“一个人应当这样生活，由于你的生存使别人生活得更加美好。”在班主任的指导和团队的帮助下，学生们举办了许多生动的富有教育意义的班会。通过这些班会的活动，逐步地培养了学生集体主义的精神和自觉地遵守纪律的习惯。
    学生尊敬老师，热爱老师。他们常常把自己珍贵的礼物送给教师。他们给老师贺年，写慰问信……，一个语文课教师带病上课，学生发觉以后都站起来请他休息，派人把他送回去，自个安静地温课；一个数学教师病了，夜里当他睡着时同学用自己的被子给盖上。这一切都鼓舞了教师们，使他们更加热爱教育事业，热爱学生。一位教师在总结中说：“每当我进入教室踏上讲台，看见孩子们的笑脸时，内心里充满了兴奋和愉快。”
    同学们团结友爱的精神在成长着。高中一年级有一个同学病了，全班都关心他，轮流着去看他，给他送饭，给他写慰问信；他病好时，全班都以愉快的心情来欢迎他，有的帮助抄笔记，有的给他补习功课，使他取得了优良的成绩。
    我爱自己的事业，为着年青的一代，我愿献出我的一切力量。
