    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st. The Guangdong Provincial Government and Guangzhou Municipal Government, along with representatives from all walks of life, held a Spring Festival troop慰问大会 (comfort and appreciation meeting) in Guangzhou on the afternoon of January 31st to express their regards to the People's Liberation Army's Central-South Military Region and the 4th Field Army's troops stationed in South China's land, sea, and air forces.

    Feng Baiju, Vice Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government, and Zhu Guang, Vice Mayor of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting. They pointed out that the People's Liberation Army stationed in South China not only steadfastly defends the southern part of the motherland but also dispatched a large number of outstanding cadres to participate in land reform in Guangdong Province and democratic reform of the coastal fishing industry. This made a significant contribution to Guangdong Province's timely conclusion of social reform and full-scale transition to economic construction. To thank the People's Liberation Army, the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Governments have launched a Spring Festival troop慰问 (comfort) movement this year to educate the people to further support and assist the People's Liberation Army and to love and respect the families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary veterans, and demobilized and transferred soldiers.

    Qiu Huizuo, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Central-South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, delivered a reply at the meeting. He represented the military region's troops in accepting the慰问 (comfort) from the people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City and expressed his heartfelt gratitude and respect. He said: In addition to actively supporting the policies of the Communist Party and the state, abiding by government laws and mass discipline, saving the motherland's resources, and supporting national economic construction, we must make the greatest effort to consolidate the national defense of southern China, always be vigilant against enemy harassment and sabotage, and strive to build our army into a regularized and modernized national defense force, so that we can more confidently safeguard national security and world peace, allowing the people of the whole country to work on production and construction with peace of mind, and make our country richer and better day by day.

    After the meeting, the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Governments and representatives from all walks of life jointly held a banquet to entertain the leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Central-South Military Region and the 4th Field Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Guangzhou.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st. Before the Spring Festival, the people of Guangzhou actively wrote letters to express their regards to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in various parts of South China. As of January 29th, the South China Spring Festival Troop慰问 (comfort) Committee had received more than 12,000 letters of慰问 (comfort).

    Workers in factories across the region reported in their letters to the soldiers their achievements on the production front over the past year and pledged to learn from the noble qualities of the People's Army, overcome difficulties, and complete and over fulfill this year's production tasks to create more wealth for the country. The workers in the repair workshop of the state-owned Guangzhou Xicun Cement Plant said in their慰问 (comfort) letter that they had repaired a raw material mill that had not been repaired for more than 20 years, saving the country 600 million yuan, and expressed their intention to continue learning advanced experience and further increase production. Advanced producers at the state-owned Guangzhou General Machinery Factory reported in their letters that they had invented and manufactured a jacket for the 1,000-ton jack tool, increasing production efficiency sevenfold. Women enthusiastically expressed their love for the People's Army in their letters. All the staff of the Beiqu Workers' Nursery in Guangzhou City also attached photos of the children from the nursery to their letter to the People's Liberation Army. Returned overseas Chinese and returned distressed overseas Chinese in Guangzhou City confided in the soldiers in their letters as if writing to their loved ones about their painful lives overseas and the persecution they had suffered. Huang Zhenqiu, a distressed overseas Chinese returnee from Malaya, wrote in his letter: After being persecuted, we returned to the embrace of the motherland and received spiritual comfort and material assistance, feeling infinite warmth and happiness. You are not only the defenders of the people of the motherland and the defenders of world peace, but also the saviors of our distressed overseas Chinese. Many overseas Chinese and distressed overseas Chinese expressed their deep gratitude in their letters of慰问 (comfort). They said that being able to study and work happily in the motherland today is inseparable from the heroic struggle of the People's Army. They pledged to join the people of the motherland in the future to work hard to participate in the construction of the motherland.

    Residents on the water in the Pearl River area also wrote many letters of慰问 (comfort). In their letters of慰问 (comfort), they reported on the gradual improvement of their lives and the general election work in Guangzhou City, promising to actively participate in the general election and do a good job in preferential treatment work.
