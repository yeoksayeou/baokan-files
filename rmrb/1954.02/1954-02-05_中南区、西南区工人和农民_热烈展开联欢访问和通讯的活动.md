    Workers and Peasants in Central South and Southwest China
    Enthusiastically Launch Activities of Joint Celebration, Visits, and Communication
    [Report from this newspaper] Workers and peasants in various provinces and cities of the Central South region have recently enthusiastically launched activities of mutual visits, joint celebrations, and communication. Approximately over a thousand agricultural labor models, agricultural production cooperative chairmen, mutual aid group leaders, and farmer representatives have visited the Han River Iron Bridge construction site, Daye Steel Plant, Huaxin Cement Company, Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory, and textile, oil pressing, and farm implement manufacturing factories in cities such as Wuhan, Kaifeng, Anyang, and Shashi. Workers from factories like Daye Steel Plant, Yubei Yarn Factory, Jiujiang Xingzhong Textile Factory, and the No. 1 Power Plant of Wuhan Metallurgy and Electricity Bureau have also visited nearby rural areas. Many famous industrial labor models and agricultural labor models have exchanged letters, encouraging each other to work hard in production.
    Workers and peasants in various parts of the Central South region have shown great enthusiasm in their visits, joint celebrations, and communication activities, deepening their mutual understanding. Workers at the Yubei Yarn Factory warmly received farmers from Guo Wangdu Village who came to visit the factory, and subsequently visited Guo Wangdu Village themselves. The farmers of Guo Wangdu Village carried the thirty-six banners awarded to them by the government and greeted the workers outside the village. The Daye Steel Plant Trade Union specially screened movies in the suburbs for the farmers. When workers from the Wuhan Fuxin Flour Mill went to the countryside for visits, medical personnel accompanied them to treat farmers. Farmer representatives were very excited when they visited the Han River Iron Bridge construction site and saw large machines they had never seen before. Zeng Zhaoshu, an agricultural labor model from Wuchang County, even made a calculation: a steam hammer used for driving piles weighs 10,000 catties (the hammerhead) and only requires two people to operate; a tamper used by farmers to repair dikes weighs 80 catties and requires four people to hold it and four people to pull it, and 125 tampers are only equivalent to the weight of one steam hammer, which would require 1,000 people to use it. Xu Xingdi, a female worker at the Yubei Yarn Factory in Henan, can watch 1,200 spindles alone, and the yarn she spins in a day would require 1,040 people to spin by hand. When farmer representatives visited the five major yarn factories in Wuhan, they saw that from cotton to woven cloth, many procedures were involved, but the workers cooperated closely and were very organized and orderly, unlike many production activities in rural areas where one person does everything from beginning to end, expending a lot of effort but still producing very little. These facts made the farmer representatives realize the benefits of machine production and organization, enhanced their enthusiasm for taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and they expressed their desire to produce more grain to sell to the state and strive to use machines to cultivate the land as soon as possible. During the joint celebrations and visits, workers and peasants thanked each other for their strong support and expressed their intention to further improve production. Song Yinsheng, a labor model from Lin Ying Township in the suburbs of Wuhan, excitedly told the workers that last year there was a drought, but thanks to the water pumps manufactured by the workers, they maintained their normal yield. Their mutual aid group has already sold the surplus grain to the state and is preparing to transform into an agricultural production cooperative. Their township's pumping station will also be established soon. Their mutual aid group is striving to produce 1,000 catties of grain per mu this year to support industrial construction. The workers of the No. 1 Wuchang Yarn Factory proposed a plan to guarantee a 9 percent increase in output and a 2.5 percent reduction in costs this year, to supply farmers with more, better, and cheaper cloth.
    The workers' hard work and great contributions to the country deeply moved the farmers and dispelled the misunderstandings that some farmers had about the workers in the past. When the farmers saw the workers at the Han River Iron Bridge construction site, working tirelessly day and night in shifts in the turbulent river to drive bridge piles during the dry season, regardless of the biting wind and snow; when they saw the workers at the Daye Steel Plant, enduring the scorching heat by the steel furnace and working diligently to produce more steel for the country; when they heard that the workers at the No. 1 Wuchang Yarn Factory created 100 million yuan of wealth for the country on average per worker last year, they dispelled their past misunderstandings that workers used machines for production, had easy jobs, high wages, and ate and dressed well. Everyone learned that workers made great contributions to the country and worked very hard, and they expressed their desire to learn from the workers' spirit of selfless dedication and hard work, and to improve agricultural production under the leadership of the working class.
    The joint celebration and visit activities inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of workers and peasants. Jia Shixiu, the chairman of the Shifo Temple Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qi County, Henan Province, heard that the Hua'an Oil Factory had suspended production for two or three months last year due to insufficient cottonseed when he visited the factory. After returning home, he sold 800 catties of cotton and 4,000 catties of cottonseed stored in the cooperative to the state. After selling 13,500 catties of surplus grain, the Zhou Yue'an mutual aid group in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, received a thank-you letter from Sun Linye, the director of the calcination workshop of the Xicun Cement Plant in Guangzhou, and they carefully calculated and decided to sell another 350 catties of grain to the state, and guaranteed to increase production by a quarter this year and sell 30,000 catties of grain to the state. When farmers from Guo Wangdu Village in Anyang City, Henan Province, visited the Yubei Yarn Factory, both sides proposed guaranteed plans for grain sales and production. Guo Wangdu Village completed its grain sales plan, exceeding the quota by more than 4,000 catties in three days, and the Yubei Yarn Factory also exceeded its 1953 production plan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 4th: Workers and peasants in cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming in the Southwest region have enthusiastically launched joint celebration and visit activities.
    Factories in Chongqing have formulated plans for the propaganda and education of the worker-peasant alliance. Many factories in the city have organized propaganda visiting teams to go to the countryside, and some factory propaganda teams and amateur troupes have also performed many plays for nearby farmers. Employees of the Southwest Silk Spinning Factory held a joint celebration with more than 600 nearby farmers and invited farmers to visit the factory. In Chengdu, worker representatives from more than thirty factories have visited farmers in the suburbs. More than 1,400 agricultural labor models and mutual aid group leaders from Longtan and Wannian districts in the suburbs of the city visited the Yuhua Yarn Factory and the Chengdu Textile Factory. On February 1, more than 200 industrial and agricultural labor models and representatives held a joint celebration and symposium, visited the industrial and agricultural production exhibition and advanced technology demonstration performances, and presented each other with gifts such as walking plows, bone meal, sugarcane, and vegetables; in the evening, 5,000 workers and peasants held a joint celebration at the city's Labor People's Cultural Palace. More than 3,400 rural cadres and activists who are studying in training classes in Changshou County also visited the Xinyou Yarn Factory and the Changshou Flour Mill.
    Mutual visits between workers and peasants have deepened their friendship. The farmers who visited the Chengdu Machinery Factory learned that an average worker in the factory creates 40 million yuan of wealth for the country a year, were deeply moved, and automatically criticized some of the incorrect views they had in the past about the lives of workers. After visiting the factories, the farmers of Changshou County in Sichuan Province thought of the chemical fertilizers, new farm implements, and the pumping station being built in Duzhou Township in the county, and all expressed their gratitude: Without the leadership and assistance of the working class, it would be impossible for us to transition to a socialist society. The workers of Changshou County visited the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative, and were very excited to see that the cooperative members sold 18,000 catties of surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction after studying the general line.
    Through visits, workers and peasants have deepened their understanding of the worker-peasant alliance and realized the importance of mutual trust and support. After visiting the farmers, the workers of the Chengdu Machinery Factory stated that they would not disappoint the expectations of their peasant brothers and guaranteed to produce more new farm implements of good quality and low price to support the farmers. All the members of the Wu Xiangyun Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Sixth District of Chongqing wrote a letter to the Tang Ruifu team of the State-owned No. 102 Steel Plant, stating: To support the country's industrial construction, we have decided to increase grain production by 20 percent in 1954, of which rice production will increase by 5 percent.

    中南区、西南区工人和农民
    热烈展开联欢访问和通讯的活动
    【本报讯】中南区各省市的工人和农民，最近热烈展开相互访问、联欢和通讯活动。约有一千多名农业劳动模范、农业生产合作社社长、互助组组长和农民代表，分别到汉水铁桥工地、大冶钢厂、华新水泥公司、湘潭电机厂和武汉、开封、安阳、沙市等城市的纺织、榨油、农具制造厂参观。大冶钢厂、豫北纱厂、九江兴中纺织厂和武汉冶电业局第一发电厂等工厂的工人，也先后访问了工厂附近的农村。许多著名的工业劳动模范和农业劳动模范互相通信，勉励努力生产。
    中南区各地工人和农民在访问、联欢和通讯活动中，表现了很高的热情，加深了彼此之间的了解。豫北纱厂的工人热情地接待郭王度村的农民来厂参观，随后到郭王度村访问。郭王度村的农民扛着政府奖给他们的三十六面锦旗，到村外迎接工人。大冶钢厂工会专门到郊区放映电影给农民看。武汉市福新面粉厂的工人下乡访问时，有医疗人员一同前往替农民治病。农民代表在汉水铁桥工地参观时，看见了从未见过的大型机器，感到非常兴奋。武昌县农业劳动模范曾昭树还专门算了一笔账：一个打桩用的汽锤重一万斤（锤头），只需要两个人操纵；农民修堤的硪重八十斤，得四个人掌，四个人牵，而一百二十五张硪才抵得上一个汽锤的重量，那就得一千个人才能使用它。河南豫北纱厂的女工许杏娣一人能看一千二百个锭子，她一天纺的纱，如由手工纺，要一千零四十个人。农民代表在武汉市五大纱厂参观时，看见从棉花到织成棉布，要经过许多道手续，但工人们分工合作，紧密配合，非常有组织和有秩序，不像农村中的许多生产活动都是一个人从头干到底，费了很大劲，产量还是很少。这些事实都使农民代表认识到机器生产与组织起来的好处，增强了他们走互助合作道路的热情，他们表示要多打粮食卖给国家，争取早日用机器耕地。工人和农民在联欢访问时，互相感谢彼此大力支援，并表示要进一步努力搞好生产。武汉市郊区林英乡劳动模范宋银生兴奋地告诉工人说：去年天旱，因为有了工人制造的抽水机，保持了常年产量。他们的互助组已把余粮卖给国家，并准备转为农业生产合作社。他们乡里的抽水机站也快成立了。他们的互助组今年争取每亩田打一千斤粮食，支援工业建设。武昌第一纱厂的工人提出了保证今年提高产量百分之九，降低成本百分之二点五的计划，供应农民更多、更好、更便宜的布。
    工人们的艰苦劳动和对国家的重大贡献，深深地感动了农民，消除了过去少数农民对工人的误解。农民们看到汉水铁桥工地的工人，为了在枯水期间打好桥桩，不顾刺骨的风雪，不分昼夜地轮班在激湍的江中工作；看到大冶钢厂的工人为了给国家多生产钢铁，在炼钢炉旁忍受着炙人的高温，辛勤地劳动；听到武昌第一纱厂去年平均每个工人为国家创造了一亿元的财富，就消除了他们过去以为工人用机器生产、活路轻便，工资高、吃得好、穿得好等等误解。大家了解到工人对国家贡献大，劳动很辛勤，纷纷表示要学习工人的大公无私与艰苦奋斗的精神，在工人阶级领导下，搞好农业生产。
    联欢访问活动鼓舞了工人和农民的爱国热情。河南省淇县石佛寺农业生产合作社社长贾石秀参观华安油厂时，听说该厂去年因为棉籽不够，曾停工两、三个月，他回家后就将社里存的八百斤棉花与四千斤棉籽卖给了国家。广东省新会县周岳安互助组在卖出一万三千五百斤余粮后，收到了广州市西村水泥厂煅烧车间主任孙林业的感谢信，他们又精打细算，决定再卖三百五十斤粮食给国家，并保证在今年增产四分之一，卖三万斤粮食给国家。河南省安阳市郭王度村农民参观豫北纱厂时，双方都提出了售粮和生产的保证计划。郭王度村在三天内以超额四千多斤完成了售粮计划，豫北纱厂也超额完成了一九五三年生产计划。
    【新华社重庆四日电】西南区重庆、成都、昆明等市的工人和农民，已热烈展开联欢访问活动。
    重庆市各工厂已制定了关于工农联盟宣传教育的计划。市内不少工厂已组织宣传访问队下乡，有些工厂的宣传队和业余剧团并为附近农民演出了许多戏目。西南绢纺厂职工和附近六百多农民举行联欢大会，还邀请农民参观工厂。成都市已有三十多个工厂的工人代表访问市郊农民。市郊龙潭、万年两区的农业劳动模范、互助组组长等一千四百多人参观了裕华纱厂和成都纺织厂。二月一日，该市二百多名工业和农业劳动模范及代表等举行了联欢会、座谈会，参观了工农业生产展览会和先进技术示范表演，并互相馈赠了步犁、骨粉、甘蔗、菜蔬等礼品；晚间，五千名工人和农民又在市劳动人民文化宫举行了联欢晚会。长寿县正在训练班学习的三千四百多农村干部、农民积极分子等，也参观了新友纱厂和长寿面粉厂。
    工人和农民相互访问，加深了彼此之间的友谊。参观成都机械厂的农民，知道该厂一个工人平均一年为国家创造四千万元的财富，深为感动，自动批判了过去对工人生活的某些不正确看法。四川省长寿县的农民在参观工厂后，联想到他们在生产上用的化学肥料、新式农具以及该县渡舟乡正在修建的抽水机站等，都一致感激地表示：如果没有工人阶级的领导和援助，我们是不可能过渡到社会主义社会去的。长寿县的工人参观了前进农业生产合作社，看见该社社员在学习总路线后把一万八千斤余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设，也感到非常兴奋。
    经过参观、访问，工人和农民们都加深了对工农联盟的认识，了解到相互信任和支持的重要意义。成都机械厂的工人访问农民后，表示决不辜负农民弟兄的期望，保证生产更多的物美价廉的新式农具来支援农民。重庆市第六区伍祥云农业生产合作社全体社员，写信给国营一零二钢铁厂唐瑞福小组，表示：为支援国家工业建设，决定在一九五四年增产粮食百分之二十，其中水稻要增产百分之五。
