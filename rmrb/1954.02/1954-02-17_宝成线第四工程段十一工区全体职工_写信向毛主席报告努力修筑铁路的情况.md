To our respected Chairman Mao:

    Since you issued the instruction to "continue efforts to build the Tiancheng Railway" (Tiancheng Railway has been renamed Baoji-Chengdu Railway), hundreds of thousands of railway builders have responded to your call and launched a heroic battle towards the mountains and rivers of Sichuan. In our work, we encountered many difficulties. For example, when we first arrived, there was a shortage of grain and vegetables, and housing was insufficient. In particular, the mountain rocks here were harder than those encountered during the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and our drill bits would break after only a few strikes. However, when we remembered the arduous deeds of you leading the Red Army through this route in the past, we felt that these difficulties were nothing. If we lacked grain, we ate sweet potatoes and beans; if there were few houses, we slept under the eaves of the villagers' houses. Under the slogan of "Conquering extremely hard rocks and penetrating the Dabashan Mountains," everyone actively unleashed their creativity. Liao Haishan created a method to increase the hardness of drill bits; Li Zongde, Zhang Yunbing, and others took the lead in promoting the single-person drilling method, increasing the efficiency of drilling blast holes from three inches per person per day to five to six meters... Our strong will overcame all kinds of difficulties, and the stubborn mountains that had stood for thousands of years were blasted open by us.

    Respected Chairman Mao, in 1953, through the establishment of a responsibility system, red flag competitions, and the creation of model workers and meritorious deeds, our work zone overfulfilled the task you entrusted to us by 109.6 percent. We completed 870,000 cubic meters of earth and stone for the roadbed and installed 12,350 cubic meters of bridge culverts. The 41 rationalization proposals we put forward saved the country more than 22.8 billion yuan in wealth. In production, 94 labor models emerged. With the specific help of Soviet experts, we adopted new experiences such as the "segmental installation method for bridge culverts" and "mortar rubble masonry," reducing the cost of cement and stone materials. Today, more than 6,000 employees in our work zone are gathered here to celebrate these victories; we miss you, because these achievements are all due to your wise leadership.

    Respected Chairman Mao, under your education, and through the study of the general line, we have further seen the bright future of socialism. We understand that an early completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will greatly benefit the industrial construction of the Southwest and Northwest. Therefore, we have shouted the slogan "Race with the train and fight against time," braving the cold day and night, and are actively working hard to achieve the goal of opening the line to Majiaoba (in Zhitong County, Sichuan Province) before May this year.

    宝成线第四工程段十一工区全体职工
    写信向毛主席报告努力修筑铁路的情况敬爱的毛主席：
    自您发出“继续努力修筑天成路”（天成路已改称宝成路）的指示后，成千上万的筑路健儿响应了您的号召，齐向巴山蜀水展开了英勇的战斗。在工作中，我们遇到了不少困难。如初来时，当地粮食菜蔬缺乏，住房不够；特别是这里需要开凿的山石比修建成渝路时的坚硬，炮钎在石头上打不到几下就断了。但是，我们想起您过去领导着红军经过这条路时的艰苦事迹，就感到这点困难算不了啥。缺乏粮食我们就吃山芋、豆子，房屋少我们就睡在老乡的屋檐下。在“征服特坚石，凿穿大巴山”的口号下，大家积极地发挥了创造性。廖海山创造了增加炮钎硬度的办法；李宗德、张云炳等首先推广单人打眼法，打炮眼效率由每人每天打三公寸提高到五至六公尺……。我们坚强的意志战胜了各种困难，矗立了千百年的顽石大山被我们炸开了。
    敬爱的毛主席，在一九五三年经过建立责任制、红旗竞赛、创模立功等运动，我们工区超额完成了您交给我们的任务百分之一百零九点六。我们共完成路基土石方八十七万立公方、安砌桥涵一万二千三百五十立公方。我们提出的四十一件合理化建议，给祖国节省财富二十二亿八千多万元。在生产中涌现出九十四个劳动模范。在苏联专家的具体帮助下，我们采用了“桥涵分节安砌法”、“浆砌片石”等新经验，降低了水泥料石成本。今天，我们工区六千多职工在这里欢聚一堂，庆祝这些胜利；我们想念着您，因为这些成绩都是您的英明领导得来的。
    敬爱的毛主席，在您的教育下，经过总路线学习，我们进一步看清了社会主义的光明前途。我们明白，早一日修通宝成铁路，对西南、西北的工业建设有很大好处。因此，我们喊出了“和火车赛跑，同时间战斗”的口号，冒着日夜严寒，为今年五月前通车到马角坝（在四川省梓潼县境）而积极努力。
