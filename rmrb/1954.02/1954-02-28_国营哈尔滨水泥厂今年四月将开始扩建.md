    The state-owned Harbin Cement Plant will begin expansion this April. After the entire expansion project is completed by April next year, the plant's annual cement production will increase by 81% compared to the current annual production, which can meet the construction needs of fifty-one factories as large as the Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant.
    The expansion project of the state-owned Harbin Cement Plant is designed with reference to the plant's original equipment capacity and the utilization of buildings. According to the fact that the production capacity of the finished product workshop is greater than that of the sintering and raw material workshops, the capacity of the transporting machinery is relatively strong, and there is still room in the plant buildings, the designers plan to add only one rotary kiln, one raw material mill, and newly build one raw material warehouse, staff dormitory, substation, crane depot, and staff family dormitory, which can be quickly put into production. It is not necessary to add a large number of management staff and technical workers, and it is not necessary to build new factory buildings, transportation platforms, auxiliary workshops, and laboratories. During the expansion of the project, the normal production of the plant will not be affected, and the construction time and investment can also be saved by one-half compared with building a new cement plant.

    国营哈尔滨水泥厂今年四月将开始扩建
    国营哈尔滨水泥厂今年四月将开始扩建。全部扩建工程到明年四月完成后，该厂水泥的年产量要比目前的年产量增加百分之八十一，即可供建设五十一个像哈尔滨电机厂那样规模巨大的工厂建筑上的需要。
    国营哈尔滨水泥厂的扩建工程，是参照该厂原有的设备能力和建筑物的利用情况设计的。设计者们根据该厂制成车间生产能力大于烧成和原料车间，运搬机械能力较强，厂房尚有余地的情况，计划只要增添一个回转窑，一个原料磨和新建生料仓库、职工宿舍、变电所、吊车库、职工家属宿舍各一处，就可迅速投入生产，不必再增添大批管理工作人员和技术工人，不用新建厂房、运输站台、辅助车间和化验室等。在工程扩建期间，将不影响该厂正常生产，并且施工的时间和投资，也可比新建一个水泥厂节约二分之一。（新华社）
