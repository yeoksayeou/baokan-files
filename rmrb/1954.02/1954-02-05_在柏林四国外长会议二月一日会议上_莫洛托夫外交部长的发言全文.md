Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 2nd (via TASS): Molotov spoke at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on February 1, 1954. The full text is as follows:

We are beginning the discussion of the German question. In our agenda, this item is titled "The German Question and the Task of Guaranteeing European Security."

This Berlin Conference will be judged primarily by the outcome of the discussion on this question.

Only a decision on the German question that, not only in words but also in fact, conforms to the interests of safeguarding peace and European security will be of great significance to the people of Europe, including the German people themselves. Our decision must serve one main purpose: to safeguard European peace, and therefore to prevent the danger of the revival of German militarism.

Do the representatives of France, Britain, and the United States present here agree that German militarism should bear the primary responsibility for launching the First and Second World Wars? I hope they agree. Our task is to prevent a situation in which an aggressive German militarism can once again disrupt the peaceful life of Europe and launch a third world war.

The Soviet people often remember this. They cannot forget the incalculable sacrifices suffered by our people in the past. These sacrifices are far beyond what numbers and examples can describe. After attacking Czechoslovakia, Poland, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Yugoslavia, the Hitlerite gang attacked the Soviet Union. During those difficult years, the Soviet Union suffered particularly heavy losses.

How can we forget that, due to Hitler's aggression, 1,710 cities and over 70,000 villages across our country were completely or partially destroyed or burned down?

As everyone knows, if calculated in monetary terms, according to very incomplete figures, the direct losses caused by the German occupation on Soviet territory amounted to 128 billion US dollars. Detailed official figures in this regard have already been published. How can we forget that, due to the aggression of German militarism, approximately 7 million Soviet men and women died in the war or were cruelly abducted abroad? This is an irreparable loss for the Soviet Union. The people of other countries in Europe (and not only Europe) also suffered significant sacrifices. However, as everyone knows, the Soviet Union suffered the most severe losses and bore the main burden of opposing aggression and striving for a just peace. The Soviet government, expressing the deepest feelings and will of the Soviet people, believes it has a responsibility to make every effort to prevent another world war. It is precisely for this reason that it opposes all attempts to revive German militarism. Today, if anyone is helping to revive German militarism, he will bear the most serious responsibility for the fate of the world, and first and foremost, for the fate of the peoples of Europe.

What position does the Soviet Union take on the German question? Simply put, the Soviet Union's position is that we, the four countries of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, should base our actions on the basic principles of those common resolutions that we previously unanimously adopted. These principles state that peace must be safeguarded and the possibility of a resurgence of German militarist aggression must be prevented. These agreements stipulate that the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain must take joint action to help the German people rebuild their country in a democratic and peaceful manner. France later agreed to these resolutions. Although Mr. Bidault now frequently tries to distance himself from his relationship with these previously agreed resolutions, I believe that France needs these agreements no less than the Soviet Union.

We acknowledge that many provisions in the Potsdam Agreement are now outdated. However, the main purpose of these agreements remains entirely valid. The purpose of these agreements is that France, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States should work together to resolve the German question; and that we, these countries, should reach a consensus with the German people, that is, with the democratic forces in Germany, in order to prevent new wars in Europe.

The above-mentioned agreements of the four major powers point out a clear path for ensuring European security. If we work together according to these agreements of the four major powers to prevent the resurgence of German militarism, we can eliminate the main danger of another war in Europe, thereby constituting a serious obstacle to the planning and launching of another world war. If our four major powers refuse to take joint and concerted action and allow German militarism to revive, then no international agreement can give us sufficient guarantees to prevent another world war.

The German people, like the people of other countries, are equally concerned about all of this. We in Berlin are particularly aware of the serious consequences of war for the German people. Under the current circumstances, launching another world war would also create the danger of serious disasters such as a war in which Germans slaughter each other.

Our meeting is in a rather difficult situation. We are discussing the German question in Berlin without German participation.

The ministers of France, Britain, and the United States present here, using the opposition of the Adenauer government as an excuse, are unwilling to listen to the views of the government of the German Democratic Republic. They agree with the claims of those West German officials who insist that they can represent the will of the entire German people, although this is completely contrary to the facts. These self-satisfied West German officials are unwilling to sit at the same table and hold talks with the personnel of the government of the German Democratic Republic, who are in power entrusted by the vast majority of residents of East Germany, as evidenced by the democratic parliamentary elections held here and many everyday events. This proves the short-sightedness of the above-mentioned officials' political vision.

However, the Soviet delegation believes that it is possible to correct the errors that have already been made. We can take advantage of opportunities in the future to listen to the opinions of representatives from East and West Germany, even if it is only on some of the most important issues in the German question. This can also be done for the issues being discussed today.

The Soviet delegation believes that, first of all, it should be affirmed that the German question is primarily a matter for the German people themselves, a matter for the Germans themselves. The German people should not simply be the object of resolutions or the object of actions taken by other countries. Only they themselves, only the Germans themselves, can truly resolve the German question. Any other way of resolving the German question is unreasonable and unjust for the German people.

On the other hand, the situation created by the Second World War also makes it impossible for the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and the United States to avoid resolving this issue, nor can they take a passive, hands-off attitude toward this matter. Since the end of the war, they have had a particularly important responsibility to actively resolve the German question.

Of course, this only refers to the period before a peace treaty with Germany has been concluded. Once a peace treaty with Germany is concluded, Germany will immediately be able to stand among the equal European nations—it is our responsibility to finally make the conclusion of a peace treaty a reality. There is no doubt that Germany's high level of culture and developed peaceful economy will guarantee Germany a well-deserved place among the other major powers in the world.

However, before a peace treaty with Germany is concluded, our four countries should not act separately, but should act together so that a peace treaty with Germany can be concluded, ensuring that the German people restore the unity of their national state, and that our joint actions and the joint efforts of the peace-loving forces of the German people create conditions to ensure that a restored Germany will not become a new source of aggression in the future, but will become an equal member of the peace-loving European peoples' family. There is no doubt that if our four countries take joint action, and do not attempt to use part of Germany to turn some European countries against other European countries, then we can successfully resolve the German question. This would not harm the interests of any of the four countries, or harm the interests of any other peace-loving country. At the same time, from the point of view of guaranteeing the German people's own national rights and fundamental interests, this is also the best way to resolve the German question.

The plan to establish the so-called "European Defense Community" is pushing Germany onto another path. The political significance of these plans lies in the fact that the three countries, the United States, Britain, and France, are attempting to collude with the current officials of West Germany to form a military bloc to oppose the fourth country—the Soviet Union.

Currently, every effort is being made to drag West Germany into this anti-Soviet bloc, giving it the opportunity to revive German militarism. At the same time, this also means that the three Western countries are currently pursuing a policy of military cooperation with West German officials who openly hope to quickly obtain legal status for German militarism, rather than a policy of preventing the resurgence of German militarism.

It cannot be ignored that even the French government is now implementing this policy. It is certainly not an exaggeration to say that this apparently hopeless policy has aroused reasonable surprise among most people in Europe.

In order to find a basis for this policy of the French government, Mr. Bidault framed the issue in such a way that it seems that only the two formulas he proposed must be chosen between. What are these two formulas?

Here I quote Mr. Bidault's words at the January 25th meeting:

"It is important not to allow an isolated Germany to exist in the center of the continent, while also preventing the resurgence of any aggressive militarism. In this regard, there are possibly and only two formulas: one is forced control, and the other is union."

Thus, according to Mr. Bidault's speech, the possible options for Germany are either the "formula of forced control" (in another place he even talks about "indefinite control"), or the "formula of union." However, the union referred to here is a very special "union."

From what has been said above, Mr. Bidault interprets the Potsdam Agreement on Germany as a "formula of forced control." He frames the matter as if someone is attempting to force Germany to accept indefinite control by other countries. This interpretation is, of course, incorrect.

If the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany is not delayed indefinitely, and if preparations for a peace treaty are started as the Soviet Union has requested, then a peace treaty with Germany can be concluded without much delay. We have concluded peace treaties with other European countries, including a country like Italy. If the four foreign ministers no longer delay this matter, a peace treaty with Germany can also be concluded, and Germany can obtain true freedom in domestic and foreign affairs according to this treaty, a true freedom that the German people have long had the right to enjoy. Otherwise, the so-called freedom of Germany to live in a free environment is not convincing. It is not enough to just talk about freedom; the German people must finally be able to enjoy this true freedom.

On the other hand, Mr. Bidault wants to use the vague "formula of union" to achieve the goal of establishing the "European Defense Community," which, to put it bluntly, is to establish a Western European army with the participation of a revived German Wehrmacht. Thus, we have a very special "union," which, to put it bluntly, is a military bloc established by some European countries to oppose other European countries.

In other words, the framers of the "union" formula are not concerned about peace between European countries, are not personally consolidating peace, but are preparing for another most terrible war in Europe. It is surprising that some French representatives believe that what France needs is not a union with the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries, but a military bloc, even if it is only a union with part of Germany—a military bloc targeting the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, despite the fact that these countries are the most reliable bastions of peace and pan-European security, and hope to be reliable allies of France, who are concerned about preventing new wars.

Indeed, if we take the countries represented at this meeting, isn't it true that large parts of France and the Soviet Union were occupied by German militarists a few years ago? Isn't it true that France and the Soviet Union should understand that they have common interests in ensuring European security?

It must be admitted that if France and the Soviet Union maintain good relations, and do not go their separate ways but jointly seek reliable ways to ensure their external security, then, under the current circumstances, no one would dare to disrupt European peace, and European security could be guaranteed.

Differences in social systems should not, under any circumstances, be an obstacle, nor should they create an insurmountable obstacle to reaching an agreement guaranteeing the peaceful development of the two countries, an agreement that should be a reliable basis for lasting peace and security in Europe. This is possible if France and the Soviet Union work together to prevent the resurgence of German militarism.

The Soviet government is deeply convinced that such a policy would also be supported by the vast majority of the German people. France and the Soviet Union should not pursue isolated policies, but should strive to continuously strengthen Franco-Soviet relations, strive to create conditions for normal cooperation between the Soviet Union, France, and Germany, so that German militarists and revanchists are isolated in Europe and within Germany. Such a policy is disliked by German militarists, but they are only a small minority of power-holders in German society. The broadest masses of the German people will inevitably support this policy. Moreover, this will inevitably turn things in favor of lasting peace and European security in the end.

Mr. Bidault is enthusiastic about the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty concluded with West Germany. However, even within France, resistance to these treaties is growing. This is entirely understandable.

As everyone knows, the most enthusiastic supporters of the establishment of the West European army are US government officials. For them, this is a relatively simple matter, because the United States is not preparing to send its own troops to participate in the West European army.

Mr. Dulles said that the Soviet Union is worried that this new group (referring to the "European Defense Community") may pose a danger to the Soviet Union; in fact, this group seems to be laying Europe on a sound foundation, guaranteeing that Europe will be more prosperous, thereby making Europe stronger. As long as Europe also becomes more peaceful at the same time, there is no reason to worry.

This is how the Soviet Union is advised not to be afraid of the "European Defense Community." But there is a reservation here, which is the following prerequisite: as long as Europe becomes more peaceful. It is precisely this reservation that shows that Europe has not yet become peaceful, so the Soviet Union's concerns are not so unfounded.

There is also the question of how to understand Mr. Dulles's words: the "European Defense Community" seems to be laying Europe on a sound foundation and guaranteeing its prosperity. As everyone knows, only six countries, including Luxembourg, are joining the "European Group." As everyone also knows, there are more than six countries in Europe, but thirty-two. So, how can the six countries that make up this "group" lay the entire Europe, which has a total of thirty-two countries, on a sound foundation? Isn't this too arduous a task for these six countries?

The Bonn and Paris treaties are, in fact, only part of a huge American military plan. In this case, not only Luxembourg, but also France and Italy, are only seen as executors of foreign will and foreign plans.

The Bonn and Paris treaties are turning West Germany into the main bridgehead for planning new wars in Europe. Under this plan, West Germany will become the main military base for new aggression, but not the only military base. It merely expands the network of American military bases distributed across Europe, North Africa, the Near East, the Middle East, and the Atlantic islands. As everyone knows, the United States has military bases in Britain, West Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Norway, Malta, Iceland, Austria, Portugal, French Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Türkiye, Crete, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Aden, and other places. In addition to the US establishing a network of military bases on foreign territory, Britain has also established bases on foreign territory, and there are dozens of these bases. The US has established as many as eighty-two bases on the aforementioned foreign territories, according to incomplete statistics.

The United States has even concluded a special agreement with Franco's Spain. Hitler had to strive for such support in the past. So why shouldn't others make use of such a famous ally? Obviously, all of this, as well as the many newly built American military bases, and the Bonn and Paris treaties, are what Dulles had in mind when he spoke of laying Europe on a sound foundation and guaranteeing its prosperity. It is not difficult to see that this is not at all about laying Europe on a sound foundation, not at all about making it prosperous. The purpose of all this is to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. Therefore, we cannot but take this into consideration.

The matter is not limited to the purely military measures taken by the United States and Britain. Who doesn't know that, in addition to this, measures are being taken to undermine the economies and the welfare of the residents of, for example, the people's democratic countries.

In 1951, the United States promulgated a "Common Security Act" and, in accordance with this law, allocated 100 million US dollars to carry out various sabotage and subversive activities against the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, and the Soviet occupation zones of Germany and Austria. Because this practice by the United States aroused legitimate protests from many countries, the publicity of the above-mentioned "law" has been curtailed. Recently, there has been as little talk about this law as possible.

However, since 100 million US dollars were allocated in 1951 to carry out subversive activities in the people's democratic countries, it is clear that some funds were also allocated in 1952, 1953, and 1954. We do not know whether a total of 500 million or 1 billion US dollars were allocated in these years. However, there are considerable indications that the US dollars used to carry out subversive activities in the people's democratic countries are increasing steadily.

We could very well not talk about this if it were only an internal affair of this or that country. However, this is not the case.

We cannot ignore the fact that the American "Common Security Act" is first and foremost a factor in planning another war in Europe. Later amendments to this law indicate that the purpose of this law is not only to facilitate the planning of new wars in Europe, but also in Asia.

When we listened to Mr. Dulles's speech on Saturday, it seemed that his words were full of peace-loving intentions. Mr. Dulles directly advised us not to worry about the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. But on the other hand, it is unwise not to examine the facts. The materials I have just listed above are completely different compared to the verbal guarantees made by Mr. Dulles.

Recently, there has been endless promotion of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, which are opening the door to German militarism. The effective period of these treaties is several decades. Apparently, someone wants to tell us: stop thinking about concluding a peace treaty with Germany. We only need to have the governments of the six countries sign the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. Apparently, this is intended to replace a peace treaty with Germany.

However, the necessity of quickly concluding a peace treaty with Germany should not be underestimated. The lessons of the Treaty of Versailles should be taken seriously.

For a short period after the end of the First World War, people in the West believed that the Treaty of Versailles could solve the problem of guaranteeing European countries against the threat of the resurgence of German militarism and German aggression. The incompetence and shortsightedness of the framers of the Treaty of Versailles were soon exposed. Not only did the Treaty of Versailles fail to ensure European security, but it was one of the main preconditions for the Second World War. This was mainly because it was a predatory treaty for Germany, hated by the German people, and therefore inevitably suffered a shameful failure.

The Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty are no better than the Treaty of Versailles. This is mainly because these treaties are neither in line with the interests of ensuring European security nor in line with the interests of the German people. These treaties are merely appendages of the notorious North Atlantic military bloc.

According to the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty, West Germany will be a semi-occupied country, deprived of national sovereignty and diplomatic independence, for the next fifty years. We have been advised to establish this system throughout Germany, including its eastern part, at least until a peace treaty is concluded, as Mr. Bidault said today, while no agreement has been reached on the timing of preparing this treaty. But which German would voluntarily take this path? Even the Treaty of Versailles did not so rudely deprive the German people of their rights. No one can believe that the Germans living in West Germany would tolerate the following situation for an infinitely long period: they cannot independently and autonomously decide on their internal affairs, nor can they independently and autonomously decide on the issue of their diplomatic relations with other countries. How can we imagine the following situation: in a certain part of Germany, which is currently West Germany, the three Western countries—the United States, Britain, and France—can interfere in its internal life at any time, can declare martial law at will, and in short, act as the omnipotent masters of this part of Germany. If some officials in West Germany agree to this situation, this is by no means because, under today's forced submission, they are giving any serious consideration to the possibility of maintaining this situation for decades.

Therefore, the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty are built on sand and cannot last long. But under the specious pretext of establishing a West European army, they are actually indulging German militarists and revanchists, attempting to establish a new regular army in West Germany. According to the provisions of the Paris Treaty, twelve divisions will be established first. And then what? If we are not too naive, we will think about what will happen next. The time will soon come when German militarism, disregarding the interests of the German people, reveals its aggressive nature. We know that it will not stop halfway.

Once West Germany joins the "European Defense Community," it will openly embark on the road to reviving German militarism. As everyone knows, the peace-loving German Democratic Republic will not take this path. However, the implementation of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty will become an insurmountable obstacle to the unification of Germany, making it impossible for Germany to be reunified for a period of time.

There is another common point between the Bonn Treaty, the Paris Treaty, and the Treaty of Versailles: these two new treaties, like the Treaty of Versailles, have their blades pointed at the Soviet Union. Not everyone dares to speak frankly about this. However, we Soviet people were not mistaken in our assessment of the Treaty of Versailles at the time. We believe that we are not mistaken in our assessment of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty now, and in the corresponding conclusions drawn from this assessment.

We believe that the fate of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty will not be better than that of the Treaty of Versailles. Either the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty cannot be realized and will be stillborn, or at the same time as these treaties begin to be implemented, the system of international relations on which these treaties are based will also begin to disintegrate.

You cannot expect the Soviet people to sympathize with these treaties that are directed against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving nations in Europe.

The planners of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty apparently did not take into account that they are living in the mid-20th century. The Treaty of Versailles has already shown that in our time, people should not act according to the worst examples of unequal and oppressive treaties of the past (including the 19th century). And this is even more true for the treaties and agreements we are now discussing.

Whether we want to or not, we live in a new era, so we must consider the events of modern history. And the planners of the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty apparently believe that this is irrelevant to them. Therefore, they have drafted plans that are inconsistent with the actual situation in the modern era. If there is anything realistic in these plans, then it must be admitted that these things are not in line with the interests of peace, not in line with the interests of the security of the peoples of Europe. The only ones who can benefit from these drafts are those German revanchists who dream of reviving German militarism and expanding their military industries as soon as possible. Once the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty come into effect, their aggressive intentions will have the opportunity to be realized. This means that the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty do not serve the cause of peace and European security, but serve the planning and launching of new aggression and new wars.

So, where is the way out? Of course, there is a way out. That is, our four countries should abandon attempts to confront each other, at least on those matters related to the interests of peace and the interests of European security. If we all agree not to allow the resurgence of German militarism, the way out is not difficult to find.

It is precisely for this reason that the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany must be resolved. What the German people need are not the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, which would exacerbate the threat of war, but a peace treaty. Only a peace treaty can guarantee the German people's true freedom and independence, guaranteeing them the freedom to handle domestic affairs and matters involving relations with other countries.

As early as two years ago, the Soviet government submitted a draft of the principles for a peace treaty with Germany to the governments of France, Britain, and the United States. However, until now, the three Western countries have not expressed their attitude towards this draft, nor have they put forward any proposals regarding a peace treaty with Germany. Such an attitude will not help solve this important problem.

According to the draft of the principles for a peace treaty with Germany that we have proposed, Germany should be restored as a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful country.

The armed forces of the occupying countries should all withdraw from Germany no later than one year after the peace treaty comes into effect. We believe that the following point must be added to the "political clauses" of our previously proposed draft: "Germany shall not be forced to assume any obligations of a political or military nature stipulated in the treaties and agreements concluded by the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic prior to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the re-establishment of Germany as a unified country."

If the reassuring remarks made by Mr. Eden at the last meeting are in line with the views of the governments of the Western countries participating in the meeting, the above suggestion should not be opposed.

It is of great significance to Germany to stipulate the improvement of the financial and economic situation in the treaty. Regarding this aspect, we believe that it is best to add the following clause to our draft: "Germany shall be completely exempt from its post-war national debt to the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, with the exception of payments due under trade obligations."

The Soviet-proposed draft peace treaty with Germany stipulates that democratic Germany may maintain the national armed forces necessary for defense. In order to make this more precise, we are making the following supplement to the "military clauses": "The size of these armed forces shall be limited to the needs of internal security, border defense, and air defense."

This clause should be in line with the clauses of some corresponding treaties that have been signed by the governments of our several countries.

Whenever there is talk about accelerating the preparation of a peace treaty, various objections are usually raised to delay the progress of this matter. Some say that a peace treaty should not be prepared until a pan-German government is established. But this objection cannot be considered reasonable.

The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have previously believed that it is possible for the four countries to formulate a draft treaty before a pan-German government is established.

At the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in London in 1947, someone said that he hoped to reach an agreement in which two things could be done simultaneously: that is, preparing to establish a German government and preparing a peace treaty at the same time, so that as soon as the peace treaty preparation work is completed, a German government that can express its views will be established. He said that he thought these two things could be done simultaneously. The person who said this was none other than the British Foreign Secretary.

The US government and the French government also agreed with this view of the British government. Needless to say, only a pan-German government formed by a parliament elected on the basis of free elections can sign the peace treaty. One of our main obligations is to promote the holding of these free elections. However, preparing the peace treaty, which first requires the coordination of the opinions of the four countries, should not be delayed indefinitely. This should have been done long ago.

The Soviet government advocates that German representatives should be widely involved in all stages of the preparation of the peace treaty. The Soviet government believes that, before a pan-German government is established, representatives from East and West Germany can be involved in the preparation of the peace treaty. The final review and adoption of the peace treaty should be held with the participation of a pan-German government produced by pan-German elections, and at the same time, the peace treaty should be ratified by the pan-German parliament.

It can be seen that the Soviet government's proposal is to immediately begin drafting a draft peace treaty with Germany, while the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France are to continue to delay the resolution of this issue.

Beginning the preparation of a peace treaty would in itself prove that we have entered a new and very important stage in the common work of resolving the German question, a process in which we are able to overcome the differences that exist in some contentious issues. This will also promote the rapprochement between East and West Germany and the resolution of some individual issues related to the German question, including the establishment of a pan-German government and the holding of pan-German elections. According to these proposals, the Soviet delegation is submitting to this conference its revised draft of the principles for a peace treaty with Germany and a draft of the "Preparation of a Peace Treaty with Germany and Convening of a Peace Conference on a Peace Treaty with Germany."

The Soviet delegation hopes that the ministers and ministers of France, Britain, and the United States present here will express their views on these proposals. It is very important that we reach an agreement on the issue of quickly preparing a peace treaty and convening a peace conference on a peace treaty with Germany. As for the opinions put forward by Mr. Bidault today, the Soviet delegation will express its opinions. We will also carefully study the opinions put forward by Mr. Eden today.

I must add that the Soviet delegation will also put forward its own proposals on some other issues concerning the German question.

    在柏林四国外长会议二月一日会议上
    莫洛托夫外交部长的发言全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二日电：莫洛托夫于一九五四年二月一日在柏林四国外长会议上发言，全文如下：
    我们开始讨论德国问题了。在我们的议程中，这个项目订为“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”。
    这次柏林会议主要是要依据这个问题讨论的结果如何来判断的。
    只有对德国问题作出不仅在字面上而且在事实上符合于保障和平与欧洲安全的利益的决定，才会对欧洲各国人民、包括德国人民自己在内，具有重大意义。我们的决定必须为了一个主要目的——保障欧洲和平，因而也就防止德国军国主义复活的危险。
    在座的法国、英国和美国的代表们是否同意，德国军国主义应负发动第一次和第二次世界大战的主要责任呢？我希望他们是同意的。我们的任务就在于防止一种侵略性的德国军国主义得以重新破坏欧洲和平生活及发动第三次世界大战的形势。
    苏联人是时常记住这一点的。他们不能忘记我国人民过去所遭受到的不可计算的牺牲。这种牺牲是远非数字和事例所能形容的。希特勒匪帮在进攻了捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、比利时、法国、荷兰、丹麦、挪威、南斯拉夫之后，就进攻苏联。在这段艰苦的岁月里，苏联的牺牲特别惨重。
    我们怎能忘记，由于希特勒的侵略，我们全国有一千七百一十座城市和七万余个乡村全部或部分被破坏或烧毁呢？
    大家知道，如果以金钱来计算，根据非常不完备的数字，德国的占领在苏联土地上所造成的直接损失就有一千二百八十亿美元。这方面详细的官方数字已经发表。我们怎能忘记，由于德国军国主义的侵略，苏联男女牺牲于战争和被残忍地劫出国外的约有七百万人。这是苏联一个无可补偿的损失。欧洲（而且不仅是欧洲）其他国家的人民也遭到了重大的牺牲。不过大家知道，苏联所受的损失最为惨重，它还承担了反对侵略、争取建立公正的和平的主要重担。苏联政府表达苏联人民最深切的感情和意志，认为有责任尽一切努力来防止另一次世界大战。正因为如此，它要反对一切复活德国军国主义的企图。今天，如果有谁在帮助德国军国主义的复活，他就要对世界的命运、首先是对欧洲各国人民的命运，负最严重的责任。
    苏联对德国问题究竟采取怎样的立场呢？简单地说，苏联的立场就是：我们法、英、美、苏四个国家在这个问题上应以我们以前一致通过的那些共同决议的基本原则为依归。这些原则说明必须保障和平，必须防止德国军国主义侵略再起的可能性。这些协定规定：苏联、美国和英国要采取共同行动，来帮助德国人民本着民主与和平的方针来重建其国家。法国后来也同意了这些决议。虽然现在皮杜尔先生不时要摆脱他和这些曾经得到大家同意的决议的关系，但是我认为，法国需要这些协定并不下于苏联。
    我们承认，波茨坦协定中有不少条款已经过时了。然而，这些协定的主旨仍然是完全有效的。这些协定的宗旨就是：法国、苏联、英国和美国应协力解决德国问题；而且，我们这几个国家应和德国人民，也就是和德国的民主力量取得一致意见，以便防止欧洲发生新的战争。
    四大国的上述协定为保障欧洲安全指出了明确的途径。如果我们根据四大国的这些协定，共同努力防止德国军国主义的复活，我们就能消除欧洲另一次战争的主要危险，从而构成策划和发动另一次世界大战的严重障碍。如果我们四大国拒绝共同采取一致的行动，而容许德国军国主义复活，那么任何国际协定都不能给我们以足够的保证来防止另一次世界大战。
    对于这一切，德国人民也和其他国家人民同样关心。我们在柏林特别感觉到战争给德国人民造成的严重后果。在目前情况下，发动另一次世界大战，还会引起像德国人自相残杀的战争的危险那样的严重灾祸。
    我们的会议陷于相当为难的处境。我们在柏林讨论德国问题而没有德国人参加。
    在场的法国、英国和美国的部长们以阿登纳政府的反对为借口，不愿听取德意志民主共和国政府的意见。他们同意那些西德官方人物的说法，那些人硬说他们可以代表全体德国人民的意志，虽然这是完全不符合事实的。这些洋洋自得的西德官方人物不愿和德意志民主共和国政府的人员坐在一张桌子旁边进行会谈，而这些人员是受东德绝大多数居民的委托而执政的，这里举行的民主的议会选举和许多日常生活事件都证明了这一点。这就证明了上述官方人物政治眼光的短浅。
    但是，苏联代表团认为有可能纠正已经犯下的错误。我们今后可以利用机会，听取东德和西德的代表的意见，即使只是关于德国问题中个别最重要问题的意见也好。对于今天所讨论的问题也可以如此。
    苏联代表团认为，首先应当肯定：德国问题首先是德国人民自己的事情，是德国人自己的事情。德国人民不应当单纯是决议的对象，或其他国家采取行动的对象。只有他们自己，只有德国人自己，才能真正地解决德国问题。用任何其他办法去解决德国问题，对于德国人民来说，都是不合理的、不公道的。
    另一方面，第二次世界大战所产生的局面也使得苏联、法国、英国和美国不能避不解决这个问题，也不能对这件事情只采取被动的、袖手旁观的态度。自战争结束后，他们就负有积极解决德国问题的特别重大的责任。
    当然，这只是指在目前还没有缔结对德和约的时期。对德和约一缔结，德国马上就能侧身于平等的欧洲国家之列——使得缔结和约这件事终于实现，是我们的责任。毫无疑问，德国的高度文化水平和发达的和平经济，会保证德国在世界其他大国中占有应得的地位。
    但是，在对德和约缔结以前，我们四个国家不应当分别行动，而应当共同行动，以便对德和约得以缔结，保证德国人民恢复其民族国家的统一，并且以我们的共同行动和德国人民爱好和平的力量的共同努力来创造条件，使恢复起来的德国今后不至于成为新的侵略策源地，而成为爱好和平的欧洲各国人民的大家庭中平等的一员。毫无疑问，如果我们四个国家采取共同行动，而不企图利用德国的一部分来使欧洲的一些国家去反对其他欧洲国家，那么，我们就能够成功地解决德国问题。这样就不至于损害到四国中任何一国的利益，或损害到任何其他爱好和平的国家的利益。同时，从保证德国人民自己的民族权利和根本利益的观点看来，这也是解决德国问题最好的办法。
    建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”的计划把德国推上另一条道路。这些计划的政治意义在于：美、英、法三国正在企图勾结目前西德的官方人物结成一个军事集团去反对第四个国家——苏联。
    目前正有人在千方百计地把西德拖入这个反苏集团，使它有机会复活德国军国主义。同时，这还意味着：西方三国目前执行的，是和公开希望使德国军国主义从速获得合法地位的西德官方人物进行军事合作的政策，而不是阻止德国军国主义复活的政策。
    不能忽视的是：甚至法国政府现在也在执行这个政策。如果说这个显然没有前途的政策引起了欧洲大多数人民合理的惊奇，那也绝不算说得过分。
    为了替法国政府的这种政策寻找根据，皮杜尔先生把问题说成这样：似乎只有他所提出的两个公式，必须任择其一。这是哪两个公式呢？
    我在这里引用皮杜尔先生在一月二十五日的会议上所说的话：
    “重要的是：不让在大陆的中心存在一个被孤立的德国，同时又要防止任何侵略性的军国主义复活。在这方面可能而且只有两种公式：一种是强迫管制，另一种是联合。”
    这样，根据皮杜尔先生的发言，对德国可能采取的不是“强迫管制的公式”（在另外一个地方他甚至谈到“无限期的管制”），就是“联合的公式”。然而，这里所指的联合是一种非常特殊的“联合”。
    从上面所谈的来看，皮杜尔先生把波茨坦会议关于德国的协定解释成为“强迫管制”的公式。他把事情说成是：似乎有人企图强迫德国接受其他国家的无限期管制。这种解释当然是不正确的。
    如果不无限期拖延对德和约的缔结，而如苏联所要求的那样着手准备和约，那么，不需要多久就可以缔结对德和约，而不再拖延了。我们已和欧洲其他国家，包括像意大利这样一个国家在内，缔结了和约。如果四国外长不再拖延这个事情，对德和约也就可以缔结，而德国也就可以根据这个条约在内政和外交方面获得真正的自由，这种真正的自由是德国人民早就有权享受的。否则，所谓德国在自由的环境中生活的说法，是不能令人相信的。不能光是口谈自由，而必须要使德国人民终于能享受这种真正自由。
    在另一方面，皮杜尔想用含糊其词的“联合的公式”来达到建立“欧洲防务集团”的目的，明白地说，就是建立有复活了的德国国防军参加的西欧军队。于是，我们就有了一种非常特殊的“联合”，这种联合明白地说就是一些欧洲国家为了反对其他欧洲国家而建立的军事集团。
    换句话说，“联合”公式的拟订者不是关心欧洲国家间的和平，不是在亲手使和平巩固，而是在欧洲准备另一次最可怕的战争。令人惊奇的是：某些法国代表相信，似乎法国所需要的并不是和苏联及其他爱好和平的欧洲国家联合，而是需要一个即使只和德国的一部分联合的军事集团——一个针对苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克及其他国家的军事集团，尽管这些国家是和平与全欧洲安全最可靠的堡垒，并且希望成为关心阻止新战争的法国的可靠的盟国。　
    的确，如果拿有代表来参加这个会议的国家来说，那么不正是法国和苏联的很大一部分在几年以前曾被德国军国主义者占领吗？不正是法国和苏联应当了解：它们在保障欧洲安全中有共同的利益吗？
    不能不承认，如果法国和苏联保持很好的关系，不是各行其道而是共同为保障自己的外部安全寻找可靠的途径，那么，在目前的情况下，就没有人敢破坏欧洲和平，而欧洲安全也就能够得到保障。
    社会制度的不同无论如何不应当是一种障碍，不应当为达成保证两国和平发展的协议造成不可克服的阻碍，这种协议应当是欧洲的持久和平与安全的可靠基础。如果法国和苏联协同一致地来阻止德国军国主义的复活，达到这一点是可能的。
    苏联政府深信，这样的政策也会得到绝大多数德国人民的支持。法国和苏联不应当执行互相隔离的政策，而应当致力于不断地加强法苏关系，致力于为苏联、法国、德国之间的正常合作创造条件，而使德国军国主义者和复仇主义者在欧洲和德国国内陷于孤立。这样的政策是德国军国主义者不喜欢的，可是，他们只不过是德国社会中一小撮的少数当权派。而最广大的德国人民则必然会支持这个政策。而且，这一点最后必然会使事情有利于持久和平与欧洲安全。
    皮杜尔先生热中于与西德缔结的波恩条约与巴黎条约。然而，就是在法国国内，对这些条约的抵抗也正在日益增长。这是完全可以理解的。
    大家知道，对建立西欧军最热烈的支持者是美国政府人员。对于他们，这是比较简单的事，因为美国不准备叫自己的军队参加西欧军。
    杜勒斯先生说：苏联担心这个新建的集团（指“欧洲防务集团”）可能为苏联造成危险；而事实上，这个集团似乎会使欧洲奠立在一个健全的基础之上，会保证欧洲更加繁荣，从而使欧洲更加强大。只要使欧洲同时变得更加和平，那就没有理由担心了。
    就是这样劝告苏联不要害怕“欧洲防务集团”的。但是这里有一个保留，也就是下面这个先决条件：只要使欧洲变得更加和平。正是这个保留表明了欧洲现在还没有变得和平，因此，苏联的担心就不是那么没有根据的了。
    还有一个问题，就是怎样去理解杜勒斯先生的话：“欧洲防务集团”似乎会使欧洲奠立在一个健全的基础之上，会保证欧洲更加繁荣。大家知道，加入“欧洲集团”的，只有包括卢森堡在内的六个国家。大家也知道，欧洲不止六个国家，却有三十二个国家。那么，组成这个“集团”的六个国家又怎能使共有三十二个国家的整个欧洲奠立在一个健全的基础之上呢？对这六个国家来说，这难道不是一件太艰巨的工作吗？
    波恩和巴黎条约事实上只不过是庞大的美国军事计划的一部分。在这种情况下，不仅是卢森堡，就是法国和意大利，也只被看成是外国的意志和外国计划的执行者。
    波恩和巴黎条约把西德变成在欧洲策划新战争的主要桥头堡。在这个计划下，西德会变成进行新侵略的主要军事基地，但还不是唯一的军事基地。它只不过使分布在欧洲、北非、近东、中东及大西洋的许多岛屿上的美国军事基地网扩大一些罢了。大家知道，在英国、西德、法国、西班牙、意大利、希腊、挪威、马尔他岛、冰岛、奥地利、葡萄牙、法属摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、利比亚、土耳其、克里特岛、沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、亚丁等地方，都有美国的军事基地。除了美国在别国领土上建立军事基地网之外，英国也在别国领土上建立了基地，这些基地也有好几十个。美国在上述外国领土上建立的基地，据不完全统计，已达八十二个。
    美国甚至于和佛朗哥西班牙也缔结了特别协定。希特勒当年也曾经不得不争取这种支援。那么，别人为什么不该利用这样一个著名的同盟者呢？显然，所有这一切以及许多新建的美国军事基地，还有波恩和巴黎条约，就是杜勒斯在谈到使欧洲奠立在一个健全的基础之上并且保证其繁荣这些话时，心里所想到的东西。不难看出，这完全不是使欧洲奠立在健全基础之上，完全不是使它繁荣。这一切的目的，就是反对苏联和各人民民主国家。因此，我们不能不考虑到这一点。
    事情还不仅限于美国和英国采取了一些纯军事性的措施。谁不知道：除此之外，还正在采取一些措施去破坏例如各人民民主国家的经济和居民的福利。
    一九五一年，美国颁布了一项“共同安全法”，并且按照这个法律拨款一亿美元，用来对苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚以及德国与奥地利的苏联占领区进行种种破坏和颠覆活动。因为美国的这种做法引起了许多国家正当的抗议，对上述“法律”的吹捧已经收敛起来。最近已经尽可能不谈这个法律了。
    但是，既然在一九五一年拨了一亿美元来在人民民主国家进行破坏活动，显然，在一九五二年、一九五三年和一九五四年也拨出了一些款项。在这些年头里究竟总共拨出了五亿还是十亿美元，我们不清楚。不过有相当多的迹象，表明用来在人民民主国家进行破坏活动的美元正在源源不绝地增加。
    如果这只是这个或那个国家的内部事务，我们满可以不谈。然而，情况不是这样。
    我们不能忽视这个事实：美国的“共同安全法”首先也就是策划欧洲另一次战争的因素。后来对这个法律的修正案说明：这个法律的目的不仅是为了便于在欧洲，而且也为了便于在亚洲策划新战争。
    我们在星期六听取杜勒斯先生的发言时，好像觉得他的话里充满了爱好和平的意图。杜勒斯先生直接劝告我们不要为波恩条约和巴黎条约而担心。但是，另一方面，不考核事实是不智的。刚才我在上面所列举的一些材料和杜勒斯先生口头所作的保证比较起来，又完全是另外一回事。
    最近有人喋喋不休地替那些为德国军国主义打开大门的波恩条约和巴黎条约捧场。这些条约的有效时期有好几十年。显然有人想告诉我们说——别再想缔结对德和约吧。我们只要让六国政府在波恩条约和巴黎条约上签字就够了。显然是要以此来代替对德和约。
    但是，不应当对迅速缔结对德和约的必要性估计不足。应当重视凡尔赛条约的教训。
    在第一次世界大战结束之后的某一个时期内，西方的人们有一个短时期相信凡尔赛条约能解决保障欧洲国家免受德国军国主义复活和德国侵略的威胁的问题，凡尔赛条约的拟订者的无能和短视很快就暴露出来了。凡尔赛条约不仅不能保障欧洲的安全，而且是第二次世界大战的主要的先决条件之一。这主要是因为，它对德国是一种强盗式的条约，它是为德国人民所憎恨的，因此它不可避免地遭到了可耻的失败。
    巴黎条约和波恩条约并不比凡尔赛条约高明。这主要是因为，这些条约既不符合保障欧洲安全的利益，也不符合德国人民的利益。这些条约只不过是臭名昭彰的北大西洋军事集团的附属品。
    根据巴黎条约和波恩条约，西德在今后五十年中都是一个处于半占领状态的国家，被剥夺了国家主权和外交上的独立。有人向我们建议在整个德国，包括它的东部，建立这种制度，至少如皮杜尔先生今天所说的，到缔结和约时为止，而关于准备这个和约的时间都还没有取得一致意见。但是，有哪一个德国人会自愿地走这条道路呢？甚至凡尔赛条约也没有这样粗鲁地剥夺德国人民的权利。没有人能相信，住在西德的德国人会在一个无限长的时期中忍受下面的这种情况：他们既不能独立自主地决定自己的内政，也不能独立自主地决定他们和其他国家的外交关系的问题。我们怎么能够想像下面的这种情况呢，就是：在德国的某一部分，在目前说来就是西德，三个西方国家——美国、英国和法国——可以在任何时候干涉它的内部生活，可以随心所欲地宣布戒严，总之，就是充当德国这一部分的威力无边的主人。如果目前西德的某些官方人士同意这种情况，这决不是因为他们在今天勉强驯服的情况下，多少认真地考虑到可能把这种情况保持几十年。
    因此，巴黎条约和波恩条约都是建筑在沙滩上的，是不能长久存在的。但是在建立西欧军的似是而非的借口之下，他们实际上正在放纵德国军国主义者和复仇分子，企图在西德建立一支新的正规军。按照巴黎条约的规定，首先将建立十二个师。然后呢？我们每个人如果不太天真的话，都会想到然后怎么样。这一次，德国军国主义不顾德国人民的利益，暴露出自己的侵略面目的时候很快就会来到了。我们知道，它是不会干到半路就歇手的。
    西德一参加“欧洲防务集团”，就会公开地走上复活德国军国主义的道路。大家知道，爱好和平的德意志民主共和国是不会走这条道路的。可是，实现波恩条约和巴黎条约会成为统一德国的不可逾越的障碍，使德国在一个时期内不可能重新统一。
    波恩条约、巴黎条约和凡尔赛条约之间还有一个共同点：这两个新条约和凡尔赛条约一样，是把刀锋对着苏联的。关于这一点不是每个人都敢直言不讳的。然而，我们苏联人民当时对凡尔赛条约的估计没有错误。我们认为，现在我们对波恩条约和巴黎条约的估计，以及从这种估计中所得出的相应的结论也没有错误。
    我们认为，波恩条约和巴黎条约的命运将不会比凡尔赛条约来得好。要就是波恩条约和巴黎条约不能实现而流产，要就是在开始实施这些条约的同时，作为这些条约的基础的那种国际关系的体系也将开始瓦解。
    你们不能指望苏联人民会同情这些针对苏联和欧洲其他爱好和平的民族的条约。
    波恩条约和巴黎条约的策划者显然没有考虑到他们是生活在二十世纪的中叶。凡尔赛条约就已表明，在我们这个时代，人们不应该按照过去（包括十九世纪在内）不平等的压迫性条约的最坏的例子办事。而对于我们现在正在讨论的这些条约和协定来说，那就更是如此了。
    不管我们愿不愿意，我们生活在新时代里，所以必须考虑现代历史的事件。而波恩条约和巴黎条约的策划者显然认为这是与他们无关的。因此他们就拟就了这样一些与现代的实际情况不符合的计划。如果说这些计划中也有什么现实的东西，那么应当承认，这些东西是不符合和平利益，不符合欧洲各国人民安全的利益的。能从这些草案中得到好处的只有那些梦想早日复活德国军国主义和扩张自己的军事工业的德国复仇主义者。波恩条约和巴黎条约一旦生效，他们的侵略意图就有机会实现。这意味着，波恩条约和巴黎条约不是为和平及欧洲安全的事业服务的，而是为策划和发动新侵略、新战争而服务的。
    那么，出路在哪里呢？出路当然是有的。那就是，我们四个国家放弃互相对抗的企图，至少在那些有关和平利益和欧洲安全利益的事情上放弃这种企图。如果我们大家同意不让德国军国主义复活，出路是不难找到的。
    正因为如此，才必须解决缔结对德和约的问题。德国人民所需要的不是那些会加剧战争威胁的波恩条约和巴黎条约，而是和约。只有和约才能保障德国人民的真正的自由和独立，保障他们有处理国内事务和涉及对其他国家关系的事务的自由。
    早在两年前，苏联政府就已向法国、英国、美国政府提出了关于对德和约原则的草案。然而直到现在，西方三国还没有对这个草案表示自己的态度，也没有提出任何关于对德和约的建议。这样的态度是不会有助于这个重要问题的解决的。
    根据我们提出的对德和约原则草案，德国应当恢复成为一个统一、独立、民主与和平的国家。
    占领国的武装部队应在不迟于和约生效后的一年之内全部撤离德国。我们认为必须在我们以前提出的草案的“政治条款”中补充下列一点：“不得强使德国承担德意志联邦共和国与德意志民主共和国在缔结对德和约及德国重新成为统一的国家以前所缔结的各项条约和协定中所规定的任何政治或军事性质的义务。”
    如果艾登先生在上次会议上所作的安慰人心的发言是符合与会的西方国家政府的意见的话，上述的建议是不应遭到反对的。
    在条约中规定改善财政经济状况一点，对德国有重大的意义。关于这方面，我们认为最好在我们的草案中加上下面一条：“完全免除德国对美国、英国、法国、苏联所负的战后国债，根据贸易义务所应支付者不在此例。”
    苏联提出的对德和约草案规定：民主德国得保持为国防所必需的国家武装部队。为了使这一点更加确切，我们对“军事条款”作下列补充，即：“这些武装部队的数额应以内部治安、边防、空防的需要为限”。
    这一条款应与我们几国政府所已签定的一些相应的和约的条款相符合。
    每当谈到必须加速准备和约时，通常总会提出种种的反对意见来反对，以拖延这一件事的进行。有人说：全德政府成立以前，不应从事准备和约。但这种反对意见不能认为是有理由的。
    美国、英国和法国政府以前也曾认为：在成立全德政府以前四国拟定和约草案是可能的。
    一九四七年在伦敦的四国外长会议上有人说过：他希望能达成这样一种协议：两件事能够同时进行，就是说准备成立德国政府与准备和约同时进行，这样，一俟和约准备工作结束，一个能够表明自己看法的德国政府也就成立起来了。他说，他想这两件事可以同时进行。说这话的不是别人，正是英国的外交大臣。
    美国政府与法国政府也曾同意英国政府的这种意见。不用说，只有由在自由选举的基础上选出来的议会成立的全德政府才能在和约上签字。我们的主要义务之一就是：促进这一自由选举的举行。可是，准备和约，这首先要靠四国的意见取得协调，不应无止境地拖下去。这是早就应该做的。
    苏联政府主张在准备和约的各个阶段都要广泛地吸收德国的代表参加。苏联政府认为，在全德政府没有成立之前，可以吸收东德与西德的代表参加准备和约。和约的最后审查与通过应在由全德选举而产生的全德政府的参加下举行，同时和约应由全德议会来批准。
    可见，苏联政府的建议是要立即开始拟定对德和约草案，而美国、英国和法国的建议都是要继续拖延解决这一问题。
    开始准备和约，这件事本身就会证明：在解决德国问题的共同工作中，我们已进入了一个新的、十分重要的阶段，在这个工作的过程中我们是能够克服在一些争执问题中存在的分歧的。这还会促使东德与西德双方的接近和解决有关德国问题的一些个别问题，包括成立全德政府和进行全德选举的问题。按照这些建议，苏联代表团将其对德和约原则的经过修正的草案以及“准备对德和约及召开关于对德和约的和平会议”的草案提交这次会议。
    苏联代表团希望：在座的法国、英国和美国的部长和大臣对这些建议表明自己的意见。我们在迅速准备和约和召开关于对德和约的和平会议问题上取得协议，这是十分重要的。至于对今天皮杜尔先生所提出的意见，苏联代表团将表明自己的意见。我们也将慎重研究艾登先生今天提出的意见。
    我还得补充一句，即苏联代表团还将就关于德国问题的其他一些问题提出自己的建议。
