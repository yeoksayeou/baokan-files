Watching the Film "The Great Land Reform"

    The historical documentary film "The Great Land Reform" records the largest land reform in China, the suffering of hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants before liberation, and their struggles and victories under the leadership of the Communist Party. Through vivid images, it comprehensively and authentically portrays the Party's land policies at various stages. It encourages us to move forward with greater confidence and courage, opening up a wider path to socialism. It helps peasants summarize the most valuable experience from their own experiences—"Following the Communist Party is right!" "Organization brings great strength!" By reviewing these experiences, farmers will better understand how to proceed in the next step.

    The film is only a little over five thousand feet long; however, it includes such rich content! The film begins with an endless expanse of fields, fertile land. Why can crops grow on the land? It is the result of generations of working people clearing thorns and shedding blood and sweat. However, under the feudal land ownership system, 70% to 80% of the land was occupied by landlords and rich peasants, who accounted for less than 10% of the rural population. Poor peasants, farm laborers, middle peasants, and other people, who accounted for 90% of the rural population, owned only 20% to 30% of the land in total. Apart from the rich peasants' own cultivated land, which accounted for about 10% of the total cultivated land, 90% of the land was cultivated by poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants. Those who tilled the land "had no land," those who worked all year round could not eat enough or dress warmly, and were subjected to beatings, scoldings, and bullying; this unreasonable situation continued for thousands of years. At the end of the film, it is still an endless expanse of fields, fertile land. The crops on the land are even more lush. Tractors and combine harvesters are working in the fields. The same land, from feudal ownership to peasant individual ownership, and then to peasant collective ownership, brings such different lives to the peasants! In the past, how much the peasants loved the land, yet how much they "dared not" love it, and "couldn't" love it! After being given land, how joyful the peasants were, and how actively they labored! In order to love the land even more, in order to make the land exert greater strength and grow better crops, in order not to lose the land again, many peasants understood: only by managing it with collective strength, only by managing it with new technology, new farm tools, and agricultural machinery under the leadership and help of the working class! This clear and vivid contrast leaves an extremely deep impression on people.

    In the film, we can see the "imperial edict" of the Qing Dynasty's Emperor Yongzheng forcing a family of farmers surnamed Yu to be hereditary "house slaves" of the landlord surnamed Cheng; we can see the Kuomintang bandit gang supporting landlords in seizing peasants' land with "proclamations." The ugly relationship between the reactionary regime and the landlord class is thus nakedly displayed before the people.

    We can also see other documents: the Outline Land Law of China, the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, and the judgments announced by the People's Court severely punishing the heinous local despots; we can also see how the peasants held representative conferences and established a people's regime where they were the masters. This further illustrates the relationship between the Communist Party, the People's Government, and the peasants.

    The film features close-up shots of stacks of leases and land deeds. Each of these leases and land deeds contains countless blood and tears. These leases stipulated that the peasants' hard-earned harvest should be given to the landlord in large part, even nine-tenths; regardless of whether the year was one of drought or flood, even if there was no harvest, the peasants were not allowed to give the landlord one sheng or one ge less of grain. We can also see another stack of land deeds, which are no longer the golden hoops used by landlords to oppress peasants; they are burning in the flames, turning into ashes. The peasants received land certificates from the People's Government, laughing joyfully. With their own land, the peasants no longer had to pay rent.

    We see a peasant laboriously plowing in the paddy field, his wife pulling the plow like an ox, with a child on her back, the child swaying on her back, almost falling off. We also see another peasant with his wife and children, standing in the field they just received, laughing joyfully; with their own land, they no longer have to be beasts of burden for others.

    We see the "homes" where the peasants used to live—grass sheds that could not keep out the wind or rain, we see a poor peasant's "quilt"—a pile of straw netted with fishing nets, we see a poor peasant's "bed"—a pile of rags and rotten cotton, we see a poor peasant's "clothes"—worn for four generations, regardless of the season, patched upon patched, countless pieces of cloth stitched together, something that seemed to be a cotton-padded jacket. We also see how the peasants moved into the tile-roofed houses they were given, talking and laughing, excitedly organizing the bedding on the beautiful large wooden bed, and also see a newly liberated peasant couple smiling and putting on new clothes in front of the beautiful bed just before the celebration of the victory of land reform.

    We see a landlord's sixty-two warehouses, filled to the brim with grain; despite the peasants not even being able to eat their fill by peeling bark and digging wild vegetables, and many people starving to death in famine years, the landlord's grain was left here to be eaten by mice, eaten by insects, and spoiled. We also see how bumper harvests have been achieved year after year since the land reform; there is more and more grain, and the grain belongs to the peasants themselves. In the harvest season, how many peasants are laughing so hard that they can't close their mouths.

    We can see many such vivid contrasts in this film. The two events being contrasted may be far apart in the film, but after seeing them, people will naturally connect the two or several scenes before and after, forming a contrast in their minds, and the impression is particularly strong. This is naturally the inevitable result of the development of historical facts themselves, but it should also be said that these are inseparable from the careful thinking and careful selection of materials and scenes by the film's directors and cinematographers. It is not easy to make a vivid, complete, and correct record of such a historic and great mass movement in a short film. They adopted many valuable historical materials and objects, and also personally participated in the struggle of land reform for a relatively long period of time, and had a relatively deep understanding of the Party's land policy and the lives of the masses. Therefore, the selected materials and scenes are generally representative and have the power to attract and persuade people. Its narration is generally simple and moving, full of class feelings, and has fighting power. Some narration turns dead historical materials and static objects into life.

    For example: seeing a fur coat, we immediately hear such narration: "This otter fur robe of the landlord Yi Zhen is worth one hundred and twenty shi of rice, enough for a farmer to eat and wear for twenty years." Seeing a village's towering bunkers, we hear such narration: "In order to suppress the peasants' just resistance, the landlord class once frantically armed themselves with all kinds of weapons. This is the seaside village of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, where the four hundred wealthy gentry landlords living here almost all built tall bunkers. They once extended guns and cannons manufactured by imperialists from the gun holes of these bunker buildings, facing the unarmed peasants with murderous intent."

    There are many such vivid and powerful narrations. These narrations are obviously an integral part of the film's artistry.

    The film narrates how the Communist Party of China correctly led the peasant masses in carrying out the land reform struggle for decades through on-site shooting of some places with great historical significance. In the film, we can see the birthplace of the Party in Shanghai, we can see the old site of the National Peasant Movement Training Institute presided over by Chairman Mao in Guangzhou, we can see Jinggang Mountain, we can see Yan'an, we can see Xibaipo Village, Jianping County, Hebei Province, where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated the Outline Land Law of China. How intimate these places make people feel! The narration accompanies the images of these places, briefly and clearly narrating the path the Communist Party has led the national peasants, explaining that as long as they follow the Communist Party, they will be invincible; and only by following the Communist Party can the peasants be completely liberated and obtain ever-increasing happiness.

    The film shows the entire process of the land reform movement through some typical examples. From cadres going to the countryside to mobilize peasants, to peasants complaining about their suffering, connecting with each other, dividing classes, organizing peasant associations, fighting local despots, to distributing land and agricultural tools, holding celebrations, and electing new rural regimes, there are vivid descriptions. No matter how the landlords sabotage, burning grain, burning farm tools, killing cattle, and killing peasants' children; once the peasants are organized and awakened, they will sweep away the landlords' power and prestige like a wind sweeping away fallen leaves. On the one hand, this shows that: without the leadership of the Communist Party, the peasants cannot turn over; on the other hand, it also shows that: only by organizing can the peasants be completely liberated and obtain greater happiness.

    The peasants have wept. However, just weeping cannot bring a good life; under the leadership of the Communist Party, the peasants have learned to organize and struggle.

    The peasants have laughed. However, just laughing cannot guarantee a good life; the peasants will continue to organize under the leadership of the Communist Party to create a better life.

    The sun is rising. Spring is coming again. Azaleas are blooming. "Children who used to go barefoot to the mountains to herd pigs and cattle for the landlords are now spending their lovely childhoods in school." (Narration) Rural cadres are studying the principle of "organizing, developing production, and moving towards prosperity." Many peasants have already understood: the land reform is completed, and good days are just beginning. To maintain good days and live better and better days, they must accept the good experiences learned in the land reform: continue to organize and continue to follow the Communist Party towards socialist society. - After watching this film, the main experiences that should be drawn from that past era are precisely these.

    After watching this film, I feel that two points are not fully expressed:

    The basic purpose of land reform is to pave the way for national industrialization. This film lacks sufficient and powerful expression on this point. How the feudal land system before land reform hindered industrial development, and how the peasants supported national industrial construction after land reform are lacking, both in the pictures and in the narration. The film points out that the correct path for peasants to continue to advance after land reform is to organize, mutual aid, and cooperation. When the peasants were given land, the narration said: "This peasant said to his wife and children: 'We have carried out heavy labor for decades, and as a result, we still don't have an acre of land. From today onwards, we will never be poor again.'" It is okay to express the peasants' love for the land in this way. However, the fact that peasants can "never be poor again" on small pieces of land is generally not consistent with the facts. It is naturally not the task of this film to express the instability of the small-scale peasant economy; however, when talking about organizing mutual aid and cooperation, it is still necessary to explain this appropriately.

    看影片“伟大的土地改革”

    历史文献纪录影片“伟大的土地改革”，纪录了我国规模最大的一次土地改革，纪录了中国亿万农民在解放前曾经受过的苦难，纪录了农民在共产党领导下进行的斗争和胜利。它通过形象，概括地、真切地表现了党在各个时期的土地政策。它鼓励我们用更大的信心和勇气继续前进，开辟更宽阔的通向社会主义的道路。它帮助农民从自己亲身经历的事情里总结出来最宝贵的经验——“跟着共产党走没错！”“组织起来力量大！”温习了这些经验，农民就会更加明白下一步应该怎样走。
              ×　×　×
    影片不过五千多尺长；可是，它包括着多么丰富的内容！影片一开始，是一眼望不到边的田野，富饶的土地。土地上为什么能长出庄稼来？是多少世代劳动人民披荆斩棘流血流汗开垦的结果。可是，在封建的土地所有制下面，百分之七十到八十的土地，却被占不到乡村人口百分之十的地主富农霸占着。占乡村人口百分之九十的贫农、雇农、中农及其他人民，总共只占有百分之二十到三十的土地。除了富农自耕地大约占全部耕地的百分之十以外，百分之九十的土地是贫农、雇农、中农耕种的。种地的人“没有地”，终年劳动的人吃不饱穿不暖，还要挨打挨骂受欺负；这种不合理的事就这样继续了几千年。影片的末了，还是一眼望不到边的田野，富饶的土地。土地上的庄稼更繁茂了。拖拉机、联合收割机在田野里工作着。同样的土地，从封建的所有制、到农民的个体所有制，再到农民的集体所有制，带给农民多么不同的生活！土地，在过去，农民多么爱它又多么“不敢”爱它，也“没法子”爱它！分到了土地，农民多么欢乐，多么积极地劳动！为了更热爱土地，为了使土地发挥更大的力量，长出更好的庄稼，为了不再失去土地，许多农民又明白了：只有用集体的力量经营它，只有在工人阶级领导帮助下用新技术、新农具、农业机器经营它！这个鲜明的、生动的对比，给人们的印象是极其深刻的。
    我们在影片里可以看到清朝雍正皇帝强迫一户姓余的全族农民做程姓地主的世代“家奴”的“圣旨”；可以看到蒋介石匪帮支持地主霸占农民土地的“布告”。反动政权和地主阶级互相勾结的丑恶关系就是这样赤裸裸地摆在人民面前的。
    我们也可以看到另外一些文件：中国土地法大纲、中华人民共和国土地改革法、人民法庭宣布的给罪行累累的恶霸地主以严厉惩办的判决书；还可以看到农民怎样开代表大会建立了人民当家作主的政权。这又说明了共产党、人民政府和农民的关系是怎样的。
    影片里出现了一张张的成堆的租约和地契的特写镜头。这些租约和地契，每一张都不知包含着多少血泪。这些租约规定：农民辛辛苦苦的收获，要给地主一大半甚至十分之九；不论水旱年成，就是颗粒不收，也不许农民少给地主一升一合粮食。我们也可以看到另外的成堆的地契，那已经不再是地主用来压榨农民的金箍咒了；它们在烈火中燃烧着，化成了纸灰。农民们从人民政府领到了土地证，欢笑着。有了自己的土地，农民们再也用不着缴租子了。
    我们看到一个农民艰难地在水田里犁地，他的妻子像牛马一样在拉犁，背上还背着孩子，孩子在脊背上摇幌着，几乎要摔下来。我们也看到又一个农民和他的妻子、孩子，他们站在刚才分到的田地里，欢笑着；有了自己的土地，他们再也用不着给别人当牛马了。
    我们看到农民曾经住过的“家”——遮不住风、挡不住雨的草棚，看到一个贫农的“被子”——渔网网着的一堆稻草，看到一家贫农的“床铺”——一堆破布烂棉花，看到一个贫农的“衣服”——传了四代的不分四季穿着的、补丁上边加补丁、无数布片缀在一起的、似乎是棉袄的东西。我们也看到农民怎样又说又笑地搬到自己分到的瓦房里，兴奋地整理着漂亮的大架木床上的被褥，还看到在快要开庆祝土地改革胜利的大会的时候，一对翻身农民夫妻俩微笑着在漂亮的床前穿着新衣服。
    我们看到一个地主的六十二间仓房，满仓满屋堆着粮食；尽管农民连剥树皮、挖野菜吃也吃不饱，遇到荒年许许多多人饿死，地主的粮食却在这里让耗子吃、虫咬、霉烂。我们也看到土地改革以后怎样连年丰收；粮食越来越多了，粮食是农民自己的了。在收获的季节，多少农民笑得合不拢嘴。
    我们在这部影片里可以看到许多这样鲜明的对比。对比起来的两件事在影片中可能相距很远，可是人们看了以后很自然地就会把前后两个或几个场面联系起来，在思想上形成对比，印象就特别强烈了。这自然是历史事实本身发展的必然的结果，但是，也应当说，这些和影片的编导者和摄影师们的用心思考，精心选择材料和场面是分不开的。把这样一个历史性的伟大的群众运动在一部短短的影片中作出生动的、完整的、正确的纪录，是不容易的。他们采用了不少珍贵的历史材料和实物，又比较长期地亲身参加了土地改革的斗争，比较深刻地了解了党的土地政策和群众的生活。因此，选择的材料和场面一般地说是有代表性的，是有吸引人和说服人的力量的。它的解说词，一般地说也是朴实而又动人的，是富有阶级感情的，是有战斗力的。有些解说词，把死的历史材料和静止的实物也变得有生命了。
    例如：看到了一件水獭衣，我们同时就听到了这样的解说：“地主易珍的这件水獭皮袍，价值一百二十石米，足够一个农民吃穿二十年。”看到了一个村庄的林立的碉堡，我们就听到了这样的解说：“地主阶级为了镇压农民的正义反抗，曾经疯狂地用全副刀枪把自己武装起来。这是广东中山县的海边村，住在这里的四百户豪绅地主，几乎家家都筑起高大的碉堡。他们曾经从这些碉堡楼的枪眼里，伸出过帝国主义制造的枪炮，杀气腾腾地面对着手无寸铁的农民。”
    像这样生动有力的解说词是不少的。这些解说词，显然是这部影片的艺术性的不可分割的一部分。
              ×　×　×
    影片通过一些有重大历史意义的地点的实地拍摄，叙述了中国共产党几十年间怎样正确地领导农民群众进行土地改革斗争。我们在影片中可以看到党在上海的诞生地，可以看到毛主席主持的全国农民运动讲习所在广州的旧址，可以看到井冈山，可以看到延安，可以看到中共中央曾在那里制定了中国土地法大纲的河北建屏县西柏坡村。这些地方使人感到多么亲切！解说词伴随着这些地方的形象，简要明白地叙述了共产党领导着全国农民走过的道路，说明只要跟着共产党走，就能无往而不胜利；也只有跟着共产党走，农民才能得到彻底解放，才能得到越来越大的幸福。
    影片通过一些典型事例表现了土地改革运动的整个过程。从干部下乡发动农民，到农民诉苦、串连，划分阶级，组织农会，斗争恶霸，以至分配土地、农具，开庆祝会，选举新的农村政权，都有生动的描写。不管地主怎样破坏，烧粮食，烧农具，杀耕牛，杀害农民的孩子；农民一经组织起来，觉悟起来，就像风扫落叶一般把地主的权势和威风一扫净光了。这一方面说明：农民要翻身，没有共产党领导是不行的；一方面也说明：农民只有组织起来才能得到彻底解放，才能得到更大的幸福。
    农民哭泣过。但是，只是哭泣是得不到好生活的；农民在共产党领导下学会了组织起来进行斗争。
    农民欢笑了。但是，只是欢笑也是保不住好生活的；农民将继续在共产党领导下组织起来创造更美好的生活。
    太阳升起来了。春天又来了。杜鹃花开放着。“从前赤着脚到山上给地主放猪放牛的孩子，今天在学校里渡过他们可爱的童年。”（解说词）农村干部在学习“组织起来，发展生产，走向富裕”的道理。许多农民已经明白了：土地改革完成了，好日子不过刚开头。要想保持好日子，一天天过更好的日子，就要接受在土地改革里边学到的好经验：继续组织起来，继续跟着共产党走向社会主义社会。——看了这部影片，应当从那已经过去了的时代吸取的主要的经验，也正是这些。
            ×　×　×
    看了这部影片，感到有两点表现得还不够充分：
    土地改革的基本目的，是为国家工业化开辟道路。这部影片在这一点上缺乏足够的有力的表现。土地改革以前的封建土地制度如何阻碍工业的发展，土地改革以后农民如何支援国家工业建设，不论是画面还是说明词，都是缺少的。影片指出了农民在土地改革以后继续前进的正确道路是组织起来，互助合作。在农民分到了土地的时候，解说词说：“这个农民对妻子和孩子说：‘咱们扛了几十年大活，结果还是一亩地都没有，从今天起咱们再不会受穷了。’”这样表现农民对土地的热爱是可以的。但是，农民在小块土地上可以“再不会受穷”，一般地说并不符合事实。表现小农经济的不稳定，自然不是这部影片分内的任务；可是，在说到要组织起来互助合作的地方，对这一点适当地解说一下，还是必要的。
