More than 22,000 senior elementary school graduates in Heilongjiang Province are active on the agricultural production front.

These students all graduated in the summer of 1953. Because they all grew up in peasant families and have had labor habits since childhood, and they are hardworking after formally participating in agricultural production, many of them have become activists in production, and some have become production experts. For example, Wang Shushan from Dongxin Village, Yi'an County, is 19 years old, a member of the Communist Youth League. After graduating from senior elementary school, he participated in the autumn harvest, engaging in labor such as cutting crops, pulling carts, and threshing. When chopping firewood, he sometimes worked shirtless, and the masses praised him, saying, "This young man is really capable." Since winter, he has been busy every day, getting up early and working late to fish and engage in sideline occupations. So far, he has caught more than 500 jin of fish and more than 2,000 bundles of firewood. He plans to buy a cow this year and engage in agricultural production properly. Wei Jingyi, a senior elementary school graduate from Yongfeng Village, Baiquan County, has now become the head of a production mutual aid team and has a high reputation in the village. He is indispensable for major and minor matters. Last year, their team harvested a lot of grain and took the lead in selling the surplus grain to the state. During the winter, he led his team to chop two carts of firewood a day, and the income from chopping firewood was used to buy a new cart.

These senior elementary school graduates also actively participated in various aspects of work in the villages. Almost all senior elementary school graduates in the province participated in the general election and the publicity of the general line. They have played a considerable role in promoting agricultural technology, promoting new agricultural tools, publicizing the unified purchase and sale of grain, and helping farmers to become literate. Many people who study well, produce well, work well, have a correct work style, and are enthusiastic about serving the masses have been elected as people's representatives in the general election. For example, Cai Keji, a senior elementary school graduate from Caijia Village, Suihua County, is capable and active after participating in production. She is an expert among women and won a red flag in the middle of summer hoeing. The whole village praised her as a "good laborer." Because she can unite the masses and is enthusiastic about serving everyone, she was elected as the deputy village chief by the people of the whole village on November 13 last year. After being elected as deputy village chief, she worked even more actively. In the recent seventeen days of disaster assessment work, she had to assess until late at night. Her mother was ill, but she took care of her mother and insisted on working. Most of the thirteen village committee members are illiterate. Cai Keji can write and calculate. She finished the final accounting of the disaster assessment in three days. In the grain purchase work, many senior elementary school graduates not only persuaded their families to sell surplus grain to the state, but also mobilized relatives, friends, and farmers to sell surplus grain to the state. During the population survey in the general election, many village cadres said: Thanks to the help of these senior elementary school graduates. Because there are not many literate people in the countryside, and elementary school teachers cannot be transferred casually now, these senior elementary school graduates have taken on a major task, and they are very active in doing the work assigned by the government. In the past, some mutual aid teams had no one to keep accounts. When it came time to keep accounts in the evening, they had to carry the account books to other teams to find someone. Now, many senior elementary school graduates participate in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams as accountants. Many senior elementary school graduates have also become village clerks. Many senior elementary school graduates have been hired as teachers in people's schools.

Farmers and rural cadres warmly welcome senior elementary school graduates to participate in agricultural production. Old Shangtou, a farmer in the Eighth District of Baiquan County, said, "I have always wondered in recent years, if students go to school and become cadres, who will farm the land in the future? We want to build everything well, but it won't work if there is no one in the countryside. Now the government is mobilizing students to participate in production, which is really thoughtful!" Some farmers are happy that their sons are participating in agricultural labor, saying, "This time, the money spent on education was well spent!" Some elderly farmers said, "In the future, tractors will be used in the countryside. None of us old guys even know a foreign letter. How can we use them? Now it's great that students are participating in production." District and village cadres unanimously believe that the participation of a large number of senior elementary school graduates in production has promoted many aspects of work. The district chief of the Eighth District of Baiquan County said, "Students have a certain level of political and cultural knowledge, and with further education and training, they will definitely become a new force in agricultural production."

The participation of these senior elementary school graduates in agricultural production has promoted the development of production and enlivened rural work to a certain extent. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government attach great importance to them. However, there are still some students who have not settled down even though they have participated in production. In order to better organize last year's and this year's senior elementary school graduates to participate in agricultural production, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government have instructed party committees, governments, educational administrative departments, and mass organizations at all levels to continue to educate the vast number of students, their parents, and the masses in conjunction with the publicity of the general line.

    黑龙江两万多名高小毕业生参加农业生产
    黑龙江省两万两千名高小毕业生活跃在农业生产战线上。
    这批学生全是一九五三年暑期毕业的。因为他们都是生长在农民家庭，从小就有劳动习惯，正式参加农业生产以后，又努力肯干，所以许多都成了生产中的积极分子，有的成了生产能手。例如，依安县东新村王树山，十九岁，青年团员，高小毕业后，就参加了秋收，从事割庄稼、拉地、打场等劳动。在打柴的时候，有时光着膀子干，群众都称赞“这小伙子，真能干”。入冬以来，一天不闲，起早贪黑地打鱼，搞副业。到现在为止，已经打了五百多斤鱼，两千多捆柴火。他打算今年买一头牛，好好地从事农业生产。拜泉县永丰村高小毕业生魏景义现已成为生产互助组长，在屯中威信很高，大事小事都少不了他。他们组去年打了很多粮食，带头把余粮卖给了国家。冬季搞副业生产，他带领本组一天打两车柴火，已把打柴火的收入添买了一辆新车。
    这批高小毕业生，也积极地参加了村里各方面的工作。全省农村高小毕业生几乎全部参加了普选和宣传总路线的工作。他们在推广农业技术、推广新式农具、宣传粮食统购统销以及帮助农民识字等方面，都起了相当大的作用。许多学习好、生产好、工作好、作风正派、热心为群众服务的人，在普选中被选为人民代表。如绥化县蔡家村高小毕业生蔡克基，在参加生产后，又能干又积极，是妇女当中的能手，夏锄中间曾得红旗一面，全村称赞她是“好劳动”；又因为她能团结群众，热心为大家服务，去年十一月十三日被全村人民选为副村长。当选副村长后，她工作得更加积极了，在最近十七天的评灾工作中，每天要评到晚间三星晌午歪，她母亲正闹病，她一面侍候母亲，一面坚持了工作。十三个村委员大都不识字，蔡克基又能写又能算，评灾最后算账，三天就把账算完了。在购粮工作中，许多高小毕业生不但说服家庭把余粮卖给国家，还动员亲友和农民把余粮卖给国家。在普选进行人口调查时，许多村干部说：多亏这批高小毕业生帮助。因为农村识字的人不多，小学教师现在也不能随便抽调，这批高小毕业生就顶了大事，政府找他们工作，他们干得可真积极。过去有些互助组没人记账，到晚间记账的时候，要挟着账本到别的组找人，现在许多高小毕业生参加农业生产合作社和互助组当了会计。也有许多高小毕业生当了村文书。许多高小毕业生被聘为民校教师。
    农民和农村干部都热烈欢迎高小毕业生参加农业生产。拜泉县第八区农民老尚头说：“这些年我老是纳闷，学生读了书，都去当干部，将来谁种地呢？啥都想建设好，农村没有人也不行哪。如今政府动员学生参加生产了，真想的周到！”有的农民高兴自己的儿子参加了农业劳动，说：“这回算把书供对啦！”有些老年农民说：“将来农村要使拖拉机，咱们这帮老家伙连个洋字码都不认得，咋使？如今学生参加生产可太好啦。”区、村干部一致认为大批高小毕业生参加生产，许多工作都好推动了。拜泉县第八区区长说：“学生有一定的政治、文化水平，再加以教育培养，一定会成为农业生产当中的一支新生力量。”
    这批高小毕业生参加了农业生产，在一定程度上推动了生产的发展，活跃了农村工作。黑龙江省委和人民政府十分重视他们。但目前还有一部分学生，虽然参加了生产，仍没有安下心来。为了更好地组织去年和今年的高小毕业生参加农业生产，省委和省人民政府已指示各级党委、政府、教育行政部门、群众团体，结合总路线的宣传，向广大学生及其家长、群众继续进行教育。
