Xinhua News Agency, February 10th, New York Dispatch: According to the American metallurgical industry magazine "Steel," American steel production in January this year has fallen to its lowest level since the 1952 steel strike. The decline in steel production is due to the increasing reduction in steel consumption.

The "Steel" magazine said: In the week ending February 6, the operating rate of the steel industry was only 73.9 percent, while it was 97.7 percent a year ago. The "Steel" magazine admitted that due to the decline in demand, "people's confidence" in the fact that February's "steel production will be higher than January's is not as strong as before."

Another metallurgical industry magazine, "Iron Age," also said: If the steelmaking operating rate "remains at the 70-odd percent level for most of the first half of this year, it will not be surprising." The magazine said that many steel capitalists' imagined good years are no longer a sharp increase in production, but merely a hope to barely maintain the status quo. With the shrinking sales market, large and small American steel companies have launched fierce competition, "In addition to reducing basic prices, producers are taking almost every method they can think of to attract business." In fact, many companies have implemented disguised price reduction methods such as canceling freight charges.

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, Washington Dispatch: Reports released by the U.S. government show that U.S. commodity exports in 1953 decreased by nearly $1 billion compared to 1952.

The Census Bureau's report released on the 5th said that normal commodity exports for the entire year of 1953 only reached $12,191,100,000, $998,800,000 less than in 1952. However, U.S. military supplies exports in 1953 reached $3,503,000,000, an increase of $1,515,000,000 over the previous year.

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, Washington Dispatch: Anthony Valente, president of the United Textile Workers of America, said: In the textile industry, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people accounts for about half of the entire textile industry's labor force.

In his statement to the Congressional Economic Committee on the 8th, he pointed out that since January 1953, 125,000 textile workers in the United States have lost their jobs, and another 375,000 textile workers are now working only two to four days a week.

Valente told the Congressional Economic Committee, which is holding a hearing on "anti-depression plans": "We can tell you that the textile industry is in a depression."

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th, Washington Dispatch: According to statistics released by the American Merchant Marine Institute on the 4th, 926,000 tons of American oil tankers are idle, 62 percent more than the oil tankers that were out of service a year ago. The institute pointed out that the occurrence of this idling situation is "mostly due to the reduction in freight volume."

Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, New York Dispatch: With the increasing decline in economic activity, the number of unemployed people in the United States is rapidly increasing. Driven by unemployment and poverty, suicides among working people are increasing.

According to an Associated Press report on the 6th, more than 370,000 newly unemployed workers were registered last week, and the total number of newly registered unemployed people in the three weeks ending February 6 exceeded one million. Materials released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the 9th showed that from December of last year to January of this year, the total number of non-agricultural employees in the United States decreased by 2 million, including a decrease of 380,000 in manufacturing employment and a decrease of 270,000 in construction employment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report admitted that the decrease in factory employment in this month was "more than usual," and it was the largest decrease in this season since January 1949. At the same time, according to Labor Statistics Bureau Director Clague, the work of employed workers has also been reduced. From December to January, employed workers had an average of only 39.4 hours of work per week, which is lower than the level in January in recent years. Therefore, in manufacturing, construction, transportation and other sectors, not only is unemployment extremely serious, but also the wage income of employed workers is rapidly decreasing.

The deteriorating economic situation is driving American working people to suicide. New York newspapers reported three cases of suicide in four days because they were forced by local authorities to move out of their homes. On February 2, seaman Stuart committed suicide due to unemployment and economic hardship. On February 4, 58-year-old widow Fickaro from a Brooklyn slum jumped to her death. On February 5, 60-year-old poor worker Robinson committed suicide.

Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, TASS News Agency, New York, February 11th:
  The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" published a news item saying that thousands of cotton planting workers in Missouri have no work and are starving. The newspaper pointed out:
  "In the heart of Missouri's cotton planting area, there are more people starving this year than at any time since the economic depression of the early 1930s."
  Local authorities admit that in only one cotton planting area in Missouri (the Caruthersville area), "there are six to eight thousand people who have lost any hope of finding work and have not had a piece of bread for two or three days." The newspaper pointed out that one of the reasons for the increase in unemployment among cotton planting workers is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's decision to reduce the cotton planting area.

Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, Washington Dispatch: The U.S. Department of Labor announced on the 8th that Detroit, the largest automobile industrial center in the United States, is a city with "substantial" unemployment. The Department of Labor's report, released after a special survey of the Detroit area, said that in mid-January, 117,000 workers in the area were unemployed, and by the end of January, the number of unemployed people was still increasing. The report pointed out that the "critical reason" for the increase in unemployment is the auto industry's layoffs.

According to United Press International, the Department of Labor's announcement has brought the number of major industrial centers that have been declared to have "substantial" unemployment to twenty-one so far. In addition, thirty-one smaller cities have also been declared as "substantial" unemployment areas.

    美国钢铁生产继续下降商品输出继续减少
    工人失业人数日益增加，自杀事件越来越多
    【新华社十日讯】纽约消息：据美国冶金业杂志“钢业”说，今年一月份美国钢铁生产已下降至一九五二年钢铁大罢工以来的最低水平。钢铁生产下降是因为钢铁消费量日益减少。
    “钢业”杂志说：在二月六日为止的一周内，钢铁工业的开工率仅为百分之七十三·九，而一年前则为百分之九十七·七。“钢业”杂志承认，由于需求量的下降，“人们对于”二月份“钢铁产量会比一月份多的信心已经不如以前了”。
    冶金业另一份杂志“钢铁时代”也说：如果炼钢开工率“在今年上半年大部分时间内停留在百分之七十几的水平，那将不会令人惊奇。”该杂志说，许多钢铁资本家目前想像中的好年头已经不是生产急剧上升，而是仅仅希望能够勉强维持现状了。在销售市场日益缩小的情况下，美国大小钢铁公司已经展开了激烈竞争，“除了减低基本价格以外，生产者正在采取他们可以想到的差不多每一种办法来招揽生意。”实际上，许多公司已经实行取消运费之类变相减价的办法。
    【新华社十一日讯】华盛顿消息：美国政府发表的报告显示，美国一九五三年商品出口比一九五二年又减少近十亿美元。
    国情普查局五日发表的报告说，正常的商品输出一九五三年全年只达到一百二十一亿九千一百万美元，比一九五二年少九亿九千八百万美元。但是一九五三年美国军事物资的输出达三十五亿零三百万美元，比前一年增加了一十五亿一千五百万美元。
    【新华社十一日讯】华盛顿消息：美国联合纺织工人工会主席安东尼·瓦伦特说：在纺织业中，失业和半失业的人数约占整个纺织工业劳动力的一半。
    他在八日向国会经济委员会提出的声明中指出，自一九五三年一月以来，美国已有十二万五千名纺织工人失去工作，还有三十七万五千名纺织工人现在每周仅作两天到四天工作。
    瓦伦特向正在举行“反萧条计划”意见听取会的国会经济委员会说：“我们可以告诉你们，纺织工业是萧条了。”
      【新华社十一日讯】华盛顿消息：据美国商船航运研究所四日发表的统计，九十二万六千吨美国油船闲着无事，比一年前停驶的油船要多百分之六十二。该研究所指出，这种闲着无事的情况的发生，“多半由于货运的减少”。
      【新华社十二日讯】纽约消息：在经济活动日益衰落的情况下，美国的失业人数正在迅速增加。在失业和贫困交迫下，劳动人民自杀事件愈来愈多。
    据美联社六日消息说，在上周，新登记失业的工人就有三十七万多人，总计在二月六日为止的三周内新登记失业的人数超过一百万。美国劳工统计局九日发表的材料说明，从去年十二月到今年一月，美国全国非农业的就业人数总共减少了二百万，其中制造业就业人数减少三十八万，建筑业就业人数减少二十七万。劳工统计局的报告承认，这一个月中工厂就业人数的减少“比通常要多些”，而且是从一九四九年一月以来这一季节中人数减少得最多的一次。同时，据劳工统计局局长克拉格说，在业工人的工作也缩减了。从十二月到一月间，在业工人平均每周已只有三十九点四小时工作可做，比最近几年内一月间的水平都要低。因此，在制造业、建筑业与运输业等部门，不仅失业现象极为严重，而且在业工人的工资收入正在急剧减少。
    恶劣的经济情况把美国劳动人民逼上自杀的道路。纽约报纸在四天里就接连报道了三宗因为被地方当局逼迫迁出住处而自杀的案件。在二月二日，海员斯图特自杀，原因是失业与经济困难。二月四日，布鲁克林贫民窟五十八岁的寡妇费卡罗跳楼自杀。在二月五日，六十岁的贫苦工人罗宾逊自杀。
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社纽约十一日讯：
  “圣路易邮报”刊载了一条消息，说密苏里州有数千名植棉工人没有工作，正在挨饿。该报指出：
  “在密苏里州植棉区中心，今年挨饿的人比三十年代初的经济萧条以来任何时期都要多。”
    地方当局承认，仅在密苏里州的一个植棉区
  （卡鲁特斯维尔区）中，“就有六千到八千人失去了任何找到工作的希望，两三天没有得到一片面包”。该报指出，植棉工人失业人数增加的原因之一是美国农业部决定缩小棉花播种面积。
    【新华社十二日讯】华盛顿消息：美国劳工部八日宣布美国最大的汽车工业中心底特律为有“大量”失业的城市。劳工部在对底特律地区进行特别调查以后发表的报告说，在一月中旬，该地区已有十一万七千工人失业，在一月底，失业人数还在继续增加。报告指出，失业增加的“关键性原因”是汽车工业解雇工人。
    据合众社说，劳工部这一宣布使得到目前为止已被宣布为有“大量”失业的大工业中心达到二十一个，此外还有三十一个较小的城市也已被宣布为有“大量”失业地区。
