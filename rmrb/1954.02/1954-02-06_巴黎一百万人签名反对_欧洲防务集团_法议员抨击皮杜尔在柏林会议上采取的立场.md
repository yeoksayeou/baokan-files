Xinhua News Agency, February 5th dispatch from Paris: A rally protesting the establishment of a "European Army" was held on February 3rd on Rue Saint-Denis in Paris. Former Popular Republican Movement member and parliamentarian André Denis, French Communist Party Secretary Jacques Duclos, former minister Reynaud Gaby Tanguy, National Assembly member Maurice Benard, and Radical Socialist Party members all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously condemned the policy of arming West Germany under the guise of the "European Army." André Denis said: "The 'European Defense Community' must be abandoned, because peace and negotiation are based on this."

In Paris, one million people have already signed a petition protesting the establishment of the "European Defense Community."

Veterans and resistance movement participant groups have also written to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference being held in Berlin, hoping that the conference will take steps to prevent the revival of German militarism and expressing firm opposition to the Bonn-Paris war treaty.

On January 31st, hundreds of women from all over France convened a meeting in Paris to discuss the issue of striving for peace and opposing the revival of German militarism. The meeting passed a letter to women across France and resolved to send a copy of this document to the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the French government.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th dispatch from Paris on February 4th: Philippe Barrès, a member of the French National Assembly, published an article in "Le Monde" commenting on the work of the Berlin Conference and the position taken by the French delegation.

Barrès mentioned Bidault's statement at the Berlin Conference. Bidault said that he would never agree to "bargain with the European Defense Community." Barrès emphasized that "this position is suitable for the Americans." Barrès pointed out that a large number of French parliamentarians believe that the "European Defense Community" is a fatal danger to France.

Barrès said: "The US government... wants France to abandon its policy of peace-loving and occupy a position lower than Germany in an anti-Soviet alliance called the European Defense Community."

    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：二月三日在巴黎圣但尼街举行了一个抗议建立“欧洲军”的集会。前人民共和党党员、议员安德烈·德尼、法国共产党书记雅克·杜克洛、前部长雷纳·加比唐、国民议会议员莫里斯·贝纳以及激进社会党人等都在会上讲了话。他们一致斥责在“欧洲军”掩盖下武装西德的政策。安德烈·德尼说：“必须放弃‘欧洲防务集团’，因为和平与协商是以此为依据的。”
    在巴黎，已经有一百万人在抗议建立“欧洲防务集团”的请愿书上签了名。
    退伍军人和抵抗运动参加者团体也写信给正在柏林开会的四国外长会议，希望会议采取步骤以阻止德国军国主义复活，并表示坚决反对波恩与巴黎战争条约。
    一月三十一日，有数百名来自法国各地的妇女在巴黎召开会议，讨论争取和平和反对德国军国主义复活的问题。会议通过了告法国全国妇女书，并决议将这个文件的副本送给柏林四国外长会议和法国政府。
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社巴黎四日讯：法国国民议会议员菲利普·巴尔在“新闻报”上发表了一篇文章，评述柏林会议的工作及法国代表团所采取的立场。
    巴尔提到皮杜尔在柏林会议上的声明。皮杜尔说他决不同意“以欧洲防务集团来进行讨价还价”。巴尔强调指出：“这种立场是适合于美国人的立场”，巴尔指出，有很大一部分法国议员认为“欧洲防务集团”对法国来说，是一个致命的危险。
    巴尔说：“美国政府……要法国放弃它爱好和平的政策，而在一个叫做欧洲防务集团的反苏联盟中占有低于德国的地位。”
