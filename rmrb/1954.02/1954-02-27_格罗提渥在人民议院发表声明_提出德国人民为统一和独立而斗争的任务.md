Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 25th: TASS reported that on February 24th, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, delivered a government statement in the People's Chamber. He analyzed the progress and results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference and pointed out the tasks the Berlin Conference brought to the German people, especially the German Democratic Republic.

Grotewohl began by saying that the Berlin Conference made some important resolutions. The positive significance of the Foreign Ministers Conference is undeniable, primarily because the conference situation explained to world public opinion the positions of the four major powers on important international issues, and also reached important agreements on several major international issues. In addition, the German people can also draw important lessons from the results of the conference.

Grotewohl emphasized that this conference told the German people that consultation and agreement, which serve as the basis for the peaceful policies of the German Democratic Republic, are possible. He pointed out that the four foreign ministers are willing to take measures to smoothly resolve the issue of disarmament, or at least the issue of substantial reduction of armaments, and decided to convene a conference in Geneva in April 1954 by the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina.

Grotewohl said that without a doubt, these achievements can encourage the German people, who are striving for agreement and solving their national problems, to continue their struggle for a peace treaty and reunification more actively.

In his statement, Otto Grotewohl pointed out that Western countries—especially the United States—and the Bonn government, colluding with them, do not want a peaceful solution to the German question because they are trying to obstruct the easing of international tensions at any cost and want to solve the impending crisis by creating a new war. Grotewohl then said that the government of the German Democratic Republic, in accordance with the will of the peace-loving people of all Germany, submitted a memorandum to the Four Powers Conference on the peaceful settlement of the German question, acting as the representative of all the German people. This memorandum is in line with the true national interests of the German people and puts forward the only possible view of the people of East and West Germany on their vital national issues.

Grotewohl then spoke about the attitude adopted by the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Speaking of the suggestions made by the Soviet delegation when discussing the second agenda item "The German Question and the Task of Ensuring European Security," Otto Grotewohl said: At the Four Power Conference, only the Soviet Union put forward constructive and reasonable suggestions that promoted peace and the international security of all peoples and were in line with the suggestions of the German Democratic Republic.

We, representing all peace-loving German people in the East and West, would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Soviet government, the Soviet delegation, and especially the Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov.

The Soviet delegation embraced the desire to conclude an agreement that would not infringe upon the interests of others but would be acceptable to all conference participants and would be in line with the vital interests of all large and small countries.

Otto Grotewohl criticized the attitude of the Western countries at the Berlin Conference towards the constructive suggestions made by the Soviet delegation on easing international tensions and peacefully resolving outstanding international issues.

Speaking of the Bonn government's attitude towards the results of the Berlin Four Power Conference, especially towards the Soviet proposals, Otto Grotewohl mentioned Adenauer's speech at a rally in West Berlin on February 23. Grotewohl exposed the hypocrisy of this speech and emphasized that the Adenauer government's policies violate the interests of the German people and will eventually be spurned.

It is known that the representatives of the Western occupying authorities recently put forward a suggestion to the Soviet High Commissioner in Germany, requesting to discuss the traffic issues between East and West Germany and the issue of the circulation of printed matter in Germany. Grotewohl pointed out the appeasing nature of this suggestion and said that the Soviet delegation had made many constructive suggestions on these issues at the Berlin Conference, but had not received a response from the Western representatives. At the same time, Grotewohl said that the issues of traffic and the circulation of books between West Germany and the German Democratic Republic are entirely matters for the German people themselves, and the government of the German Democratic Republic, which has exercised administrative functions since its establishment, has suggested to the West German representatives to discuss the above issues, but has not received a response from them.

In this regard, Grotewohl emphasized that the government of the German Democratic Republic advocates that all people should be able to move freely throughout the country, but cannot agree to creating opportunities for the agents of the Bonn Blank War Department, Gehlen's spy organization, and other terrorist and spy organizations to infiltrate the German Democratic Republic and operate in this part of Germany. Grotewohl went on to say that the government of the German Democratic Republic does not intend to punish those honest Germans who, under the influence of hostile imperialist propaganda, left the territory of the German Democratic Republic and later returned to the German Democratic Republic.

Grotewohl then spoke about the tasks of the German people to further struggle to defend peace and to restore German unity and independence in accordance with peaceful and democratic principles.

Based on the negative attitude of the Western countries on this issue and the positive attitude of the Soviet Union, the German people come to an inevitable conclusion: it is necessary to further strengthen friendship with the Soviet Union—the bulwark of world peace—than before.

Does not the Soviet Union's view that the solution of the German question is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves, and that the German people must participate in the conference to discuss this issue, clearly conform to the interests of the German people?

Did not the Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov's suggestion to hold a referendum on the war treaty and the peace treaty clearly conform to the national interests of the German people?

Yes, these suggestions of the Soviet Union, as well as all other suggestions of the Soviet Union, are fully in line with the vital interests of the German people.

Only by Adenauer and the American imperialists not concluding military alliances, only by not forming a German mercenary army, can a sovereign, new, democratic, and peaceful Germany be established. Only under such circumstances can the security of the people of Europe be guaranteed.

Germany's future policy must provide affirmative guarantees in this regard. These guarantees are as follows:

One: A unified Germany must be democratic and peace-loving. Anti-democratic forces and groups and militaristic and fascist organizations are not allowed to exist; monopoly capital must not exert any influence on German policy.

Two: Germany must not participate in military alliances.

Three: A German self-defense army can only be established within the limits of common agreement.

Four: The security of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries must be guaranteed against German aggression.

Five: The security of Germany's Western neighbors must be guaranteed accordingly.

This will prevent Germany from engaging in any military aggression in any direction.

For this purpose, the Germans must reach an agreement themselves, stipulating the stages for restoring national unity—establishing a provisional government, drafting election laws, holding truly free and democratic elections, and convening a national assembly.

Such a policy means abolishing the Bonn and Paris treaties and eliminating the aggressive militarism that is being revived in West Germany. Such a policy can guarantee the security of the countries that have been attacked by Germany twice, and can guarantee the security of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, and other countries that have been ravaged by German militarism and fascism.

Such a policy will eliminate the threat of civil war in Germany and eliminate the terrible threat of Germany becoming a strategic springboard and main battlefield for the war planned by the United States.

Therefore, the government of the German Democratic Republic welcomes the Soviet delegation's suggestion at the Four Power Conference stipulating that Germany shall not build up arms before an agreement on a peace treaty is reached and guaranteeing Germany's neutrality for a certain period of time.

In this regard, another suggestion of the Soviet Union—concluding a pan-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe—is of great significance.

We believe that only the joint efforts of all peace-loving countries can guarantee European security and maintain peace, and we declare that the government of the German Democratic Republic, which has consistently pursued a policy of peace and international cooperation since its establishment, is ready to cooperate in such a European collective security system.

We believe that this is not in contradiction with the national interests of the German people. Establishing such a peace camp in Europe can also accelerate the solution of the German question. In addition, this treaty will eliminate the main obstacle encountered in solving the German question—dragging West Germany into the military bloc of some Western European countries, which is incompatible with the establishment of a peace-loving democratic Germany.

This treaty will prevent the formation of two opposing military blocs in Europe and will prevent the outbreak of another war. And this is the purpose and ardent desire of all the German people.

Precisely because of this, the German people must take decisive steps in this regard. At present, this step is to hold a referendum on the following question: Approve the conclusion of the Bonn Treaty and the "European Defense Community" treaty, or approve the conclusion of a peace treaty?

Although no agreement was reached on the German question at the Four Power Conference, these questions have not been removed from the agenda.

At present, we are more clearly aware of the difficulties we face. But we do not bow to difficulties. On the contrary, the struggle continues, and those who insisted that the Soviet Union regarded the German Democratic Republic as merely a pawn to be sacrificed at the appropriate moment now realize that they were wrong.

Today, the German Democratic Republic maintains close friendship with the great Soviet Union, and its position in the peace camp is more consolidated than ever before. The German Democratic Republic will continue to persevere in the struggle to solve the German national question, conclude a peace treaty, and re-establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

Otto Grotewohl's statement concluded with a call for the people to strengthen the German Democratic Republic—the bulwark of all German patriots in the struggle for peace and unity.

    格罗提渥在人民议院发表声明
    提出德国人民为统一和独立而斗争的任务
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林二十五日电：二月二十四日，德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥在人民议院中发表了一篇政府声明。他分析了柏林四国外长会议的进展和结果，并指出了柏林会议带给德国人民，尤其是德意志民主共和国的任务。
    格罗提渥开头说，柏林会议作出了一些重要的决议。外长会议的积极意义是无可怀疑的，这首先是由于会议情况向世界舆论说明了四大国对重要国际问题的立场，同时在若干重大国际问题上取得了重要的协议。此外，德国人民还可以从会议的结果中吸取重要的教训。
    格罗提渥强调说，这次会议告诉德国人民，作为德意志民主共和国的和平政策基础的协商和协议是可能的。他指出，四国外长都愿意采取措施以便顺利解决裁军问题，或者至少解决大量缩减军备问题，并决定于一九五四年四月在日内瓦召开苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国以及其他有关国家的会议，以和平解决朝鲜问题和讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。
    格罗提渥说，毫无疑问，对于争取协议和解决他们民族的问题的德国人民说来，这些成就可以鼓舞他们更加积极地继续进行争取和约和重新统一的斗争。
    奥托·格罗提渥在声明中指出，西方国家——尤其是美国——和与它们串通一气的波恩政府是不希望和平解决德国问题的，因为它们企图不惜任何代价来阻挠缓和国际紧张局势，并且想以制造新战争的办法来解决即将发生的危机。格罗提渥接着说，德意志民主共和国政府遵照全德和平人民的意志，以全体德国人民代表的身份，向四国会议提出了关于和平解决德国问题的备忘录。这个备忘录符合于德国人民的真正的民族利益，并提出了东德和西德的人民对于他们切身的民族问题唯一可能的看法。
    格罗提渥然后谈到苏联代表团在柏林四国外长会议上采取的态度。谈到苏联代表团在讨论第二项议程“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”时所提出的建议，奥托·格罗提渥说：在四国会议上，只有苏联提出了促进和平与各国人民的国际安全，并与德意志民主共和国的建议一致的、建设性的、合乎情理的建议。
    我们代表东部与西部的所有爱好和平的德国人民，谨向苏联政府、苏联代表团、尤其是苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫表示深切的感谢。
    苏联代表团抱着缔结协议的愿望，这种协议不致侵犯其他人的利益，而能为所有会议与会者所接受，而且是符合所有大、小国家的切身利益的。
    奥托·格罗提渥指责西方国家在柏林会议上对苏联代表团所提出的缓和国际紧张局势，并和平解决悬而未决的国际问题的建设性建议采取的态度。
    谈到波恩政府对于柏林四国会议结果的态度，尤其是对于苏联建议的态度，奥托·格罗提渥提到了阿登纳二月二十三日在西柏林的一次集会上的演说。格罗提渥揭发了这个演说的虚伪，并着重指出阿登纳政府的政策违反德国人民的利益，终久将被唾弃。
    大家知道，西方占领当局的代表最近向苏联驻德高级专员提出了一个建议，要求讨论东西德的交通问题以及印刷品在德国流通的问题。格罗提渥指出了这个建议的笼络人心的性质，并且说，苏联代表团在柏林会议上曾就这些问题提出许多建设性的建议，但是没有得到西方代表的答复。同时，格罗提渥说，西德与德意志民主共和国之间的交通以及书籍的流通等等问题完全是德国人民自己的事情，从一成立以后就行使行政职务的德意志民主共和国政府已经向西德代表建议讨论上述问题，但是没有得到他们的答复。
    在这方面，格罗提渥着重指出，德意志民主共和国政府主张全体人民都应该能够在全国自由行动，但是不能同意创造机会使波恩布兰克战争部、盖伦的间谍组织以及其他的恐怖组织和间谍组织的特务得以渗入德意志民主共和国，并在德国的这一部分活动。格罗提渥接着说，德意志民主共和国政府迄今并不打算处分那些在敌对的帝国主义宣传的影响下离开德意志民主共和国的领土，后来又回到德意志民主共和国来的正直的德国人。
    格罗提渥然后谈到德国人民为保卫和平，为根据和平与民主方针恢复德国统一和独立而进一步斗争的任务。
    根据西方国家在这个问题上所抱的否定态度和苏联的积极态度，德国人民得出一个当然的结论：必须比以前更进一步加强与苏联——世界和平的堡垒——的友谊。
    苏联认为，解决德国问题首先是德国人民自己的事情，必须让德国人民参加会议对这个问题的讨论，难道苏联这种说法不是明显地符合于德国人民的利益的吗？
    苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫建议就战争条约与和约举行公民投票，难道他这个建议不是明显地符合于德国人民的民族利益的吗？
    是的，苏联的这些建议，以及苏联所有其他的建议是完全符合于德国人民的切身利益的。
    只有阿登纳和美帝国主义者不缔结军事同盟，只有不组成德国雇佣军，才可能成立一个有主权的、新的、民主的与和平的德国。只有在这种情况下，欧洲各国人民的安全才能有保证。
    德国今后的政策必须在这方面给以肯定的保证。这些保证如下：
    一、统一的德国必须是民主的与爱好和平的。不许反民主势力和集团与军国主义和法西斯组织存在；垄断资本不得对德国政策施以任何影响。
    二、德国不得参加军事同盟。
    三、只能在共同协议的限度以内建立一支德国的自卫军队。
    四、必须保证苏联和人民民主国家的安全，不受德国的侵略。
    五、必须相应保证德国的西方邻国的安全。
    这将阻止德国向任何方面进行任何军事侵略行为。
    为了这个目的，德国人必须自己取得协议，规定恢复国家统一的各阶段——成立临时政府，草拟选举法，举行真正自由的民主选举和召开国民议会。
    这样一种政策意味着废除波恩和巴黎条约、消灭正在西德复活起来的侵略性的军国主义。这样一种政策就能保证曾经两次受德国攻击的国家的安全，就能保证苏联、人民民主国家、法国、比利时、荷兰、挪威、丹麦和其他曾受德国军国主义和法西斯主义蹂躏的国家的安全。
    这样一个政策将消除德国内战的威胁，消除德国变成美国策划的战争的战略跳板和主要战场的可怕的威胁。
    因此，德意志民主共和国政府欢迎苏联代表团在四国会议上所提出的、规定在就和约达成协议前德国不得建设武装以及在一定时期内保证德国中立的建议。
    在这一方面，苏联的另外一个建议——缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约——具有很重大的意义。
    我们认为只有所有爱好和平的国家共同努力才能保障欧洲的安全，并维护和平，我们宣布，自从成立之日起就一贯执行和平政策和国际合作政策的德意志民主共和国政府准备在这样一个欧洲集体安全体系中合作。
    我们认为这一点与德国人民的民族利益并没有矛盾。在欧洲建立这样一个和平阵营还可加速德国问题的解决。此外，这个条约将消除在解决德国问题时所遇到的主要障碍——把西德拖入某些西欧国家的军事集团，这种做法是与建立一个爱好和平的民主德国不相容的。
    这种条约将防止欧洲形成两个对立的军事集团，将防止另一次战争的爆发。而这是全体德国人民的目的和热烈的愿望。
    正是因为这样，德国人民必须在这方面采取决定性步骤。目前，这种步骤就是对下面这个问题举行公民投票：赞成缔结波恩条约和“欧洲防务集团”条约还是赞成缔结和约？
    虽然德国问题没有在四国会议上达成协议，但这些问题并未从日程上除去。
    目前，我们更加清楚地认识到我们所面临的困难。但是我们并不向困难低头。相反地，斗争在继续进行着，那些硬说苏联把德意志民主共和国当作只是在适当的时刻进行交易的牺牲品的人，现在认识到他们是错了。
    今天，德意志民主共和国与伟大的苏联维持着紧密的友谊，它在和平阵营中的地位比以前任何时候更加巩固了。德意志民主共和国将为解决德国民族的问题、缔结和约、重新建立一个统一、民主、爱好和平的德国而继续坚持不懈地进行斗争。
    奥托·格罗提渥的声明最后号召人民加强德意志民主共和国——德国所有爱国者在争取和平和统一的斗争中的堡垒。
