    Beijing Holds Meeting of Representatives of Families of Martyrs, Military Dependents, and Disabled Soldiers; Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai Attends and Speaks
    [Xinhua News Agency News] The Beijing Municipal People's Government held a citywide representative meeting of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers on February 12th. A total of 541 representatives attended the meeting. Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, delivered an important speech at the meeting.
    At the meeting, Ma Yuhuai, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, gave a report on preferential treatment work. Ma Yuhuai pointed out that Beijing's preferential treatment work has implemented the policy of "focusing on organizing production and introducing employment," and has made considerable achievements in 1953. In urban areas, in order to cultivate employment conditions for families of martyrs and military dependents, five political and technical training classes have been held successively, enabling more than 1,600 people to find jobs; after rectifying the 24 military dependents production units organized in the past, 18 have been transformed into production cooperatives. In rural areas, the work of land cultivation on behalf of others has been universally rectified, and many families of martyrs and military dependents have participated in mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives, ensuring that the land yield of families of martyrs and military dependents is not lower than the level of the general public. Material subsidies were provided to poor and orphaned, elderly, disabled, and sick families of martyrs and military dependents. In addition, pensions and resettlement were provided for revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers. Ma Yuhuai pointed out that mass preferential treatment work has also been greatly developed in 1953. The political consciousness of families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers has generally improved, and many exemplary figures have emerged. Ma Yuhuai talked about the preferential treatment work in 1954, saying that according to the resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, it is determined to continue to focus on organizing production and employment, do a good job in employment in cities; mobilize and organize families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas, and pay special attention to strengthening the political and ideological education of families of martyrs and military dependents.
    Minister Xie Juezai then spoke at the meeting (full text to be published separately, see page 3).
    Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, also spoke at the meeting. He hoped that everyone would frequently offer opinions on the preferential treatment work, and stated that the Municipal People's Government guarantees to do a better job in preferential treatment work in the future. He also encouraged everyone to play an exemplary and leading role in various tasks, and maintain and promote the glory already gained.
    Many representatives spoke at the meeting, expressing heartfelt gratitude for the care of the People's Government and people from all walks of life, and stated that they would actively respond to the government's call, become models for the masses in various tasks, and strive for greater glory.
    The meeting finally passed a letter of respect to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    After the meeting, Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, hosted a banquet for all the representatives.

    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] The capital's large-scale movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to military families is continuing.
    In order to allow the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing to celebrate the Spring Festival happily, the districts have staged at least 200 performances of movies, Peking opera, song and dance, and dramas for them. All sixteen major cinemas in the city are now offering free movie tickets to them. Famous Peking opera actors Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Fuying, Zhang Junqiu, Wu Suqiu, and others have also performed many wonderful programs for the families of martyrs and military dependents. The film projection team of the Cultural Department of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the Beijing People's Art Theater, the Central Experimental Opera House, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the China Acrobatic Troupe, the Central Broadcasting Ballad Music Troupe, and other units have all gone to the suburbs to perform for the families of martyrs and military dependents. Many government agencies, organizations, factories, and schools have also organized various cultural and artistic evenings and film screenings to express their regards to the families of martyrs and military dependents and local troops.
    In recent days, various districts have successively held army-government-people joint celebration meetings. At these meetings, the families of martyrs, military dependents, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, troops stationed in the area, cadres of the district people's government, and people from all walks of life gathered together to enjoy wonderful cultural and entertainment programs. At the meeting, everyone congratulated each other on a happy Spring Festival and good health. The stationed troops and the local government also presented banners to each other. The heads of the district people's governments also held a get-together with the heads of the local troops. A forum of representatives of the stationed troops was also held. In order to celebrate the meritorious service of hundreds of family members of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army who made meritorious service in 1953, all districts held celebration meetings. At the celebration meeting of more than 1,700 people held in Xisi District on the evening of February 9, the District People's Government and the representatives of the stationed troops personally hung glorious flowers on the families of meritorious personnel and presented meritorious service reports. The audience warmly applauded and congratulated these glorious revolutionary families.
    At the forums of families of martyrs, military dependents, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers held in various districts, the preferential treatment work over the past year was reviewed. At the meeting, the families of martyrs and military dependents expressed their infinite gratitude for the cordial concern of the People's Government. Sun, an old woman from the family of a Chinese People's Volunteer in Dongsi District, was elected as a district people's representative in this general election. She said at the forum: "We must do a good job in the street work and challenge her son." At the forum of demobilized and transferred soldiers and revolutionary disabled soldiers held in this district, the demobilized soldiers who have already joined the workforce said: "We must carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Army and work hard to respond to the care of the government and the people."

    在各区召开的烈属、军属及复员转业军人、革命残废军人座谈会上，检查了一年来的优抚工作。会上，烈属、军属们对人民政府的亲切关怀都表示无限感激。东四区中国人民志愿军家属孙老太太在这次普选中当选为区人民代表，她在座谈会上表示：一定要做好街道工作，和她的儿子挑战。在这个区召开的复员转业军人和革命残废军人座谈会上，已经参加工作的复员军人表示：要发扬人民军队的光荣传统，努力工作，来回答政府和人民的关怀。
