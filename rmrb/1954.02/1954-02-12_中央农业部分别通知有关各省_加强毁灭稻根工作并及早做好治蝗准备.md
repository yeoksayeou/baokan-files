The Central Ministry of Agriculture recently issued two notices, requesting relevant provinces to strengthen the destruction of rice roots to reduce stem borer damage and to prepare for locust control work early this year.

The notice on destroying rice roots stated: The progress of rice root destruction work is currently very uneven across various regions. Apart from some areas in Fujian, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces that have done relatively well, generally no action has been taken yet. According to recent inspections in Zhejiang, Anhui, and other places, there are approximately 5,000 to 34,000 overwintering stem borers per mu of rice roots, of which over 80-90% are live insects. If farmers are not promptly led to destroy rice roots, it will seriously affect this year's rice production increase. The notice also requested that all regions plow and turn over hardened rice paddies, collect and destroy rice roots. Fields that are difficult to plow should be dug up and destroyed, and fields with convenient water sources can be flooded and rotted. Spring flower fields and green manure fields should also carry out rice root destruction work as much as possible. In areas with severe rice stem borer infestation, in addition to destroying rice roots, weeds near the fields should also be cleared. The rice roots dug up or collected and the weeds hoed must be thoroughly treated by burning,沤 composting, or other methods in conjunction with manure accumulation.

The notice on preparing for locust control stated: Due to the inadequate locust control last autumn, the area and density of residual locusts and surviving eggs are relatively large. According to preliminary inspections in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Suiyuan, Xinjiang and other provinces, the area with eggs reaches more than 4 million mu. Generally, there are 5 to 11 egg masses per square zhang, and some areas have more than 25. If the climate and rainfall are suitable in April and May this year, summer locusts may occur severely. Therefore, all regions must make all preparations: quickly rectify and improve locust control institutions, train locust control cadres, and prepare and transport a sufficient quantity of pesticides, machinery, and wheat bran. In areas where egg surveys have not yet been conducted, supplementary surveys can be carried out after thawing to make timely forecasts.

    中央农业部分别通知有关各省
    加强毁灭稻根工作并及早做好治蝗准备
    中央人民政府农业部最近发出两个通知，要求有关各省加强毁灭稻根减轻螟害和及早做好今年治蝗准备工作。
    毁灭稻根的通知中说：目前各地毁灭稻根工作的开展极不平衡，除福建、湖南、江西等省部分地区做得较好外，一般都还没有行动起来。根据最近浙江、安徽等地检查，稻根中过冬螟虫每亩地约有五千到三、四万个，其中百分之八、九十以上为活虫。如不及时领导农民毁灭稻根，必将严重影响今年水稻增产。通知并要求各地耕翻板田，拾毁稻根，耕翻困难的田应进行挖毁，水源方便的田可灌水沤毁。春花田和绿肥田也要尽可能进行毁灭稻根的工作。二化螟严重地区，除毁灭稻根外，还要清除田旁杂草。挖起或拾起的稻根和锄割的杂草，必须结合积肥，用烧、沤等办法彻底处理。
    准备治蝗的通知说：由于去年秋蝗防治不够彻底，残蝗遗卵面积和密度较大。据江苏、安徽、山东、河北、河南、绥远、新疆等省初步检查，有卵面积达四百多万亩，一般地区每平方丈有五至十一个块卵，有的地区在二十五块以上。如果今年四、五月间气候雨量适合，夏蝗可能严重发生。因此，各地必须做好一切准备工作：迅速整顿与健全治蝗事业机构，训练治蝗干部，准备与调运足够数量的药械、麦麸。在尚未进行过查卵地区，在解冻后可进行补查，及时作好预测工作。
