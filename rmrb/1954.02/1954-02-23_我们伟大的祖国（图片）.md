    Our Great Motherland
    The iron-smelting furnace of the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant has been successfully rebuilt according to Soviet design. The six iron-smelting furnaces, which suffered severe damage from the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits and had been shut down for more than eight years, are now all producing iron. Shanghai's steelmaking and machinery manufacturing industries can obtain pig iron supplies from here. This is a night view of the blast furnace tapping.

    国营马鞍山铁厂炼铁炉，已按照苏联的设计改建成功。遭受日寇和国民党匪帮严重的破坏、停火八年多的六座炼铁炉，已全部出铁，上海市炼钢及机器制造业，就可以从这里得到生铁的供应。这是高炉出铁时的夜景。
