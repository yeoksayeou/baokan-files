    With the help of the state's electric-powered pumping station,
    Riverside paddy fields in the tenth district of Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, have reaped bumper harvests year after year.
    With the help of the state electric-powered pumping irrigation station, farmers planting paddy fields along the Songhua River in the tenth district of Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, have overcome natural disasters such as drought and flood, and have achieved large-scale bumper harvests year after year.
    The riverside area of the tenth district of Huachuan County is low-lying and prone to waterlogging. Many cultivated lands have become wilderness. In 1948, the state built an electric pumping station here, fundamentally changing the past impoverished situation. Although drought and flood disasters have continued to occur in this area in recent years, output has continued to increase. Even in 1949, when a severe drought occurred, the paddy fields in this area still achieved a bumper harvest of 6,400 catties of rice per hectare because the irrigation station used electricity to power the machines and supplied sufficient water. In 1953, when widespread flooding occurred in various places, the paddy fields in the tenth district of Huachuan were able to appropriately reduce the water supply based on the water needs of the paddy fields, and opened the downstream outlet sluice gates to allow excess water to flow into the Songhua River, avoiding flood damage, because of the use of electric machinery for water supply. After the autumn harvest, the rice yield was more than 9,000 catties per hectare. The average yield of many agricultural producers' cooperatives exceeded 10,000 catties per hectare, with the highest reaching 12,000 catties.
    Over the years, the staff of the state irrigation station have been considerate of the farmer brothers in every way, overcoming numerous difficulties, and continuously improving operating techniques and strengthening business management, so that the irrigated area has increased from 600 hectares in 1948 to the current 2,100 hectares; water conservancy costs have also decreased year by year, increasing farmers' income. In 1952, when the rice was budding, the No. 2 electric roller suddenly broke down. In order to ensure a good harvest of paddy fields, the pumping station director Li Yongfu and electrician Zhao Qianzhen and other comrades rushed to repair it overnight, ensuring timely water supply and a guaranteed bumper harvest.
    At present, the state irrigation station is taking advantage of the winter leisure time to overhaul machinery and carry out design work, preparing to expand the irrigated area by another 400 hectares this year, and plans to give full play to the efficiency of existing machinery within five years, so that the irrigated area will be doubled again.

    在国家电力机械抽水站的帮助下
    松江省桦川县十区沿江水田年年丰收
    松江省桦川县十区松花江沿岸种水田的农民，在国家电力机械抽水灌溉站的帮助下，战胜了旱涝等自然灾害，连年获得大面积丰收。
    桦川县十区沿江地带，地势低洼，经常发生内涝，好多熟地变成了荒野。一九四八年，国家在这里修建了电力抽水厂，根本改变了过去贫穷的状况。几年来这一带虽然不断发生旱涝等灾害，但产量却不断提高。就在一九四九年发生严重旱灾的时候，这一带的水田由于灌溉站用电力发动机器供给了充足的水量，仍然获得每垧产六千四百斤水稻的丰收。一九五三年各地普遍发生水涝时，桦川十区的水田却因为是发动电力机械供水，根据水田用水的情况，适当地减少了水的供应量，并打开下游出口的水闸，使多余的水流入松花江，避免了涝害。秋后水稻产量每垧都在九千斤以上，好多生产合作社的平均产量每垧都超过一万斤，最高的达到一万二千斤。
    几年来，国家灌溉站的职工，处处为农民弟兄打算，克服重重困难，不断地改进操作技术和加强经营管理，使灌溉面积从一九四八年的六百垧增加到现在的两千一百垧；水利费用也逐年降低，增加了农民的收入。一九五二年正在稻子打苞的时候，二号电滚突然坏了，为了保证水田丰收，抽水厂厂长李永福和电工赵乾珍等同志就连夜赶修，保证了及时供水，保证了丰收。
    目前，国家灌溉站正利用冬闲时间检修机器和进行设计工作，准备今年再扩大灌溉面积四百垧，并计划在五年内充分发挥现有机器效能，使灌溉面积再扩大一倍。
