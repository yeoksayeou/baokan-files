    Our Party and the state's general line during the transition period is to develop China's socialist industry in a planned way, transform various non-socialist economic components into socialist economic components, and transform China from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country. The central link of the first Five-Year Plan formulated according to the general line of the transition period is to concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry. This requires the construction of many magnificent large-scale projects. To complete the construction of these huge projects, a large amount of funds and a large number of cadres are required. In order to solve the problems of funds and cadres necessary for national industrialization, we must vigorously increase production and practice economy, accumulate funds from all aspects, and rationally use and vigorously train various construction talents. Therefore, streamlining state organs and various public institutions, and tightening administrative expenditures, is of great significance at present. When various organs streamline their organizations, reduce personnel, and reduce expenditures, the money saved and the cadres who meet the conditions can be used in the industrial front. At present, people from all walks of life, state organs, and public institutions across the country are deeply studying the general line of the state during the transition period and are actively improving their work in conjunction with the study of the general line to improve work efficiency, streamline organizations, and tighten administrative expenditures. This has become an urgent task for the staff of state organs and public institutions.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our state organs and other various public institutions were successively established and developed to meet the needs of various democratic reforms and economic recovery work. Without these state organs and various public institutions that developed with the development of the situation, it would have been impossible to complete such arduous and complex work during the recovery period in just four years. However, in the development and establishment of state organs and other various public institutions, many work were newly created, and there was a lack of experience. In addition, the subjectivism of certain organs, greed for more and bigger things, and blind development have resulted in many organs having unreasonable phenomena to varying degrees in terms of organizational structure and work system, such as bloated organizations, overlapping levels, unclear division of labor, and overstaffing. This has expanded administrative expenditures, increased the burden on the state, accumulated cadres, wasted talents, and fostered bureaucracy. Therefore, it is not only possible to help the country accumulate funds and prepare cadres for industrialization to carry out a comprehensive reorganization of staffing and streamlining of organizations in the state organs and various public institutions from top to bottom, but also to overcome bureaucracy, overcome subjectivism and decentralism, and make state organs more capable and more combative.
    Frequently paying attention to improving state organs, streamlining organizations, and tightening administrative expenditures is an important experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin to ensure capital accumulation and overcome bureaucracy. Lenin said: "We must make our state apparatus as economical as possible. We must banish from it all traces of extravagance, of which so much has been left over from tsarist Russia, from its bureaucratic capitalist state apparatus.” He also said: "Only by thoroughly purging our government apparatus, by reducing it to the utmost, shall we be certain of holding on.” (“Better Fewer, But Better”). When the Soviet Union entered the period of struggle to realize the socialist industrialization of the country, Stalin pointed out in his historically significant report "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Policy of the Party" in April 1926: "It is necessary to streamline and reorganize our state and cooperative organs, our People's Commissariats and economic accounting organs from bottom to top. The huge staffing and unparalleled waste of our management organs have become the subject of general talk. No wonder Lenin repeated dozens or hundreds of times that workers and peasants cannot tolerate the bloated organization and vast expenditure of our state organs, and it is necessary to streamline them by all means and methods." According to the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state vigorously carried out the work of streamlining state organs and economic organs. From 1927 to the beginning of 1929 alone, more than 100,000 people were streamlined in the national administrative organs of the Soviet Union. This made the Soviet organs more rational, and the proportion of administrative management expenses in the national budget decreased significantly year by year, allowing the state to invest more funds in the basic construction of industry. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China is also good at using streamlining organizations and tightening administrative expenditures to overcome financial and material difficulties and improve the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary ranks. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the liberated areas were in the most difficult period in 1941 and 1942, the Party Central Committee put forward the "extremely important policy" of developing production and streamlining troops and simplifying administration. Comrade Mao Zedong specifically proposed: "In this streamlining of troops and simplifying administration, we must achieve the five goals of streamlining, unity, efficiency, economy, and anti-bureaucracy." ("Economic and Financial Problems During the Anti-Japanese War"). The liberated areas resolutely implemented this policy during the war, overcame the difficulties at that time, and finally defeated the enemy. After the revolution achieved national victory, Comrade Mao Zedong again loudly proposed at the Third Plenary Session of the Party in June 1950: To strive for a fundamental improvement in the state's financial and economic situation, there are three conditions, one of which is "a large reduction in the funds required by state organs." The historical facts of the past few years have once again proved the correctness of this policy.
    Now we have entered the second year of the first Five-Year Plan for economic construction. The current situation is very different from the period of the Anti-Japanese War and the period of national economic recovery. In order to concentrate on major construction undertakings, conscientiously implement the principle of streamlining organizations and tightening expenditures is of particular importance; at the same time, due to the increase in the enthusiasm of the people across the country in recent years, the improvement of the political and professional level of the vast number of cadres, and our experience in several streamlining efforts, and the Soviet Union's experience in this area for us to learn from, there are more favorable conditions for carrying out this work now.
    How to carry out the work of streamlining organizations? The principles and methods of streamlining organizations should be: First, tighten administrative organs and strengthen factories, mines, and schools; tighten organizations with more people and less work, and supplement aspects with more work and fewer people. At present, many administrative organs have large organizations and have accumulated many cadres, while many factories, mines, and secondary schools lack the necessary cadres and teachers. Some organs have more people and less work, and many staff members cannot do half a day's work a day, or even have nothing to do for a long time, while some units that urgently need to be strengthened lack the necessary personnel. This unreasonable phenomenon of wasting manpower and financial resources must be gradually resolved in the streamlining of organizations. Second, tighten the upper-level leading organs of various economic work departments, and try to draw out cadres to enrich factory and mine production units, so that economic leadership is closer to the lower levels. Stalin taught us: "It is not to lead enterprises 'in general', not to lead enterprises 'from the air', but to lead enterprises concretely and practically." ("New Environment and New Tasks of Economic Construction"). To achieve this, the leadership mechanism and leadership methods must be close to the lower levels. The current phenomenon of heavy top and light bottom in our economic management organs not only cannot meet the requirements of further strengthening leadership over enterprises, but also will continue to promote the bureaucratic style of leading organs. Therefore, various economic work departments should, in accordance with the principle of tightening upper-level leading organs and enriching lower-level production units and basic construction units, except for retaining the necessary personnel, send as many cadres from other organs as possible to work in factories and mines. In this way, it can not only solve the current difficulties of factories and mines lacking cadres, but also enable these cadres to accumulate experience in leading basic construction and production, which will be conducive to strengthening the work of economic leading organs in the future. Third, merge overlapping organizations, abolish dispensable organizations, establish urgently needed organizations, and minimize the internal levels of various organs as much as possible. Because some leading organs did not distinguish between priorities and emergencies when establishing organizations and expanding institutions, and did not base on time, place, and conditions, there are certain subjective and formalistic biases. Therefore, there are many organizational structures that are repetitive and dispensable. In this streamlining, those organizations that overlap up and down, have unclear division of labor, or are needed in this area but not needed in that area, needed in the past but not needed now, or needed in the future but not needed now, should be considered for abolition or merger with organs with similar characteristics. Within an organ, units with many levels and unclear division of labor, which cause mutual involvement and offset power in work, should be carefully adjusted and streamlined in accordance with this principle. Fourth, streamline district-level staffing, strengthen county-level leadership, and appropriately adjust administrative divisions. The number of staff in each district in rural areas can be gradually reduced on the basis of the existing ones, according to the experience of the Second Domestic Revolutionary War and the Anti-Japanese War. As for how to make the county and district organs more rational, each region can select several counties and districts to conduct typical experiments, obtain experience, and then promote it. Administrative divisions at all levels have been continuously adjusted in recent years, but for some existing administrative units that are not suitable for construction needs, appropriate adjustments and mergers should still be made based on political, economic, and other conditions. Fifth, properly resettle surplus personnel. Surplus personnel who can be transferred to work in factories, mines, schools, and agricultural mutual aid and cooperation or other work should be appropriately assigned their work according to work needs and their own conditions. Those who cannot be assigned work temporarily should organize cultural or technical training classes to improve their work ability and cultural and technical level so that they can participate in the cause of national construction. We must cherish all talents, make the best use of their talents, and use them appropriately. All hasty decisions and arbitrary dismissals are wrong.
    Now the central and all levels of organs have or will carry out the work of reorganizing staffing and streamlining organizations. When carrying out this work, it must be closely combined with improving work and improving leadership. Some organs have overcome the procrastination, carelessness, red tape, and bureaucracy in the "three-anti" movement and the anti-bureaucracy struggle, but because many organs have unreasonable organization, unsound system, and waste of manpower, work efficiency cannot be improved rapidly, and procrastination, red tape, and bureaucracy have grown again. Therefore, we must start by mobilizing the enthusiasm of all staff, improve work, improve leadership, and adjust the organization. The process of streamlining organizations should also be a process of improving the enthusiasm of cadres and improving business. Only by improving the enthusiasm of cadres and improving business can we do a good job of streamlining organizations; conversely, only by streamlining organizations can we promote the work to advance by leaps and bounds.
    In the work of streamlining organizations, we should pay attention to overcoming the conservatism and localism of some organs and units. For example, some organs worry that if the number of cadres is reduced, the work will be affected; some organs proceed from the partial interests of their own units and departments. In order to "save" cadres, they are unwilling to resolutely streamline the excessive number of cadres that can and should be streamlined at present to enrich the departments that urgently need to be supplemented by cadres. These conservative and localist ideas are due to a lack of deep understanding of the positive significance of streamlining organizations and a failure to consider this issue well from the perspective of long-term interests and overall interests. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the editorial on streamlining troops and simplifying administration written for the Liberation Daily in 1942: "The status quo and habits often easily bind people's minds tightly, and even revolutionaries cannot avoid it sometimes. The huge organization was created by one's own hands, and it is unexpected that it will be reduced by one's own hands, and it feels very reluctant and difficult when implementing the reduction." "The climate has changed, and clothes must change with it. Every year, at the turn of spring and summer, the turn of summer and autumn, the turn of autumn and winter, and the turn of winter and spring, clothes must be changed once. However, people often do not change clothes at the 'turn', and some problems will arise, which is due to the power of habit." ("An Extremely Important Policy"). At present, we are again in the "turn" situation, from the economic recovery stage to the economic construction stage. We must deal with the issue of streamlining organizations from a developmental perspective and an overall perspective. Departments that can be abolished now should be abolished, organizations that can be adjusted now should be adjusted, and personnel that can be streamlined now should be streamlined. We should not hesitate or take a negative attitude.
    Streamlining organizations is a work that involves a wide range, is very detailed and very complex. In the process of carrying out this work, we will encounter many specific problems and difficulties. The key to handling all problems and solving all difficulties lies in the ability of leading cadres to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and come up with various methods to carry out appropriate arrangements and handling in a planned and step-by-step manner. All cadres of state organs and various public institutions must be mobilized to actively improve business, strive to improve work efficiency, and strive to save a large amount of funds and cadres for the country, and vigorously support economic construction!

    精简行政机构，提高工作效率
    我们党和国家在过渡时期的总路线就是有计划地发展我国的社会主义工业，改造各种非社会主义的经济成分为社会主义的经济成分，使我国由落后的农业国变为社会主义的工业国。根据过渡时期总路线所制订的第一个五年建设计划的中心环节，就是集中主要力量发展重工业，这就需要建设许多规模宏伟的大工程，要完成这些巨大工程的建设，就需要大量的资金和大批的干部。为了解决国家工业化所必需的资金和干部问题，就必须厉行增产节约，从各方面积聚资金，合理地使用并大力培养各种建设人材。因此，精简国家机关和各种事业机关，紧缩行政开支，在目前就有极重大的意义。各种机关精简了机构，人员减少了，开支也就减少了，省下来的钱和条件适合的干部，就可以用到工业战线上去。目前，在全国各界人民、国家机关和事业机关中，正在深入学习国家过渡时期总路线，结合总路线的学习积极改进工作，提高工作效率，精简机构，紧缩行政开支，就成为国家机关和事业机关的工作人员当前一项迫切任务。
    我们的国家机关和其他各种事业机关，在中华人民共和国成立后，为了适应国家各项民主改革工作和经济恢复工作的需要，都相继建立和发展起来，没有这些随着形势发展而发展起来的国家机关和各种事业机关，在短短四年中要完成恢复时期这样繁重复杂的工作是不可能的。但在发展和建立国家机关和其他各种事业机关中，由于很多工作是新创的，经验很缺乏；加以某些机关的主观主义、贪多贪大，盲目发展，以至很多机关在机构编制上和工作制度上，都不同程度地存在着机构臃肿、层次重叠、分工不清、人浮于事等不合理的现象。这样就扩大了行政开支，增加了国家负担，积压了干部，浪费了人材，并助长了官僚主义。因此国家机关和各种事业机关从上到下普遍地进行一次整顿编制、精简机构的工作，不仅可以帮助国家为工业化积累资金和准备干部，而且是克服官僚主义，克服主观主义和分散主义，使国家机关更加干练，更加富于战斗力的一种措施。
    经常的注意改善国家机关、精简机构、紧缩行政开支，是苏联共产党在列宁、斯大林领导下，保证资金积累，克服官僚主义的一项重要经验。列宁说过：“我们应当使我们国家机关尽量节省。我们必须把国家机关中所有一切浪费现象的遗迹铲除干净，而沙皇俄罗斯及其官僚资本主义机关所遗留在我们国家机关中的这种遗迹，尚是很多的。”他并说：“只有尽量清洗我们的国家机关，充分裁减其中一切非绝对必需的人事，只有经过这种办法，我们才定能支持下去。”（“宁肯少些，但要好些”）。当苏联进入为实现社会主义国家工业化而斗争的时期，一九二六年四月斯大林在“论苏联经济状况和党底政策”这一有历史意义的报告中又指出：“必须自下而上地精简和整顿我们国家的与合作社的机关、我们各人民委员部的与实行经济核算制的机关。我们管理机关底庞大的编制和无比的挥霍，已成为一般谈话的资料。难怪列宁曾几十次几百次重复说：工人和农民忍受不了我们国家机关底臃肿机构和浩繁开支，无论如何需要用一切办法、一切手段来加以精简。”根据列宁和斯大林的指示，苏联共产党和苏维埃国家曾大力进行了精简国家机关和经济机关的工作，仅一九二七年至一九二九年初苏联全国行政管理机关就精简了十万多人。这样使苏维埃机关更加合理化，在国家预算中行政管理费用所占的比例逐年有显著的减少，使国家可以有更多的资金投到工业的基本建设上去。中国共产党在以毛泽东同志为首的中央委员会领导下，也是善于运用精简机构、紧缩行政开支来克服财政、物质困难，提高革命队伍战斗力的。在抗日战争期间，当一九四一年和一九四二年解放区处在最困难的时期，党中央提出了发展生产和精兵简政这个“极其重要的政策”。毛泽东同志并具体提出：“在这次精兵简政中，必须达到精简、统一、效能、节约和反对官僚主义五项目的。”（“抗日时期的经济问题和财政问题”）各个解放区在战争中，坚决地贯彻执行了这个政策，渡过了当时的困难，最后战胜了敌人。在革命取得全国胜利后，一九五○年六月毛泽东同志在党的三中全会上又响亮地提出：要争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转有三个条件，其中一条就是“国家机构所需经费的大量节减”。几年来历史的事实再次证明此项政策的正确。
    现在我们已进入第一个五年经济建设计划的第二年，目前的情况已经和抗日战争时期，和国家经济恢复时期大不相同了，为了集中力量于主要的建设事业，认真贯彻精简机构、紧缩开支的方针，更有特殊重要的意义；同时由于几年来全国人民群众积极性的增涨，广大干部政治、业务水平的提高，以及我们已有几次精简的经验，又有苏联在这方面的经验可供我们学习，所以现在来进行这项工作有利的条件更多了。
    怎样来进行精简机构的工作呢？精减机构的原则和方法应该是：第一、紧缩行政机关，加强厂矿和学校；紧缩人多事少的机构，补充事多人少的方面。现在很多行政机关机构庞大，积压了很多干部，而许多厂矿和中等以上的学校则缺少必要干部和师资。有的机关人多事少，很多工作人员一天作不了半天工作，甚至长期无事可做，而急需加强的某些单位，则缺少必要的人员。这种浪费人力、财力的不合理现象，必须在精简机构中逐步求得解决。第二、紧缩各经济工作部门的上层领导机关，尽量抽出干部充实厂矿生产单位，使经济领导更接近下层。斯大林教导我们：“不是‘一般地’领导企业，不是‘从空中’领导企业，而是具体切实地领导企业”。（“新的环境和新的经济建设任务”）要作到这一点，必须使领导机构和领导方法接近下层。我们的经济管理机关目前存在着的头重脚轻现象，不仅不能适应对企业进一步加强领导的要求，而且还会继续助长领导机关官僚主义的作风。因此，各种经济工作部门，应根据紧缩上层领导机关，充实下层生产单位及基本建设单位的原则，除保留必不可少的人员外，对其余机关干部应尽量派到厂矿企业中去工作。这样，既可解决目前厂矿企业缺乏干部的困难，又可使这些干部积累领导基本建设及生产的经验，从而有利于将来加强经济领导机关的工作。第三、合并重叠组织，取消可有可无的机构，成立亟需建立的机构，并尽量减少各机关的内部层次。由于有的领导机关在建立组织扩充机构时不分轻重缓急，不根据时间地点条件，存在着某些主观主义和形式主义的偏向，因而目前在组织机构上有许多是重复的和可有可无的。在这次精简中对那些上下重叠，彼此分工不清，或这个地区需要、那个地区不需要，过去需要、现在不需要，或将来才需要、现在还不需要的机构，都应该考虑撤销或者和性质相近的机关合并。在一个机关内部，也应该根据这个原则对那些层次繁多，分工不清，以致工作上互相牵扯，抵消力量的单位，认真加以调整和精简。第四、精简区级编制，加强县级领导，适当调整行政区划。农村中每个区的编制人数，根据第二次国内革命战争时期和抗日战争时期的经验，在现有的基础上可再逐步缩减。至于县、区机构如何做到更加合理，可由各地选择若干县、区进行典型实验，取得经验，然后推广。各级行政区划，几年来曾不断地进行过一些调整，但对于现有的某些不适于建设需要的行政单位，还应根据政治、经济等各方面的条件，加以适当的调整和归并。第五、妥善安置编余人员。编余人员中能够转入工矿、学校和农业互助合作工作或其他工作的，应根据工作需要和本人条件，适当地分配其工作。暂时不能分配工作的，应组织文化或技术训练班，以提高其工作能力及文化技术水平，以便其参加国家建设事业。要求爱惜一切人材，做到人尽其能，用得其人，一切草率决定，随便遣散的作法都是错误的。
    现在中央和各级机关已经或即将进行整顿编制、精简机构的工作，进行这项工作时，必须和改进工作、改善领导密切结合起来。有些机关办事拖沓、马虎、文牍主义和官僚主义的作风，在“三反”运动和反官僚主义斗争中曾有克服，但由于不少机关存在着机构不合理、制度不健全和人力浪费的现象，使工作效率不能迅速提高，拖拖沓沓、文牍主义、官僚主义又有滋长。因此，必须从发动全体工作人员积极性入手，改进工作，改善领导，调整机构。精简机构的过程应该也是提高干部积极性、改进业务的过程，只有提高了干部积极性，改进了业务，才能作好精简机构工作；反过来精简好了机构，也才能促使工作大踏步前进。
    在精简机构的工作中，应该注意克服某些机关和单位的保守主义和本位主义。如有的机关担心：干部减少了，工作将要受到影响；有的机关从本单位本部门的局部利益出发，为了“储蓄”干部，对于目前可以而且应该精简的过多的干部，不愿坚决精简出来，充实那些急需补充干部的部门。这种保守主义的和本位主义的想法，都是由于没有深刻地了解精简机构的积极意义，没有很好地从长远的利益和整体的利益去考虑这个问题。正如毛泽东同志在一九四二年为解放日报所写的关于精兵简政的社论中所指出的：“现状和习惯往往容易把人们的头脑束缚得紧紧的，即使是革命者有时也不能免。庞大的机构是由自己亲手创造出来的，想不到又要由自己的手将它缩小，实行缩小时就感到很勉强，很困难。”“气候变化了，衣服必须随着变化。每年的春夏之交，夏秋之交，秋冬之交和冬春之交，各要变换一次衣服。但是人们往往在那‘之交’不会变换衣服，要闹出些毛病来，这就是由于习惯的力量。”（“一个极其重要的政策”）目前又处在“之交”形势，由经济恢复阶段进入经济建设阶段，我们必须从发展观点、从整体观点来处理精简机构问题，现在能撤销的部门就要撤销，现在能调整的机构就要调整，现在能精简的人员就要精简，不应该犹豫或抱消极态度。
    精简机构是一件牵连很广，很细致很复杂的工作，在进行这一工作过程中会遇到很多具体问题和困难的。而处理一切问题，解决一切困难的关键就在于领导干部善于依靠群众，发动群众，想出各种办法有计划有步骤地进行适当的安排与处理。国家机关和各种事业机关的全体干部必须动员起来，积极改进业务，努力提高工作效率，为国家节省出大量资金和干部，大力支援经济建设而奋斗！
