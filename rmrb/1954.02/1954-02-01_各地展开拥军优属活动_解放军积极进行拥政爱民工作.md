Activities to Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Servicemen展开 Across Various Locations
    PLA Actively Carries Out Activities to Support the Government and Cherish the People

[This newspaper dispatch] Throughout the country's major administrative regions, activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen will be widely carried out during this year's Spring Festival. According to the notice from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, various regions have successively issued instructions to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen, requiring that mobilizing and organizing the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to actively engage in labor production be regarded as the main task of preferential treatment work this year, and encouraging and absorbing them to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In order to conduct the activities of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen under leadership, committees for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen have been established in South China and other places.

The civil affairs departments of the people's governments at all levels have universally conducted or are about to conduct inspections of last year's preferential treatment work in accordance with the spirit of the general line, so as to absorb experience and further improve the preferential treatment work in the future. The Northeast Administrative Committee has transferred cadres to form four inspection teams, which went to Songjiang, Liaoyang, Shenyang, Fushun and other provinces and cities to inspect the resettlement of demobilized soldiers. The Civil Affairs Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee also held a symposium on preferential treatment work to exchange experiences in preferential treatment work, discuss plans for rectifying the work of land tilling on behalf of servicemen's families and adjusting the burden of land tilling on behalf of servicemen's families, and determine the tasks of preferential treatment work in 1954. Since late November, the special districts of Jiangsu Province in East China have successively convened representative meetings of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and transferred and demobilized soldiers to summarize and inspect preferential treatment work, and conduct education on the general line. Some areas have rewarded personnel with outstanding achievements in preferential treatment work during the summarization of preferential treatment work. For example, in Anshan City, Northeast China, five special-class model workers, thirteen first-class model workers, and one hundred and ninety-two second- and third-class model workers were rewarded.

Propaganda and consolation activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen will be widely carried out throughout the country during the Spring Festival. Beijing and other major cities will combine the transmission report of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea to universally educate the people on loving the people's army and respecting the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary servicemen, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, and hold various consolation activities such as army-people get-togethers; various people's organizations and government agencies will organize many consolation groups to comfort the wounded and sick of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army who are recuperating. A consolation group organized by the South China region will go to Hainan Island and other coastal areas during the Spring Festival to comfort the national defense forces. The Spring Festival Consolation Team organized by people from all walks of life in Wuhan City has started to comfort the recuperating members of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, disabled soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs, and families of revolutionary servicemen since January 23. All regions have also mobilized the people to write letters of condolence to the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army during the Spring Festival.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in various places will also widely carry out "support the government and cherish the people" activities during the Spring Festival. The Central South Military Region, the Fourth Field Army, and the Northwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have successively issued instructions to their subordinate units, stipulating the work of "supporting the government and cherishing the people". The Northwest Military Region stipulates that the period from the New Year to the Spring Festival is the "Day for Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People", requiring all units, agencies, schools, and hospitals to conduct an education on "supporting the government and cherishing the people" among all commanders and fighters, inspect discipline, and solicit opinions from the masses through symposiums and other forms. The Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army stipulated that all agencies, troops, and schools of the entire army should cooperate with local authorities before and after the Spring Festival, and take advantage of various opportunities to vigorously publicize the general line to the masses and family members in their stationed areas, and mobilize them to sell their surplus grain to the state.

    各地展开拥军优属活动
    解放军积极进行拥政爱民工作
    【本报讯】全国各大行政区在今年春节期间，将广泛展开拥军优属活动。根据中央人民政府内务部的通知，各地都已先后发出了拥军优属的指示，要求把发动与组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人积极从事劳动生产当做今年优抚工作的主要任务，鼓励和吸收他们参加互助合作组织。为使拥军优属活动有领导地进行，华南等地成立了拥军优属委员会。
    各地人民政府的民政工作部门根据总路线的精神，对去年的优抚工作普遍进行了或即将进行检查，以便吸取经验，进一步做好今后的拥军优属工作。东北行政委员会抽调干部成立了四个检查组，分赴松江、辽阳、沈阳、抚顺等省市检查复员军人的安置情况。东北行政委员会民政局还召开了优抚工作座谈会，交流了优抚工作的经验，讨论了整顿代耕工作、调整代耕负担的方案，并确定了一九五四年优抚工作的任务。华东区江苏省各专区自十一月下旬起先后召开了革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人以及转业、复员军人的代表会议，总结检查优抚工作，并进行总路线教育。有些地区在总结优抚工作中，对工作有成绩的人员进行了奖励。如东北鞍山市有五名特等模范、十三名一等模范和一百九十二名二、三等模范得到了奖励。
    全国各地在春节将广泛进行拥军优属的宣传和慰问活动。北京等各大城市将结合中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的传达报告，向人民群众普遍进行爱护人民军队，尊敬革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人的教育，并举行军民联欢会等各种慰问活动；各人民团体和政府机关将组织许多慰问团，慰问在休养中的中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军的伤病员。华南地区组织了一个慰问团，将于春节赴海南岛等沿海地区慰问国防军。武汉市各界人民组织的春节慰问队，已从一月二十三日开始向中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的休养员、残废军人、革命烈士家属和革命军人家属进行慰问。各地还发动人民在春节给人民解放军和志愿军战士写慰问信。
    驻各地的人民解放军，也将在春节期间广泛展开“拥政爱民”活动。中国人民解放军中南军区、第四野战军和西北军区，先后向所属各部发出了指示，对“拥政爱民”工作作了规定。西北军区规定新年至春节期间为“拥政爱民日”，要求各部队、机关、学校、医院在全体指战员中进行一次“拥政爱民”教育，检查纪律，并通过座谈会等形式，征求群众的意见。中南军区和第四野战军规定全军各机关、部队和学校在春节前后，配合地方，利用各种机会大张旗鼓地向驻地群众和家庭亲属，进行总路线宣传，并动员他们把余粮卖给国家。
