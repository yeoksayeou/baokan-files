	Songjiang Province's Jixian County is actively promoting new-style animal-drawn farm tools, which has played a significant role in improving agricultural production and promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
	By 1953, Jixian County had promoted 349 sets of new-style animal-drawn farm tools throughout the county. To educate farmers to master the technology and give full play to the role of animal-drawn farm tools, the county also established nine technical stations, one threshing station, and trained more than 160 technical extension workers and 400 farmer technicians. More than 30 percent of the agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams in the county have used new-style animal-drawn farm tools. As a result, production has increased significantly, generally increasing by 40 percent compared to the output when using old farm tools. Last year, the Yongfa Village Agricultural Production Cooperative used new farm tools to densely plant wheat, yielding 5,727 jin per hectare, an increase of one to two times compared to that cultivated with old farm tools. New farm tools are not only suitable for planting wheat, but also for planting soybeans. The Erqu Bao'an Agricultural Production Cooperative used new farm tools to plant soybeans, averaging 4,445 jin per hectare, which is also more than double the local average yield. While using new farm tools, many farmers also paid attention to improving other agricultural techniques, such as applying more fertilizer and disinfecting seeds.
	Land concentration and unified management are conducive to the use of new-style animal-drawn farm tools. Therefore, the promotion of animal-drawn farm tools has also powerfully promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In 1952, after the county promoted 75 sets of new farm tools, many mutual aid teams merged into larger teams, and three agricultural producers' cooperatives were also organized. In 1953, 950 mutual aid teams were merged to establish 49 cooperatives, and the organized farmers accounted for more than 95 percent of the total number of farmers in the county. When the Bao'an Agricultural Production Cooperative was still a mutual aid team, due to scattered land, each seeder could only sow three hectares of land per day. After the establishment of the cooperative, it could sow more than four hectares and seven mu of land per day. Because the use of new farm tools saved labor and produced more grain, it attracted more than 40 farmers in the whole village to join the agricultural production cooperative. The use of new farm tools not only increased output, but also improved production efficiency and reduced physical labor. Last autumn, the threshing station dispatched 12 threshing machines to help farmers thresh wheat, saving more than 4,700 animal power and more than 26,800 man-days compared to using old-fashioned stone rollers.

    松江集贤县积极推广新农具
    提高了生产促进了互助合作运动的发展
    松江省集贤县积极推广新式马拉农具，对于提高农业生产和促进互助合作运动的发展起了很大的作用。
    到一九五三年，集贤县全县已推广新式马拉农具三百四十九套。为了教育农民掌握技术，充分发挥马拉农具的作用，全县还建立了九处技术站，一处脱谷站，并训练培养了一百六十多名技术推广员和四百名农民技术手。全县百分之三十以上的农业生产合作社和互助组已使用了新式马拉农具。因此，生产量显著提高，一般地均较使用旧农具的产量增加百分之四十。永发村农业生产合作社去年用新农具密植的小麦，每垧地产五千七百二十七斤，比用旧农具耕种的增产一倍乃至两倍以上。新农具不但适合种小麦，也适于种大豆，二区保安农业生产合作社用新农具播种的大豆，每垧平均打四千四百四十五斤，也比当地平均产量多一倍。与使用新农具同时，许多农民并注意改进其他农业技术，如多施肥和进行种籽消毒等。
    土地集中和统一经营，才便于使用新式马拉农具。所以，马拉农具的推广，也有力地推动了互助合作运动的发展。一九五二年全县推广了七十五套新农具后，许多互助组合并成大组，还组织了三个农业生产合作社；一九五三年，有九百五十个互助组归并成立了四十九个合作社，组织起来的农户占全县总农户数百分之九十五以上。保安农业生产合作社还是互助组的时候，因土地零散，每台播种机每天只播种三垧地，成立合作社后，每天能播种到四垧七亩多地。由于使用新农具省工多打粮，吸引全屯四十多户农民都加入了农业生产合作社。使用新农具不仅增加了产量，还提高了生产效率，减轻了体力劳动。去年秋季，脱谷站出动了十二台脱谷机帮助农民脱小麦，比用旧式笨磙子打，节省了四千七百多个畜力，二万六千八百多个人工。
