Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: Faced with the continuous failures of the French colonialists in Indochina, American reactionary public opinion has had to admit that the Indochina colonial war, which is strongly supported by the United States, does not have the support of the local people.

    The New York "Saturday Evening Post" published an article on the 21st by its Saigon correspondent, Sherrod, stating, "There is no doubt that the United States is extremely concerned about the Indochina War." However, "despite the fact that the United States has given or loaned France many billions of dollars since the end of World War II," France has not been able to win the war. Sherrod said that the reason for not being able to win the war might be that the Vietnamese do not like the French. "The fact is that the French have failed to convince the Vietnamese that their intentions are sincere." The reporter gave an example: "The reason for France's failure can perhaps be found in the Tokyo (North Vietnam) Delta... French troops control the roads leading to their watchtowers during the day... but at night, barbed wire is laid on the roads, the French retreat into their watchtowers,... and the Viet Minh troops take over." Sherrod also said that the United States has fallen into the quagmire of the Indochina War, "unless France can find a way to boost the morale of the Vietnamese, American soldiers will also have to die in Indochina."

    Blins, former AP Tokyo bureau chief who visited Indochina twice, also admitted not long ago that "the French not only lack the support of the people, but also lack any leaders who can be entrusted with important tasks once they withdraw. For the locals who still do not consider communism a threat, Ho Chi Minh is still the authoritative leader on this peninsula." Blins believes that "the difficulty for the United States is that it cannot find a solution that can achieve victory in Indochina without the United States undertaking further obligations, relying only on the French and the strongly nationalistic people of this peninsula and its neighbors."

    美国反动舆论承认法国殖民者不得人心
    【新华社二十三日讯】在法国殖民者在印度支那不断遭到失败的事实面前，美国反动舆论不得不承认，由美国大力支持的印度支那殖民战争得不到当地人民的支持。
    纽约“星期六晚邮报”二十一日刊载该报驻西贡记者谢罗德的文章说：“毫无疑问，美国对印度支那战争是极为关切的”。但是，“尽管美国自从第二次世界大战结束以来已给予或贷与法国许多亿美元”，法国并未能赢得战争。谢罗德说，越南人不喜欢法国人，这可能是不能赢得战争的原因。“事实是法国人未能使越南人相信他们的意图是诚恳的。”记者举例说：“法国失败的原因，或许可以在东京（北越）三角洲中找到……法国军队在白天控制着通往他们的了望塔的公路……但是在夜里公路上就布起了铁丝网，法国人退入他们的了望塔，……越盟部队就来接管了”。谢罗德又说，美国已陷入印度支那战争的泥淖中，“除非法国能设法振作越南人的士气，否则美国兵也将要死在印度支那。”
    曾经两次访问印度支那的前美联社东京分社社长布林斯不久以前也承认，“法国人不但缺乏人民的支持，并且也缺乏一旦撤出后能够付托重任的任何领袖人物。对于仍旧不认为共产主义是一种威胁的本地人来说，胡志明仍旧是这个半岛上的权威领袖。”布林斯认为，“美国的困难是无法找出一种方案，可以不需要美国承担进一步的义务，只靠法国人和这个半岛及其邻邦的具有强烈民族主义感的人民的支持，就在印度支那取得胜利。”
