Dear Comrades:

　　Entrusted by the people of the whole country, we are about to set off to extend warm greetings to the defenders of the Chinese people—the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. We are extremely excited and happy to be undertaking this glorious task.

　　Not long ago, the people of the whole country organized the Third Delegation to Korea to Comfort the Troops, going to Korea to express their greetings to the heroic Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Now, we are representing the people of the whole country to extend our greetings to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army. This fully demonstrates the respect and care that the people of the whole country have for the heroes who resist aggression and defend peace, and for the heroes who defend the motherland and the construction of the motherland.

　　The people of the whole country have not forgotten that the founding of the People's Republic of China is inseparable from the heroic fighting, arduous struggle, and sacrifices of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the past twenty years. The people of the whole country have also not forgotten that we are carrying out construction in the face of constant attempts by imperialism to invade us. Without the great victory achieved by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and without the Chinese People's Liberation Army victoriously defending the national defense of the motherland, it would be unimaginable for our people to have achieved such brilliant and enormous achievements in the cause of national socialist construction and socialist transformation over the past four years; and without the protection of a powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army, it would be impossible for us to build a great socialist country. We need a peaceful environment to build our country, and we are determined to work to defend peace in the East and the world. However, imperialists and warmongers are constantly trying to undermine peace. We need a strong armed force to defend our socialist construction cause, defend peace in the East and the world. We will never allow any imperialists and their lackeys to invade us.

　　The people of the whole country are constantly mindful of the great contributions made by the People's Liberation Army in defending the motherland and the construction of the motherland over the past four years. The people of the whole country are infinitely concerned about all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, especially the heroes guarding the borders, coasts, and airspace of the motherland. We will represent the people of the whole country, the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong to express our heartfelt gratitude and highest respect to them.

　　We will publicize to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army the great achievements of the country's construction over the past four years, publicize the general line of the country during the transition period, and encourage them to strive to build a modernized national defense force, to defend the safety of the motherland, to ensure the smooth progress of national construction, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world! We will also certainly convey their spirit of hard struggle, heroic sacrifice, close unity, observance of discipline, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance to the people of the whole country, and encourage the people of the whole country to take their fighting spirit as an example to successfully carry out the great cause of socialist construction. Let us, the soldiers and civilians of the whole country, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, under the brilliant illumination of the national general line, unite and strive forward towards the great socialist goal!

　　We will certainly strive to fulfill the glorious task entrusted to us by the people of the whole country of comforting the People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the great unity of the people of the whole country!

　　Long live the victory of the cause of socialist construction!

　　Long live our great motherland!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live the Central People's Government!

　　Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

    全国人民一点也没有忘记，中华人民共和国的成立，是与中国人民解放军二十多年来英勇作战、艰苦奋斗、流血牺牲分不开的。全国人民更一点也没有忘记，我们是在帝国主义不断企图侵略我们的情况下进行建设的，没有中国人民志愿军进行抗美援朝斗争取得的伟大胜利，没有中国人民解放军胜利地保卫着祖国的国防，我国人民四年来在国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业上取得如此光辉巨大的成就是不可想像的；而如果没有强大的中国人民解放军的保卫，我们要建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家将是不可能的。我们需要一个和平环境来建设我们的国家，我们坚决为保卫东方与世界和平而努力。但是，帝国主义和战争贩子时时刻刻要破坏和平。我们就需要一支强大的武装力量，来保卫我们的社会主义建设事业，保卫东方与世界的和平。我们决不允许任何帝国主义者及其走狗前来侵犯我们。
