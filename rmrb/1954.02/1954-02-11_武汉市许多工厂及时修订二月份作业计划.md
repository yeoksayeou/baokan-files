Many factories and enterprises in Wuhan launched mass movements before the Spring Festival to revise their February work plans in a timely manner. Except for a few factories that planned to reduce output due to the off-season for their products, most factories have increased their February plan targets compared to January.

Of the city's fourteen state-owned and local state-owned machinery factories, thirteen have already prepared their February work plans, and most of these factories have submitted their plans to the masses for discussion. After discussion by the masses, the work plan of Jiangling No. 43 Factory was increased by 5% compared to the January plan, and the two main products were increased by 10%. The daily output of five products of Hankou Auto Parts Factory is much higher than the January plan. For example, the daily planned output of piston pins in January was 346 pieces, and the daily planned output in February is 458 pieces. Wuhan Power Machine Factory reversed the long-term situation of being unable to complete its plan, completed the January plan ahead of schedule on January 25, and determined the February plan targets on the same day, submitting the targets to the masses for discussion. Workshops and groups formulated work plans on January 28. Hubei Agricultural Tool Factory launched a mass discussion of the February plan on January 30 and 31, and the workers had full confidence in completing the plan. The planned daily output of state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in February increased by 221 pounds of cotton yarn compared to January, but when the masses formulated group or individual guarantee conditions, it exceeded the administrative plan by one to five pounds. The February plans of other factories such as the Universe Tobacco Factory were generally higher than those of January.

When formulating work plans, these factories generally considered the organizational and technical measures to ensure the completion of the February plan and formulated a plan of measures. The masses in each factory were in high spirits when discussing the plan, expressing their determination to complete and overfulfill the state plan for February.

    武汉市许多工厂及时修订二月份作业计划
    武汉市许多工厂企业在春节前发动群众及时修订了二月份作业计划，除个别工厂因为产品逢到淡季有计划地降低了产量外，一般工厂二月份的计划指标都比一月份的计划有所提高。
    全市十四个国营与地方国营机械工厂已有十三个工厂编好了二月份的作业计划，其中多数工厂已将计划交给群众讨论。江零四三工厂的作业计划经群众讨论后，比一月份计划提高了百分之五，两种主要产品提高了百分之十。汉口汽车配件厂五种产品的日产量都比一月份的计划高得多，如活塞肖一月份的日计划产量为三百四十六件，二月份日计划为四百五十八件。武汉动力机厂扭转了长期不能完成计划的局面，在一月二十五日提前完成了一月份计划，并于当天确定了二月份的计划指标，把指标交给群众讨论。车间、小组在一月二十八日就订出了作业计划。湖北省农具厂在一月三十、三十一两天中发动群众讨论了二月份计划，职工们对完成计划都有充分信心。国营武汉第一棉纺织厂二月份计划日产量比一月份提高两百二十一磅棉纱，但在群众制订小组或个人保证条件时，又比行政计划超过一磅到五磅。其他宇宙烟厂等工厂的二月份计划一般都较一月份有了提高。
    这些工厂在制订作业计划时，一般都考虑到了保证完成二月份计划的组织技术措施，并订出了措施计划。各厂群众在讨论计划时，情绪都很饱满，表示决心完成和超额完成二月份的国家计划。
