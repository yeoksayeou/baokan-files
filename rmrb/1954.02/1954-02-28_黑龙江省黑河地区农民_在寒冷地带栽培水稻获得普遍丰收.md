Farmers in the Heihe region of Heilongjiang Province have successfully experimented with cultivating rice in cold regions, achieving universal bumper harvests of rice in 1953.

The counties of Aihui, Xunke, and Sunwu in the Heihe region are traversed by the main streams and tributaries of the Gebiela River and Xunbiela River, with boundless fertile fields along the banks, creating excellent conditions for developing paddy fields. However, because the region is located north of 50 degrees north latitude, the climate is extremely cold, with only about 120 frost-free days in a year, resulting in a relatively short growing season for rice cultivation. In recent years, under the correct leadership of the People's Government, farmers in the Heihe region have actively cultivated cold-resistant varieties. By digging water storage ponds and extending waterways, they have increased water temperature, enabling rice seedlings to grow normally even in cold conditions, ensuring timely early sowing. Most of the rice can mature in early and mid-September. Appropriate rational close planting, early and deep plowing, and timely weeding have also been implemented, leading to year-by-year increases in rice yields. In 1951, the average yield per hectare of rice on 272 hectares of land was 2,000 jin. In 1952, the cultivated area was 817 hectares, with an average yield of 4,000 jin per hectare. In 1953, the cultivated area was expanded to 963 hectares, with an average yield of 5,000 jin per hectare, and many high yields of over 10,000 jin per hectare emerged. Jin Longfan of Songshugen Village, Fourth District, Xunke County, harvested an average of 13,901 jin per hectare of rice on 1.6 mu of land. After achieving bumper harvests of rice, farmers in the Heihe region are even more enthusiastic about production and plan to further expand the rice cultivation area this year. Farmers in Yangshulin Village, Third District, Aihui County, plowed 60 percent of their paddy fields in the autumn of last year in order to lay the foundation for this year's bumper rice harvest.

    黑龙江省黑河地区农民
    在寒冷地带栽培水稻获得普遍丰收
    黑龙江省黑河地区农民试验在寒地栽培水稻获得成功，一九五三年的水稻普遍丰收。
    黑河地区瑷珲、逊克、孙吴等县境内有公别拉河、逊别拉河的干流和支流分布着，沿河两岸是一望无际的沃野，给开发水田造成了优越条件。但因位于北纬五十度以北，气候非常寒冷，一年内无霜期仅有一百二十天左右，如耕作水稻时，生育时间比较短促。几年来，在人民政府的正确领导下，黑河地区的农民积极培育了耐寒品种，他们通过挖蓄水池和延长水道等方法，提高了水温，使秧苗在寒冷条件下也能正常生长，作到了适当早播，使大部分水稻都能在九月上、中旬成熟，又加适当的合理密植、早耕深耕、及时除草，使水稻的产量逐年提高。一九五一年二百七十二垧地水稻，每垧平均产量两千斤；一九五二年栽培面积是八百一十七垧，每垧平均产四千斤；一九五三年栽培面积扩大到九百六十三垧，每垧平均产量达到五千斤，并出现了不少每垧打一万斤以上的高额产量。逊克县四区松树根屯，金龙范种一垧六亩地水稻，平均每垧打一万三千九百零一斤。黑河地区的农民在获得水稻丰收后，生产积极性更加提高，准备今年还要扩大水稻耕种面积。瑷珲县三区杨树屯的农民，为了给今年水稻丰产打下基础，百分之六十的水田在去年秋天都翻耕了一遍。
