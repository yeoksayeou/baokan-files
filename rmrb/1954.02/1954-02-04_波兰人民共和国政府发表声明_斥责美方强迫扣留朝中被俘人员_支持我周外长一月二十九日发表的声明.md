Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 3rd: The Polish Press Agency in Warsaw reported on the 1st that the Government of the People's Republic of Poland, regarding the unilateral and illegal transfer of North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the United Nations Command and the fact that the Command has granted them civilian status, issued the following statement:

　　The Polish government sent representatives to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (whose main task was to make the repatriation of prisoners of war possible) in the hope of helping to implement the terms of the Armistice Agreement and the Commission's "Terms of Reference."

　　However, it must be stated that since the establishment of the Commission, the US side, anxious to limit the Commission's powers and make it practically impossible to carry out its tasks, has systematically obstructed its work.

　　It is enough to recall how the Commission was prevented from starting the explanatory work within the time stipulated in the "Terms of Reference," and how the terrorist rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee agents in the camps was covered up, preventing the prisoners of war from exercising their right to repatriation and preventing the explanatory work from being carried out fully for ninety days. The release of North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war as civilians, which is in fact the forcible detention by the US side and the illegal conscription into the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee armies, is not only a violation of the Armistice Agreement, but also a shameless violation of international conventions and principles.

　　As a result of all these conspiracies, the explanatory work was carried out for only ten days, not ninety days, and only 15 percent of the prisoners of war were explained to. Thus, the vast majority of prisoners of war were deprived of the opportunity to hear the explanations.

　　The Polish government would like to point out that the Polish representatives on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission repeatedly protested against the illegal and harmful actions of the US side in the course of their work, and demanded compliance with the terms of the Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." In particular, the Polish representatives demanded that the terrorist rule in the southern prisoner-of-war camps be stopped and that an atmosphere be created there in which prisoners of war could make free decisions on the issue of repatriation. The Polish representatives demanded that a full ninety days of explanatory work be carried out and that all prisoners of war be explained to. As for those prisoners of war who, after being explained to, still did not request repatriation, the Polish representatives demanded that their fate be decided by the political conference.

　　The Czechoslovak representatives also made these demands.

　　The fact that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was prevented from carrying out its task is a major setback in resolving the Korean issue, which is detrimental to peace and contrary to the general desire to ease international tensions. The responsibility for this situation rests entirely with the US side. At the same time, it should be regretted that the Swiss and Swedish delegations failed to help the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to complete its task well. These delegations opposed the just proposals of the Polish and Czechoslovak delegations, in particular the proposal to stop the terrorist rule in the prisoner-of-war camps; and they supported the illegal actions of the US side.

　　The Polish government must regretfully state that the Indian forces did not take decisive steps to stop the terrorist rule over the prisoners of war, and that General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, although confirming the undeniable facts that there was terrorist rule in the prisoner-of-war camps and that some murders had occurred in the prisoner-of-war camps, took the wrong decision, contrary to the letter and spirit of the Armistice Agreement, namely, to hand over the prisoners of war in the southern prisoner-of-war camps to the United Nations Command.

　　In view of the situation in Korea, the Polish government has announced in a timely manner that it is in favor of resuming the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly. In this regard, the Polish government fully supports the request of the Government of the People's Republic of China for reconvening, as put forward in the statement issued by Mr. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on January 29, 1954. The Polish government also fully agrees with the People's Republic of China's request to resume the preparatory talks for the political conference.

    波兰人民共和国政府发表声明
    斥责美方强迫扣留朝中被俘人员
    支持我周外长一月二十九日发表的声明
    【新华社三日讯】波兰通讯社华沙一日电：波兰人民共和国政府就北朝鲜和中国战俘被片面地非法地移交给联合国军司令部的事件并鉴于该司令部已给予他们以平民身份的事实，发表声明如下：
    波兰政府派遣代表参加中立国遣返委员会（该委员会的主要任务是使战俘遣返成为可能），是希望能协助贯彻停战协定和该委员会的“职权范围”的条款。
    但是，必须声明，自该委员会一成立，美方由于急于要限制该委员会的权力并使它实际上不可能执行它的任务，就有计划地阻挠它进行工作。
    人们只要回想一下就够了：委员会怎样受到阻挠不能按照“职权范围”所规定的时间开始解释工作，而蒋介石和李承晚特务在营场内的恐怖统治又怎样被掩盖起来，使战俘们不能运用他们遣返的权利并使解释工作不能十足进行九十天。朝中战俘之被释放为平民，实际上是被美方强迫扣留并非法地强编入蒋介石及李承晚军队，这不仅是违反停战协定，而且是一种无耻地违反国际惯例和原则的行动。
    由于这一切阴谋的结果，解释工作只进行了十天，而不是九十天，而且只是对百分之十五的战俘进行了解释。因此，绝大部分战俘就被剥夺了听取解释的机会。
    波兰政府愿意指出，中立国遣返委员会的波兰代表在进行工作过程中屡次对美方的非法和有害的行为提出抗议，并要求遵守停战协定和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的条款。波兰代表特别要求制止南部战俘营里的恐怖统治，并在那里造成一种气氛，使得战俘能在遣返问题上作出自由的决定。波兰代表要求进行十足九十天的解释工作，并且要全体战俘都进行解释。至于那些在经过解释之后还未请求遣返的战俘，波兰代表要求由政治会议来决定他们的命运。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表也提出了这些要求。
    中立国遣返委员会受到阻挠而未能执行任务，这是在解决朝鲜问题方面的一大退步，这对于和平是不利的，而且是违反缓和国际紧张局势的普遍愿望的。这种情况的责任完全要由美方来担负。同时，还应当遗憾地说明，瑞士和瑞典代表团未能帮助中立国遣返委员会很好地完成任务。这些代表团反对波兰与捷克斯洛伐克代表团的公正建议，特别是关于制止战俘营恐怖统治的建议；而且，他们还支持美方的非法行动。
    波兰政府必须遗憾地声明，印度部队并没有采取决定性的步骤以制止对战俘的恐怖统治，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军虽然证实战俘营里存在着恐怖统治和战俘营中发生过一些谋杀罪行这两个无可辩驳的事实，却采取了错误的、违反停战协定的文字与精神的决定，就是，把南部战俘营里的战俘移交给联合国军方面。
    鉴于在朝鲜所发生的局势，波兰政府曾及时宣布它赞成第八届联合国大会复会，在这方面，波兰政府完全支持中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来先生在一九五四年一月二十九日发表的声明中所提出的中华人民共和国政府关于复会的要求。波兰政府也完全同意中华人民共和国所提出的关于恢复准备政治会议的预备会谈的要求。
