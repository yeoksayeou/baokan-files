(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 26th) According to TASS, the preparation for the Soviet Supreme Soviet election has moved from the stage of meetings between representatives and voters to a new stage of publicizing the candidates' lives and social activities.

    The list of candidates includes many production innovators and outstanding workers from various industrial enterprises. For example, Ni. Sherbinovich, a candidate from the Donets Coal Region, is an advanced operator of the powerful new machine "C X Б M" tunnel boring combine. The "CXБM" combine was originally designed specifically for the coal seams of the Siberian Coal Region, but after Sherbinovich and engineers cooperated to improve the machine, it could also be applied in the Donets Coal Region, where geological conditions are more complex. Sherbinovich's team can excavate 250 meters per month using the new machine, several times more than with the old method. Because of Sherbinovich's great contributions to communist construction, the miners respect him very much. A. Papavin, a candidate nominated by the residents of Yaroslavl, is a hero of socialist labor who enjoys a high reputation among Soviet railway employees. He used to be a stoker and is now an excellent locomotive driver. His locomotive has traveled 1.5 million kilometers without requiring a major overhaul. His advanced working methods have been widely adopted in the Soviet railway transportation system. His book on how to drive a locomotive has been translated into many foreign languages. Railway employees from China and European People's Democratic countries often consult him.

    Va. Digen, a lathe operator at the Kharkov Tractor Factory in Ukraine, is a production expert who has completed seven years of production quotas in the past three years. More than a thousand workers have adopted the high-speed metal cutting method he promoted in the factory. He was elected as a representative in the third Supreme Soviet election in 1950. In the past four years, he has not failed the trust of his constituents. He has done a lot of work to improve the municipal construction of his hometown of Kharkov. Therefore, the working people of Kharkov have nominated him as a candidate again in this election.

    苏联最高苏维埃选举的筹备工作
    进入宣传候选人生平和社会活动的新阶段
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃选举的筹备工作，已由代表候选人和选民会见的阶段进入宣传候选人生平和社会活动的新阶段。
    候选人的名单中有很多是各工业企业的生产革新者和优秀工人。例如，顿尼兹煤区的候选人尼·谢尔比诺维奇是效力强大的新机器“C X Б M”隧道掘进联合机的先进操使者。“CXБM”联合机本来是专门为西伯利亚煤区的煤层设计的，但经过谢尔比诺维奇和工程师合作改进了机器以后，也能在地质条件更为复杂的顿尼兹煤区应用。谢尔比诺维奇的工作组使用新机器每月可掘进二百五十公尺，比用老方法多好几倍。由于谢尔比诺维奇对共产主义建设有了巨大的贡献，矿工们都很尊敬他。雅罗斯拉夫市的居民提出的候选人亚·帕帕文，是社会主义劳动英雄，在苏联铁路员工中享有很高的威信。他以前是司炉，现在是出色的机车司机。他的机车已行驶了一百五十万公里还不用大修。他的先进的工作方法已在苏联铁路运输系统中广泛采用。他所著的关于如何驾驶机车的书籍已译成许多外国文字。中国和欧洲人民民主国家的铁路员工也经常向他请教。
    乌克兰哈尔科夫拖拉机工厂的车工瓦·迪根是一个生产能手，在过去三年中已完成了七年的生产定额。他在工厂中推行的高速金属切削法，已有一千多个工人采用。他在一九五○年第三届最高苏维埃选举中被选为代表。四年来他丝毫没有辜负选民们对他的信任。他曾为了改进他的故乡哈尔科夫的市政建设做了许多工作。因此，哈尔科夫的劳动人民在本届选举中又把他提名为候选人。
