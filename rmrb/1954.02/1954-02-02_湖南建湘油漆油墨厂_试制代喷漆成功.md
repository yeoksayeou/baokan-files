The Hunan Jianxiang Paint and Ink Factory in Hunan Province successfully trial-produced a substitute lacquer in December of last year, effectively supporting the production of the country's large-scale industry.

Lacquer is an important material needed for manufacturing industries such as machinery, ships, and vehicles, as well as basic construction. Spraying lacquer on the surface of steel not only makes it beautiful but also waterproof, rustproof, wear-resistant, and heat-resistant, making the steel durable. In the past, there was not a single paint factory in the entire Central and Southern China region that could manufacture lacquer. The lacquer needed by large-scale industrial and basic construction units in Hunan Province was purchased from private factories in Shanghai, and these private factories in Shanghai relied on imported raw materials for manufacturing. Therefore, the price was very high, and timely supply could not be guaranteed.

Last year, after the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the state-owned Factory 282 contacted the Jianxiang Paint and Ink Factory and requested a trial production of lacquer or substitute lacquer. Xiao Qingxi, director of the Jianxiang Paint and Ink Factory's inspection laboratory, and others decided after research to trial-produce substitute lacquer using raw materials produced in the province. After repeated research and experimentation by technicians and workers, they finally succeeded. The results of trial use by Factory 282 proved that, except for the slower drying time, the other effectiveness and durability, gloss, waterproofness, rust resistance, and resistance to cold and heat of the substitute lacquer were quite good.

The function of this substitute lacquer is basically the same as that of regular lacquer, but the selling price and cost are more than half lower than that of regular lacquer. The Jianxiang Paint and Ink Factory is further researching to improve quality and preparing to expand the production of substitute lacquer according to user needs.

    湖南建湘油漆油墨厂
    试制代喷漆成功
    湖南地方国营建湘油漆油墨厂于去年十二月间，试制代喷漆成功，有力地支援了国家大工业的生产。
    喷漆是机械、轮船、车辆等制造工业和基本建设等所需要的重要材料。将喷漆喷在钢铁物的表面，不仅美观且能防水、防锈、耐擦、耐热，使钢铁物经久耐用。过去，中南全区没有一个油漆工厂能够制造喷漆，湖南省大工业和基本建设单位所需要的喷漆都是向上海私营工厂去买，上海的私营工厂又都是依靠进口原料制造。因此，价格很高，还不能保证及时供应。
    去年，增产节约运动开展以后，国营二八二工厂就曾向建湘油漆油墨厂联系，提出了试制喷漆或代喷漆的要求。建湘油漆油墨厂检验室主任萧庆禧等研究后，决定用该省出产的原料试制代喷漆。经过技术人员和工人们反复的研究试验，最后终于获得成功。二八二工厂试用结果，证明代喷漆除了干燥时间较慢外，其他效能和牢固、光泽、防水、防锈、耐冷热等相当好。
    这种代喷漆的作用与正式喷漆基本相同，但售价和成本却比正式喷漆要低到一半以上。建湘油漆油墨厂正在进一步研究提高品质并准备根据用户需要扩大代喷漆的生产。
