[Reported by this newspaper] North China region saw 301 factories and mines complete their national production plans for January, reversing the previous trend of "loose at the beginning and tight at the end" in the region's factories and mines. Among the 137 state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly public-private factories and enterprises in Beijing, 92 completed or exceeded their state plans. In Tianjin, 80 factories completed their output value and production plans, generally maintaining production at or above the actual levels of the fourth quarter of last year. In Shanxi Province, 75 factories and mines completed their plans in January, and 65 exceeded them. Notably, major factories and mines such as Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, which failed to meet their targets in the same period last year, all exceeded their plans this year. Many factories and mines also achieved a more balanced rate of completion than in previous years, with Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant achieving a 100% balanced rate of finished product assembly.

The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has been closely monitoring and leading industrial production since the first day of the new year, supervising the production work of factories and mines, and checking their implementation of the national plan. At the industrial work reporting conference in December last year, the North China Bureau reviewed the preparations and promptly arranged the production for the first quarter. At the first Standing Committee meeting of 1954, the Bureau discussed industrial work issues in the region and issued instructions to Party committees at all levels and factories and mines, requiring them to take effective measures to ensure that first-quarter production was not lower than the actual level of the fourth quarter of 1953. Subsequently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the North China Administrative Council convened specialized meetings on the iron and steel, coal, electricity, and machinery industries. In late January, the North China Bureau held an industrial work reporting conference, focusing on checking the first-quarter plan and the implementation of the plan in early and mid-January. Party committees at all levels and Party organizations in factories and mines took effective measures to strengthen leadership over industrial production in accordance with the instructions of the North China Bureau. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee sent two inspection teams to key inspection of industrial and mining areas. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry held an enlarged cadre meeting of factory directors and mine managers to criticize conservative ideas and formulate an advanced and feasible plan for the first quarter, which was 9.6 percent higher than the original plan and 1.3 percent higher than the actual production level of the fourth quarter of last year. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee of Hebei Province reviewed the plans of factories and mines in the city four times, increasing the total plan of 28 units from 11.7 percent below the actual level of the fourth quarter of last year to only 1 percent below. They are currently striving to reach the actual production level of the fourth quarter of last year.

In strengthening the leadership of industrial production, Party organizations at all levels in the North China region extensively carry out political work among workers and further implement the education of the Party's general line during the transition period to raise workers' socialist consciousness. Encouraged by the education of the general line, workers in factories in the local industrial system of Tianjin realized that balanced completion of production tasks could accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. Ten factories exceeded their daily production plans on the first day of work this year. Due to the strengthening of political work, the sense of responsibility of the broad masses of workers in completing the national plan has also been greatly strengthened. According to statistics from eight units, including Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory and Tianjin Bicycle Factory, the attendance rate in January was no lower than 92.8 percent, with a maximum of 98.22 percent. The attendance rate of Datong Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province has been maintained above 90 percent, an increase of more than 5 percent compared to the same period last year.

While strengthening political work, the Party promptly supervised and inspected the production work of various factories and mines in 1954 to ensure a good material foundation for the year's production from the beginning of the new year. The region's coal mining industry has prepared working faces for more than half a year. The machinery industry has prepared sufficient reserves of work-in-progress. Factories producing new products this year have also made comprehensive preparations. For example, Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory formulated the entire operating procedure for the production of new products for the trial production of doubling machines, and trial-used all new tools, cutting tools, and gauges required for production. This year, all factories and mines have learned from the lessons of equipment maintenance last year and emphasized timely maintenance and attention to the quality of maintenance. Hebei Fengfeng Coal Mine and Shanxi Yangquan Coal Mine used their annual leave to carefully and early overhaul 173 parts, ensuring the completion of the plan in safe production.

While the North China Bureau's factories and mines completed their January production plans, they also pointed out to Party committees at all levels: First, we must comprehensively, carefully, and properly deploy the work in February to ensure the comprehensive completion of various economic indicators; and when completing the production tasks of this month and this day, we must prepare for the next step of production to prepare conditions for the balanced and continuous increase in production. In order to ensure safe production, we must strengthen the class education and technical education of workers, continuously improve the political awareness and technical level of workers, strictly carry out the maintenance and overhaul of equipment in accordance with the plan, and establish and improve the special responsibility system for safe production to eliminate accidents caused by technical and management defects and combat sabotage activities. Second, we must regularly do two things: one is to closely link the actual production work of workers with their actual lives and thoughts to further deepen the education of the general line, and the other is to strengthen the unity of the Party, first of all, the leading cadres in factories and mines must be closely united and work in accordance with the principles of the general line.

    华北区党组织加强对工业生产的领导
    三百个厂矿完成一月份生产计划
   【本报讯】华北区一月份有三百零一个厂矿完成了国家生产计划，扭转了全区厂矿历年来完成计划的先松后紧现象。北京市一百三十七个国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂企业中，有九十二个完成和超额完成了国家计划；天津市有八十个工厂完成了产值与产量计划，而且一般不低于去年第四季度生产的实际水平。山西省一月份完成计划的厂矿有七十五个，超额完成计划的有六十五个，其中太原钢铁厂、太原矿山机器厂等主要厂矿，去年同期没有完成计划，今年都超额完成了。许多厂矿完成计划的均衡程度也超过了往年，北京第一机床厂和华北农业机械总厂的成品装配均衡率达到了百分之百。
    中共中央华北局从新年第一天起就紧紧抓住对工业的领导，监督厂矿的生产工作，检查厂矿对国家计划的执行情况。华北局在去年十二月的工业工作汇报会议上，检查了准备工作情况，及时布置了第一季度的生产；并在一九五四年第一次常务委员会会议上，讨论了全区的工业工作问题，向全区各级党委和厂矿发出指示，要求各级党委采取有效措施，保证第一季度生产不低于一九五三年第四季度生产的实际水平。接着，华北行政委员会财政经济委员会召开了钢铁、煤、电和机器工业的专业会议，一月下旬华北局召开了工业工作汇报会议，着重检查了第一季度计划编制和一月上、中旬计划执行的情况。各省市党委和各厂矿党的组织按照华北局的指示，采取有效措施加强对工业生产的领导。山西省委派出两个检查组分赴工矿区进行重点检查，山西省人民政府工业厅召开各厂矿长扩大干部会议批判了保守思想，订出第一季度先进可行的计划，比原计划提高了百分之九点六，超过去年第四季度实际生产水平百分之一点三。河北省石家庄市委，对全市各厂矿计划的制订情况曾作了四次审查，使二十八个单位的计划总数，由原低于去年第四季实际水平百分之十一点七提高到仅低百分之一；最近正努力争取达到去年第四季度的生产实际水平。
    华北区各级党的组织在加强工业生产的领导中，广泛地在职工中开展政治工作，进一步贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线的教育，以提高职工的社会主义觉悟。天津市地方工业系统各厂职工在总路线教育的鼓舞下，认识到均衡完成生产任务就可以加速国家社会主义工业化，有十个厂今年第一天开工就超额完成了当天的生产计划。由于政治工作的加强，广大职工完成国家计划的责任感也大大加强。据天津棉纺织厂和天津自行车厂等八个单位的统计，一月份出勤率没有低于百分之九十二点八，最高达百分之九十八点二二。山西省大同矿务局出勤率一直保持在百分之九十以上，比去年同期提高百分之五强。
    党在加强政治工作的同时，及时地督促和检查各厂矿一九五四年的生产工作，保证在新年一开始就为全年生产打下良好的物质基础。全区煤矿工业已准备了半年以上的工作面。机器工业准备了充分的在制品的储备量。今年生产新产品的工厂，也都作了周全的准备。如天津纺织机械厂为试制合股机，制订了新产品生产的全部操作规程，试用了全部生产需用的新工具、刀具和量具。今年各厂矿都接受了去年设备检修方面的教训，强调按时检修和注意检修质量。河北峰峰煤矿和山西阳泉煤矿，利用年假认真地及早检修了一百七十三项机件，保证在安全生产中完成计划。
    华北局在各厂矿完成了一月份生产计划同时，又向各级党委指出：第一，要全盘、周密、妥善地部署二月份工作，保证全面地完成各项经济指标；并要在完成本月本日生产任务的时候，做好下一步生产准备工作，为生产均衡地、不断地上升准备条件。为了保证安全生产，要加强职工的阶级教育和技术教育，不断提高职工的政治觉悟和技术水平，严格地按照计划进行设备的维护检修工作，建立与健全安全生产专责制，以消灭由于技术方面和管理方面的缺陷所造成的事故，打击阴谋破坏活动。第二，要经常地做好两件工作，一件是紧密联系职工的生产工作实际和生活、思想实际，进一步深入地进行总路线的教育，另一件是加强党的团结，首先是厂矿中的领导骨干要紧密团结，按照总路线的原则进行工作。
