Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, Eighteenth: According to the German News Agency, the trade delegation of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade signed a trade agreement for 1954 in Moscow on February 13th. Due to the Soviet Union's further cancellation of Germany's reparations, reduction of occupation fees, the transfer without compensation of factories originally taken over by the Soviet Union to East Germany, and the lifting of other financial obligations of East Germany, the exchange of goods between the two countries has greatly increased compared to last year, roughly equivalent to three times that of 1950.
	The goods that East Germany will export to the Soviet Union include mining equipment, equipment for metallurgical and chemical plants, various machines, ships, various railway vehicles, electrical industrial products, precision instruments and optical instruments, chemicals, and consumer goods.

    苏联和民主德国签订一九五四年贸易协定
      【新华社十八日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林讯：德意志民主共和国贸易代表团和苏联对外贸易部于二月十三日在莫斯科签订了一九五四年贸易协定。由于苏联进一步地取消了德国的赔偿费、减少了占领费、把原先由苏联接管的工厂无代价地移交给了民主德国和解除了民主德国的其他财政义务，两国间货物的交换比去年大大地增加了，大约等于一九五○年的三倍。
    民主德国将输往苏联的货物有采矿设备、冶金和化学工厂的设备、各种机器、船只、各种铁道车辆、电气工业品、精密仪器和光学仪器、化学品以及消费品等。
    苏联将输往民主德国的货物主要是谷物、肉类、牛油、植物油、罐头食品、豆类以及其他食物。还有煤、焦炭、矿石、生铁、压延品、金属、棉花和其他纺织原料、原油、焦油脑、药品等。另外，还将增加四百个打谷联合机。
