The broad masses of peasants in Northeast China are enthusiastically subscribing to national economic construction bonds.

Peasants in the suburbs of large and medium-sized cities such as Shenyang, Dalian, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Andong started subscribing to public bonds earlier. In the twenty districts of Shenyang's suburbs, people's representative conferences were generally held before the Spring Festival. Subsequently, in conjunction with the publicity of the General Line and the organization of winter production, extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization work were carried out. After the broad masses of working peasants understood that subscribing to public bonds was to support the country's industrial construction and strive for an early transition to socialist society, they actively subscribed. In Gaokan Village, where all the peasants in the village have embarked on the road of mutual aid and cooperation, the activity of subscribing to public bonds is very enthusiastic. Many members of the Gaokan and Xinglong Agricultural Production Cooperatives have scrambled to take part of the money from selling surplus grain and fat pigs to subscribe to public bonds. Zhao Gang, the women's team leader of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative, took half of the more than two million yuan she earned from selling surplus grain to subscribe to public bonds; Lin Shubo, a member of the Xinglong Agricultural Production Cooperative, saved 300,000 yuan from his labor income to subscribe to public bonds. In just one evening, the peasants in the whole village subscribed to 25.25 million yuan of public bonds, exceeding the expected figure. Before the Spring Festival, peasants in the suburbs of Qiqihar City had subscribed to 22 percent more public bonds than expected.

In the vast rural areas of Liaodong, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, and Liaoxi provinces, in conjunction with the central work of current production and grain purchase, the publicity and mobilization work for subscribing to national economic construction bonds has been successively launched on the basis of in-depth publicity of the General Line. Peasants in some counties have also started subscription activities. Members of the Shuguang Collective Farm in Hailong County, Liaodong Province, in addition to actively carrying out winter production to prepare for increasing grain production this year, also used surplus funds and possible savings to subscribe to public bonds. Peasants in Maxian Gou Village, Jian County, subscribed to more than 10 million yuan of public bonds with surplus money. The members of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Andong County subscribed to 8.5 million yuan of public bonds in 20 minutes. Ten households paid all the subscription money on the spot. They said: The sooner we pay, the sooner the country can use it for industrial construction, and the sooner our peasants can use tractors to cultivate the land! Peasants in Nongfan Village, Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, while actively rectifying mutual aid groups, enthusiastically subscribed to public bonds. In just two days, the whole village subscribed to more than 9 million yuan of public bonds. In Zhifu Village, the ninth district of Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, the amount of public bonds subscribed by peasants in three days exceeded the expected figure by 15 percent.

At present, the activity of subscribing to public bonds by the broad masses of peasants in Northeast China is being fully launched.

    东北广大农民热烈认购公债
    东北各地农民开始热烈认购国家经济建设公债。
    沈阳、旅大、长春、齐齐哈尔、安东等大中城市郊区农民开始认购公债较早。沈阳市郊二十个区，在春节前普遍召开了人民代表会议，随后结合总路线的宣传和组织冬季生产，展开了广泛深入的宣传动员工作。广大劳动农民懂得了认购公债是支援国家工业建设，争取早日过渡到社会主义社会的道理后，便踊跃认购。在全村农民都已走上互助合作道路的高坎村，认购公债的活动十分热烈。高坎、兴隆两个农业生产合作社的许多社员都争先把卖余粮和卖肥猪的钱，拿出一部分来认购公债。高坎农业生产合作社妇女队长赵纲，把卖余粮所得的二百多万元拿出一半认购了公债；兴隆农业生产合作社社员林树柏从劳动所得中节约出来三十万元认购了公债。只一个晚上，全村农民就认购公债两千五百二十五万元，超过预计数字。齐齐哈尔市郊区农民在春节前夕，认购公债已超过了预计数字百分之二十二。
    辽东、松江、黑龙江、辽西等省广大农村，也都结合当前生产、购粮等中心工作，在深入宣传总路线的基础上，先后展开了认购国家经济建设公债的宣传动员工作，有些县份的农民并已开始了认购活动。辽东省海龙县曙光集体农庄的庄员，除了积极开展冬季生产，给今年增产粮食做好准备工作外，还用余款和可能节省下来的钱认购了公债。辑安县麻线沟村农民，用余钱一千多万元认购了公债。安东县前进农业生产合作社的社员们，在二十分钟的时间认购了八百五十万元公债，有十户社员并当场缴完了全部认购款，他们说：我们早一天缴款，国家就能早一天把它用到工业建设上去，我们农民也就能早点使用拖拉机种地！松江省五常县农繁村农民，一面积极整顿互助组，一面热烈地认购公债，只两天的功夫，全村认购公债九百多万元。黑龙江省安达县第九区致富村的农民，在三天里认购公债的数目就超过了预计数字百分之十五。
    目前，东北广大农民认购公债活动，正在全面展开。
