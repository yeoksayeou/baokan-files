Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: The Vietnam News Agency reported on February 20th that on February 16th, a platoon of the Vietnamese People's Army near Dien Bien Phu repeatedly repelled attacks by the French invading forces. On the morning of that day, three battalions of enemy troops sallied forth from the surrounded Dien Bien Phu, attempting to seize Hill 674, four kilometers southeast of Dien Bien Phu. Defending this hill was only a platoon of the Vietnamese People's Army. These three battalions of enemy troops attacked the hill twelve times, but were all bravely repelled by the People's Army platoon, and nearly one hundred were killed.

Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: The Vietnam News Agency reported on February 21st that the Vietnamese People's Army recently annihilated most of a French European-African company transferred from Korea to Vietnam.

On the morning of February 18th, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an attack on the French army stronghold of Duc Tao Ya on Highway 19 in central Vietnam. After 45 minutes of battle, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated this stronghold, killing many enemy soldiers and capturing one hundred European and African soldiers, including the commander of this stronghold and a artillery lieutenant.

    越南人民军以少胜多击退奠边府敌军进攻
    在中越拔除德陶亚法军据点歼灭敌军一个欧非连的大部
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社二十日讯：二月十六日，奠边府附近的越南人民军一排多次击退了法国侵略军的进攻。这天上午，有三营敌军自四面受围的奠边府出犯，企图占领奠边府东南四公里的六七四高地。据守这高地的只有越南人民军一排人。这三营敌军向高地进犯十二次，但都被人民军一排人英勇击退，并被击毙近一百人。
    【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社二十一日讯：越南人民军最近歼灭从朝鲜调到越南的法军一个欧非连的大部分。
    二月十八日早晨，越南人民军对越南中部第十九号公路上的德陶亚法军据点发动进攻，经过四十五分钟战斗，越南人民军即拔除了这个据点，击毙许多敌军和俘掳一百名欧非籍兵士，其中有这个据点的指挥官和一名炮兵中尉；越南人民军缴获了敌军的全部武器和弹药。
    德陶亚据点是中越高原波来古的前哨据点。防守这个据点的敌军约有一百五十名。这些敌军是在不久前从朝鲜调来的法军营的一部分。这个法军营曾被派在中越富安省绥和地区登陆作战，最近才增援到受威胁的波来古地区。
    越南人民军总司令部已以三级军功章授予拔除这个敌军据点的人民军部队。
    又讯：二月十八日晚上，越南人民军摧毁了波来古外围的另一个敌军前哨据点，并攻进了波来古以北十公里的敌军据点边浒，摧毁敌军的许多弹药库。
