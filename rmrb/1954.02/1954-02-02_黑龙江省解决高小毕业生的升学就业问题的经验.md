Heilongjiang Province's Experience in Solving the Problem of Further Education and Employment for Higher Primary School Graduates
Liang Zhichao, Director of the Education Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government

    In the summer of 1953, there were approximately 60,000 higher primary school graduates in Heilongjiang Province. Among them, over 12,000 entered middle school, and over 22,000 participated in agricultural production. In addition, some were introduced to state-owned factories and enterprises as apprentices and shop assistants, some were introduced to government organizations and groups to work, some were organized into tutoring classes, youth study groups, or self-study groups, and some returned to their original schools for further study. Through the efforts of various parties, the problem of further education and employment for higher primary school graduates was largely resolved satisfactorily.

    In the work of solving the problem of further education and employment for higher primary school graduates in 1953, the leading comrades of Party committees and people's governments at all levels personally presided over and controlled the work from studying the situation and determining the principles to formulating plans, deciding on work steps and methods, conducting inspections during the work, and finally summarizing. This was the key to the relatively satisfactory resolution of this problem. For example, the policy for dealing with higher primary school graduates was initially proposed by the Education Department under the direct guidance of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, discussed at meetings of the Provincial Party Committee and administrative meetings of the Provincial People's Government, and finally determined. After the policy was determined, a special meeting was convened to clarify the thinking of cadres, deploy work, explain policies, and clearly define work steps and methods. After receiving the Xinhua News Agency's forwarding of the People's Daily editorial "Solve the Problem of Enrollment of Primary School Graduates Based on Facts," we immediately convened a meeting of heads of municipal, county, and banner cultural and educational bureaus to clarify thinking and uniformly determine work steps in order to avoid passivity and confusion in the work. During the work process, the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Provincial Cultural and Educational Committee, the Education Department, and the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League jointly organized working groups to conduct inspections and pilot projects, gained some experience, and discovered some problems, thus enabling them to provide timely and effective guidance to the lower levels. Leading cadres in various cities, counties, and banners across the province also attached great importance to leading this work. Generally, the issue of solving the study and employment problems of higher primary school graduates was discussed at meetings of the city, county, and banner Party committees and government administrative meetings, and decisions were made. Gao Heng, the mayor of Qiqihar City, personally presided over various meetings and forums with government cadres, factories, enterprises, industrial and commercial circles, student parents, and higher primary school graduates to conduct propaganda, mobilization, persuasion, and education. The Guo Hou Banner Party Committee also conducted a pilot project in the model production village of Mengkeli Village to guide higher primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production. In rural areas, leading cadres of village branches and village people's governments also personally guided the work.

    We have learned that in solving the problem of further education and employment for higher primary school graduates, conducting in-depth and widespread propaganda and education work is of paramount importance. Over the past few years, we have gradually realized that there is ideological resistance to solving this problem not only among students, student parents, and the broad masses of the people, but also among the vast number of cadres and even educators. Without first solving the ideological problems of this group of people, it is impossible to smoothly conduct propaganda and education work among the masses. Therefore, we first raised the issue of strengthening propaganda and education within various organizations. We have used meeting formats within Party committees, the Communist Youth League, trade unions, the Democratic Women's Federation, government organizations, and enterprises at all levels to report to cadres and conduct propaganda and education. Among the people, in addition to using people's representative meetings, production meetings, night schools, and literacy classes for propaganda, we also used the propaganda network and organized all propagandists to carry out propaganda. In schools, we have universally educated graduating students and conducted propaganda and education for student parents through parent meetings. In addition, we have focused on conducting home visits. The content of propaganda and education mainly focused on the following points: First, graduating from primary school means completing basic national education. Therefore, most students should participate in industrial and agricultural production, and some students should continue their education; Second, education should serve production, and participating in labor production is glorious and has a promising future; Third, the prospects for socialist agriculture. We also paid special attention to the opportunities before and after the examinations to directly educate higher primary school graduates. The propaganda ministers or county heads of various cities, counties, and banners personally gave reports and held forums at the examination sites. County cultural and educational bureaus, district cultural and educational assistants, principals, and teachers also focused on conducting home visits and provided individual education to students. Primary school teachers are an important force in propaganda work. Each county has organized primary school teachers to study articles on the problem of higher primary school graduates in newspapers and magazines, taking districts as units. Primary school teachers have been very active and responsible in this work, and generally they have been able to conduct propaganda correctly. Heilongjiang Daily, the Provincial People's Broadcasting Station, the Provincial Cultural Center, and the cultural stations of various counties have also provided strong cooperation in propaganda and education.

    Such a work involving all strata and all aspects cannot be done well by the educational administrative department alone. It requires the close cooperation and collaboration of organizations such as the Communist Youth League, trade unions, and the Democratic Women's Federation under the leadership of the Party Committee. However, in this respect, the work was generally not done well last year.

    At present, there are still some problems in Heilongjiang Province that have not been well resolved. Among educators, cadres, the masses, and students, there are still many people who do not correctly understand the relationship between education and national economic construction, the principle that education should serve production and construction, and so on. Therefore, there is still considerable resistance to continuing to organize higher primary school graduates to participate in industrial and agricultural production, especially agricultural production. Although a large number of rural higher primary school graduates have participated in agricultural production, many of them are not at ease. Some have "bodies in the countryside but hearts in the city," and individual students wander around, not engaging in production properly. A small number of students in the city idle on the streets all day long, which has a very bad impact on the masses. In addition, the tutoring classes in cities and towns still have many problems from policies, organizational leadership to funding and teachers, which have not been properly resolved, and the teaching and discipline situations are not good enough.

    In order to solve the above problems and better deal with the issue of enrollment and employment of primary school graduates in 1954, we plan to do the following work this year:

    First, in conjunction with the propaganda and education of the general line, we will use various opportunities and organize various propaganda forces to conduct universal and in-depth propaganda and education among cadres, the people, and students, so that everyone adopts a correct attitude towards higher primary school graduates participating in labor production, and that higher primary school graduates who cannot continue their education happily participate in production labor.

    Second, in junior high schools and primary schools, we must strengthen socialist ideology and labor production education. Primary schools should appropriately add production knowledge courses and abacus courses, regularly organize visits to factories and agricultural production cooperatives, invite labor models to give reports, and invite students who have achieved success in industrial and agricultural production after graduation to return to school to give reports and other activities.

    Third, the Communist Youth League and Democratic Women's Federation organizations at all levels, especially their grassroots organizations, should carry out their work among higher primary school graduates, and include organizing and mobilizing them to participate in labor production and organizing them to engage in spare-time study in their work agenda.

    Fourth, schools should regularly convene graduates for education and help them solve difficult problems in self-study. In addition, we should carry out education work for parents.

    Fifth, the educational administrative department should cooperate with relevant parties to rectify and run tutoring classes, youth study groups, and self-study groups well.

    黑龙江省解决高小毕业生的升学就业问题的经验
    黑龙江省人民政府教育厅厅长　梁志超
    一九五三年暑期，黑龙江省高小毕业生约为六万人，其中一万二千多人升入中学，二万二千多人参加了农业生产，此外，有的被介绍到国营工厂、企业做徒工、店员，有的被介绍到机关团体作工作，有的组织到补习班、青年进修学园或自修小组学习，有的回原校补习。经过各方面的工作，高小毕业生的升学和就业问题大体上获得了较为妥善的解决。
    在一九五三年解决高小毕业生升学和就业问题的工作中，各级党委和人民政府的负责同志，从研究情况，确定方针，到制订计划，决定工作步骤、方法，工作中进行检查，以至最后总结，都是亲自主持和掌握的，这是这一问题所以能够比较妥善解决的关键。例如，处理高小毕业生的方针，是在省委宣传部直接指导下，由教育厅提出初步方案，在省委会议和省人民政府政务会议上进行了讨论，最后确定下来的。方针确定后，即召开专门会议，打通干部思想，布置工作，交代政策，明白地确定了工作步骤和方法。在接到新华社转发的人民日报社论“实事求是地解决小学毕业生升学问题”的电讯稿以后，我们立即召开了市、县、旗文教科长会议，澄清了思想，统一确定了工作步骤，以避免工作中的被动和混乱。在工作过程中，省委宣传部、省文教委员会、教育厅、团省委曾联合组织了工作组进行检查，并作试点工作，取得了一些经验，发现了一些问题，因而能比较及时地给予下边以有力指导。全省各市、县、旗的领导干部也都很重视对这一工作的领导，一般地都在市、县、旗委会议、政府政务会议上讨论了解决高小毕业生学习和就业的问题，并做出了决定。齐齐哈尔市高衡市长曾主持召开了机关干部、工厂企业、工商业界、学生家长、高小毕业生的各种会议和座谈会，进行宣传动员和说服教育。郭后旗旗委并在生产模范村——孟克里村做了引导高小毕业生参加农业生产的试点工作。在农村里，村支部和村人民政府的领导干部也都亲自指导了这一工作的进行。
    我们体会到，在解决高小毕业生升学和就业问题上，进行深入广泛的宣传教育工作具有头等重要的意义。几年来，我们逐渐认识到，解决这一问题不仅在学生、学生家长以及广大人民群众中间有思想阻力，就是在广大干部、甚至教育工作者中间也有思想阻力，不首先解决这一部分人的思想问题，要想顺利地向群众进行宣传教育工作是不可能的。因此，我们首先提出了加强各组织内部的宣传教育的问题。我们曾在各级党委、青年团、工会、民主妇联、机关、企业内部，利用会议形式向干部做报告，进行宣传教育。在人民群众中间，除了利用人民代表会议、生产会、夜校、识字班等进行宣传外，还利用宣传网，组织全体宣传员进行了宣传。在学校里，普遍地对将要毕业的学生进行了教育，并通过家长座谈会对学生家长进行了宣传教育，另外，还重点地进行了家庭访问。宣传教育内容，主要着重在下面几点：一、小学毕业，已完成了国民基础教育。因此，大部分学生应参加工农业生产，一部分学生继续升学；二、教育要为生产服务，参加劳动生产是光荣的，同样有远大前途；三、社会主义农业的前景。我们还特别抓紧考试前和发榜后的机会，对高小毕业生直接进行了教育。各市、县、旗委宣传部长或县长，都亲自到考场做报告和召开座谈会，县文教科、区文教助理员、校长、教师并重点进行家庭访问，对学生进行个别教育。小学教师是宣传工作中的重要力量。各县都曾以区为单位集中小学教师学习了报纸刊物上的有关高小毕业生问题的文章。小学教师在这次工作中，都很积极负责，一般地都能够正确地进行宣传。黑龙江日报、省人民广播电台以及省文化馆、各县文化站在宣传教育上也都做了有力的配合。
    这样一项牵连到各阶层、各个方面的工作，光靠教育行政部门是做不好的，须要在党委的领导下，青年团、工会、民主妇女联合会等组织的密切配合，通力合作。但在这一方面，去年一般是作得不好的。
    现在，黑龙江省还有一些问题没有得到很好的解决，不论在教育工作者、干部、群众和学生当中，还有不少人对于教育和国家经济建设的关系，教育要为生产建设服务等等道理，没有正确的了解，因此，今后继续组织高小毕业生参加工、农业生产，尤其是农业生产，还有着相当大的阻力。农村高小毕业生虽然大量参加了农业生产，但还有许多人不很安心，有的“人在农村，心在城市”，个别的学生，东家出，西家进，游游逛逛，不好好生产；城市有一小部分学生，则整天街头闲荡，这些都给群众以很不好的影响。此外，城、镇的补习班从方针、组织领导到经费、师资还存在着很多问题，没有得到妥善解决，教学、纪律情况也还不够好。
    为了解决上述问题，更好地处理一九五四年小学毕业生升学和就业问题，我们打算今年做好下面这些工作：
    一、结合总路线的宣传教育，利用各种机会，组织各种宣传力量，经常地在干部中间，在人民群众中间，在学生中间进行普遍深入的宣传教育，使大家对高小毕业生参加劳动生产采取正确的态度，使不能升学的高小毕业生愉快地参加生产劳动。
    二、在初中和小学当中，要加强社会主义思想和劳动生产的教育，小学要适当增添生产知识课和珠算等课，经常组织参观工厂、农业生产合作社，请劳动模范作报告，邀请毕业后参加工、农业生产有成绩的同学回校作报告等活动。
    三、各级青年团、民主妇女联合会组织，尤其是它们的基层组织要在高小毕业生中间开展自己的工作，把组织动员他们参加劳动生产，组织他们进行业余学习，列入工作日程。
    四、学校要定期召集毕业生进行教育，并帮助他们解决自修中的疑难问题。另外，要开展对家长的教育工作。
    五、教育行政部门要配合有关方面整顿并办好补习班、青年进修学园和自修小组。
