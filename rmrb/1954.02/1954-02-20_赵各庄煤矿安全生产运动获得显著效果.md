    Zhao Gezhuang Coal Mine Achieves Significant Results in Safe Production Campaign
    The Zhao Gezhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine has conscientiously implemented the policy of safe production and has achieved great results in the past year. Since the mine launched the 500,000-ton safe production campaign on January 16 last year, it has continuously completed the task of carrying out three 500,000-ton safe production campaigns in the past year, and the fourth 500,000-ton safe production campaign is continuing.
    Due to the mine's good safety production campaign, it overfulfilled the state production and basic construction plan ahead of schedule last year. The efficiency of all employees completed 102.98% of the plan, the ash content was reduced by 0.1%, and the unit cost was reduced by 8.69%. There were no deaths in the year, only one serious injury, which was 98.46% lower than the same period of the previous year, light injuries were reduced by 57.88%, and non-work-related injuries were also reduced by 70%.
    After the mine achieved the above-mentioned significant results, it was commended and rewarded by the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and relevant leading organs. The mine has achieved the above-mentioned results mainly by carrying out the following tasks:
    First, we conscientiously implemented the policy of safe production, launched a mass anti-accident struggle, and laid the foundation for production work. Since the launch of the 500,000-ton safe production campaign on January 16, cadres and workers have repeatedly criticized various incorrect ideas through specific examples, and conducted conscientious ideological inspections, thereby establishing a unified idea of "safety for production, and production should not forget safety." During the campaign, six mass safety inspections were carried out, and 8,987 safety production problems were solved successively according to the principles of necessity and possibility, and unsafe conditions were improved. On the basis of the safety inspection, 65 technical operating procedures for major types of work were formulated and implemented, and 286 grass-roots cadres and 716 workers of major types of work were organized to leave production and conduct training in a step-by-step manner. General workers used their spare time to conduct amateur studies for three consecutive months. The technical level of workers has been improved, and a formal operation system has been established. Preventive plans have also been made for major safety issues (such as water prevention, fire prevention, and gas), and a regular inspection system has been established. At the same time, compliance with operating procedures has been included in the group plan, and regular inspections have been carried out. In the event of an accident, a mass anti-accident struggle is launched through criticism and self-criticism, which effectively guarantees safe production.
    Second, we strengthened planned management with the operation plan as the center, which made production gradually balanced and also effectively guaranteed the safety of production. In the past, the mine had no production plan. Although a monthly plan was set at the beginning of last year, the plan was not submitted to the workers for discussion and was divorced from reality. Therefore, the monthly average in the first quarter could not complete the production task according to the plan. To this end, the leadership conscientiously studied the advanced experience of the "May 3" factory and strengthened the concept of planning for cadres and workers. Starting in April, plans were formulated from top to bottom, and workers were mobilized to discuss and revise them so that the plan was close to reality. Starting in July, operation plans for months, ten-day periods, days, and shifts began to be compiled, and a dispatching organization was established. The Party organization mobilized the masses through the trade union to strictly implement the operation plan. Secondly, in terms of technical management, a technical responsibility system was also established around the operation plan, and major problems (water prevention, grouting, fire extinguishing, roof management, etc.) were studied and solved by special personnel. After a relatively long period of observation and research on the site, the law of roof in the seventh and ninth troughs was found out, roof accidents were eliminated, and the roof was effectively controlled. The advanced experience of Datong Coal Mine was promoted in medium-thick coal seams, and the recovery rate of pit wood was increased from 60% in the past to 90%, which saved wealth for the country and ensured safety. A series of systems have also been established in production management. In addition, 1,572 grass-roots cadres and workers were trained to improve their technical level; the work of auxiliary production units was improved. This has gradually made production balanced. From April to the end of the year, except for June, the national plan was overfulfilled on a monthly basis. From January to November last year, the average monthly production balance rate reached 97%.
    Third, we strengthened on-site management and improved the responsibility system for on-site management. Since the launch of the third 500,000-ton safe production campaign, the leadership of districts and sections has been strengthened, a division of labor and responsibility system has been established, and they often go deep into the site to guide the work, and a daily meeting of district chiefs, deputy district chiefs, assistant coal engineers, and technicians has been established to achieve unity in command. In order to further rationalize the labor organization, the district and section leaders also went deep into the site to repeatedly investigate the geological conditions, machinery and equipment, operating methods, and labor organization distribution, studied the connection of processes, and compiled a circular operation table, so that man-hours were fully utilized and the phenomenon of on-site disorder was overcome.
    Fourth, we promoted advanced experience with key significance and conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts. Since mid-September last year, 27 advanced experiences with key significance have been summarized and promoted successively. After Li Changzhen's "safe support method" was promoted in 6598 working faces, not only was the quality up to specifications, but also the work efficiency was quickly doubled; after the electromechanical department promoted the advanced experience of the "safe operation patrol inspection system," mechanical accidents were greatly reduced, ensuring the safe operation of machinery. The employees also created many other advanced experiences, which played a great role in ensuring safe production. At the same time, eleven suggestions from Soviet experts were conscientiously implemented, production was improved, and production efficiency was greatly improved.

    赵各庄煤矿安全生产运动获得显著效果
    开滦煤矿赵各庄矿认真贯彻安全生产的方针，一年来取得了很大成绩。该矿自去年一月十六日开展五十万吨安全生产运动以来，一年来已连续完成了开展三个五十万吨安全生产运动的任务，目前第四个五十万吨安全生产运动正继续开展中。
    由于该矿安全生产运动搞得好，去年提前超额完成了国家生产和基本建设计划，全员效率完成计划百分之一○二点九八，灰分减低百分之零点一，单位成本降低百分之八点六九。一年中没有发生死亡事故，重伤只有一名，与过去的一年同期比较，降低了百分之九十八点四六，轻伤降低百分之五十七点八八，非工伤事故也降低了百分之七十。
    该矿获得以上重大成绩后，曾分别受到中共中央华北局和有关领导机关的表扬和奖励。该矿能取得以上成绩，主要是进行了以下几项工作：
    第一，认真贯彻了安全生产的方针，开展群众性的反事故斗争，给生产工作打下了基础。从一月十六日开展五十万吨安全生产运动开始，在干部、职工中，通过具体事例反复批判了各种不正确思想，并认真地进行了思想检查，从而树立了“安全为了生产，生产不忘安全”的统一思想。运动中曾进行了六次群众性的安全大检查，根据需要与可能的原则，先后解决了八九八七件安全生产中的问题，改进了不安全情况。在安全大检查的基础上，制订和贯彻了六十五种主要工种的技术操作规程，并有步骤地组织了二八六名基层干部和七一六名主要工种工人脱产进行了训练，一般工人则利用工余时间，连续进行了三个月的业余学习。提高了工人技术水平，树立了正规作业制度。对于重大安全问题（如防水、防火、瓦斯）也都作了预防计划，建立了定期检查制度，同时把遵守操作规程列入小组计划，定期检查，发生事故，即通过批评与自我批评方式，开展群众性的反事故斗争，这样就有力地保证了安全生产。
    第二，以作业计划为中心，加强了计划管理，使生产逐步走向均衡，也有力地保证了生产的安全。该矿过去生产无计划，去年年初虽订了月计划，但计划并未交工人讨论，脱离实际，因此，第一季度月月均不能按计划完成生产任务。为此，领导上即认真学习“五三”工厂的先进经验，加强了干部和职工的计划观念。四月份开始即自上而下制订计划，发动职工群众讨论修订，使计划接近了实际。七月份起，开始编制月、旬、日、点班的作业计划，建立了调度组织，党的组织则通过工会发动群众，使作业计划严格贯彻执行。其次在技术管理上，亦围绕作业计划，建立了技术责任制，重大问题（防水、灌浆、灭火、顶板管理等）则由专人研究解决。经过比较长期对现场的观察和研究，找出了七、九槽顶板规律，消灭了顶板事故，有效地控制了顶板；并在中厚煤层推行大同煤矿的先进经验，坑木回收率由过去的百分之六十提高到百分之九十，为国家节省了财富，又保证了安全，在生产管理上也建立了一系列的制度。此外，训练了一五七二名基层干部和工人，提高了技术水平；改进了辅助生产单位的工作。这样就使生产逐步走向均衡，从四月份至年底除六月份外，均按月超额完成了国家计划，去年一至十一月，月的生产均衡率平均达到百分之九十七。
    第三，加强现场管理，健全了现场管理的责任制。第三个五十万吨安全生产运动开展以来，加强了区、科领导，确定了分工责任制，经常深入现场指导工作，并建立了区长、副区长、助理煤师和技术员的每日碰头会，作到了指挥上的统一。为了使劳动组织进一步达到合理化，区、科领导又深入现场反复的进行对地质条件、机械设备、操作方法及劳动组织分布情况的调查，研究工序的衔接，编制了循环作业表，使工时得到充分的利用，克服了现场紊乱现象。
    第四，推广带有关键性的先进经验，认真的执行苏联专家建议。去年九月中旬以后，先后总结和推广了二十七种有关键性的先进经验。李长振的“安全支柱法”，在六五九八掌推行后，不但质量合乎规格，而且工作效率很快就提高了一倍；机电部门推广了“安全运转巡回检查制”的先进经验后，大大减少了机械事故，保证了机械安全的运转。职工们并创造了其他很多先进经验，对保证安全生产都起到很大的作用。同时认真执行了苏联专家十一项建议，改进了生产，大大提高了生产效率。
