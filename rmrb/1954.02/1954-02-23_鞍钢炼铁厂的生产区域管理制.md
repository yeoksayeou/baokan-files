The production requirements of modern industrial enterprises demand centralized and unified management. According to Soviet experience, the production area management system is the most suitable scientific management system for socialist industrial enterprises. Implementing the production area management system means rationally establishing production management organizations according to the characteristics of production and the distribution of areas, strictly implementing the "one-chief system" in each production area, and implementing the responsibility system for functional departments and the individual post responsibility system, so that everything is someone's responsibility, everyone's duties are clear, and the national plan is comprehensively overfulfilled. The following is an introduction to the situation before and after the implementation of the production area management system in the ironmaking plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company for reference.

(1) The original production management was very unreasonable

The most important equipment of Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant is several blast furnaces. Each blast furnace is equipped with hoisting machines, ore trucks and coke trucks, hot blast stoves and other equipment, and the blast furnace body also has cooling equipment. However, some of them are the latest semi-automatic equipment, and some are 19th-century mechanized equipment. During ironmaking, there are hoisting workers and raw material workers to load and transport raw materials, gas workers to heat cold air, piping workers to repair cooling equipment, furnace front workers to tap slag and iron, and blast furnace technicians to control blast furnace operation. In addition, the ironmaking plant also has attached cast iron equipment, as well as electrical and mechanical repair and other auxiliary equipment. Except for major repairs, ironmaking work is carried out continuously day and night. Workers work in three shifts (eight hours per shift) around the clock.

Before 1951, the production organization and management organization of Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant were very unreasonable, and were not organized with each blast furnace as a basic production area. The workers working in each blast furnace were led by several different workshops and shifts according to their types of work: the furnace front workers of each blast furnace in the whole plant belonged to the furnace front shift leader of the ironmaking workshop, the gas workers of each blast furnace belonged to the hot blast stove shift leader of the ironmaking workshop, the piping workers of each blast furnace belonged to the piping shift leader of the ironmaking workshop, and the raw material workers and hoisting workers of each blast furnace belonged to the raw material shift leader and hoisting shift leader of the material transportation workshop respectively. The workers took turns working eight hours at each blast furnace in three shifts day and night, while the shift leaders only worked eight hours during the day. The duty technicians of each blast furnace were only in charge of the internal operation of the blast furnace. In this way, each blast furnace – the basic production organization of the ironmaking plant – was divided into four parts in management. The workers working in the same blast furnace were led by the shift leaders of the whole plant according to their respective types of work. The duty technicians of the blast furnace had no right to lead them. When accidents occurred, they shirked responsibility and argued endlessly. No one was responsible for the failure to complete the plan. Although there was a duty leader in each shift of the whole plant for the eight hours, this duty leader was only responsible for guiding the technical operation of the blast furnace, and his power was very small. When the repair workshop wanted to repair the ore truck for transporting materials, it could suspend the transportation and supply of raw materials without notifying the duty leader or the blast furnace technician.

Because the "one-chief system" was not strictly established, the factory director, deputy factory director, workshop directors, and shift leaders could all give orders to the workers separately. Therefore, when it came to daytime, there were too many leaders, and the production was very chaotic. When the duty leader had to correct some unrealistic or conflicting orders in order to take care of balanced production, he often had to consult with all parties or call the factory director again and again for a final decision. But sometimes, after changing back and forth, the workers also felt clueless and didn't know what to do. In the middle and night shifts, there were fewer leaders, but there was less chaos.

Functional departments believed that handling trivial matters and calculating production consequences were their own work, and being out of touch with the site was simply a common problem. Some departments directly convened meetings and issued orders without going through the factory director, and even transferred production personnel without notifying the factory director or shift leader. There were many engineers in the factory, who were concentrated in the engineer's office directly under the leadership of the factory director. Usually, they did not have fixed work, but only listened to the factory director's temporary orders to solve individual technical problems. However, they did not understand the situation at ordinary times, and often solved problems unsatisfactorily when they went to solve problems temporarily. The active role of functional departments and functional personnel had not been properly brought into play. The phenomenon of no one being responsible in the whole plant was very serious, responsibility accidents occurred frequently, and production was very abnormal.

(2) Implementing the production area management system

Since 1951, Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant has gradually implemented the production area management system, especially since 1953, it has further implemented the production area management system and implemented planned management. How did the plant implement and implement the production area management system?

Rationally divide production management areas and implement the "one-chief system"

For an ironmaking plant with several blast furnaces, the division of basic production areas should combine various workers (including raw material workers, hoisting workers, furnace front workers, gas workers, piping workers, etc.) who directly serve the same blast furnace, and be directly led by the blast furnace technician, so that the blast furnace becomes a basic production area with independent production capacity. According to this requirement, Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant successively abolished the plant-wide hot blast stove shift leader, and assigned the gas workers of each blast furnace to the duty technician of each blast furnace. Later, it abolished the plant-wide furnace front shift leader, and assigned the furnace front workers of each blast furnace to the duty technician of each blast furnace. It was determined that the production work of each shift of each blast furnace was completely the responsibility of the duty technician of each blast furnace. Recently, starting from No. 8 blast furnace, the furnace front workers, gas workers, piping workers, raw material workers, hoisting workers, etc. who serve the blast furnace in each shift are all under the leadership of the blast furnace duty technician. In this way, the combination of technology and administration is realized, and the unity and concentration of blast furnace production management work are strengthened.

Ironmaking work is carried out continuously in three shifts (eight hours per shift) day and night, and each shift should be an organic whole. In the implementation of the production area management system, Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant abolished the original production management organizations divided by types of work, such as the ironmaking workshop and the material transportation workshop, and established a plant-wide duty leader system. The production of each shift in the whole plant is fully responsible by a duty leader. The duty leader directly leads the duty technicians of each blast furnace to carry out production. The dispatching room is also under the leadership of the duty leader in each shift. The duty leader directly controls the production progress of a shift and the cooperation between various sections. The daily production problems are solved by the duty leader. In this way, the phenomenon of no one being responsible in each shift is eliminated. The duty leader and the blast furnace duty technician have established and implemented a strict shift handover system.

In this way, Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant has implemented the "one-chief system": the factory director is the highest administrative leader of the whole plant, he is fully responsible for the work of the whole plant, and directly leads the deputy factory director for production, the equipment assistant, and the section chiefs of various functional departments. The deputy factory director for production is the general person in charge of production, he is responsible to the factory director, he has the right to directly control the work of the duty leader and various specialized engineers and technicians, and conduct supervision and inspection. The duty leader is the person in charge of production in each shift of the whole plant. When the deputy factory director for production is not in the plant, the duty leader can also replace the work of the deputy factory director for production. The duty technician of each blast furnace is responsible for the work of the whole furnace during his duty. All decisions concerning the dispatch and rewards and punishments of all personnel of the whole furnace in the shift must first be approved by the duty technician of the shift before they are valid. Because the "one-chief system" has been implemented at all levels and the powers of the leaders of each production area have been clarified, the phenomena of multiple, weak, and irresponsible leadership in the past have been overcome, and the problems that occur in production can be solved in a timely and effective manner.

Establish the responsibility system for functional departments and functional personnel

The plant has also established the responsibility system for functional departments, clarifying that functional departments are assistants to the factory director, and have no right to directly order production units, but should be responsible for supervising and ensuring that production units implement the factory director's orders and complete the national plan within their own functional scope. Therefore, each functional department must clarify its central business and responsibilities, clarify the division of labor, and carry out work in a planned manner. For example, the labor and wage department has clarified that mastering the labor and wage plan is its central business, and other tasks in the department, such as promoting advanced experience, wage management, and reward assessment, should be closely combined to ensure the completion of this central task. The labor organization work was originally managed by the personnel department, but now it is assigned to the labor and wage department. On the one hand, the labor and wage department should continuously create conditions for the implementation of the labor plan and the improvement of labor productivity on the site. On the other hand, it must also supervise the rational arrangement and use of labor on the site. More than ten labor organization improvement tasks in the whole plant in 1953 were successfully completed after the staff of the labor and wage department cooperated with the site to carry out a series of ideological and organizational work. Other departments have also compiled annual plans for the plans that they should be responsible for guaranteeing and supervising the completion of (such as the personnel department's plan for personnel training, the production department's plan for production technology, the economic accounting personnel's plan for financial costs, and the welfare staff's plan for welfare measures), and further compiled quarterly plans, monthly plans, and weekly plans in a timely manner. Some personnel have also compiled daily action plans according to the weekly plans and earnestly implemented them. Planned management has also been implemented in the departments. The engineers and technicians who originally only waited for the factory director's orders to act temporarily have also established a professional responsibility system. Now there are raw material engineers, smelting engineers, furnace front technicians, gas technicians, piping technicians, mechanical technicians, electrical technicians, etc., each responsible for the technical work in their profession. They have quickly become specialized talents in their respective professions, and under the leadership of the deputy factory director for production and the equipment assistant, they guide the work of employees and technical and administrative cadres within their technical professional scope, and guarantee and supervise the implementation of operating procedures from the technical aspect to ensure the completion of the production plan.

Gradually promote the worker post responsibility system

The plant has also established a worker post responsibility system in some key production teams. For example, the furnace front workers of the blast furnace used to work alternately at the iron tapping hole and the slag tapping hole. This, on the one hand, fostered the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and on the other hand, violated the principle of dividing labor according to technical proficiency. As a result, the work was chaotic and accidents were likely to occur. Now, the entire furnace front work of each blast furnace has been clearly divided according to the technical complexity and importance, and the work posts of each person have been fixed according to the level of workers' technical skills. In this way, not only does each worker in each post have the corresponding technical level, but also the training and promotion of workers has a clear criterion. However, the worker post responsibility system is a major work in labor organization, and it involves changes in wages, which is a major issue and needs further study and steady promotion. In addition, the work of some workers is temporary or mobile in itself, so it is impossible to fix their work posts.

(3) The supervision and guarantee role of the Party organization

The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant, after heated debate in the implementation of the production area management system, and with the approval of the higher authorities, under the Party committee, trade union, and Communist Youth League general branch at the plant level, organized Party branches, trade unions, and Communist Youth League branches by shift, and then set up groups by shift of each blast furnace to adapt to the production organization and strengthen the work of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union in each shift.

When the duty technician of each blast furnace is used as the leader of the whole blast furnace in the shift, some blast furnace technicians are afraid of trouble and are unwilling to add administrative work, and some workers are unwilling to accept the leadership of the blast furnace technicians. This is a serious obstacle to the implementation of the production area management system and the implementation of the "one-chief system". The Party committee of the plant led the trade union and the Communist Youth League to actively overcome this obstacle in cooperation with the administration. The Party committee studied the situation of the blast furnace technicians one by one, discussed the methods of uniting and educating them, and assigned special personnel to carry out specific work, educating the technicians to combine technology and administration in order to better complete the national plan. It focused on cultivating two technicians who made faster progress and took the lead in being responsible for the production work of the entire blast furnace during their duty, and paid attention to praising the slightest progress of each technician to promote justice. In addition, it educated the workers to consciously consolidate labor discipline, abide by operating procedures, and obey the leadership of the blast furnace duty technicians in order to do a good job in production. It also educated the technicians to combine technology with labor, especially to be responsible for answering every technical question raised by the workers in the blast furnace work. Some blast furnace technicians are irresponsible during their duty. The Party leads the trade union to mobilize the workers to make criticisms and suggestions at the production meeting. At the same time, it also educates the technicians to humbly accept the beneficial criticisms and suggestions of the workers and take responsibility seriously. After these tasks, everyone's work enthusiasm is very high, and the things of technicians and workers cooperating to put forward rationalization proposals and promote advanced experience have increased.

Since 1953, Anshan Iron and Steel Works' ironmaking plant has further implemented the production area management system and implemented planned management. The number of production responsibility accidents has been greatly reduced. Compared with April 1953 and the same period in 1952, the number of material collapse accidents has decreased by 90%, and the number of material suspension accidents has decreased by 85%. In 1952, the plant failed to complete the production plan for eight months, and only managed to complete the production task five days and twenty hours ahead of schedule by carrying out a shock campaign in the fourth quarter. In 1953, it was able to overfulfill the production task in a balanced manner every month, and completed the national plan for the whole year more than twenty-seven days ahead of schedule on December 4. The plant is preparing to steadily promote the worker post responsibility system, continue to implement the production area management system and consolidate planned management, in order to further improve the production level.

    鞍钢炼铁厂的生产区域管理制
    朱理允
    现代工业企业的生产要求集中统一的管理，根据苏联的经验，生产区域管理制是最适合于社会主义工业企业的科学管理制度。实行生产区域管理制，就是要按照生产的特征和区域的分布合理地设立生产管理组织，在每一个生产区域内严格实行一长制，实行职能机构的责任制和个人的岗位责任制，作到事事有人负责，人人职责分明，保证全面超额完成国家计划。现将鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂实行生产区域管理制前后的情形介绍如下，以供参考。
    （一）原来的生产管理很不合理
    鞍钢炼铁厂最主要的设备是若干座高炉。每座高炉都附有卷扬机，运料的矿石车和焦炭车，热风炉等设备，高炉身上还有冷却设备。但其中有的是最新式的半自动化设备，有的是十九世纪的机械化设备。炼铁时，要装运原料有运转工和原料工，把冷风加热有瓦斯工，检修冷却设备有配管工，高炉出渣出铁有炉前工，掌握高炉操作有高炉技术员。另外，炼铁厂还附属有铸铁设备，还有电气、机械修理等辅助设备。除了大修以外，炼铁工作是日日夜夜连续进行的。工人们每昼夜分成三班（每班八小时）轮流进行工作。
    在一九五一年以前，鞍钢炼铁厂的生产组织和管理组织很不合理，不是按每一座高炉为一个基层生产区域来组织的。在各高炉工作的工人们是按工种分别属于几个不同的车间和班领导着：全厂各高炉的炉前工是属于炼铁车间的炉前班长领导，各高炉的瓦斯工是属于炼铁车间的热风炉班长领导，各高炉的配管工人属于炼铁车间的配管班长领导，而各高炉的原料工和运转工则分别属于料运车间的原料班长和运转班长领导。工人们是每昼夜分三班轮流赴各高炉工作八小时，而班长们只是白天的八小时上班。各个高炉的值班技术员只管高炉的炉内操作。这样，每一个高炉——炼铁厂的基层生产组织在管理上就被分割得四分五裂，在同一个高炉工作的工人，是分别属于全厂性的按各个工种划分的班长领导，高炉的值班技术员无权领导他们，发生事故时就互相推诿，争吵不休，计划完不成则无人负责。全厂在每个轮班的八小时中虽然也有一个值班长，但这个值班长仅仅负责指导高炉的技术操作，他的权力很小。修理车间要检修运料的矿石车时，可以不通知值班长也不通知高炉技术员，就中止了原料的运输供应。
    由于没有严格建立一长制，厂长、副厂长、各车间主任、各班班长都可以分头直接给工人下命令，所以一到白天，领导多头，生产非常混乱，值班长为了照顾均衡生产而必须改正某种不切合实际的或互相抵触的命令时，往往要与各方面协商，或者要接二连三地打电话找厂长作最后决定，但有时改来改去，工人也感到漫无头绪，不知如何是好。到了中班、夜班，领导头少，反而乱得少些。
    职能机构认为处理琐碎事情，计算生产后果就是自己的工作，和现场脱节简直是通病；有的科股不通过厂长就直接召开会议，发布命令，甚至把生产人员调走了也不通知厂长或班长。厂里有不少工程师，被集中在直接受厂长领导的工程师室，平时没有固定的工作，只是听候厂长的临时命令，解决个别的技术问题，但平时不了解情况，临时去解决问题往往解决得很不圆满。职能机构和职能人员的积极作用都没有得到正当的发挥。全厂无人负责现象很严重，责任事故频繁，生产很不正常。
    （二）实行生产区域管理制
    从一九五一年起，鞍钢炼铁厂逐步实行了生产区域管理制，特别是一九五三年以来，更进一步贯彻了生产区域管理制，并实行了计划管理。该厂是怎样实行和贯彻了生产区域管理制的呢？
    合理地划分生产管理区域并实行一长制
    有着若干高炉的炼铁厂，基层生产区域的划分应该是将直接服务于同一高炉的各种工人（包括原料工、运转工、炉前工、瓦斯工、配管工等）结合起来，并直接受高炉技术员领导，使高炉成为一个具有独立生产能力的基层生产区域。鞍钢炼铁厂根据这个要求，先后取消了全厂性的热风炉班长，把各个高炉的瓦斯工分别划归各该高炉的值班技术员领导，以后又取消了全厂性的炉前班长，把各高炉的炉前工分别划归各该高炉的值班技术员领导，确定各高炉每个轮班的生产工作，完全由各该高炉的值班技术员负责。最近从八号高炉开始，每个轮班为高炉服务的炉前工、瓦斯工、配管工、原料工、运转工等都归高炉值班技术员领导。这样，使技术与行政结合起来，加强了高炉生产管理工作的统一性和集中性。
    炼铁工作是每昼夜分三班（每班八小时）轮流连续进行的，每个轮班应该是一个有机的整体。鞍钢炼铁厂在实行生产区域管理制中，取消了原来的炼铁车间、料运车间等按工种划分的生产管理组织，建立了全厂性的值班长制，全厂每一轮班的生产，由一个值班长负完全责任，值班长直接领导各高炉值班技术员进行生产，调度室在每轮班中也受值班长领导，值班长直接掌握一个轮班的生产进度及各工段间的配合，日常的生产问题都由值班长负责解决。这样就消灭了各班生产中的无人负责现象。值班长、高炉值班技术员都建立和实行了严格的交接班制度。
    这样，鞍钢炼铁厂就贯彻执行起一长制来了：厂长是全厂行政上的最高领导者，他对全厂工作负完全责任，直接领导生产副厂长、设备助理及各职能科科长。生产副厂长则为生产方面的总负责人，他对厂长负责，他有权直接支配值班长及各专责工程师、技师的工作，并进行监督检查。值班长则是全厂每个轮班生产中的负责人，生产副厂长不在厂时，值班长并可代替生产副厂长的工作。各高炉值班技术员在值班期间负责全炉的工作，凡有关该班全炉人员的调度及奖惩等决定，均必须首先经过该班的值班技术员同意才有效。由于层层贯彻了一长制，明确了各个生产区域领导者的职权，这就克服了过去领导多头、软弱无力、无人负责的现象，生产中发生的问题能够及时而有效的得到解决。
    建立职能机构和职能人员的责任制
    该厂还建立了职能机构的责任制，明确了职能机构是厂长的助手，无权直接给各生产单位下令，但应在自己的职能范围内，负责监督和保证各生产单位执行厂长的命令，完成国家计划。因此，每一个职能科室必须明确自己的中心业务和责任，明确分工，有计划地进行工作。例如劳动工资科已明确了掌握劳动工资计划是自己的中心业务，科内其他各项工作如推广先进经验、工资管理、奖励考工等都应该为保证完成这一中心任务而密切结合起来。劳动组织工作原来由人事科管，现在则划归劳动工资科掌握。劳动工资科一方面应不断为现场贯彻劳动计划、提高劳动生产率创造条件，另一方面还必须监督现场合理地安排与使用劳动力。全厂一九五三年十多项改善劳动组织的工作，都是劳动工资科的工作人员们在配合现场进行了一系列的思想及组织工作后顺利完成的。其他各科室也都将本身应负责保证和监督完成的计划（如人事科对人员的培养训练计划，生产科对生产技术计划，经济核算人员对财务成本计划，福利工作人员对福利措施计划等）编制了年计划，并进一步及时编制了季度计划，月计划，周计划，有些人员还根据周计划编制了每日行动计划，切实执行。在科室中也实行了计划管理。原来只有等候厂长命令临时行事的工程师和技师们，也建立了专业责任制，现在有了原料工程师、冶炼工程师、炉前技师、瓦斯技师、配管技师、机械技师、电气技师等，各负责其专业内的技术工作，他们很快地都变成了该专业的专门人材，分别在生产副厂长和设备助理的领导下，各在其技术专业范围内指导职工及技术行政干部的工作，从技术方面保证与监督操作规程的执行，保证生产计划的完成。
    逐步推行工人岗位责任制
    该厂还在一些主要的生产小组中建立了工人岗位责任制。例如高炉的炉前工，过去是轮换着在铁口和渣口工作，这样一方面滋长了无人负责现象，另一方面违背了按技术熟练程度进行分工的原则，结果工作紊乱，容易发生事故。现在把每个高炉的全部炉前工作，按技术复杂性与重要性作了明确的划分，并根据工人技术水平的高低，固定了每个人的工作岗位。这样不但使每个岗位上的工人都有相应的技术程度，而且也使工人的培养训练和提升有了明确的准绳。但工人岗位责任制是在劳动组织上的一个重大工作，而且牵涉到工资的变更，问题很大，尚须进一步研究，稳步推行。另外，有些工人的工作本身就是临时的或流动的，因而也就不能固定其工作岗位。
    （三）党组织的监督保证作用
    鞍钢炼铁厂的党、工会、青年团的组织，在该厂实行生产区域管理制当中，经过热烈的争论以后，经过上级批准，在厂一级的党委、工会、青年团总支之下，按每一个轮班为单位，分别组织了党的支部、工会、团支部等，下面再分别按高炉的每个轮班设小组，以适应生产组织，加强每个轮班中党、青年团和工会的工作。
    在以每个高炉的值班技术员作为该班的全高炉的领导者时，有的高炉技术员怕麻烦，不愿加上行政工作，有的工人也不愿意接受高炉技术员的领导，这对实行生产区域管理制和贯彻一长制是一个严重的阻碍。该厂的党委领导着工会和青年团，配合行政积极克服了这种阻碍。党委把高炉技术员们的情况逐个加以研究，讨论出团结教育他们的方法，并分配专人进行具体工作，教育技术员把技术与行政相结合，以更好地完成国家计划。有重点地培养了两个进步较快的技术员带头在值班中认真负责全高炉的生产工作，并注意表扬每个技术员的丝毫进步，以发扬正气。另外则教育工人们自觉地巩固劳动纪律，遵守操作规程，服从高炉值班技术员的领导，以搞好生产。也教育技术员要把技术与劳动相结合，特别是要负责解答工人提出来的有关高炉工作中的每一项技术问题。有的高炉技术员在值班中不负责任，党领导工会动员工人们在生产会议上提出批评和建议。同时也教育技术员虚心接受工人们有益的批评和建议，认真负起责任来。经过这些工作以后，大家的工作情绪都很高，技术员与工人合作共同提出合理化建议和推广先进经验的事多起来了。
    鞍钢炼铁厂自一九五三年以来，进一步贯彻了生产区域管理制，并且实行了计划管理，生产的责任事故大大减少了，拿一九五三年四月与一九五二年同期作比，崩料事故减少了百分之九十，悬料事故减少了百分之八十五。一九五二年该厂有八个月完不成生产计划，靠第四季度进行突击，才勉强提前五天零二十小时完成了生产任务，一九五三年则月月都能均衡地超额完成生产任务，并于十二月四日提前二十七天多全面完成了全年的国家计划。该厂正准备稳步地推行工人岗位责任制，继续贯彻生产区域管理制和巩固计划管理，以便把生产水平更提高一步。
