    Sports in Hungary
    Wu Chongyuan
    At the 15th International Olympic Games held in Helsinki, Finland, in 1952, athletes from the Hungarian People's Republic demonstrated outstanding and excellent talent in track and field, swimming, wrestling, boxing, gymnastics, fencing, and the pentathlon. The Hungarian football team won the championship with a series of victories. Hungarian athletes won forty-two gold medals for individual and team championships, a number equal to the total gold medals won by athletes from the United Kingdom, France, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Japan, India, the Union of South Africa, Argentina, Canada, and Brazil. In addition, Hungarian athletes also won fifteen silver medals and thirty-two bronze medals. In the competition with sixty-eight countries participating, Hungary's total score ranked third, second only to the Soviet Union and the United States. In November 1953, the Hungarian national football team defeated the British professional football team, which had maintained a ninety-year unbeaten record, by a decisive score of six to three in London, England.
    These brilliant victories achieved by Hungarian athletes fully demonstrate the high level of development of sports in Hungary.
    The fact that Hungarian sports have achieved such success in just a few years, surpassing capitalist countries with decades or even hundreds of years of sports history, is not accidental. This is due to the superiority of Hungary's people's democratic system, and the fact that the Hungarian people, on the basis of the tremendous development of their economy and culture, have learned from the Soviet Union's advanced sports theories and experiences, and have carried out mass sports movements.
    Nine years ago, when Hungary was still under fascist rule, sports were merely a tool for the ruling class's recreation and entertainment, and various sports clubs and associations were commercial institutions for the ruling class to siphon money. Only nobles, officials, and university graduates could join sports clubs, and the broad masses of working people were excluded from sports activities. In 1939, only 45,000 people in Hungary regularly participated in sports, accounting for 0.5 percent of the country's population. On the eve of the collapse of fascist rule, the Nazis not only destroyed Hungary's factories and farms, but also destroyed more than half of the various sports facilities (1,611 of the country's 2,088 stadiums, gymnasiums, and swimming pools were destroyed), causing the most serious damage to Hungary's sports undertakings.
    After Hungary's liberation in 1945, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Hungarian Workers' Party, engaged in the restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production with selfless labor enthusiasm. In a few years, the Hungarian people healed the wounds of war, making Hungary an industrialized and agriculturally developed country. The improvement and elevation of the people's living standards have prompted their growing demands for cultural life and sports activities.
    From the first day of Hungary's liberation, the Hungarian Communist Party (now the Hungarian Working People's Party) has given great care to the development of people's sports. Comrade Rákosi, the leader of the Hungarian people, said in September 1945: The Hungarian Communist Party believes that sports occupy an extremely important position in the lives of the people. Hungary's sports undertakings, in any aspect, can obtain support from all democratic parties, and first and foremost, from the Hungarian Communist Party.
    The Hungarian Working People's Party and the government of the Hungarian People's Republic, while leading the people in building a socialist society, also guided the people in carrying out sports activities. In December 1949, the decree of the Republic's Five-Year Plan, passed by the Hungarian National Assembly, stipulated the allocation of a considerable amount of funding for the construction of many complete sports venues and equipment. By 1950, 7,000 stadiums, tennis courts, swimming pools, gymnasiums, ski resorts, etc., had been built and renovated nationwide. The Budapest People's Stadium, which can accommodate more than 100,000 people, also began construction in 1950. This stadium alone required 60,000 cubic meters of concrete, 72,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel, 1,800 carloads of cement, and 6 million kilograms of steel. Hungary's most famous artists and sculptors participated in the stadium's design and artistic arrangement. After nearly four years of construction, this largest stadium in Europe was opened to the Hungarian people last August. The Five-Year Plan also stipulated the construction of 400 rural sports grounds. In January 1951, according to the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Hungarian People's Republic, the National Sports Commission was established under the Council of Ministers to lead the country's sports undertakings. At the same time, sports commissions were established in states, districts, and cities. Currently, there are a total of 210 sports commissions in Hungary, responsible for organizing and guiding sports activities in their respective jurisdictions. Comrade Rákosi also frequently visited the National Sports Commission to provide specific guidance. To train sports cadres, the Hungarian government has opened many sports academies, sports middle schools, and various short-term training courses. The Budapest Sports Academy, for example, has more than 600 students, five times more than before the war, and most of the students are children of workers and peasants.
    The Hungarian Working People's Party and the government have created good conditions for the sports activities of millions of working people, and tens of thousands of young workers, office workers, farmers, and students have been attracted to the sports field. By 1952, the number of male and female athletes had increased to 500,000, in addition to 400,000 working people regularly participating in various sports competitions. By 1953, one million working people – about one in ten – had become active participants in sports.
    Hungary's sports associations are spread throughout the country, organized according to various national economic sectors. Prominent examples include "Vasas" (organized by metalworkers), "Petőfi" (organized by office workers), "Kner Printing House" (organized by the food industry), "Előre" (organized by transport workers), and others. The famous "Honvéd" Sports Association is the sports organization of the Hungarian armed forces. Now, almost every factory, mine, and government office has its own sports club. The Ganz Wagon Factory in Budapest, which is not the largest factory in Hungary, and the conditions of its sports club are not the best, has 1,200 members, who participate in 22 different sports according to their different interests and specialties. In 1952, the Ganz factory had 16 football teams participating in the factory's football league, 19 men's volleyball teams and 4 women's volleyball teams, 18 men's bowling teams participating in the factory's competition, 65 players participating in the chess competition, and 130 players participating in the tennis competition. Kováts Balázs, the fencing champion of the 15th International Olympic Games, is the deputy director of the factory's engineering department and an active member of the sports club. Sports activities in rural Hungary are developing along with the rural cooperative movement. After farmers joined production cooperatives, their lives became prosperous, and they had good conditions to engage in sports activities. More than 20,000 young farmers participated in the first Hungarian National Rural Youth Games held in 1951. In Perg village, which has only 500 residents, 80 young men and women in the whole village signed up to participate in the Games. At the finals held in Budapest, many talented rural athletes emerged. József Csermák, the hammer throw champion of the 15th International Olympic Games and the world record holder in the hammer throw, was just a child in the countryside four years ago. The facts prove that due to the widespread development of sports in Hungary among workers and peasants, it has cultivated healthy bodies, and the excellent qualities of courage, wit, diligence, and optimism.
    Hungarian athletes have never participated in so many international competitions as they do today. In the past two or three years, Hungarian athletes have participated in about 200 international competitions. Hungarian athletes have established close ties with athletes from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Countless friendly competitions have played a great role in exchanging experiences, improving athletes' skills, and promoting close unity between the people and athletes of various countries. Competitions with athletes from capitalist countries also occupy a large place in Hungarian sports. In 1952 alone, Hungarian athletes went to Austria, Belgium, Finland, India, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and other capitalist countries to participate in competitions. At the same time, Hungary also hosted many foreign sports delegations to visit the country. When contacting athletes from various countries, Hungarian athletes expressed and emphasized their desire for world peace and friendship between the people of all countries.
    The astonishing development of Hungarian sports is inseparable from their unwavering spirit of learning from the advanced sports theories and experiences of the Soviet Union. The "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" sports system, which serves as the foundation for the sports education of Hungarian youth, is basically modeled after the Soviet "Prepared for Labor and Defense" sports system.
    The "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" system has become a huge force in popularizing sports in Hungary and an inexhaustible source of providing new competition talent. From the trial implementation of the "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" system in 1949 to 1951, it attracted 484,169 male and female working people to participate in various competitions, and 99,400 students under the age of 14 received the "Prepared for Labor and National Defense" medal. The Hungarian people are proud to receive this "most beloved sports badge" because this badge shows that its owner is a flexible, agile, tenacious, powerful, courageous, and healthy person. Another measure to learn from the advanced sports theories and experiences of the Soviet Union is the implementation of the grading system for 44 sports for male and female athletes. This system is divided into four grades: junior grade, third grade, second grade, and first grade. Athletes with particularly high achievements can be awarded the title of "Excellent Athlete of the Hungarian People's Republic." The athlete grading system encourages every athlete to strive to upgrade or maintain their original highest grade, becoming the main method for improving the technical level of Hungarian sports. In addition, Hungary also frequently sends athletes to the Soviet Union to study or invites the best Soviet athletes to Hungary to give demonstration performances. In the past few years, the Soviet Union has provided Hungary with friendly assistance and guidance in track and field, weightlifting, gymnastics, wrestling, skating, chess, basketball, and swimming. When asked who helped him most with his sports achievements, the famous Hungarian swimmer, György Tumpek, the world record holder in the 100-meter butterfly, said: "The Soviet Meshkov." He said: "When I visited the Soviet Union, our Hungarian swimmers practiced with Soviet comrades for a month. Meshkov helped me improve my diving and turning methods." There are many similar examples. Gyula Hegyi, Chairman of the Hungarian Sports Committee, said: "Now the people's democratic countries are using the Soviet Union's rich experience and moving forward along a new, socialist road. We have achieved great success, and in the future, there is a vast prospect before us. We are turning sports into the property of millions of people. For this purpose, we are transforming all sports organizations in Hungary." "And what can serve as our example in this regard is the Soviet Union's sports organizations."
    Hungarian sports have become an indispensable and important part of people's lives. The achievements of Hungarian sports have reached the highest level in the world. We can clearly see that Hungarian sports already have an extremely solid foundation, and under the correct leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Republic government, it will achieve more brilliant and outstanding accomplishments.

    匈牙利的体育运动
    吴重远
    一九五二年在芬兰赫尔辛基举行的第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会，匈牙利人民共和国的运动员们，在田径、游泳、角力、拳击、体操、击剑、五项竞技等项目中，都表现了突出的、优异的才能。匈牙利的足球队，以屡战屡胜的姿态夺得了冠军。匈牙利运动员，因个人和集体冠军获得了四十二个金质奖章，这个数字等于英国、法国、南斯拉夫、土耳其、日本、印度、南非联邦、阿根廷、加拿大和巴西等国运动员所得金质奖章的总和。此外，匈牙利运动员还得到了十五个银质奖章和三十二个铜质奖章。在和六十八个国家参加的竞赛中，匈牙利的总分仅次于苏联和美国而居第三位。一九五三年十一月，匈牙利国家足球队混合队在英国伦敦以六比三的绝对优势，打败了保持了九十年常胜不败的纪录的英国职业足球队混合队。
    匈牙利运动员所获得的这些辉煌胜利，充分说明了匈牙利体育运动的高度发展。
    匈牙利的体育运动，在短短的几年内，其成就就超过了有数十年乃至百余年体育运动历史的资本主义国家，这不是偶然的。这是由于匈牙利的人民民主制度的优越性，由于匈牙利人民在其经济和文化得到巨大发展的基础上，学习了苏联的先进体育理论和经验，开展了群众性的体育运动。
    九年以前，当匈牙利还处在法西斯统治下面的时候，体育运动只是统治阶级消遣娱乐的工具，各种体育俱乐部和体育协会，是统治阶级吸吮金钱的商业机构。只有贵族、官吏和大学学士才能参加体育俱乐部，广大劳动人民是被摒弃在体育运动的大门之外的。一九三九年，匈牙利全国经常参加体育运动的只有四万五千人，占全国人口百分之零点五。在法西斯统治崩溃前夕，纳粹分子不仅破坏了匈牙利的工厂、农庄，并且还破坏了半数以上的各种体育运动设备（全国两千零八十八个体育场、体育馆和游泳池，被破坏了一千六百十一个），使匈牙利体育运动事业遭受了最严重的摧残。
    一九四五年，匈牙利获得解放以后，匈牙利人民在劳动人民党的领导下，以忘我的劳动热情从事工农业生产的恢复和发展工作。几年中间，匈牙利人民医治好了战争的创伤，使匈牙利成为一个工业化的、农业发达的国家，人民的生活水平得到了改善和提高，这就促使他们对于文化生活和体育运动的要求日渐增长。
    从匈牙利解放的第一天起，匈牙利共产党（即今劳动人民党）就对人民体育运动的开展，给予莫大的关怀。匈牙利人民领袖拉科西同志在一九四五年九月曾经说过：匈牙利共产党认为体育在人民底生活中占着极端重要的地位，匈牙利的体育运动事业，不论在任何方面都能从各民主党派，首先是从匈牙利共产党获得支持。
    匈牙利劳动人民党和匈牙利人民共和国政府，在领导人民建设社会主义社会的同时，也引导人民开展了体育运动。在一九四九年十二月，匈牙利国民会议通过的共和国五年计划的法令中，就规定拨出相当数量的经费兴建许多完善的体育场地和设备。到一九五○年，全国已经兴建和重修了七千个体育场、网球场、游泳池、体育馆、滑雪场等。能容十万多人的布达佩斯人民体育场，也于一九五○年动工，仅仅这个运动场，就需要六万立方公尺混凝土，七万二千立方公尺砂石，一千八百车厢水泥和六百万公斤钢铁，匈牙利最著名的艺术家和雕塑家参加了运动场的设计和艺术布置。经过近四年的修建，这个全欧最大的运动场已经在去年八月开始供匈牙利人民使用了。五年计划中还规定修建四百个农村运动场。一九五一年一月，根据匈牙利人民共和国部长会议的决定，在部长会议之下成立了全国体育运动委员会，领导全国的体育运动事业。同时，建立了州、区、市的体育运动委员会。现在，匈牙利总共有二百一十个体育运动委员会，负责组织和指导所辖地区的体育运动。拉科西同志也经常到全国体育运动委员会给以具体的指导。为了培养体育干部，匈牙利政府开办了许多体育学院和体育中学以及各种短期训练班。以布达佩斯体育学院为例，有学生六百多人，比战前增加了五倍，而且学员大部是工农子弟。
    匈牙利劳动人民党和政府给千百万劳动人民的体育活动创设了良好的条件，成千成万的青年工人、机关工作人员、农民和学生被吸引到运动场上去。到一九五二年，男女运动员的人数增加到五十万人，此外还有四十万劳动人民经常参加各种运动竞赛，到一九五三年，已经有一百万劳动人民——约十个人中有一个——成为体育运动的积极分子了。
    匈牙利的体育协会，遍布全国，它是按照全国各个国民经济部门组织起来的。著名的如“凡萨斯”
  （五金工人组织的）、“贝多斐”（机关工作者组织的）、“开纳辛”（食品工业组织的）、“爱洛拉”（运输工人组织的）等。著名的“享维德”体育协会，是匈牙利部队的体育组织。现在，几乎没有
  一个工厂、矿山和机关没有自己的体育俱乐部。布达佩斯的甘日车箱工厂，它并不是匈牙利最大的工厂，该厂的体育俱乐部的条件也不算最好，但它拥有一千二百个会员，他们按照各人不同的兴趣和特长，参加二十二种不同的运动项目。一九五二年，甘日工厂有十六个足球队参加了工厂的足球比赛，有十九个男子排球队和四个女子排球队、十八个男子九柱戏队参加了工厂的竞赛，有六十五个选手参加了象棋比赛，一百三十个选手参加了网球比赛。荣获十五届国际奥林匹克运动会击剑冠军的科瓦奇·巴尔，就是该厂工程部副主任和体育俱乐部的积极分子。匈牙利农村中的体育运动是随着农村合作运动的发展开展起来的。农民们参加生产合作社以后，生活富裕起来了，有了从事体育运动的良好条件。一九五一年所举行的匈牙利全国第一届农村青年运动会，参加比赛的青年农民达二万多人。一共只有五百个居民的柏格村，全村八十个青年男女，都报名参加了运动会。在布达佩斯举行的决赛中，出现了不少有能力的农村运动员，第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会链锤冠军、世界链锤纪录创造者约瑟夫·契尔玛克，四年以前，还是一个农村里的孩子。事实证明：由于匈牙利体育运动在工农劳动人民中的普遍开展，培养了人们健康的身体，和勇敢、机智、勤劳、乐观的优良品质。
    匈牙利运动员，过去从来没有像今天这样，参加了那么多的国际比赛。最近两、三年中间，匈牙利运动员参加国际竞赛有二百次左右。匈牙利运动员和苏联以及各人民民主国家的运动员建立了密切的联系。无数次友谊的竞赛会，对交流经验，提高运动员的技术和促进与各国人民以及运动员间的亲密团结，起了极大的作用。和资本主义国家运动员的竞赛会，在匈牙利的体育运动中，也占着很大的位置。仅在一九五二年一年中，匈牙利运动员就到奥地利、比利时、芬兰、印度、意大利、挪威、瑞典、瑞士和其他资本主义国家参加了比赛。与此同时，匈牙利还招待了许多外国体育运动代表队到本国来。匈牙利运动员在和各国运动员联系时，表现并强调了对世界和平和各国人民间友谊的愿望。
    匈牙利体育运动所以会有这样惊人的发展，是和他们以坚定不移的精神学习了苏联先进的体育理论和经验分不开的。作为对匈牙利青年进行体育教育基础的“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度，基本上是仿照苏联的“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度而制订的。
  “准备劳动与卫国制”成为普及匈牙利体育运动的巨大力量，也成为提供新的竞赛人才的无穷源泉。从一九四九年开始试行“准备劳动与卫国制”，到
  一九五一年，即吸引了四十八万四千一百六十九个男女劳动人民参加了各种竞赛，有九万九千四百个年龄在十四岁以下的学生得到了“准备劳动与卫国制”奖章。匈牙利人民以得到这种“最可爱的运动胸章”而骄傲，因为这个胸章表明了它的所有者是一个灵活、敏捷、顽强、有力、勇敢和健康的人。学习苏联先进体育理论和经验的另一个措施，就是实行了男女运动员四十四项运动的等级制。这一制度，分为少年级、三级、二级和一级四个等级。成绩特别高的运动员可以获得“匈牙利人民共和国优秀运动员”的称号。运动员等级制，鼓励着每一个运动员努力争取获得升级或保持他原有的最高等级，成为提高匈牙利体育运动技术的主要方法。此外，匈牙利还经常派运动员到苏联学习或请苏联最优秀的运动员到匈牙利作示范表演。过去几年中间，在田径、举重、体操、角力、滑冰、象棋、篮球和游泳等方面，苏联给予了匈牙利以友谊的援助和指导。匈牙利著名的游泳运动员，一百公尺蝴蝶式俯泳世界纪录创造者董贝克·吉久，曾经在回答谁对他的运动成绩最有帮助的问题时说：“苏联的梅西科夫。”他说：“当我访问苏联的时候，我们匈牙利的游泳运动员和苏联同志在一起练习了一个月，梅西科夫帮助我改进了潜水和转身的方法。”类似这样的实例是很多的。匈牙利体育运动委员会主席赫基·纠拉说道：“现在各人民民主国家正在运用苏联的丰富经验，沿着新的、社会主义的道路前进。我们已经获得了巨大的成就，而未来，在我们面前有着辽阔的远景。我们正在把体育变成千百万人民群众的财产。为了这种目的，我们正改造着匈牙利的一切体育组织。”“而在这方面可作我们榜样的就是苏联的体育组织。”
    匈牙利的体育运动，已经成为人民生活中不可缺少的重要部分。匈牙利体育运动的成绩已达到了世界上最高的水平。我们可以清楚地看出：匈牙利的体育运动已经有着极为巩固的基础，在匈牙利劳动人民党和共和国政府的正确领导下，它将会获得更辉煌，更卓越的成就。
