Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th: The new steelmaking shop project of the Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Steel Plant is nearing completion. Trial operation of some machines has already begun, and it is expected to be put into production in the second quarter of this year.

    The new steelmaking shop of the Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Steel Plant is relatively large in scale. The volume of the two open-hearth furnaces built in the plant is second only to that of the open-hearth furnaces in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant. After these two open-hearth furnaces are put into production in the second quarter of this year, the steel produced in one year, if rolled into construction steel, could build dozens of steelmaking shops of the same size. The value of the steel produced daily is equivalent to the daily income of hundreds of thousands of farmers. The steel produced by these two open-hearth furnaces, when rolled into steel rails, will be supplied to the construction of the Baocheng Railway and other new railway lines that are under construction; when rolled into steel plates and steel, it will support the needs of machinery manufacturing, shipbuilding, and other construction projects.

    After the new steelmaking shop of the Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Steel Plant is put into production, it will begin to change the unbalanced state of the iron and steel industry in Southwest China. In the past, Southwest China's iron and steel industry had a greater steel rolling capacity than smelting capacity. The original smelting capacity of the No. 101 Steel Plant could not even meet the needs of rolling for five months of production in a year. Most of the steel billets needed for rolling steel rails had to be transported from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, thousands of kilometers away. Long-distance transportation not only increased product costs but also often delayed production. In particular, after the new large-scale rolling mill of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company started production, due to its own rolling needs, it could not continue to supply more steel billets to the Southwest region. Therefore, after the new steelmaking shop is put into production, it can not only save more than 100 billion yuan in transportation and other expenses each year, but also reduce the burden on the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and further ensure the needs of construction throughout the country.

    The new steelmaking shop of the Chongqing State-owned No. 101 Steel Plant was formally designed in March 1951 and construction began in 1952. After more than two years of construction, the construction of factory buildings, open-hearth furnaces, civil engineering, and machine installation has been basically completed. This steelmaking shop, which includes two open-hearth furnaces, is the first modernized steelmaking shop designed and constructed by Chinese technicians and workers under the guidance of Soviet experts. The completion of this steelmaking shop marks the growth of another group of black metallurgical design and construction forces in our country.

    西南钢铁工业的新发展
    重庆一零一钢铁厂新建炼钢场即将完工
   【新华社重庆九日电】重庆国营一零一钢铁厂新建炼钢场工程快要完工，目前已开始了部分机器的试运转，预计在今年第二季度就可以投入生产。
    重庆国营一零一钢铁厂新建炼钢场的规模较大，厂房内建筑的两座炼钢平炉的容积，仅次于鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂平炉的容积。这两座平炉在今年第二季度投入生产后，一年炼出的钢如轧成建筑钢材，可以建设几十个和该炼钢场相同的炼钢场，每天炼出的钢的价值，相当于几十万农民一天的收入。这两座平炉炼出的钢，轧制钢轨后将供应正在修筑的宝成铁路及其他铁路新线的修建工程；轧成钢板、钢材后，将支援机械制造、船舶制造及其他建设的需要。
    重庆国营一零一钢铁厂新建炼钢场投入生产后，将开始改变西南钢铁工业设备不平衡的面貌。西南钢铁工业过去轧钢能力大于冶炼能力，一零一钢铁厂原有的冶炼能力还不能满足该厂一年生产中轧制五个月的需要，该厂轧制钢轨需要的大部分钢坯，不得不从数千公里远的鞍山钢铁公司运来。长途运输既提高了产品成本又常耽误生产。特别是鞍山钢铁公司新建大型轧钢厂开工生产后，由于它本身轧制的需要，不能继续以更多的钢坯供应西南地区，因此，新建炼钢场投入生产后，不仅每年可节约一千亿元以上的运输等方面的开支，而且可以减轻鞍山钢铁公司的负担，进一步保证全国各地建设的需要。
    重庆国营一零一钢铁厂新建的炼钢场，是从一九五一年三月正式设计，一九五二年开始施工的。经过两年多的建设，目前厂房建筑、平炉建筑、土木建筑和机器安装等工程，已经基本完工。这个包括两座平炉的炼钢场，是在苏联专家指导下由我国技术人员和工人自行设计和施工所建的第一个近代化的炼钢场。这个炼钢场的建成，标志着我国又有一批黑色冶金设计和施工力量成长起来。
