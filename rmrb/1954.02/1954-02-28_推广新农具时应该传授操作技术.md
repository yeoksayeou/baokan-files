    Should Teach Operating Techniques When Promoting New Farm Tools
    Zhao Jizhang from Gutuan, Guanchao County, Shandong Province writes: The Gutuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative's store lent a seven-inch walking plow to the Zhao Deyin mutual aid team in Jiangjunzhai last spring to promote it. The team members were very happy. They took the seven-inch walking plow to the field to try it out the next day; however, because they did not understand the technology, they could not use it, so they had to put the plow aside. Four months later, they still had not solved the technical problem, so they returned the seven-inch walking plow to the cooperative. In November, Director Jiang of the cooperative invited a skilled farmer to the field to try it out, but it still did not work. Since then, this walking plow has been stored in the cooperative. The technical problem of using the new walking plow has become an urgent problem to be solved in various districts of Guanchao County. Local agricultural technology guidance organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives should quickly pay attention to this problem.

    推广新农具时应该传授操作技术
    山东观朝县谷疃赵纪章来信：谷疃供销合作社门市部，为推广七吋步犁，曾在去年春天将一张七吋步犁贷给了将军寨的赵德印互助组。该组组员非常高兴，他们在第二天就把七吋步犁拿到田里试用；但因为不懂技术，无法使用，只好把犁放了起来。四个月后，仍没有解决技术问题，他们就把七吋步犁退还合作社。十一月间合作社的姜主任请了一位耕地能手到田间试用，结果还是不行。从那时起，这张步犁只好在合作社存放起来。使用新式步犁的技术问题，已成为观朝县各区一个急待解决的问题。当地农业技术指导机构和供销合作社应该迅速重视这个问题。
