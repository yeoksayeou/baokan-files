U.S. Imperialism is the Most Vicious and Insidious Colonialist

U.S. imperialism is the most vicious and insidious colonialist in the world today, and the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia.

Since the end of World War II, the American ruling clique has been using various means to plunder more colonies, dreaming of dominating the world. As early as December 1940, Virgil Jordan, Chairman of the National Industrial Conference Board of the United States, revealed this ambition to a group of American bank bosses, saying that the United States, together with Britain as its "errand boy," was engaged in building "a new Anglo-Saxon empire, in which the economic resources and the army and naval power of the United States will be (its) center of gravity."

Wall Street "theorist" James Burnham wrote a book called "The Struggle for the World" in 1947, further advocating the establishment of "an American empire." He said that this empire, "although without true worldwide formal boundaries, (it) can exercise effective global control." "Life" magazine published a map in an article specifically touting this book. According to this map, the territory included in the "American Empire" included Antarctica, the Arctic, Canada, South America, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Africa, the Near and Middle East, India, China, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand, in addition to the United States itself.

The American "Business Week" published on October 31st last year even more arrogantly depicted the dream of the U.S. imperialists, saying that within twenty-five years, the United States will invest 5 billion U.S. dollars abroad every year and ship back 20 billion U.S. dollars worth of raw materials from abroad; "Every American businessman and child will be familiar with new names of foreign styles… Americans will enjoy longer and more vacations… following the sun to enjoy midsummer… They will find American-standard equipment in every vacation area – in fact, most of the large hotels in the newly developed areas will be built and operated by familiar American hotel systems. …It is safe to bet that most of the natives on the travelers' route will speak very good American."

In order to achieve its sinister goals, starting from the time when World War II was about to end, U.S. imperialism launched a comprehensive military, political, economic, and cultural aggression against the people of Asia. U.S. imperialism inherited and developed the brutal nature of the old colonial rulers. In the armed suppression of the Philippine people's liberation movement, in the enslavement and trampling of the Japanese people, in the three-year barbarous war of aggression against Korea, and recently in the intensified interference in the Indochina war, it has fully exposed itself as the most ferocious enemy of the people of Asia.

At the same time, the United States has also adopted more insidious and malicious methods than the old colonialists, using the bait of so-called "independence" and "aid" to deceive, attempting to achieve its goals of maintaining colonial rule and squeezing out other colonial rulers.

The United States' attempt to maintain its barbaric colonial rule by means of fake independence is most clearly manifested in the Philippines. "Business Week" once admitted that the predatory "Bell Trade Act" was "the price the Philippines paid for nominal independence, (it) gives American entrepreneurs priority in developing Philippine resources." American economist Shirley Jenkins also admitted in her book "American Economic Policy towards the Philippines" that the "Bell Trade Act" allows the United States to enjoy "all the benefits of possessing a colonial appendage, including economic and military aspects, without the responsibility of management or internal affairs." The American "National Guardian" weekly pointed out on December 7th last year that more than seven years after "independence," the Philippines is still under the control of American monopoly capital such as Mobil Oil Company, Citibank, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Tubbs Cordage Company, and Insular Lumber Company. The United States still occupies twenty-three military bases in the Philippines.

The aggressive purpose of American foreign "aid" is fully exposed in the notorious so-called "Point Four Program." Even former U.S. President Truman publicly admitted in July 1952 that this program was a "very good deal" for the United States. “…It means more trade, more markets…and more raw material supplies.” Last year, the United States repeatedly proposed to grant "aid" to the Iranian government, each time with enslaving conditions, requiring Iran to resolve the Anglo-Iranian oil dispute in accordance with a "plan" that would benefit the intrusion of American capital. Shortly after the United States decided to "donate" one million tons of wheat to Pakistan at the end of June last year, newspapers revealed the news of negotiations to conclude a U.S.-Pakistan military treaty to establish U.S. military bases on Pakistani territory.

The "Wall Street Journal" revealed on October 23rd last year the wishful thinking of the United States attempting to force recipient countries to provide cannon fodder by granting "military aid," saying: "The annual cost of maintaining a U.S. division abroad is estimated at approximately $250 million. But maintaining a French division only costs $80 million, a British division only costs $70 million, a Turkish division only costs $30 million, and a South Korean division only costs $15 million..."

This aggressive activity of the United States, which strives to maintain and expand colonial rule and delusionally attempts to turn the entire earth into an "American Empire" in the end, has aroused increasingly strong opposition from the broad strata of people in increasingly awakened Asian countries. The people of various countries have widely engaged in the struggle against American aggression. Intense anti-American sentiment has reached such a degree that representatives of the U.S. ruling clique have found it increasingly difficult to conceal their unease. After U.S. Secretary of State Dulles "visited" the Middle East last summer and returned home, he admitted: "Most people in the Near East and East Asia are deeply concerned about the political independence of themselves and other people. They suspect colonial countries. The United States is also among those suspected." Mallory, Executive Director of the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations, admitted in an article published in the American "Foreign Affairs" quarterly in January this year that Americans are "unpopular" in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and U.S. policies are "even more unpopular." In the minds of the vast majority of residents in Southeast Asia, the so-called "Uncle Sam" is an "arrogant, selfish, and black-hearted fellow," and "its altruism is just a cloak to cover up vicious conspiracies." Mallory cited Indonesia as an example and admitted that the people there "simply do not regard the United States as anti-colonialist, but as the leading imperialist country." (Xinhua News Agency)

### 美帝国主义是最凶恶最阴险的殖民者

    美帝国主义是最凶恶最阴险的殖民者
    美帝国主义是今天世界上最凶恶最阴险的殖民者，是亚洲人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    自从第二次世界大战以后，美国统治集团采取各种手段企图掠夺更多的殖民地，梦想独霸世界。早在一九四零年十二月，美国全国工业会议委员会主席弗吉尔·约旦就曾对美国的一批银行老板透露这种野心说：美国和作为“小伙计”的英国一起，已在从事建立“一个新的安格鲁—撒克逊帝国，在这个帝国中，美国的经济资源以及陆军和海军力量将是（它的）重心”。
    华尔街的“理论家”詹姆斯·伯纳姆在一九四七年写了一本叫做“为世界而斗争”的书，进一步主张建立“一个美利坚帝国”。他说，这个帝国“虽然没有真正的全世界范围的正式疆界，但是（它）可以实行有效的世界性的控制”。“生活”杂志在特为这本书鼓吹的一篇文章中发表了一张地图，根据这张地图，包括在“美利坚帝国”版图内的，除了美国本国的国土之外，还有南极、北极、加拿大、南美洲、墨西哥、挪威、瑞典、比利时、荷兰、德国、法国、意大利、西班牙、英国、非洲、近中东、印度、中国、印尼、澳大利亚和新西兰等。
    去年十月三十一日出版的美国“商业周刊”更加狂妄地描绘美帝国主义者的幻梦说：在二十五年内，美国每年将在国外投资五十亿美元，并从国外运回二百亿美元的原料；“每一个美国做生意的人和小孩子都将熟悉外国情调的新名字……美国人将享受更长和更多的假期……一路跟随着太阳去消受仲夏……他们将在每个度假地区找到美国标准的设备——实际上，在新发展地区的多数大旅馆，将都是由熟悉的美国旅馆系统建造和营业的。……可以有把握地打赌：在旅客经过的路上的大多数土著，都会讲很好的美国话。”
    为了实现它的罪恶目的，从第二次大战快要结束的时候开始，美帝国主义便对亚洲人民进行了军事的、政治的、经济的和文化的全面侵略。美帝国主义继承和发展了旧殖民统治者的残暴本性，在对菲律宾人民解放运动的武装镇压中、在对日本人民的奴役和蹂躏中、在对朝鲜的三年的野蛮侵略战争中，以及最近在对印度支那战争的加紧干涉中，都充分暴露出它是亚洲人民最凶恶的敌人。
    同时，美国还采取了比旧殖民者更加阴险和恶毒的手段，以所谓“独立”和“援助”的诱饵进行欺骗，企图用以达到它的维持殖民统治和排挤其它殖民统治者的目的。
    美国企图用假独立的办法维持它的野蛮殖民统治，在菲律宾表现得最清楚。美国“商业周刊”曾承认，掠夺性的“贝尔贸易法案”是“菲律宾取得名义上的独立所付出的价钱，（它）给予美国企业家开发菲律宾资源的优先地位”。美国经济学家莎利·詹金斯在他的“美国对菲律宾的经济政策”一书中也承认，“贝尔贸易法案”使美国享受“占有一个殖民附属国的一切好处，包括经济和军事方面，而不负管理或内政的责任”。美国“国民前卫”周刊去年十二月七日指出，在“独立”后七年多的今天，菲律宾仍旧处在美孚油公司、花旗银行、固特异轮胎橡胶公司、徒布斯绳索公司、英苏勒木材公司等美国垄断资本控制之下。美国在菲律宾仍然占领着二十三个军事基地。
    美国对外“援助”的侵略目的，从恶名昭著的所谓“第四点计划”中充分暴露出来，甚至美国前总统杜鲁门也曾在一九五二年七月公开承认说：这个计划对于美国“是很好的买卖。……它意味着更多的贸易，更多的市场，……以及更多的原料供应”。去年，美国曾几度向伊朗政府提出给予“援助”，每次都附有奴役性的条件，要求伊朗按照有利于美国资本侵入的“方案”解决英伊石油纠纷。美国在去年六月底决定“赠”给巴基斯坦一百万吨小麦后不久，报纸上就透露了谈判缔结在巴基斯坦领土上建立美国军事基地的美巴军事条约的消息。
    “华尔街日报”去年十月二十三日曾透露美国企图通过给予“军事援助”迫使受援国提供炮灰的如意算盘说：“在国外维持一师美军每年的费用估计约需二亿五千万美元。但维持一师法国军队却只要八千万美元，一师英国军队只要七千万美元，一师土耳其军队只要三千万美元，一师南朝鲜军队只要一千五百万美元，……”
    美国的这种力图维持和扩大殖民统治并妄想在最后把整个地球变成“美利坚帝国”的侵略活动，已引起日益觉醒的亚洲各国广泛阶层人民越来越有力的反对。各国人民广泛投入反对美国侵略的斗争。强烈的反美情绪已达到如此程度，以至美国统治集团的代表人物已越来越难以掩盖他们的不安。美国国务卿杜勒斯去年夏季到中东“访问”回国后承认：“近东和东亚的大多数人民都深切地关心他们自己和其他人民的政治独立。他们怀疑殖民国家。美国也在被怀疑之列。”美国外交学会执行理事马洛里在今年一月出版的美国“外交季刊”上发表文章承认：美国人在南亚和东南亚是“不受欢迎”的，美国的政策“更其不受欢迎”。在东南亚广大居民的心目中，所谓“山姆叔叔”就是“傲慢、自私、黑心肠的家伙”，“它的利他主义只是掩盖恶毒阴谋的一件外衣”。马洛里举印尼为例承认，那里的人民“根本不认为美国是反殖民主义的，而是为首的帝国主义国家”。（新华社）
