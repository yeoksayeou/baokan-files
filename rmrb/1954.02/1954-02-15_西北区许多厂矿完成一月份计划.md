Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 9th: The state-owned cotton textile, coal, and electricity systems in the Northwest Region, as well as the local state-owned and joint state-private factories in Xi'an, achieved excellent results in their January production plans this year. This basically changed the situation in previous years where most January plans could not be completed, laying a foundation for the smooth completion of the first quarter plan.

　　This January, the state-owned cotton textile system produced 117 more bales of cotton yarn than planned, and over 411,000 meters more cotton cloth than planned. The total power generation of state-owned power plants exceeded the plan by 3.91%. State-owned coal mines also overfulfilled their coal production plans. Among the 19 factories under the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Enterprise Bureau, 17 completed their plans. Xi'an Paint Factory, Xi'an Textile Factory, and Northwest Pharmaceutical Factory all exceeded their production plans by 5% to 10% or more. Other printing and dyeing, flour, hardware, and enamel factories also overfulfilled their production plans.

　　The planned output of state-owned and Xi'an local state-owned factories and mines in the Northwest Region this January mostly exceeded the actual output of January last year. The output targets of many factories were also higher than the production level of the fourth quarter of last year. For example, in order to ensure the growing industrial electricity demand, the actual power generation of the state-owned Xi'an No. 1 and No. 2 Power Plants increased by more than 21,000 kWh in January compared to December last year.

    西北区许多厂矿完成一月份计划
   【新华社西安九日电】西北区国营棉纺织、煤、电三个系统和西安市地方国营、公私合营工厂，今年一月份的生产计划完成得很好，基本上改变了往年一月份大多不能完成计划的状况，为顺利完成第一季度计划打下了基础。
    今年一月份国营棉纺织系统生产的棉纱超过计划数字一百一十七件，棉布超过计划数字四十一万一千多公尺；国营电厂的总发电量超过计划百分之三点九一；国营煤矿也超额完成了煤炭生产计划。西安市人民政府企业局所属十九个工厂中，完成计划的有十七个。西安油漆制造厂、西安纺织厂、西北制药厂都超过生产计划百分之五到百分之十以上，其他印染、面粉、五金、搪瓷等厂也都超额完成了生产计划。
    西北区国营和西安市地方国营厂矿今年一月份的计划产量，多超过去年一月份的实际产量，很多工厂的产量指标还高于去年第四季度的生产水平。如国营西安第一、第二发电厂为了保证日益增长的工业用电需要，一月份实际发电量就比去年十二月份增加了二万一千多度。
