Hulunbuir Pastoral Area Uses Machines for Haymaking

    A large number of hay mowers and rakes have appeared on the Hulunbuir grassland in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, promoting the development of animal husbandry production.

    In view of the large number of livestock and the shortage of labor in the pastoral areas, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has promoted hay mowing and raking machines in the Hulunbuir pastoral area in recent years. At present, there are 784 hay mowers and rakes on the grassland. Each hay mower can mow more than 10,000 catties of grass per day, which is equivalent to the labor of more than a dozen people in one day in the past. Last year, the Hulun Buir League pastoral area mowed a total of more than 164.8 million catties of grass, an increase of 40 percent over 1952 and three times more than in 1951. The Hulunbuir nomadic area, which has never had the habit of mowing and storing grass, now has an average of more than 100 catties of forage per head of livestock. The storage of a large amount of forage has played a great role in preventing disasters and surviving the winter for livestock. After using machines to mow grass, the herdsmen deeply realized that the development of the country's industry will lead animal husbandry to mechanization and bring prosperity and happiness to the grassland.

    呼伦贝尔牧区使用机器打草
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上出现了大批打草机、搂草机，推动了畜牧业生产的发展。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府根据牧区牲畜多、劳动力少的情况，几年来在呼伦贝尔牧区推广了打草、搂草的机器。现在，草原上已有七百八十四台打草机、搂草机。每台打草机每天能打一万多斤草，相当于过去十几个人工一天的劳动。去年呼纳盟牧区共打草一亿六千四百八十多万斤，比一九五二年增加百分之四十，比一九五一年多三倍。历来没有打草储草习惯的呼伦贝尔游牧区，现在每头牲畜平均有一百多斤饲草。大量饲草的储存，对牲畜的防灾过冬起了很大作用。牧民使用机器打草后，深深体会到国家工业的发展将使畜牧业走向机械化，给草原带来繁荣幸福。　（据新华社讯）
