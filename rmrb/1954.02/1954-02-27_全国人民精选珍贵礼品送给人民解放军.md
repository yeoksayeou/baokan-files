Xinhua News Agency report:

    People across the country have meticulously selected and crafted many precious gifts, entrusting the representatives of the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army to present them to the heroic and beloved People's Liberation Army.

    The delegation will represent the people of the whole country in presenting each commander and fighter of the People's Liberation Army with five souvenirs and gifts: These include color photographs of the great leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, glittering commemorative medals, beautiful and durable gold pens, a condolence booklet on woodfree paper, and enamel mugs printed with the Tiananmen pattern and the words "Defend the Motherland, Defend Peace." Workers in Shanghai and other places are enthusiastically rushing to make these gifts. In many factories in Shanghai where the gifts are being made, slogans such as "When drinking water, remember the source; victory, do not forget the People's Liberation Army," and "Select the best quality products to comfort the Chinese People's Liberation Army" are posted everywhere. The employees of the gold pen factory specially selected the best materials for the pen barrels in order to make the gold pens more beautiful and durable. These gold pens will not deform whether in the hot Hainan Island or the cold North. The gold content of the pen nibs is also higher than usual.

    People from all over the country are also sending local famous specialties to the People's Liberation Army. These include Moutai liquor from Guizhou, Xuanwei ham from Yunnan, silk floss quilts from Sichuan, Xiang embroidery from Hunan, porcelain from Jiangxi, Longjing tea from Zhejiang, large and sweet candied dates from Shexian County in Anhui, Suzhou and Hangzhou embroidery, Qingdao wine, Beijing drawnwork tablecloths and rayon, Fushun jet carvings, and Dalian glass industrial products. In addition, people from all over the country have sent many gifts with commemorative significance. These include medals for labor models in industry and agriculture, report cards for students with excellent academic performance, and the most precious red scarves of the Young Pioneers. Hu Yuxi, a model of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers in Liaozhong County, Liaoxi Province, and director of the "Red Flag" agricultural production cooperative, plans to present his two commemorative medals, "Grain Increase Model" and "Support-the-Army Model," to the People's Liberation Army.

    The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers have also selected the most meaningful souvenirs and gifts to send to the fraternal People's Liberation Army. The soldiers personally used the wreckage of enemy aircraft to make exquisite wine cups, and made globes and peace doves representing the defense of world peace. The soldiers also sent captured U.S. and ROK military air mattresses and parachutes, including a U.S. "nylon flak jacket" that had been pierced by bullets from the Volunteers; there were also three beautiful stone chrysanthemums collected by the railway engineering troops of the Volunteers last autumn when they helped the Korean people repair railways and dig tunnels.

    The people of the whole country specially sent many precious gifts to Chairman Mao Zedong, the creator, organizer, and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, the leader and commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Workers sent various petroleum products and high-quality steel and other industrial products. These include seamless steel pipes from the Northeast, white cloth woven by the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the first newly built cotton textile factory in our country, from the Northwest, and various industrial products made from gallnuts from the Southwest. The Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Northeast China sent many branches of fruitful sorghum and soybeans.

    The gifts also include waist belts, waist knives, ivory chopsticks used by the Tibetan people and patterned carpets woven by the Uighur people. Various democratic parties also sent many meaningful souvenirs to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, including a painting of pine and plum blossoms personally painted by He Xiangning at the age of seventy-five, a Ming edition of Tang poetry, Lu Xun's original manuscript of "We are no longer deceived," which sternly reprimanded anti-Soviet slanders, Lu Xun's personally written vertical axis of "Fierce-browed, I coolly defy a thousand pointing fingers, Head-bowed, like a willing ox I serve the children," and ancient Zhou Dynasty coins.
