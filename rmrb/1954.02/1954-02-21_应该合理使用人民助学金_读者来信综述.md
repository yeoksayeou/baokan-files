    People's Grants Should Be Used Reasonably
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters
    Many readers' letters reflect some unreasonable phenomena in the use of people's grants in certain schools.
    One specific manifestation of this unreasonable phenomenon is that some students and parents have an unclear understanding of the significance of people's grants, some district and township cadres are irresponsible when certifying students' family situations, and some schools' evaluations are not strict, resulting in some students from relatively wealthy families also receiving people's grants. Reader Li Ming from Zhangjiakou wrote a letter of self-criticism, saying that his father runs a leather business with capital of 200 million yuan, and his family is wealthy. Before he went to middle school in Beijing, he asked the village party branch secretary (his relative) to issue a certificate saying that his family was a peasant family and had financial difficulties, and he used this certificate to get a letter of introduction from the district. As a result, he received the treatment of a Grade A people's grant, and used the money his family gave him to eat and drink extravagantly. Yuan Zhifan, a teacher at Jilin Industrial School, wrote a letter saying that some local governments have adopted an irresponsible attitude when issuing certificates of family circumstances for students applying for people's grants. Some students whose families are not financially difficult also received certificates stating that they needed subsidies, and even said in the certificates which level of grant the school should award. In fact, many certificates are often written by the students themselves, and then taken to the district or township government to be stamped. Other readers also reported similar phenomena.
    Another manifestation of the unreasonable use of people's grants is that some school authorities have not strictly used people's grants to solve students' food and other actual material difficulties, so that some actual problems that students urgently need to solve are not resolved. For example, reader Zhou Tongli from Nantong Agricultural School in Jiangsu wrote a letter saying that the school uses part of the grants for student union office expenses, tea expenses, etc., but some students who are indeed financially difficult do not receive the help they deserve. For example, one student whose family is poor and does not have cotton clothes or quilts in winter, the school only subsidized the quilt, but did not help him solve the problem of cotton clothes. A reader from the Affiliated Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School of Shandong University wrote a letter saying that some students have been studying for a year and a half and still do not have money to buy dictionaries, maps and other necessary learning supplies. However, the family relief funds deducted by the school from the grants had some surplus at the end of last year, so they mobilized students to apply for family relief funds this spring, and said: "Anyone who wants to get dentures or glasses can apply." Therefore, many people applied for subsidies regardless of whether they needed them or not.
    Some schools have surplus people's grants because they estimated more students than there actually were, so they misappropriated them casually. For example, Liang Lizhong from the Supervision Department of the Central South Finance Administration wrote a letter saying that the people's grants of Jixian Middle School and Jixian No. 1 Middle School in Henan had monthly surpluses from January to September 1953, and the amount accounted for more than 20% of the reported amount; some of these funds have been misappropriated. Ma Chunyang, Wang Ming, Xu Di and others from the Finance Section of Yangzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Jiangsu Province wrote a letter saying that when the Yizheng County Teachers' Accelerated Training Class ended in August 1953, it had a surplus of more than 50 million yuan in people's grants. Zheng Airu, the head of the County Culture and Education Section, arbitrarily approved more than 40 million yuan for the construction of houses and the purchase of entertainment equipment for junior normal schools.
    It must be pointed out that the reason why the state set up people's grants was to better cultivate construction talents and enable more young people, especially the children of working people, to enter universities and secondary schools. The above-mentioned phenomena of unreasonable use of people's grants not only waste state funds, but also damage the work of educational institutions in cultivating construction talents accordingly, and therefore must be corrected. It is hoped that schools in various places will strengthen ideological education for students on the one hand, so that every student can understand the significance of people's grants and apply according to their family's financial situation; on the other hand, they should carry out evaluation work conscientiously and responsibly, and correct the practice of arbitrarily misappropriating people's grants. Cadres of local governments at all levels should introduce students' family circumstances with a conscientious and responsible attitude, and resolutely oppose favoritism. In addition, education administrative departments and financial departments of various provinces and cities should also regularly inspect the use of people's grants in various schools, so that people's grants can play their due role in the state's work of cultivating talents.

### 应该合理使用人民助学金——读者来信综述

专栏：读者来信摘要

    应该合理使用人民助学金
    ——读者来信综述
    不少读者来信反映：某些学校使用人民助学金中有些不合理的现象。
    这种不合理现象具体表现之一就是有一些学生和家长对人民助学金的意义认识不清，某些区、乡干部在证明学生家庭情况时不负责任，以及某些学校评审不严，致使一些家庭经济较富裕的学生也领用了人民助学金。张家口读者李明来信检讨说：他父亲开设着一个有二亿元资本的皮行，家里生活富裕，他上北京念中学前请村支部书记（他的亲戚）代开一个证明，说他家庭是农民，生活困难，并拿这个证明到区里换了介绍信。这样，他得到了甲级人民助学金的待遇，而把家里给他的钱用来大吃大喝。吉林工业学校教员袁志藩来信说：有些地方政府在为申请人民助学金的学生开具家庭情况的证明时采取了不负责任的态度。某些学生家庭经济并不困难，也得到了需要补助的证明，甚至证明中还说要学校评给那一等级的助学金。实际上，不少证明往往是学生自己写好，拿到区、乡政府盖个章罢了。其他读者也反映了类似的现象。
    对人民助学金使用不合理的另一种表现是：某些学校当局没有将人民助学金严格地用之于解决学生的伙食及其他实际物质困难，以致有些学生迫切需要解决的实际问题得不到解决。如江苏南通农校读者周童里来信说：学校将一部分助学金用作学生会办公费、茶水费等，有些经济确实困难的同学却得不到应有的帮助。如有一个同学家庭贫困，冬天没有棉衣棉被，学校只补助了棉被，棉衣就不替他解决了。山东大学附设工农速成中学一读者来信说：有些同学读了一年半书还没有钱买字典、地图等学习必需用品。可是，学校在助学金中扣除的家属救济费在去年底有些结余，就动员学生申请今春的家属救济费，并说：“谁要镶牙、配眼镜都可以申请。”因此，很多人不管是否需要，也去申请补助了。
    有些学校因为预计学生人数比实际人数多，人民助学金有了结余，就随便挪用。如中南财政管理局监察处梁立中来信说：河南汲县中学和汲县第一中学的人民助学金，从一九五三年一月到九月逐月都有结余，款数占报领金额的百分之二十以上；其中一部分款项已被挪用。江苏省扬州专署财政科马春阳、汪明、徐棣等来信说：仪征县师资速成训练班在一九五三年八月结束时结余人民助学金五千余万元，县文教科长郑蔼如擅自将四千多万元批给初级师范修建房屋和买娱乐用具等。
    必须指出：国家所以设置人民助学金，原是为了更好地培养建设人材，使更多的青年，特别是劳动人民的子女能够进入高等学校和中等学校学习。上述不合理使用人民助学金的现象，不但浪费了国家的资金，而且也会损害教育机构相应地培养建设人材的工作，因此必须加以纠正。希望各地学校一方面加强对学生的思想教育，使每个同学了解人民助学金的意义，根据家庭经济情况来申请；另一方面要认真负责地进行评审工作，并且纠正任意挪用人民助学金的做法。各级地方政府的干部应该以认真负责的态度来介绍学生家庭情况，坚决反对因私徇情。此外，各省市教育行政部门和财政部门也应该经常对各校使用人民助学金的情况进行检查，使人民助学金在国家培养人材的工作中起应有的作用。
