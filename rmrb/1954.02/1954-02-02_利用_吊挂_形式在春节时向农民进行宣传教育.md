Reader's Letter Summary:

    Using "Hanging Pictures" to Conduct Propaganda and Education for Farmers During the Spring Festival

    Reader Wang Shengbo writes: In the towns of rural North China, a custom called "hanging pictures" is popular during the Spring Festival. This "hanging pictures" involves stretching ropes along both sides of the street and hanging sets of colored pictures on the ropes, similar to a street exhibition. In the past, the content of the pictures was based on old novels such as *The Little Five义*, *The Case of Peng Gong*, *Investiture of the Gods*, and *The Case of Shi Gong*. They are hung every year from the 30th day of the twelfth lunar month until the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, and sometimes even until the second day of the second lunar month, and are very popular among farmers. In Nanda Street, Sixth District, Xincheng County, there is a set of "Three Heroes and Five Gallants" "hanging pictures" that has been preserved for more than forty years and is hung every year.

    In recent years, as the old "hanging pictures" have gradually failed to meet the needs of the increasingly politically and culturally sophisticated farmers, new "hanging pictures" have emerged. In the Sixth District of Xincheng County alone, as far as I know, three or four villages are hiring folk artists to create new "hanging pictures."

    This is a very good form of propaganda. I suggest that the cultural and educational propaganda departments of local people's governments and relevant units pay attention to this form and improve it, making timely use of the Spring Festival to use "hanging pictures" to conduct propaganda and education for the peasant masses, guiding folk artists to create new pictures, or exhibiting New Year pictures in the form of "hanging pictures" to replace those old and even feudal and superstitious "hanging pictures."

### 利用“吊挂”形式在春节时向农民进行宣传教育

专栏：读者来信摘要

    利用“吊挂”形式在春节时向农民进行宣传教育
    读者王声波来信：华北一带农村的市镇，在春节流行一种“吊挂”。这种“吊挂”是在沿街两旁横拉着绳子，绳子上挂着成套的彩色图画，类似街头展览。图画的内容过去都是根据小五义、彭公案、封神演义、施公案等旧小说编绘的。每年从腊月三十开始，挂到正月十五，也有挂到二月初二的，很受农民的欢迎。新城县第六区南大街有一套“三侠五义”的“吊挂”，一直保存了四十多年，每年都挂用。
    近几年来，由于旧内容的“吊挂”已渐渐不能满足政治文化水平日益提高的农民群众的需要，新的“吊挂”便出现了，仅以新城县第六区来说，据我所知道的就有三、四个村子在请民间艺人绘制新“吊挂”。
    这是一种很好的宣传形式，我建议各地人民政府的文教宣传部门和有关单位重视这种形式并加以改进，及时利用春节以“吊挂”来向农民群众进行宣传教育，有领导地帮助民间艺人编绘新的图画，或者把新年画用“吊挂”的形式来展出，以代替那些旧的甚至是封建迷信的“吊挂”。
