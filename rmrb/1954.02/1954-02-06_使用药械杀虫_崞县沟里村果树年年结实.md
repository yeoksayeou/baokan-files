    Using Insecticides and Equipment to Kill Pests
    Guoli Village, Yuanping County, Has Fruit Trees Bearing Fruit Every Year
    Farmers in Guoli Village, Yuanping County, Shanxi Province, use insecticides and equipment to kill pests, enabling fruit trees to bear fruit every year. Guoli Village has planted many fruit trees, with over 1,100 mu of its 2,800 mu of land dedicated to fruit trees. During abundant pear harvests, the annual income from pears accounts for about 70% of the village's total income. However, due to pest infestations, the trees typically bore fruit only three times every five years, and in severe cases, only once every five or six years. In the past, when insect pests occurred, farmers in Guoli Village could only catch them by hand. When there were too many insects, they couldn't catch them all, and some farmers had to painfully cut down their fruit trees and plant crops instead. Since 1950, the farmers in Guoli Village have been using insecticides and equipment to kill pests. Over the past few years, the village has purchased a total of 36 sprayers and over 700 jin of DDT. Whenever the fruit trees blossom and sprout, they are sprayed with pesticides, freeing the fruit trees from the threat of pests, and most of them now bear fruit every year. The yield has also increased year by year, from 400,000 jin in 1951 to 1.5 million jin in 1953. With the help of state-owned trading organizations and cooperatives, Guoli Village's pears are selling well, and prices are also increasing year by year. The village's pear income was only 220 million yuan in 1951, 1 billion yuan in 1952, and 1.9 billion yuan in 1953. The production and lives of the villagers have undergone great changes. In the past, most farmers' income was not enough to cover their expenses, but now more than 80 households regularly deposit over 180 million yuan in credit cooperatives. The village has built more than 100 new houses, and last autumn alone, they bought over 400 million yuan worth of production and living supplies from the supply and marketing cooperative. After studying the General Line, they have further realized that the abundant harvest of pears and the improvement of their lives are closely related to the support of the workers. They feel that their support for the workers is not enough. Some farmers who hoarded grain after selling pears have already sold their hoarded grain to the state. They are now preparing to establish cooperatives to further improve pear and agricultural production and vigorously support national industrial construction.

    使用药械杀虫
    崞县沟里村果树年年结实
    山西崞县沟里村农民使用药械杀虫，使果树年年结实。沟里村种植果树很多，全村两千八百多亩土地中有一千一百多亩种植了果树，梨果丰收时，一年收入约占全村总收入的百分之七十。但由于害虫的侵袭，一般都是五年结三次，受灾重的五、六年才结一次。沟里村农民过去每当虫害发生时，只能用手去捉，虫多时捉不过来，有些农民便忍痛砍掉果树，改种庄稼。从一九五零年开始，沟里村农民使用了杀虫药械，几年来全村共买进三十六架喷雾器，七百多斤滴滴涕。每当果树开花发芽的时候，即用药剂喷射，使果树摆脱了虫害的威胁，大部分达到年年结实。产量也逐年提高，一九五一年产四十万斤，一九五三年已提高为一百五十万斤。加上国营贸易机关和合作社的帮助，沟里村的梨果畅销，价格也逐年提高，全村梨果收入在一九五一年才两亿二千万元，一九五二年是十亿元，一九五三年已是十九亿多元了。全村农民的生产和生活都起了很大变化，过去大部分农民收入不够开支，现在已有八十多户经常在信用合作社存款一亿八千多万元，全村已盖了一百多间新房子，仅去年秋季就在供销社买了四亿多元的生产生活用品。经过总路线学习以后，他们进一步认识到梨果的丰收、生活的改善，和工人的支持有很大关系。他们感觉自己对工人的支持很不够，有些卖梨果后囤积粮食的农民，已把囤粮卖给了国家。现在他们正在准备建立合作社，进一步搞好梨果和农业生产，大力支持国家工业建设。
