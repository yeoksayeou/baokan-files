    Promoting Advanced Methods for Medical Treatment of Swine Erysipelas

    Editor's Note: Reader Li Chengfeng suggests promoting the advanced Soviet experience of using "soap bath therapy" to treat swine erysipelas (commonly known as "playing with fire," "branding," or "ghost branding"). According to our understanding, Sichuan and Hunan provinces experimentally implemented this advanced method in 1953, achieving good results.

    In addition, Sichuan Province also experimented in 1951 with using the Chinese folk remedies "White Arsenic Ear Insertion Method" and "Sun Liangchen's Proven Formula" to treat swine erysipelas, and improved the operational techniques. The results were also very effective. The above three methods require very little cost, are simple and easy to implement, but have great effects. However, some veterinary workers currently only want to use "anti-swine erysipelas serum" or the more expensive "penicillin" when treating swine erysipelas, which our country does not yet have the conditions to supply in large quantities. This is incorrect; they should actively learn from advanced Soviet experiences and treat the experiences of the masses and the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine with a correct attitude. Now we publish reader Li Chengfeng's letter below; and request the General Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture to provide a brief introduction to the "soap bath therapy," "White Arsenic Ear Insertion Method," and "Sun Liangchen's Proven Formula."

    Reader Li Chengfeng's Letter

    Reader Li Chengfeng writes: I am a veterinarian. Sometimes, the pigs raised by farmers do not eat, have high fevers, dry stools, and red spots appear successively on the ear roots, neck, and back. Some people say this is "ghost branding," which will take the pig's life and cannot be cured. Although I explained to the farmers that this is swine erysipelas, it is impossible to treat because "anti-swine erysipelas serum" is difficult to buy and "penicillin" is very expensive. Later, I saw an article in the "Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine" magazine, Volume 4, Issue 2, stating that the Soviet Union used "soap bath therapy" to treat swine erysipelas, which is both simple and effective. So I started to implement it. From April to December 1953, we in Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, used this method to cure forty-five sick pigs. The farmers all said: This method is really wonderful, and the sick pigs are cured by simply washing them a few times with ordinary soap. I suggest that agricultural departments in various places pay attention to experimenting with and promoting this advanced Soviet experience.

    Introduction to Three Effective Methods for Treating Swine Erysipelas

                    General Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture

    Soap Bath Therapy

    Since the Soviet Veterinary Journal published the advanced experience of using "soap bath therapy" to treat swine erysipelas, the Sichuan Provincial Institute of Agricultural Sciences first conducted experiments. In some areas of Yunyang and other eight counties, this method was used to cure many sick pigs, with an effectiveness rate of over 89%. Hunan Province conducted three experiments in Liling County, and the results were also very good.

    Soap bath method: Place the pig on the grass, wash away the mud all over its body with warm water (preferably consistent with the pig's body temperature), and then use ordinary laundry soap (the easier to lather, the better) dipped in warm water to rub the pig's body (do not omit the hoof forks, head, and ears). Then, rub with your fingernails or a laundry brush, dripping warm water at any time to allow the soap to fully lather, until the sick pig's entire skin is red and a thick layer of foam adheres to the skin surface. After the soap foam dries naturally (after about one and a half to two hours), perform the second soap bath in the same way. Soap baths can be performed three times a day, but no more. Treatment should continue until the sick pig's body temperature drops and its appetite returns. However, this therapy is ineffective when swine erysipelas is complicated by other diseases.

    White Arsenic Ear Insertion Method

    This method was first tested in Huayang County, Sichuan Province in 1951, curing many sick pigs. In 1952, the Sichuan Agricultural Experimental Institute, Chengdu Serum Factory, and other units jointly experimented with using white arsenic to treat seven artificially inoculated sick pigs, all of which were cured. In Xindu County, the experimental treatment efficiency reached over 82%. After being promoted in the province in 1953, according to key inspections in Neijiang and other sixteen counties, the cure rate in some areas reached over 88%. Moreover, this treatment method has also shown some preliminary effects on swine fever (necrotic enteritis).

    Ear Insertion Method: Use a sterilized small pointed knife to make a transverse cut in the skin about a quarter of an inch wide on the outer edge of the pig's ear tip at the bifurcation of blood vessels. Then, insert the knife tip under the skin about three or four points deep from the cut towards the ear tip, peeling up the skin into a bag shape. Slightly puncture the blood vessels, and use sterilized tweezers to clamp a white arsenic pill (red arsenic has a smaller effect), then rub it by hand to make the white arsenic pill adhere to the blood in the bag to prevent it from falling off. Use a soybean-sized arsenic pill for large pigs and a mung bean-sized arsenic pill for small pigs. Sometimes it can take effect on the same day. If it is not effective, another arsenic pill can be inserted into the other pig ear in the same way after one or two days. If the ear does not swell after inserting the arsenic pill for one day, another arsenic pill must be inserted using the above method. Both ears of severely ill pigs can be inserted with arsenic pills at the same time.

    Sun Liangchen's Proven Formula

    This proven formula is made by adding or subtracting from the "Toad Venom Pill Formula." In 1952, experiments in Shuangliu County, Sichuan Province, cured over 80% of sick pigs suffering from swine erysipelas; experiments in Pengshan County cured over 90% of sick pigs. This method is currently being promoted in various places. This proven formula can not only treat swine erysipelas, but also swine fever and swine pneumonia.

    Prescription: Toad venom 0.5 fen (soaked in a few drops of wine), pure calomel 3 qian, musk 2 qian, calcined alum 4 qian, cold water stone 4 qian (calcined by fire), verdigris 3 qian, frankincense 4 qian, cinnabar 1 liang. The above medicines must be genuine, finely ground into powder, placed in a bottle, and the bottle mouth tightly closed to avoid reducing the efficacy of the medicine.

    Dosage: Use 0.3 fen for pigs weighing 30-40 jin, 0.4 fen for pigs weighing 50-60 jin, 0.5 fen for pigs weighing 70-80 jin, and 0.6 fen for pigs weighing over 100 jin. When using, first wet the medicine with a few drops of wine, add water to make a paste, scrape the medicine with a smoothed wooden board (or bamboo board) and apply it to the base of the pig's tongue so that it swallows it naturally; for sick pigs that are mentally weak and breathe normally, 0.1-0.2 fen of medicinal powder can be blown into the nostrils with a bamboo tube, which is also very effective. However, this formula is inconvenient for farmers to prepare, and one dose of medicine costs 60,000-70,000 yuan. Shuangliu County made pills, one pill per pig at a time, and the selling price was only 700 yuan; making it into powder or pills like this and entrusting pharmacies or cooperatives to sell it in small quantities is a very good method.

### 推广医疗猪丹毒的先进方法

专栏：读者来信摘要

    推广医疗猪丹毒的先进方法
    编者按：读者李承锋来信，建议推广苏联使用“皂浴疗法”治猪丹毒（俗称打火印、打印子或鬼打印）的先进经验。据我们了解，一九五三年四川、湖南两省曾分别试行这一先进方法，得到了良好的效果。
    此外，四川省在一九五一年还试验用我国民间土方“白砒卡耳法”及“孙良臣验方”来治疗猪丹毒，并把操作技术加以改进，结果也很有效。以上三种方法需费很少，简单易行，效果却很大。但是，目前某些兽医工作人员在医治猪丹毒时，只愿使用我国尚无条件大量供应的“抗猪丹毒血清”或较贵重的“青霉素”，这是不对的；他们应该积极学习苏联先进经验，并以正确的态度对待群众的经验和祖国医学遗产。现在我们把读者李承锋的来信发表于后；并请中央农业部畜牧兽医总局对“皂浴疗法”、“白砒卡耳法”和“孙良臣验方”作一个简单的介绍。
    读者李承锋的来信
    读者李承锋来信：我是一个兽医。有时，农民所养的猪儿不吃食，发高烧，大便干结，耳根和颈部、背部陆续出现红斑；有的人就说这是“鬼打印”，要猪儿的命，没法治。我虽然向农民说明这是猪丹毒，但因为“抗猪丹毒血清”很难买到，“青霉素”又很贵，没法治疗。后来，我在“畜牧与兽医”杂志四卷二期上看到一篇文章，说苏联治猪丹毒使用“皂浴疗法”，既简单又有效。我就试行起来。从一九五三年四月到十二月止，我们江西省东乡县就用这个法子治好了四十五头病猪。农民们都说：这个法儿真妙，有病的猪儿只要用普通肥皂洗上几次澡就治好了。我建议各地农业部门注意试行推广这一苏联先进经验。
    介绍治疗猪丹毒的三种有效方法
                    中央农业部畜牧兽医总局
    皂浴疗法
    自苏联兽医学杂志发表了用“皂浴疗法”治猪丹毒的先进经验后，四川省农业科学研究所首先进行试验，云阳等八个县部分地区使用这个办法治疗好了不少病猪，有效率达百分之八十九以上。湖南省在醴陵县作了三次试验，效果也很好。
    皂浴的方法：把猪卧放在草上，用温水（最好与猪的体温一致）洗去其全身污泥，然后用普通洗衣肥皂（越容易起泡沫的越好）蘸温水涂擦猪身（蹄叉及头、耳也不要遗漏），再用指甲或洗衣刷子揉搓，随时滴上温水，使肥皂充分发起泡沫，到病猪通身皮肤通红、皮表黏附一层浓厚泡沫为止。待肥皂泡沫自干后（约经一个半至两小时），再同样行第二次皂浴。一天内可皂浴三次，不宜再多。治疗应到病猪体温下降，食欲恢复为止。但这种疗法在猪丹毒并发其它疾病时无效。
    白砒卡耳法
    这一方法，在一九五一年首先在四川省华阳县试验，治好不少病猪。一九五二年由四川农业实验所、成都血清厂等单位联合试验，用白砒治人工接种病猪七头，均获治愈。在新都县试验治疗效率达百分之八十二以上。一九五三年在省内推广后，据重点检查内江等十六县部分地区，治愈率均达百分之八十八以上。而且这种治疗方法对猪瘟（烂肠瘟）也初步证明有些效果。
    卡耳方法：用消过毒的小尖刀在猪耳尖上面外缘血管分岔处横切开皮肤约四分宽，再从割口处用刀尖向耳尖方向插入皮下约三、四分深，将皮剥起成袋状，稍稍刺破血管，用消过毒的镊子夹入白砒丸（用红砒效果就小）一粒，随即用手揉搓，使白砒丸在袋内与血液粘着，以防脱落。大猪用黄豆大砒丸一颗，小猪用绿豆大砒丸一颗。有时当天即能见效，如不见效，一、二天后可在另一猪耳用同法卡砒丸一粒。如卡入砒丸后经一天不见耳肿，即须再用上述办法卡入砒丸。重病猪两耳可同时卡入砒丸。
    孙良臣验方
    这个验方是根据“蟾酥丸方”加减制成。一九五二年在四川双流县试验，治愈患猪丹毒的病猪在百分之八十以上；在彭山县试验，治愈病猪百分之九十以上。目前各地都在推广这种办法。这种验方不仅能治猪丹毒，对猪瘟、猪肺疫也有效。
    药方：蟾酥五分（用酒几滴浸化）、净轻粉三钱。麝香二钱、枯矾四钱、寒水石四钱（火煅）、铜绿三钱、乳香四钱、朱砂一两。以上各药必须真实，共研为细末，装在瓶内，盖紧瓶口，以免减低药效。
    服法：三、四十斤重的猪用三分，五、六十斤重的猪用四分，七、八十斤的猪用五分，百斤以上的猪用六分。用时先用酒数滴把药浸湿，加水调成糊状，用一削光的木板（或竹板）把药刮起抹在猪的舌根部，使自然咽下；对精神萎顿、呼吸正常的病猪可用药粉一、二分，用竹管吹入鼻孔，也很有效。但此方农民配制较不方便，且一剂药须用六、七万元。双流县制成丸剂，每猪一次服一丸，售价仅七百元；像这样制成粉剂或丸剂，委托药铺或合作社代为零销，是很好的办法。
