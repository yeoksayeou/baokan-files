Labor Models Su Changyou and Others Write to Commanders and Fighters of the Northeast Military Region
    Let Us Join Hands Closely to Build Our Great Motherland

Comrades of all commanders and fighters of the Northeast Military Region:

    We extend our highest respect to you and congratulate you on the brilliant achievements you have made in cultural studies and military training.

    Comrades, although we are in different work and combat positions, our hearts are closely linked together. Your heroic deeds are constantly inspiring us.

    The year 1954 has arrived. The first Five-Year Plan has only passed its first year, and our country has already won a great victory on the construction front. Look, from the Northeast to the Northwest, from Tibet to Inner Mongolia, from the Yangtze River Basin to the Yellow River Basin, how many power plants, machinery factories, textile factories... have been established one after another, and tall chimneys have been erected one after another. The lives of the people across the country are also getting better and better. In our beautiful country, such inspiring things can be seen everywhere.

    We clearly know that the wolf-hearted and dog-lunged American aggressors dream of extending their pig snouts into our beautiful garden. In the past few years, the reason why our motherland has been able to advance so rapidly is inseparable from the heroic battles of the most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteers—in Korea; it is inseparable from you—the comrades of the People's Liberation Army—who vigilantly guard the safety of the border, the coast, and the urban factories day and night, braving wind, rain, ice, and snow. You are like a copper wall and iron barrier, safeguarding the security and happiness of the motherland.

    Dear comrades, you are protecting the economic construction of the motherland, the happy life of the people of the motherland, and world peace with your lives. This great spirit of revolutionary heroism is worthy of our study. The position you stand on is the most glorious. When workers are producing in factories and farmers are harvesting in the fields, they will think of you protecting them. Even the children studying in schools, when they think of you, they will say, "Our happiness is brought to us by the uncles of the Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army."

    We, in the old society, were all "poor workers" and never dreamed of today's happiness. Now, under the glorious illumination of the Party and Chairman Mao, we not only enjoy freedom and happiness along with the people of the whole country, but we have also entered schools and become middle school students. We will complete the basic courses of middle school in three years to prepare for entering university, and in the future, become a strong backbone in the cause of building the motherland. From the day we accepted this learning task, we were determined: we must, like you, take this cultural and scientific fortress with a heroic, fearless, and indomitable fighting attitude. Let us join hands closely to build our great motherland and jointly advance for the early realization of the socialist and communist society of our motherland!

    劳动模范苏长有等给东北军区指战员写信
    让我们紧密地携起手来建设伟大的祖国东北军区全体指战员同志们：
    我们向你们致崇高的敬礼，并祝贺你们在文化学习和军事训练中取得的辉煌成绩。
    同志们，虽然我们在不同的工作和战斗岗位上，但是我们的心却是紧紧连在一起的。你们的英勇事迹时刻都在鼓舞着我们。
    一九五四年来了。第一个五年建设计划才过了头一年，我们国家就在建设战线上打了一个大胜仗。看吧，从东北到西北，从西藏到内蒙，从长江流域到黄河流域，多少发电厂、机械厂、纺织厂……一座一座地建立起来了，一个个高大的烟囱矗立起来了。全国人民的生活也越过越好起来了。在我们这个美好的国家里，到处都可以看到这种振奋人心的事情。
    我们清楚地知道：狼心狗肺的美国侵略者，梦想把它那猪嘴伸到我们这座美丽的大花园里。过去几年来，我们祖国所以能这样飞快地前进，是和最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的英勇战斗分不开的；是和你们——人民解放军的同志们日日夜夜冒着风雨冰雪，警惕地守卫着边防、海防和城市工厂的安全分不开的。你们像一道铜墙铁壁，保卫了祖国的安全和幸福。
    亲爱的同志们，你们用自己的生命保卫着祖国的经济建设，保卫着祖国人民的幸福生活，保卫着世界和平。这种伟大的革命英雄主义的精神，是值得我们每个人学习的。你们所站的岗位是最光荣的。当工人们在工厂生产的时候，农民在田里收割的时候，都会想到是你们在保卫着他们。就连在学校念书的孩子们，一想到你们，他们就会说：“我们这些幸福是解放军和志愿军叔叔给我们带来的。”
    我们，在旧社会里，都是“穷工人”，根本梦想不到还有今天的幸福。现在，我们在党和毛主席的光辉照耀下，不仅和全国人民一道享受着自由和幸福，而且都走进了学校，成了中学生。我们要在三年的时间内，学完中学的基本课程，为升入大学作好准备，将来在建设祖国的事业中作一个坚强的骨干。我们从接受这个学习任务那天起，就下了决心：一定要像你们那样，以英勇无畏、顽强不屈的战斗姿态攻下这个文化科学堡垒。让我们紧密地携起手来，建设我们伟大的祖国，为我们祖国的社会主义和共产主义社会的早日实现而共同前进！
