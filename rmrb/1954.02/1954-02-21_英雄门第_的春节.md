　　The Spring Festival of a "Heroic Family"
　　Wu Dazhong
　　Old Lunar New Year's Eve. The home of Yang Lian'di, a first-class people's hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in Beicang Village, a suburb of Tianjin, was even more lively. The sounds of gongs and drums and firecrackers blended together, and crowds of well-wishers came and went through the vermilion gate inscribed with "Heroic Family."

　　Noon. A young couple, dressed in brand-new clothes, walked in, chatting and laughing, carrying New Year's gifts. They pushed through the crowd of well-wishers, walked directly to the parents of the martyr, respectfully bowed, and said in unison, "Dad, Mom, Happy New Year!" Yang Yupou, the hero's father, took out a handkerchief, wiped his eyes, and stepped closer to carefully examine the unfamiliar guests.

　　The man introduced himself first, saying, "Today is our wedding day. We must never forget those who dug the well when we drink the water! The happiness we enjoy today as revolutionary companions is all thanks to the blood and sacrifice of the martyrs, so we decided to visit the hero's home today to express our determination and respect, and to mark the beginning of our new life."

　　Upon hearing that they were a newlywed couple, the hero's father and mother pulled them in, almost saying in unison, "A joyous occasion, a joyous occasion, please sit down!"

　　The groom's name is Liu Honggui, a teacher at the Third Workers' Amateur School in the Sixth District of Tianjin; the bride's name is Zhao Xuequan, a teacher at the Twenty-eighth Elementary School in the Fourth District of Tianjin. Before liberation, Liu Honggui could not find a job after graduating from middle school and wandered around due to the pressures of life. Zhao Xuequan also suffered the pain of being unable to attend school and being unemployed in the old society. Only after liberation did they find satisfactory jobs and begin a stable life. Whenever they thought of all the misfortunes they had encountered in the old society and their happy life today, they would naturally think of the People's Army that had liberated them and protected their happy life.

　　What they couldn't forget, in particular, was the spring of 1952, when Yang Lian'di, a first-class people's hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, returned to Tianjin. At a report meeting, they saw Yang Lian'di and heard about Yang Lian'di's heroic deeds: the worst flood in forty years on the Qingchuan River in North Korea, thirty-six days and nights of fighting amidst enemy bombing and raging torrents, fourteen times erecting pontoon bridges. These thrilling heroic deeds deeply moved and encouraged them. From then on, they used the spirit of the Volunteer Army to encourage themselves, to handle their work and study, and often told their students about the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army. Whenever they met, they would often ask each other: "What have you learned from the Volunteer Army? What progress have you made?" It was also in this process that they achieved more success in their work and their feelings became even closer.

　　On New Year's Eve, they decided to get married, and the first thing they thought of was the Volunteer Army, of Martyr Yang Lian'di, who had given them the greatest encouragement and moved them the most. So, taking advantage of this auspicious day, they came to visit the hero's home.

　　Now, they had arrived at the home of Martyr Yang Lian'di. Their arrival was warmly received by the hero's family and caused great excitement among the visitors. The hero's mother talked to them about the Spring Festival celebrations at home while introducing them to the whole family. Yang Lian'di's two young daughters, Da Ping and Er Ru, holding peanuts and candies, squeezed through the crowd, clamoring to see their new uncle and aunt. Zhao Xuequan hugged Yang Lian'di's youngest son, Ji Ying, who was less than two years old, and kissed him repeatedly. Ji Ying grinned non-stop, as if he were also happy for the newlywed couple. Comrade Jin Bingqi of the District Committee teased from the side, "When you come again on this day next year, have a chubby baby like this, and let him inherit the hero's cause!" The people in the room immediately burst into laughter, and Zhao Xuequan shyly lowered her head.

　　During the conversation, everyone was blessing the newlyweds. Among them were Lu Ding, section chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau's Pension Section of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, and Li Zhenyuan, deputy company commander of the "Yang Lian'di Company" of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, who had come all the way from the Korean front to慰问the martyr's family. At this moment, Liu Honggui took out a prepared letter of determination and read it aloud: "We will never forget the encouragement and education that Martyr Yang Lian'di gave us. In front of everyone, we are willing to make our own guarantee with the greatest sincerity and determination: Under the illumination of the general line, we must always learn from the noble qualities and great spirit of heroes and martyrs, and constantly improve our ideological level and work efficiency." A round of applause rang out in the room. People looked at the revolutionary newlyweds with envious eyes, and everyone went over to congratulate them.

　　Then, Li Zhenyuan, deputy company commander of the "Yang Lian'di Company," took the newlyweds to visit the exhibition room filled with the hero's belongings, photos, and banners, and described in detail the martyr's combat life and the heroic deeds of the "Yang Lian'di Company" under the command and leadership of the hero Yang Lian'di. Liu Honggui shook Comrade Li Zhenyuan's hand and said with emotion, "Today we have experienced the most meaningful day of our lives, and the hero's deeds will forever be a force to encourage us."

    “英雄门第”的春节
    吴大中
    旧历除夕。天津市郊区北仓村中国人民志愿军一级人民英雄杨连第烈士家里，显得更热闹了。锣鼓声、鞭炮声响成一片，慰问的人群，从写着“英雄门第”的朱漆大门出出进进。
    正午。一对青年男女，穿着崭新的衣服，带着贺年的礼品说说笑笑地走了进来。他们推开慰问的人群，一直走到烈士父母的面前，恭恭敬敬地行了一个礼，齐声说：“爸爸，妈妈，过年好！”英雄的父亲杨玉璞掏出手绢，擦擦眼睛，凑近一步仔细地打量着这对陌生的客人。
    那个男的首先自我介绍说：“今天是我们结婚的好日子。吃水不忘掘井人！我们今天能够享受革命伴侣的幸福，都是先烈们流血牺牲换来的，所以我们就决定到英雄家里来拜访，以表达我们的决心和敬意，并作为我们新的生活的开始。”
    英雄的父亲和母亲一听是对新婚夫妇，就拉着他们，也几乎是齐声说道：“大喜事，大喜事，快请坐！”
    新郎叫刘鸿贵，是天津市第六区第三工人业余学校的教员；新娘叫赵学全，是天津市第四区第二十八小学的教员。解放前，刘鸿贵中学毕业后就找不到职业了，受生活的逼迫，到处流浪。赵学全在旧社会也饱尝了失学、失业的痛苦。只是在解放后，他们才得到了满意的工作，开始了安定的生活。每当他们想起在旧社会所遭遇的一切不幸和今天的幸福生活时，就很自然地联想到那些解放了自己和保卫着自己幸福生活的人民军队来。
    尤其使他们不能忘记的是一九五二年春天，当时中国人民志愿军一级人民英雄杨连第同志回到了天津。在一次报告会上，他们看到了杨连第，听到了杨连第的英雄事迹：北朝鲜的清川江上，四十年来空前的大洪水，在敌机的狂炸下，在汹涌的激流中，三十六昼夜的奋战，十四次架搭浮桥。这些惊心动魄的英雄事迹，是那样深深地震动了和鼓舞了他们。从那时起，他们就以志愿军的精神来鼓励自己，来处理自己的工作和学习，并把志愿军的英雄事迹经常讲给自己的学生听。每当他们见面的时候，也常常要互相问起：“你向志愿军学习了些什么？有了哪些进步？”也就在这中间，他们在工作中都取得了更多的成绩，感情也更加亲密了。
    除夕，他们决定结婚了，他们首先想起了志愿军，想起了对自己鼓舞最大、感动最深的杨连第烈士。于是，乘着这个好日子，到英雄家里来拜访。
    现在，他们已经到了英雄杨连第烈士的家里了。他们的来临，受到了英雄家属的热烈招待，也引起了来访客人的很大兴奋。英雄的妈妈一面给他们谈着家里过春节的情景，一面给他们介绍全家的人。烈士杨连第的两个小女儿大萍、二茹手里拿着花生、糖果，从人群里钻过来，吵吵嚷嚷地要看看新叔叔和新婶婶。赵学全抱着杨连第的不到两周岁的小儿子继英吻了又吻，继英也咧着嘴笑个不停，仿佛他也为这对新婚夫妇感到高兴。区委会的靳秉奇同志在旁边逗着说：“来年今天你们再来的时候，也生下这样一个胖娃娃，让他也继承英雄的事业吧！”屋子里的人立刻哄笑起来，赵学全羞答答地低下了头。
    谈话间，大家都在为这对新婚夫妇祝福。其中还有天津市人民政府民政局抚恤科鲁丁科长和远自朝鲜前线前来慰问烈士家庭的中国人民志愿军“杨连第连”的李振远副连长。这时，刘鸿贵把准备好的决心书拿出来宣读：“我们永远不能忘记杨连第烈士给我们的鼓舞和教育。我们愿在大家面前，以最大的至诚和决心，提出自己的保证：在总路线的灯塔照耀下，我们一定要永远学习英雄和烈士的崇高品质和伟大精神，不断提高自己的思想水平和工作效率。”屋子里响起了一片掌声。人们以羡慕的眼光看望着这对革命的新婚夫妇，大家都走过去为他们祝贺。
    接着，“杨连第连”的李振远副连长带着这对新婚夫妇到摆满英雄的遗物、照片、锦旗的陈列室里去参观，并详细地给他们介绍烈士生前的战斗生活，和“杨连第连”在英雄杨连第指挥带动下，艰苦奋斗的英勇事迹。刘鸿贵握着李振远同志的手，感动地说：“今天我们经历了一生中最有意义的日子，英雄的事迹将永远成为鼓舞我们的一种力量。”
