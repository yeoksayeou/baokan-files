    Promote Wang Chonglun's Work Spirit and Fulfill National Plans Ahead of Schedule

    During the recovery period of China's industry, a large number of advanced producers, rationalization proposers, and technical innovators continuously emerged among the vast workers, staff, and technical personnel. They made great contributions to the rapid recovery and development of China's industry, and their advanced deeds became examples praised and emulated by the broad masses of people. Last year was the first year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. In industrial production and construction, and in the increase production and practice economy campaign launched to over-fulfill the 1953 national plan in an all-round way, many advanced producers, rationalization proposers, and technical innovators also emerged, and Wang Chonglun was one of them.

    With the help and encouragement of the leading comrades, workers, and technicians of the tool workshop of the Angang Machinery General Plant, and under the influence of Zhang Mingshan's creative spirit of inventing the "anti-circumferential disc," Wang Chonglun successively improved tools eight times and created the "universal tool tire," which improved production efficiency and solved the problem of unbalanced equipment in the workshop. According to the 1953 quota calculation, he completed more than four years of work in one year, and all products were first-class (recently, Wang Chonglun, based on the 1954 quota, proposed a plan to complete sixteen months of work throughout the year). Under Wang Chonglun's influence, the workers in the tool workshop improved their work, and according to the 1953 quota calculation, the entire workshop completed more than two years of work in one year, and the quality also met the standards. The employees of the Angang Machinery General Plant learned Wang Chonglun's work spirit, and in less than two months, they proposed 389 rationalization proposals to improve tools and equipment, overcome weak links in production, and over-fulfill the national production plan. Eighty-six of these have been successfully tested, and more than 300 are being researched and manufactured. Wang Chonglun's initiative has also attracted the attention of the vast number of employees across the country. Many factories and mines have launched a mass upsurge in technical improvement, and workers, peasants, soldiers, and students have written letters to Wang Chonglun, expressing their desire to learn his work spirit and complete the tasks assigned to them by the state. At the Shanghai Municipal Heavy Industry System's Youth Production Activists Conference, nearly a thousand young labor models and young advanced producers were very excited after hearing about Wang Chonglun's advanced deeds, and expressed their desire to further learn from Wang Chonglun and over-fulfill the national plan in an all-round way.

    During the great planned economic construction period of our motherland, Wang Chonglun's initiative is of extremely important significance. If Wang Chonglun's work spirit of continuously improving technology and fulfilling national plans ahead of schedule and in an all-round way can be promoted among the national workforce, if many workers, many groups, many work sections, many workshops, many pit mouths, many construction sites, as well as many factories and mines, and many engineering companies can fulfill the national plans ahead of schedule and in an all-round way every month and every year, then our industrial production will greatly improve, and our new industrial bases will be completed ahead of schedule. And the acceleration of industrial construction will drive the development of other sectors of the national economy. Therefore, learning and promoting Wang Chonglun's work spirit so that everyone can fulfill the national plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way is a major issue directly related to accelerating the speed of socialist industrialization and enabling our country to transition to a socialist society at an early date.

    What are the main points of Wang Chonglun's work spirit? What should the vast number of employees learn from Wang Chonglun?

    First of all, we should learn Wang Chonglun's labor attitude and his sense of responsibility as the master of the national plan. When the tool workshop of the Angang Machinery General Plant was manufacturing rock drill parts, the production capacity of the slotting machine was very small, and it was always behind schedule. The quality of the work was also poor, and the next few processes were always waiting for the slotting machine to deliver the work, so the production plan was often not completed. Under such circumstances, Wang Chonglun did not, like some people, think that "insufficient equipment is the factory's business, and improving tools is the business of technicians, neither of which is my business." Wang Chonglun realized that if the plan to manufacture rock drill parts was not completed, it would affect mining; if ore could not be mined, it would prevent iron smelting and steelmaking from fulfilling the national plan. He also realized that if the quality of the products of the plant was poor, problems would occur when they were used in the mines, which would delay production. Therefore, he cherished every second and every minute of his working time, paid attention to strengthening the maintenance of the machine, and actively sought ways to create tools, overcome the difficulties of unbalanced equipment, increase production, and improve quality, and finally over-fulfilled the plan in an all-round way. What we should learn from Wang Chonglun is precisely this socialist labor attitude of actively planning for the interests of the country, correctly handling the relationship between one's own work and the national plan, and actively contributing wisdom and strength to strive for the early and comprehensive fulfillment of the national plan.

    Second, we should learn Wang Chonglun's spirit of paying attention to mastering technology, constantly studying technology, and improving technology. Some people usually do not pay attention to improving technology. In order to complete production tasks, they only know how to simply rely on working overtime, increasing labor intensity, and carrying out one-sided crash programs, which often cause a series of bad consequences in production. In contrast, Wang Chonglun can pay attention to mastering technology, strictly abide by operating procedures, skillfully use machines, fully utilize the machine's capabilities, and on this basis, use his brain, find tricks, and continuously improve technology. After he created the "universal tool tire" for the planer, it took only 45 minutes to make a card actuator on the planer, which originally took two and a half hours on the slotting machine. But he was not satisfied with this. He then improved the stroke of the planer, changed the cutter head, and shortened the time of the empty cutter, so that the time for making a card actuator on the planer was shortened from 45 minutes to 19 minutes. And the quality was guaranteed. Learning Wang Chonglun's spirit of actively studying technology and continuously improving technology is of particular importance today. Because it can further improve the equipment of existing factories and mines, and it can also help us master new technologies and equipment more quickly, so as to continuously improve labor productivity. And the growth of labor productivity can make the people's material and cultural living standards improve faster.

    Third, we should learn Wang Chonglun's spirit of humbly learning from others and actively helping others, and learn his spirit of unity and mutual assistance with comrades. Wang Chonglun encountered many difficulties in creating the "universal tool tire," but he could humbly ask others for advice and obtain the help of technicians and other skilled workers. At the same time, he also helped the grinding machine worker Cui Junshan extend the fixture, so that the original one-piece grinding was improved to six pieces at a time. Wang Chonglun's help to apprentices is also very active. His spirit of not being arrogant and not conservative towards comrades, his spirit of unity and mutual assistance, is a very valuable spirit of the working class, and every employee should strive to learn from it.

    The Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of every enterprise should also gain valuable experience and lessons from Wang Chonglun's initiative. Wang Chonglun's initiative tells us that the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of enterprises should pay attention to strengthening the socialist education of employees. At present, they should strengthen the education of the Party's general line during the transition period to improve the class consciousness of employees. Wang Chonglun's advanced deeds were produced on the basis of his improved class consciousness. Before he improved his consciousness, he also had emotions at work and was absent from work for three days, but the Party educated him and improved his consciousness, so that he saw the great future of the working class and the beautiful prospects of national construction, and found his goal of striving hard. So he became active, and under the Party's continuous education and encouragement, he created a series of advanced deeds. Facts have proved that the Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League of enterprises must unremittingly strengthen the socialist education of employees in order to improve their class consciousness so that they can strive to realize the Party's general line during the transition period.

    Wang Chonglun's initiative and the influence of this initiative tell us that the technical improvements and rationalization proposals of the vast number of employees are the new force for improving enterprises, and are an important method for breaking through the old production level and promoting the continuous upsurge of labor productivity. In the past, the leading comrades of many factories and mines attached importance to the rationalization proposals and technical improvements of employees, and paid attention to promoting advanced experiences, and have achieved great results. However, the leading comrades of many factories and mines did not regard improving technology, handling rationalization proposals, and promoting advanced experience as regular work, and did not consolidate and improve the achievements that have been made, so that this work lacks regular leadership and forms a free flow. The work of improving technology and promoting advanced experience in some factories and mines is still at the level of general mobilization and appeals, lacking in-depth and meticulous organizational work. There is also a lack of a clear purpose for rationalization proposals. They do not propose topics based on the key problems in production, and mobilize everyone to find tricks to solve them around the topics, so the improvement of production in these enterprises is not great. The Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of enterprises should learn from Wang Chonglun's initiative. They must pay attention to supporting the budding of new forces in enterprises, promptly handle employees' rationalization proposals, vigorously promote major advanced experiences, actively improve technology, and widely carry out mechanization and automation movements according to actual conditions. The Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of enterprises should regard these tasks as regular and important work, so as to guide the enthusiasm and creativity of employees to the track of fulfilling the national plan ahead of schedule and in an all-round way, and strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization at an early date.

    发扬王崇伦的工作精神  提前完成国家计划
    在我国工业的恢复时期，广大工人、职员和技术人员中，曾经不断地涌现了许多先进生产者、合理化建议者和技术革新者，他们对于迅速恢复和发展我国的工业曾作出了伟大的贡献，他们的先进事迹曾经成为广大人民赞扬和效法的榜样。去年是我国进入第一个五年计划的第一年，在工业的生产和建设中，在为超额全面完成一九五三年的国家计划而开展的增产节约运动中，也涌现了不少的先进生产者、合理化建议者和技术革新者，王崇伦便是其中的一个。
    王崇伦在鞍钢机械总厂工具车间的领导同志及工人、技术人员的帮助和鼓励下，在张明山发明“反围盘”的创造精神影响下，先后八次改进工具，并创造了“万能工具胎”，提高了生产效率，解决了车间设备不平衡的问题。按照一九五三年的定额计算，他一年内完成了四年多的工作量，产品全部是一级品（最近，王崇伦根据一九五四年的定额，又提出了全年完成十六个月的工作量的计划）。工具车间的工人们在王崇伦的影响下，差不多每个人的工作都有改进，按一九五三年的定额计算，全车间一年完成了二年多的工作量，质量也符合标准。鞍钢机械总厂职工学习了王崇伦的工作精神，不到两个月的时间，就提出了三百八十九件改进工具和设备、克服生产薄弱环节、超额完成国家生产计划的合理化建议，其中有八十六件已试验成功，还有三百多件正在研究和制造中。王崇伦的创举，也引起了全国各地广大职工的重视。许多厂矿掀起了群众性的改进技术的热潮，工人、农民、战士、学生纷纷写信给王崇伦，表示要学习他的工作精神，完成国家所交付给他们的任务。上海市重工业系统的青年生产活动分子大会上，近一千位青年劳动模范和青年先进生产者听了王崇伦的先进事迹后都很兴奋，表示要进一步向王崇伦学习，超额全面完成国家计划。
    在我们祖国进行伟大的有计划的经济建设时期，王崇伦的创举是有极其重大的意义的。如果王崇伦这种不断地改进技术，提前全面完成国家计划的工作精神能在全国职工中推广起来，如果许多工人，许多小组，许多工段，许多车间，许多坑口，许多工地，以及许多厂矿和许多工程公司，都能每月每年地提前全面完成国家计划，那么，我们的工业生产就会大大提高一步，我们新的工业基地就会提前建设成功，而工业建设速度的加快，又会带动国民经济其它部门的发展。因此，学习和推广王崇伦的工作精神，使人人都能提前全面完成国家计划，乃是直接关联到加快社会主义工业化的速度、使我国早日过渡到社会主义社会的重大问题。
    王崇伦的工作精神主要有那几点呢？广大职工应该向王崇伦学习些什么呢？
    首先，应该学习王崇伦的劳动态度，学习他对待国家计划的主人翁的责任心。鞍钢机械总厂工具车间制造凿岩机零件时，插床生产能力很小，老是压着活干不完，做出来的活质量也不好，下几道工序却老是等着插床送活去干，以致常常完不成生产计划。在这种情况下，王崇伦并不像有些人那样，认为“设备不够，那是工厂的事，要改进工具，那是技术人员的事，都不是自己的事”。王崇伦认识到：如果制造凿岩机零件的计划完不成，就影响了采矿；矿石采不出来，又会使炼铁、炼钢完不成国家的计划。他也认识到：如果本厂的产品质量不好，拿到矿山去一使用就会出毛病，那就会耽误生产。于是他非常爱惜每秒钟每分钟的工作时间，注意加强机器的维护工作，并且积极想办法创造工具，克服设备不平衡的困难，增加产量，提高质量，终于超额全面完成了计划。我们应该学习王崇伦的，正是这种积极为国家的利益打算，正确地处理自己的工作和国家计划的关系，积极贡献出智慧和力量来争取提前全面完成国家计划的社会主义的劳动态度。
    第二，我们应该学习王崇伦注意掌握技术、不断钻研技术和改进技术的精神。有一些人，平时不注意提高技术，为了完成生产任务，只知单纯依靠加班加点、提高劳动强度、进行片面突击，结果，往往引起生产中一连串的恶果。而王崇伦与此相反，他能注意掌握技术，严格遵守操作规程，熟练地使用机器，充分发挥机器的能力，并且在这个基础之上动脑筋、找窍门，不断改进技术。他创造了刨床的“万能工具胎”之后，使原来在插床上要两点半钟才能做一个的卡动器，在刨床上只要四十五分钟就能做出了，但他并不因此就满足起来，接着又提高了刨床的冲程，之后又改变了刀头和缩短了空刀的时间，使刨床上作一个卡动器的时间，从四十五分钟又缩短到十九分钟。而且保证了质量。学习王崇伦这种积极钻研技术和不断改进技术的精神，在今天有着特别重要的意义。因为它可以进一步改进现有厂矿的设备，也可以帮助我们更迅速地掌握新的技术设备，以便不断地提高劳动生产率。而劳动生产率的增长，又可以使人民的物质和文化生活水平提高得更快。
    第三，我们应该学习王崇伦虚心向别人学习和积极帮助别人的精神，学习他对同志的团结互助精神。王崇伦在创造“万能工具胎”当中遇到了不少困难，但他能虚心向别人请教，取得技术员和其他技术工人的帮助。同时，他也帮助磨床工人崔俊山延长了卡具，使原来一次磨一个的活，改进为一次磨六个。王崇伦对于徒工的帮助也是很积极的。他这种对待同志不骄傲，不保守的精神，他这种团结、互助的精神，是工人阶级很可贵的精神，是每个职工都应该努力学习的。
    每一个企业的党、行政、工会和青年团组织，也都应该从王崇伦的创举中取得很宝贵的经验和教训。王崇伦的创举告诉我们：企业的党、行政、工会和青年团组织，应该注意加强对职工的社会主义教育，目前，更应该加强党在过渡时期的总路线的教育，以提高职工的阶级觉悟。王崇伦的先进事迹，是他在提高了阶级觉悟的基础上才产生的。他在没有提高觉悟以前，也曾在工作中闹过情绪，旷过三天工，但党教育了他，提高了他的觉悟，使他看见了工人阶级的伟大前途和国家建设的美妙远景，使他找到了自己努力奋斗的目标，于是他积极起来了，并且在党的不断教育和鼓励下，创造了一系列的先进事迹。事实证明：企业的党、行政、工会和青年团，必须坚持不懈地加强对职工的社会主义教育，才能提高职工的阶级觉悟。使他们为实现党在过渡时期的总路线奋斗。
    王崇伦的创举和这个创举所发生的影响告诉我们：广大职工的技术改进和合理化建议，是改进企业的新生力量，是突破旧的生产水平，促进劳动生产率不断高涨的重要方法。过去，许多厂矿的领导同志重视了职工的合理化建议和技术改进，注意了推广先进经验，都曾经取得过很大的成绩。可是，许多厂矿的领导同志没有把改进技术、处理合理化建议和推广先进经验作为经常工作，没有把已经取得的成绩加以巩固和提高，就使得这方面的工作缺乏经常的领导而形成自流。若干厂矿对于改进技术和推广先进经验的工作，还停留在一般的动员和号召上，缺乏深入细致的组织工作，对于合理化建议也缺乏明确的目的，不是根据生产中的关键问题提出课题，围绕着课题发动大家找窍门来解决，因而这些企业生产的改进也就不大。企业的党、行政、工会和青年团组织，应该从王崇伦的创举中得到教训，必须注意支持企业中新生力量的萌芽，及时处理职工的合理化建议，大力推广主要的先进经验，积极改进技术，根据实际情况广泛开展机械化自动化运动。企业的党、行政、工会和青年团组织，应该把这些工作当作经常的重要工作，以便把职工的积极性和创造性引导到提前全面完成国家计划的轨道上来，努力为提早实现国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗。
