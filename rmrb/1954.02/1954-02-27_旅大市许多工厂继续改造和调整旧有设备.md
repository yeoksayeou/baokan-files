Many state-owned factories in Lüda City plan to continue renovating and adjusting existing equipment this year to further unleash the potential of enterprises and meet the needs of national construction. In order to improve labor productivity and improve the working environment for workers, Dalian Textile Factory and Jinzhou Textile Factory successively installed ventilation equipment last year, and added pneumatic broken-end automatic cotton suction devices to individual spinning frames. According to the calibration of Dalian Textile Factory, after installing cotton suction devices on spinning frames with the same speed, the broken-end rate is reduced by 25% to 30%. This can not only increase the number of spindles a worker can tend and improve the quality of yarn, but also reduce flying lint and make the air in the workshop cleaner. Therefore, Dalian Textile Factory plans to continue installing pneumatic broken-end automatic cotton suction devices on all spinning frames spinning 21-count and 23-count yarn in the first spinning workshop in the first half of this year. Currently, the factory and Jinzhou Textile Factory have started to modify the equipment on the spinning frames. This year, in order to improve the output and quality of Lancashire boilers, Dalian General Machinery Factory will learn the new welding method of Dalian Lifting Machinery Factory, using edge-planing machines to replace pneumatic edge-planing, to mechanize the edge-planing process at the joints of boiler skins; the assembly of boiler cores will also be changed to semi-mechanization. The Second Glass Factory also plans, on the basis of renovating existing equipment last year, to further mechanize and automate all production and handling work in the raw material workshop, using machines to replace manual mixing of various raw materials, and to make the production process arrangement more rational. Dalian Paint Factory has decided to change the manual packaging in the second workshop to mechanized packaging this year, change the manual mixing in the fourth workshop to machine mixing, change the manual crushing and loading of raw materials in the second workshop to mechanization, and also add some dust removal equipment.

The arrangement of equipment in the Dalian Machine Tool Factory is now "machine-group style" (that is, the same types of lathes are concentrated together), which hinders the exertion of the potential of existing equipment. For example, if the foreman of the first mechanical workshop wants to master a certain part, he has to walk through several workshops. Because the equipment arrangement is unreasonable, product parts are scattered everywhere and not concentrated, and the phenomenon of parts traveling back and forth is also very serious. This prolongs the production cycle. In addition, some equipment in the factory is not used rationally. For example, some machine tools with large production capacity have very small loads in a certain workshop, but the workshop in need does not have such equipment. Dalian Machine Tool Factory plans to readjust existing equipment in the first half of this year. According to preliminary estimates, the processing operation line will be greatly shortened after the reorganization. For example, to make chucks, the past processing operation line was 480 meters, but after the reorganization it can be shortened to 64 meters, and the production efficiency can be increased by at least 50%. Dalian Motor Factory will also make similar improvements this year.

### 旅大市许多工厂继续改造和调整旧有设备

    旅大市许多工厂继续改造和调整旧有设备
    旅大市许多国营工厂计划在今年继续改造和调整旧有设备，以进一步发挥企业潜力，满足国家建设需要。大连纺织厂和金州纺织厂为提高劳动生产率和改善工人的劳动环境，已在去年先后安装了通风设备，并且在个别细纱机上增设了气流式断头自动吸棉器。据大连纺织厂的标定，同样速度的细纱机安装了吸棉器以后，断头率减少百分之二十五到百分之三十，这样不仅可以增加工人的看锭量和提高纱的质量，而且可以使飞花减少，使车间里的空气更加清洁。因此，大连纺织厂计划在今年上半年继续将第一细纱车间纺二十一支和二十三支纱的细纱机全部安装上气流式断头自动吸棉器。目前该厂和金州纺织厂已开始改装细纱机上的设备。大连通用机器厂今年为提高兰开夏锅炉的产量和质量，将学习大连起重机器厂的新焊接法，用铲边刨床来代替风力铲边，使锅炉皮对口处的铲边过程机械化；装配锅炉芯子也准备改为半机械化。第二玻璃工厂也准备在去年改造旧有设备的基础上，进一步使原料车间的生产和搬运工作全部达到机械化、自动化，用机器来代替人工调合各种原料，并且要使生产工序排列得更加合理。大连油漆厂决定在今年将第二车间的人工包装改为机械化包装，将第四车间的人工混合改为机器混合，将第二车间的原料粉碎和装料由人工改为机械化，还要增设一些吸尘设备。
    大连机床厂的设备现在是“机群式”（即同样种类的车床都集中在一起）的排列法，阻碍了现有设备潜力的发挥。例如第一机械车间的工长要想掌握某一种零件就要走好几个车间。因为设备排列不合理，产品部件分散在各处很不集中，部件往返旅行的现象也很严重。这样便延长了生产周期。另外该厂有些设备运用得也不合理，如有些生产能力大的机床在某个车间负荷很小，但需要的车间却没有这样的设备。大连机床厂准备在今年上半年将现有设备重新加以调整。据初步估计，改组后加工作业线将大大缩短，如做卡盘活，过去的加工作业线是四百八十公尺，改组后可以缩短到六十四公尺，最低可提高生产效率百分之五十。大连电机厂今年也要做类似的改进。
