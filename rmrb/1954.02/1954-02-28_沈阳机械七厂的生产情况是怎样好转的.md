How the Production Situation at Shenyang No. 7 Machinery Factory Improved
    Zhang Shufa, Wen Tianshen

    In the first half of last year, the Shenyang No. 7 Machinery Factory failed to fully achieve the state plan due to the factory leadership's lack of a perspective that relied on the entire working class to improve the enterprise, poor integration of political and economic work, inconsistent thinking and working pace among various leading cadres, and planning management becoming a mere formality, leading to prolonged irregular production. In July of last year, after the factory inspected and implemented the resolutions of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the execution of the urban work conference, the leadership's thinking began to shift. In mid-September of last year, with the in-depth assistance of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee's Increased Production and Economy Inspection Team, the thinking of the leading cadres was unified, thereby enabling the entire factory to carry out an increased production and economy campaign based on strengthened planning management. The October production completed the state plan and increased production and economy tasks one day ahead of schedule. In November, the original plan was exceeded by completing ten air compressors. In total, the planned increase in production and economy for the entire last year was 51 billion yuan, and the actual completion was 53.177 billion yuan, exceeding the target by 2.177 billion yuan.

    Why did the No. 7 Machinery Factory have such a big change in production?

    First, the understanding of the policy of increased production and economy and the potential of the factory were clarified, and the leadership's thinking was unified. In September of last year, some leading cadres of the factory, based on the principle of combining production and sales, proposed to change the originally planned ten 52-horsepower air compressors with poor sales in the fourth quarter into ten 100-horsepower air compressors with good sales and high value, and 200 pneumatic picks. Some cadres advocated increasing the production of products that were easy to manufacture. Due to the inconsistency of leadership thinking, they reviewed the completion of various indicators of the entire factory from January to August of last year. As a result of the key research and analysis of several indicators, although the total value of goods and the total value of production had completed the plan, the task of product variety had not been completed.

    Why could the product variety task not be completed? First of all, the equipment utilization rate was only 61 percent. The low equipment utilization rate was due to waiting for materials, waiting for tasks, waiting for tools, and frequent machine tool and personal accidents. From January to August of last year, a total of more than 136,000 work hours were lost, which is equivalent to producing 71 fewer 52-horsepower air compressors. Secondly, there were many defective products. From January to August, the average defect rate reached 16.99 percent, resulting in a loss of more than 13 billion yuan, which is equivalent to producing 47 fewer 100-horsepower air compressors. And the defective products were never recovered and reprocessed on a monthly basis, which also affected the completion of the cost plan. Furthermore, the consumption quotas for raw materials and tools were ignored. The workshops requisitioned materials at will, resulting in the accumulation of funds. In addition, tools and consumables were wasted a lot. Some workshops had fewer large machine tools and more small machine tools, and the production of parts was not balanced. Therefore, the product plan from January to July of last year was not completed. After everyone's research and analysis, the leading cadres of the factory began to clarify the factory's potential and the key issues in production, and also had a direction for increased production and economy. With unified leadership thinking, everyone unanimously decided to increase production according to the needs of the country, and meticulously calculated that the factory could save a lot in many aspects in the fourth quarter. Everyone believed that if the entire factory first reduced the defect rate by another 3 percent; strictly adopted the method of timely recovery of defective products in saving raw materials, and repaired and utilized the old tools; and increased the equipment utilization rate by 5 to 10 percent from reducing intermittent work hours, etc.; coupled with tightening various management expenses, etc. In this way, a total of more than 8.3 billion yuan could be saved for the country in the fourth quarter, which is equivalent to two-thirds of the plan for the first three quarters of last year.

    Second, go deep into the workshops, mobilize the workers, solve the key to production, formulate an increased production and economy plan, and establish and improve the group system. After receiving the increased production and economy targets, each workshop checked the problems existing in production according to the specific situation, initially formulated an increased production and economy plan, and opened increased production and economy training classes with party members, youth league members, propagandists, group leaders, and key members, and started to cultivate typical groups. During the discussion of the plan, the workers put forward 73 "tricks" at that time, solving the problem of the shortage of 25,600 work hours for fitters in the fourth quarter. Many groups have formulated practical guarantee measures by analyzing the reasons for defective products and intermittent work hours in the past three quarters. For example, the Hao Bingqi group in the Second Workshop researched the reasons why the operating rate of each machine tool was only about 6 hours a day during the discussion of the plan: First, no one was in charge of the tools; second, there was a lack of shift handover system; and third, there was no careful preparation work before production, so workers had to pick up materials and grab tools when producing, which delayed the machine tool's start-up time. In response to the above shortcomings, the group discussed the establishment and improvement of the group work system, and decided to explain clearly during the shift handover so that everyone would be aware of the processing progress, and could start working immediately after taking over; in addition, strict systems were formulated for tool management, machine tool maintenance, and preparation work before production. And the group leader regularly checks the implementation. After the group system was improved in October of last year, the daily machine tool operating rate increased from 6 hours to 7 hours. At the same time, the group carefully checked the production situation of 22 processes, and found that the reasons for the easy occurrence of defective products in the past were: some workers only relied on eyesight to do work without using calipers; some cutting tools were not sharp and were not sharpened, so they just nibbled hard; and some did not pay attention to checking templates on time. Therefore, when the group formulated future improvement methods, it proposed to frequently use calipers to measure work, send it for inspection after finishing the first job, and ensure that the template is measured well by looking at the drawings, and correct the measuring tools with the inspector once every three days, etc. The veteran masters also made the guarantee of "not being a hands-off master". When machining precision parts, the veteran masters would personally do it, so that the defect rate dropped from 2.1 percent to 0.78 percent. In order to ensure the implementation of the system and measures plan, the administrative, trade union, and youth league group leaders have three meeting per week to check the progress in a timely manner and help solve the key problems of the groups separately. Each trade union group also holds a meeting once a week to check the quantity and quality of production. Other groups have proposed a clinical inspection system, and hold technical research conferences on schedule, etc. In this way, 484 "tricks" and rationalization proposals appeared in the entire factory in a very short period of time, greatly boosting the production potential. As a result, the Third Workshop produced 100 more rock drills than originally planned, the Fifth Workshop increased by more than 2 billion yuan more than the original target, and even the weakest Second Workshop produced five more 100-horsepower air compressors than originally planned.

    Third, incorporate the increased production and economy plan into the operation plan and carry out labor competitions. Before October of last year, the factory's planning management work was still very weak. The operation planning team set up by the factory was neither under the production section nor under the workshop leadership, and only engaged in "operation planning" in isolation. Therefore, the plans made were often out of touch with the actual production capacity of the workshops. The various functional sections also lacked sufficient understanding of the operation plan, with unclear responsibilities and inconsistent steps. For example, when the planning section issued production targets, it specified the processing parts for each workshop every month, making it impossible for the production section to carry out scheduling, and the production section only requested tasks according to the issued targets. The phenomenon of uneven production with slackness in the front and tightness in the back was very serious. After September, the past operation planning team was merged into the production section, and a factory director personally led it; at the same time, short-term (ten-day) operation plans were compiled and implemented in the main workshops, and in-process product flow charts were established to accurately grasp the flow and reserve of parts. The increased production figures were incorporated into the operation plan, and the workers were mobilized to formulate progress plans. Each workshop focused on carrying out various forms of competition to ensure the realization of the operation plan. For example, the Fifth Workshop checked the production plan every week through each group, and placed red flags on the machine tools of the groups that completed the task, and conducted monthly evaluations; the Third Workshop adopted the form of an hourly progress board, which not only enabled the workers to understand the progress of the operation plan, but also created conditions for checking the operation plan and ensuring the completion of the operation plan. In the third week of October last year, the Wang Jinsheng group failed to keep up with the progress due to defective oil nozzles. They checked the reasons for the defective products at the group meeting, and improved the pick-ups and adjusted the processing machine tools in time to catch up with the plan progress. In addition, the factory particularly emphasized the work of promoting advanced experience in the implementation of the operation plan. For example, after the Fifth Workshop branch promoted the Xi Lefu drilling method through the trade union and youth league organizations, the productivity of six types of parts increased by two to five times; the Second Workshop (the most critical workshop) actively promoted the "magical planing method" in the large planer process, so that the work that originally required two or three planing cuts can now be done with one cut. The amount of cut was 7 or 8 li in the past, but now it reaches 20 li, increasing the output by one to two times. As a result of the combination of promoting advanced experience and the operation plan, the Second Workshop not only reversed the phenomenon of monthly emptiness in the past, but also was able to accumulate a certain amount of complete set of parts reserves.

    In addition, the work of each functional section and share has been strengthened. Once, when the production section was compiling the operation plan, it found that the parts produced in the next two months were not balanced, so it took the initiative to research with the leadership, and it was solved after adjusting the equipment in the factory. The supply and marketing section improved the raw material quota, ensured the timely supply of materials to the workshops, and actively strengthened ordering work with other factories in order to solve the problem of too much waste material in the Second Workshop's processing of connecting rods. The equipment section also formulated machine tool maintenance procedures, and appraised the machine tools and formulated a repair plan.

    With the specific assistance of the Municipal Party Committee Inspection Team, the No. 7 Machinery Factory closely combined the increased production and economy competition with planning management, and initially comprehensively improved production leadership. This ensured that the factory completed and overfulfilled the annual production tasks, and also further improved the technical management and production management level of the factory, laying the foundation for future production work.

    沈阳机械七厂的生产情况是怎样好转的
    张树发　文天申
    沈阳机械七厂在去年上半年，由于厂的领导上缺乏依靠全体工人阶级搞好企业的观点，政治和经济工作结合得不好，加以各个领导干部的思想和工作步调不一致，计划管理流于形式，生产长期不正规，不能全面均衡地完成国家计划。去年七月份该厂经过检查贯彻中共中央东北局城工会议决议执行情况，领导思想开始有了转变。去年九月中旬，在中共沈阳市委增产节约检查组的深入帮助下，统一了领导干部的思想，从而使全厂在加强计划管理的基础上开展了增产节约竞赛。十月份的生产就提前一天完成了国家计划和增产节约任务。十一月超过原计划完成空气压缩机十台。总计去年全年增产节约计划为五百一十亿元，实际完成了五百三十一亿七千万元。超额完成了二十一亿七千万元。
    机械七厂在生产上为什么会有这个大转变呢？
    第一、明确认识增产节约的政策和工厂的潜力，统一了领导思想。去年九月间，该厂有的领导干部根据产销结合的方针，主张把原准备在第四季度增产十台销路不好的五十二马力的空气压缩机，改为十台销路好、价值大的一百马力空气压缩机和两百台风铲，有的干部却主张增产好做的产品。领导思想不一致，因此他们就复查了去年一到八月份全厂各项指标的完成情况。几项指标重点研究分析的结果，商品总值和生产总值虽已完成计划，但产品种类的任务却没有完成。
    产品种类任务为什么不能完成呢？首先是设备运用率只有百分之六十一。设备运用率低是待料，待任务，待工具和经常发生机床人身事故等所致。从去年一月到八月共损失了十三万六千多工时，等于少生产五十二马力的空气压缩机七十一台。其次是废品多，一到八月的废品率平均达百分之十六点九九，损失一百三十多亿元，等于少生产一百马力的空气压缩机四十七台。而所出的废品从没有按月收回再生产，这样也就影响了成本计划的完成。再就是忽视原材料和工具消耗定额。车间生产随便领料，造成资金积压。另外，工具和消耗用品浪费很大，有的车间大机床少小机床多，生产部件也不均衡，因而去年一到七月的产品计划没有完成。经过大家研究分析，该厂的领导干部们开始明确了工厂的潜力和生产上的关键问题，对增产节约也有了方向。领导思想统一了，大家就一致决定按国家的需要来增产，并细致地计算出全厂第四季度可以节约的方面很多，数目也不少。大家认为：要是全厂首先将废品率再降低百分之三；在节约原材料上严格采用废品及时回收的办法，并把过去的废工具重新修配利用；而从减少间断工时等方面也可提高设备运用率百分之五到十；加上紧缩各项管理费用等等。这样总计第四季度就能为国家节约八十三亿多元，这个数字等于去年前三季度计划的三分之二。
    第二、深入车间，发动职工，解决生产关键，订出增产节约计划，建立和健全小组制度。各车间接到增产节约指标后，都根据具体情况检查了生产中存在的问题，初步订出增产节约计划，并开办了有党员、团员、宣传员、小组长、骨干分子的增产节约训练班和着手培养典型小组。在讨论计划中，工人们当时就提出了七十三个“窍门”，解决了第四季度钳工缺少二万五千六百个工时的问题。很多小组都通过分析上三个季度中出废品，间断工时的原因，制订出切实的保证措施。例如二车间郝炳琦小组，在讨论计划中就研究出每台机床一天开动率只有六小时左右的原因：首先是工具没人管，其次是缺少交接班制度，第三是生产前没有周密的准备工作，因此工人生产时就得现拾料，乱抓工具，拖迟了机床开动的时间。小组针对上述缺点，讨论了建立和健全小组工作制度，决定在交接班时，要交代清楚，以便使大家对加工进度心中有数，接班后就可立即干活；此外在工具保管、机床检修、生产前准备工作上都订了严密的制度。并经常由小组长检查执行情况。去年十月份健全了小组制度后，每天机床的开动率就由六小时提高到七小时了。同时，该小组又仔细地检查了二十二道工序的生产情况，找出了过去容易出废品的原因是：有的工人干活单凭眼力，不用卡钳；有的刃具不快也不磨，就硬啃；还有的不注意按时检查样板。因此小组在制订今后改进办法时，就提出勤用卡钳量活，做完头一个活就送检查，同时保证看图纸把样板量好，每三天和检查员对正一次量具等。老师傅们也提出“不当甩手师傅”的保证，在车制精密部件时老师傅就亲自动手，这样使废品率由百分之二点一降低到零点七八。为保证制度和措施计划的实施，行政、工会、青年团小组长每周有三次碰头会，及时检查进度，分头帮助解决小组的关键问题。各工会小组每周也召开一次会议检查产量质量问题。其他小组有提出临床检查制度，和按期举办技术研究会等。这样，全厂在很短时间内就出现了四百八十四件“窍门”和合理化建议，大大发挥了生产潜力。结果，三车间比原计划多增产一百台凿岩机，五车间比原指标多增了二十多亿元，连过去最薄弱的二车间也比原计划增产了五台一百马力的空气压缩机。
    第三，把增产节约计划纳入作业计划中，开展劳动竞赛。去年十月以前该厂计划管理工作还很薄弱，厂部所设的作业计划组，不属生产科也不属车间领导，只是孤立地搞“作业计划”，因此作出的计划经常和车间的实际生产能力脱节。各职能科对作业计划的认识也不足，职责不清，步调不一致。如计划科下达生产指标时把各车间每月的加工部件都给以指定，使生产科无法进行调度，而生产科也只是按照下达的指标要任务，生产上前松后紧的不均衡现象很严重。九月后，把过去的作业计划组并入生产科，由一位厂长亲自领导；同时在主要车间编制和贯彻短期（旬）的作业计划，建立在制品流动指示图表，确切地掌握部件流动和储备情况，把增产的数字编入作业计划中去，并发动工人订出进度计划。各车间就以开展各种不同的竞赛形式为中心，保证作业计划的实现。如五车间就是通过各小组每周检查生产计划，将红旗插在完成任务的小组的机床上，按月进行评比；三车间采用了小时进度板的形式，这样不仅使工人了解作业计划的进度，也给检查作业计划创造了条件，保证作业计划的完成。去年十月份第三周上，王金声小组由于油嘴子出废品，没跟上进度，他们就在小组会上检查出废品的原因，及时改进了挑扣，调整了加工机床，赶上了计划进度。另外，该厂在贯彻作业计划中特别强调了推广先进经验的工作。如五车间支部通过工会、青年团组织推广了席乐夫钻孔法后，就有六种部件提高生产率二倍到五倍；二车间（关键性最大的车间）积极地在大刨床工序推广了“奇妙的刨削法”，使原来要刨两三刀的活现在刨一刀就行了，以前吃刀量是七、八糎，现在达到二十糎，使产量提高了一倍到二倍。推广先进经验和作业计划结合的结果，二车间不仅扭转了以前月月空的现象，并已能够积存一定的成套零件储备量了。
    另外，各职能科股的工作也都加强了。有一次，生产科在编制作业计划时，发现下两个月生产的部件不均衡，就主动和领导上研究，经调整厂内设备后，得到解决。供销科搞好原材料定额后，保证车间材料的及时供应，并为了解决二车间加工联杆废料太多的问题，就积极加强了和其他厂进行订货的工作。设备科也制订了机床维护规程，并对机床作了鉴定，订出了检修计划。
    机械七厂在市委检查组的具体帮助下，把增产节约竞赛和计划管理工作紧密结合，初步全面地改进了生产领导。这样就保证了该厂完成和超额完成了全年生产任务，同时也进一步提高了该厂技术管理和生产管理的水平，给今后生产工作奠定了基础。
