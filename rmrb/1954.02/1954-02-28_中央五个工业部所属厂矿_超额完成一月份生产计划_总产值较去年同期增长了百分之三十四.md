    [This newspaper dispatch] The various industrial ministries of the Central People's Government paid timely attention to pre-production preparations, focused on worker attendance, continued to implement planned management, and promoted operational plans, exceeding the January production plan for this year. According to the January "Telegraphic Express" statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the total output value plan completed by the central Ministries of Heavy Industry, Fuel Industry, First Ministry of Machine Building, Light Industry, and Textile Industry in January was 106.6%, an increase of 34% compared to the same period last year. The completion of the total output value plan by each industrial ministry in January is as follows: Ministry of Heavy Industry was 107.4%, Ministry of Fuel Industry was 105.4%, First Ministry of Machine Building was 111.1%, Ministry of Textile Industry was 104.5%, and Ministry of Light Industry was 106.1%. In terms of 24 major products, 21 products, including electricity, raw coal, pig iron, steel, rolled steel products, metal cutting machine tools, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, automobile tires, and cigarettes, completed or exceeded the plan, while only three products, including ammonium sulfate, crude oil, and gasoline, did not complete the plan.
    However, according to inspections by the central industrial ministries, the January production situation was uneven. For example, 20% of the enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry did not complete the production plan; 12.6% of the enterprises under the Ministry of Fuel Industry did not complete the plan; 25% of the enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building did not complete the plan; 10.9% of the enterprises under the Ministry of Textile Industry did not complete the plan; and 18.9% of the enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry did not complete the plan. From the perspective of some enterprises themselves, the phenomenon of production imbalance is also significant. For example, the daily output of the Fushun Coal Mine sometimes is high, sometimes low, differing by more than twofold. The daily output of the Kailuan Coal Mine sometimes differs by nearly fourfold, and the daily output of the Fuxin Coal Mine sometimes differs by more than twofold. In addition, some enterprises experienced relatively serious equipment and personal accidents in January, especially in coal mines and non-ferrous metal enterprises. The equipment maintenance work in various enterprises is also very poor. For example, newly built power stations in Xi'an, Urumqi, Fushun, Fengman, Fuxin, and other regions have experienced equipment accidents of varying degrees during commissioning. Some enterprises still have poor raw material supply; the tunneling in some mines cannot keep up with the needs of production. Some enterprises have not signed order contracts with relevant departments in a timely manner, resulting in some enterprises having no production tasks, and some enterprises having product backlogs.
    In order to complete and exceed the first quarter production plan, strive to ensure that the first quarter production this year is no lower than the level of the fourth quarter of last year, and lay a reliable foundation for the balanced completion and overfulfillment of this year's annual plan, enterprises should make great efforts in March to further strengthen the management of production enterprises, continue to promote operational plans, strengthen scheduling work; pay attention to equipment maintenance and repair, strengthen technical organizational measures, ensure safe production, improve product quality, and increase attendance rates; seize the signing of order contracts, and ensure the supply of raw materials; in the mining departments, special attention should be paid to production geology and tunneling work. In March, in addition to ensuring the completion and exceeding of the first quarter production plan, enterprises should also prepare for the second quarter production and lay a good foundation for the second quarter production. All enterprises should pay special attention to cost and financial work to ensure the completion of the cost and financial plans.

    中央五个工业部所属厂矿
    超额完成一月份生产计划
    总产值较去年同期增长了百分之三十四
    【本报讯】中央人民政府各工业部，及时地注意了生产前的准备工作，抓紧了工人的出勤工作，并继续贯彻了计划管理，推行了作业计划，超额完成了今年一月份的生产计划。根据国家统计局的一月份“电讯快报”统计，中央重工业部、燃料工业部、第一机械工业部、轻工业部、纺织工业部等一月份完成总产值计划总计为百分之一百零六点六，较去年同期增长了百分之三十四。一月份各工业部完成总产值计划情况如下：重工业部为百分之一百零七点四，燃料工业部为百分之一百零五点四，第一机械工业部为百分之一百十一点一，纺织工业部为百分之一百零四点五，轻工业部为百分之一百零六点一。如果按二十四种主要产品来说，电力、原煤、生铁、钢、钢压延品、金属切削机床、棉纱、棉布、汽车外胎、卷烟等二十一种产品完成和超额完成了计划，只有硫铵、石油原油、汽油等三种产品没有完成计划。
    但是，根据中央各工业部的检查，发现一月份生产情况是不均衡的。如重工业部有百分之二十的企业未完成生产计划；燃料工业部有百分之十二点六的企业未完成计划；第一机械工业部有百分之二十五的企业未完成计划；纺织工业部有百分之十点九的企业未完成计划；轻工业部有百分之十八点九的企业未完成计划。从某些企业本身来说，生产的不平衡现象也是显著的，如抚顺煤矿日产量，有时高，有时低，相差一倍多，开滦煤矿日产量有时相差近四倍，阜新煤矿日产量有时也相差一倍多。另外，有些企业在一月份设备和人身事故还是比较严重的，特别是在煤矿和有色金属企业。各企业对设备的维护工作也很差，如西安、乌鲁木齐、抚顺、丰满、阜新等地区新建的电站，在通行中都或轻或重地发生了设备事故。有些企业原材料供应工作还不好；有些矿山的掘进还赶不上生产的需要。有些企业由于没有及时和有关部门签订订货合同，因而有的企业还没有生产任务，有的企业又产生了产品积压的现象。
    为了完成和超额完成第一季度生产计划，力争今年第一季度生产不低于去年第四季度的水平，并为均衡地完成和超过今年年度计划打下可靠的基础，在三月份各企业还应作极大努力，进一步加强生产企业管理工作，继续推行作业计划，加强调度工作；注意设备的维护检修，加强技术组织措施，保证安全生产，提高产品质量，提高出勤率；抓紧签订订货合同，保证原材料供应；在采掘部门应特别加强生产地质和掘进工作。三月份，各企业除保证完成和超过第一季度生产计划外，还应为第二季度的生产作好准备，给第二季度的生产打下良好基础。各企业特别要注意成本、财务工作，以保证完成成本财务计划。
