    Overcoming the Work Style of Taking on Everything and Strengthening the Party's Political and Ideological Leadership
    Zhu Weihua, Secretary of the CPC Datong Municipal Committee
    (I)
    How party organizations should lead economic work is an important question posed to the Party as the nation enters a period of planned construction. Malenkov's "Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) to the Nineteenth Party Congress" and the Soviet Union's Slepov's "On Bolshevik Methods of Leading Economic Organs" have given us great enlightenment in solving this problem. The experience of Factory 53 has provided us with a vivid model for learning. For more than ten months, we have been working in this area and have achieved certain results.
    First, we have initially overcome the subjectivism of blindly rushing forward in capital construction and the complacency and conservatism in production. At the beginning of 1953, after hearing rumors that Datong City was one of the key construction projects of the country, without clarifying the construction plan, our city absorbed a large number of long-term construction workers and recruited engineering and technical personnel, resulting in a relatively long period of idleness and waste. In addition, everyone underestimated the potential of existing enterprises, believing that "potential has been exhausted, and all the tricks have been found," and if the production plan was not completed well in the first half of the year, they doubted the accuracy of the plan and pinned their hopes on revising the plan. The Party committee led everyone to constantly study and conduct criticism and self-criticism, gradually establishing the correct guiding ideology of focusing on key construction, advancing steadily, giving full play to the potential of existing enterprises, and accumulating funds for the country.
    Secondly, we launched a struggle against bureaucracy, exposing the serious ideas of factory and mine leading cadres who did not rely on the working class and the resulting phenomenon of workers' distrust of leaders; exposing the unclear division of responsibilities between superiors and subordinates, left and right in administrative management, the leaders taking on everything or taking on without handling, the subordinates not being responsible or not daring to be responsible, and the resulting mutual buck-passing, bureaucratic correspondence, and many problems without anyone solving them. At the same time, we inspected, solved problems, and established systems, which greatly deepened the leadership work of factories and mines, significantly reduced the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and further strengthened the relationship between leaders and the masses.
    Thirdly, in conjunction with the transmission of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, we criticized the liberal and tailism thinking among cadres, conducted universal education on labor discipline among employees, commended advanced figures and advanced ideas among the masses, criticized backward ideas, and educated backward figures, initially reversing the phenomenon of lax labor discipline, and greatly improving the attendance rate. For example, the attendance rate of the Third Mine of Datong Mining Bureau increased from 91.73 percent to 93.79 percent. Throughout the city, many models of observing labor discipline have emerged. Various factories and mines have also conducted systematic education on safety regulations and operating procedures in the production increase and economy campaign to further consolidate labor discipline.
    For more than ten months, we have not only combined the central work of each different period (such as discussing the national plan, strengthening plan management, technical management, establishing responsibility systems, and the production increase and economy campaign, etc.) to carry out and carry out the above-mentioned major tasks, but also put forward different political tasks according to different central work, so that economic work and political work are closely integrated. For example, in the production increase and economy campaign, we launched a struggle against empiricism to ensure that the production increase and economy campaign developed healthily under the guideline of relying on the working class, improving enterprise management, putting forward rationalization proposals, promoting advanced experience, and creating favorable conditions for production in 1954, opposing the relaxation of improving enterprise management and relying on increasing labor intensity, regardless of production preparation work, and even shortening the life of machines to exchange for quantity to complete the task.
    The strengthening of political and ideological leadership has played a clear role in economic work. Since July last year, the production situation has gradually improved, especially since the production increase and economy campaign was launched, the major factories and mines have overfulfilled their plans every month, and Datong Power Plant has comprehensively, evenly, safely, and overfulfilled its plan.
    (II)
    The reason why the Party's political and ideological work has achieved the above-mentioned achievements is inseparable from our continuous opposition to the Party organization's work style of taking on everything. It is mainly manifested in the unclear distinction between the Party's work and administrative work and the work of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, with the Party replacing the government and taking on administrative work. The result of this leadership method is: First, the leading cadres of the Party organization are entangled in administrative work all day long and cannot get out, working hard and busy, unable to consider principles, policies, and other major issues, weakening or relaxing the Party's political and ideological leadership; Second, the initiative and enthusiasm of administrative work cadres are weakened, and dependence is fostered; Third, the trade union and the Communist Youth League naturally do too much administrative work, relaxing mass work. Under this leadership method, the roles that the Party, administration, trade union, and the Communist Youth League should play are weakened.
    In the process of opposing the work style of taking on everything, we have also encountered a lot of resistance and difficulties. Some comrades believe that this leadership method is good and easy to do. However, they do not understand that this violates the basic principle of the Party's leadership in economic construction, that is, the principle of clearly dividing the functions between the Party and economic organs. They also do not understand that only when the Party organization unifies the guiding ideology and work steps of each system can it give full play to the role of each organizational system, so that the energy will be greater and the strength will be stronger; on the contrary, if the Party takes on everything, the role of each organizational system cannot be played, and the energy of work will never be great, and the strength will never be sufficient. Some comrades do not support this leadership style, but oppose the universal strengthening of political and ideological leadership. They believe that political and ideological leadership is only needed for backward departments, workshops, and people, and is superfluous for advanced units. They have not yet realized in their actual work what is the crux of the reason why some advanced units and people cannot continue to move forward; nor do they understand that "any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology is an increase in the influence of bourgeois ideology. We must always remember that any weakening of the influence of socialist ideology is an increase in the influence of bourgeois ideology." (Malenkov: "Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) to the Nineteenth Party Congress," page 92) Some comrades believe that this leadership style should be opposed, but they do not know how to carry out political and ideological leadership. Some staff members of Party organizations believe that not replacing administrative work means that they can ignore mastering and understanding economic work; administrative staff members believe that political and ideological work is the business of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and has nothing to do with themselves. They do not understand that "in life, in practice, politics and economics are inseparable. They exist together and function together. Whoever wants to separate economics and politics in our practical work, to strengthen economic work at the expense of weakening political work, or vice versa, to strengthen political work at the expense of weakening economic work, he must fall into a dead end." (Stalin: "On the Shortcomings of Party Work and the Methods of Eliminating Trotskyite Double-Dealers and Other Double-Dealers," page 42)
    (III)
    In order to solve the problem of how the Party should lead economic work, we first divided the different responsibilities of the Party and economic organs. The Party should lead economic work, but not directly manage economic affairs, but use strengthening political and ideological leadership to ensure and supervise the completion and over-completion of the national plan and the correct implementation of the Party's policies in economic organs, and correctly select cadres and lead the trade union and the Communist Youth League. According to our experience, the Party should grasp the following key links in strengthening political and ideological work in economic work, namely: unifying thinking and unifying steps; mobilizing the masses to carry out labor competitions; regularly checking work and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and criticizing various erroneous ideas and work styles.
    In order to ensure the victorious completion of the national construction plan, unifying the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League's understanding of the national plan and the pace of implementing the plan is an important issue. Everyone's initial understanding of the tasks assigned by the state is often inconsistent. For example, when launching a production increase and economy campaign, some people think it is "asking for money and food"; some people think that "potential has been exhausted, and all the tricks have been found," and there are many difficulties, and to complete the task, it is necessary to rush production. This shows that the most easily divided opinions are on the significance, purpose, conditions for completing the task, and the principles and policies for completing the task of each task. Therefore, the task of the Party organization is first to enable the leading cadres of each system to reach a consensus on these issues. The Third Mine of Datong Mining Bureau and other units provided a method for solving this problem: When discussing the national plan, the Third Mine first studied the documents, and then, according to the spirit of the documents and the specific situation of the mine, raised questions, launched discussions, found the key, thought of solutions, and on this basis, convened the Party general branch committee to unify everyone's understanding. According to their experience, in order to unify thinking and unify steps, it is necessary to plan to organize the study of the Party's line, policies, and work guidelines, expose and criticize all deviations and errors in thinking and action that deviate from the Party's line, policies, and work guidelines, and then formulate work plans on this basis, and transmit them from top to bottom, first within the Party and then outside the Party, first cadres and then the masses. Whether it is guiding the central work of each period, implementing the Party's policies, or checking and summarizing work, this method should be adopted.
    Mobilizing the masses to carry out labor competitions is an extremely important task to ensure the completion of national tasks. In mobilizing the masses, understanding and solving the masses' ideological problems is a primary link. When the Third Mine of Datong Mining Bureau mobilized workers to discuss and revise quotas, it found that workers had the following ideological situations: Some people were dissatisfied with the bureaucracy of the leadership; some people blindly accepted tasks; and some people had antagonistic emotions towards carrying out competitions. These ideological reflections told us that to mobilize the masses, we must first solve three problems, namely: First, we must trust the working masses, which is the premise for gaining the trust of the working masses in the leadership. The workers' dissatisfaction with the leadership is the result of the leadership's distrust of the workers. In response to the call of the superior, our cadres often mobilize workers to find tricks, make criticisms, and make suggestions, but they do not believe in these tricks, criticisms, and suggestions in their thinking, and therefore still adopt a bureaucratic attitude and do not seriously deal with the workers' suggestions and criticisms. Once this happens, and then this happens again, the workers will not trust the leadership, and the leadership will be isolated from the masses. Therefore, to mobilize the masses, we must continuously oppose the bureaucracy of the leadership, firmly establish the idea of relying on the working class, and truly value the workers' inventions, criticisms, and suggestions. Second, whenever a task is put into practice, the nature, significance, purpose, principles, and policies of this task, as well as the favorable and difficult conditions for completing this task, should be widely and deeply publicized and explained to the broad masses of employees. Third, and more importantly, it is necessary to explain in detail the consistency of national interests and individual interests based on the personal experience of the masses. Some units have already paid attention to this issue and have learned to use vivid examples to educate the masses.
    Pay attention to commending the deeds and ideas of advanced figures when mobilizing the masses, set up examples to drive the middle, and at the same time help educate backward aspects. The experience of the Second and Third Mines of Datong Mining Bureau proves that transforming backwardness is a struggle between new and old ideas, and punishment and coercion are of no avail. In work, we must distinguish between backward phenomena and the essence of the working class, find the ideological roots according to their backward manifestations, patiently conduct education, and help them solve practical difficulties, and give appropriate encouragement and commendation as soon as there is progress to increase their confidence and strength. Facts have proved that backward elements can be transformed, and the key lies in whether the Party leadership pays attention to this issue.
    Pay attention to mobilizing engineering and technical personnel and staff when mobilizing the masses. This is a problem that must be solved in the current improvement of enterprise management. Unfortunately, we have not done much work in this area. Some people even only pay attention to the workers in the workshop when they mention mobilizing the masses, and put the engineering and technical personnel and staff outside the "masses." This problem must be solved in the future.
    Checking work is one of the best ways to give play to the Party's guarantee and supervisory role in economic work. Through inspection, we must discover deviations and errors that violate the Party's line, policies, and work guidelines, and give them ruthless exposure and criticism. Through inspection, we must summarize experience and help them overcome difficulties so that work can be continuously improved. However, many comrades do not pay attention to checking work. Some leading cadres are only satisfied with the arrangement of work and do not seriously check it; some, although they have carried out inspections, only give criticism without explaining the reasons, let alone summarizing experience; the cadres who are inspected like to be praised and do not like to accept criticism, and if the facts are slightly different, they are difficult to accept; some Party member cadres who do administrative work are unwilling to accept the Party's inspection and supervision. Obviously, this is all wrong. Therefore, the Party organization must grasp this important link of checking work in its own leadership work. Not only must it check the work of lower-level Party organizations, but also the work of the same-level administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League; not only must it check the problems that occur in the implementation of tasks by the lower level, but also check and discover the shortcomings and errors in its own work, and this point is often not paid attention to; not only must it check from top to bottom, but more importantly, it must mobilize the masses to check from bottom to top. This point is also often not done enough. According to our experience, checking work must be regular and have a certain system, otherwise it will be tight and loose, and problems in work cannot be solved in time. The Third Mine of Datong Mining Bureau lost more than 12,000 tons of coal in 1952. If it could have insisted on a regular inspection system at that time, its errors would not have developed to such a serious extent. The municipal Party committee's work team went down to check work and found many problems in various factories and mines that needed to be solved urgently, many of which had existed for a long time and had not been discovered. These lessons should be accepted.
    We must firmly grasp the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. Because unifying thinking, mobilizing the masses, and checking work are all a process of ideological struggle, and the goal cannot be achieved without struggle. The strengthening of the Party's political and ideological work in the past ten months is inseparable from the development of criticism and self-criticism. However, a few people still have the following erroneous ideas: First, they accept criticism happily and stubbornly persist in errors; Second, achievements are all their own, and errors are all others', or their own errors are caused by objective factors; Third, they require criticisms from the masses to be perfect; Fourth, after opposing coercion and commandism, they dare not criticize their subordinates. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly educate everyone with the principles of Marxism-Leninism, so that everyone understands the significance of criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below, and the attitude towards criticism, and clears the obstacles to carrying out ideological struggle. The Party organization must seriously and earnestly treat criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. Among the 375 criticisms, suggestions, and proposals put forward at the Datong Coal Mine Party Congress, some were criticisms of the Party's leadership. The Party committee accepted the criticisms according to the circumstances and made explanations and dealt with them item by item after the meeting, and the effect was very good. Our experience is that the Party's various meetings are the main places to launch criticism and self-criticism, and the leading cadres and leaders of the local Party leadership take the lead and use this to educate the lower level, and the layers follow suit, which is an important method to carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    克服包办代替作风，加强党的政治思想领导
    中共大同市委书记　朱卫华
    （一）
    党组织如何领导经济工作，是国家进入有计划的建设时期向党提出的一个重要问题。马林科夫“在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”和苏联斯列波夫“论领导经济机关的布尔什维克方法”对我们解决这一问题，给了很大的启示。五三工厂的经验又给我们提供了活的学习榜样。十个多月以来，我们一直在这方面努力，并已取得了一定成绩。
    首先是初步克服了基本建设中的盲目冒进和生产中的自满保守等主观主义。一九五三年初，在听到大同市是国家建设重点之一的传言之后，没有弄清建设计划，我市就大量吸收长期建筑工人和招聘工程技术人员，结果造成了较长期的窝工浪费。另外，大家对现有企业的潜在能力则估计不足，认为“潜力挖光，窍门找尽”，上半年生产计划完成的不好，就怀疑计划的准确性，把希望寄托在修改计划上。党委领导大家不断的学习和不断的开展批评与自我批评，逐渐树立了重点建设、稳步前进、发挥现有企业潜力和为国家积累资金的正确的领导思想。
    其次是开展了反对官僚主义的斗争，揭发了厂矿领导干部严重存在的不依靠工人阶级的思想和由此而产生的工人群众不信任领导的现象；揭发了行政管理中上下、左右职责不清，领导者包办代替或包而不办，被领导者不负责任或不敢负责任，以及由此而产生的互相推诿、公文旅行、问题很多而无人解决等严重的无人负责现象。同时，边检查、边解决、边订制度，使厂矿领导工作大大深入一步，无人负责现象显著减少，领导与群众的关系进一步密切了。
    再次是结合中国工会第七次全国代表大会的传达，批判了干部中的自由主义和尾巴主义思想，在职工中普遍地进行了劳动纪律的教育，表扬了群众中的先进人物和先进思想，批判了落后思想，教育了落后人物，初步扭转了劳动纪律松弛现象，出勤率大大提高。如大同矿务局三矿全矿出勤率由百分之九十一点七三提高到百分之九十三点七九。在全市范围内，出现了不少遵守劳动纪律的模范。各厂矿在增产节约竞赛中又进行了系统的保安规程和操作规程的教育，以进一步巩固劳动纪律。
    十个多月来，我们不但结合着各个不同时期的中心工作（如讨论国家计划，加强计划管理、技术管理，建立责任制及增产节约竞赛等）进行了和进行着上述几项主要的工作，而且根据不同的中心工作，提出不同的政治任务，使经济工作和政治工作紧密结合起来。如在增产节约竞赛中，我们展开了反对经验主义的斗争，保证增产节约竞赛在依靠工人阶级、改善企业管理、提合理化建议、推广先进经验，并为一九五四年生产创造有利条件的方针下健康发展，反对放松改善企业管理而依靠增加劳动强度、不顾生产准备工作甚至用缩短机器寿命以换取数量的办法来完成任务。
    政治思想领导的加强，在经济工作中已起了明显的作用。从去年七月份以来生产情况已逐渐好转，特别是增产节约竞赛开展以来，主要厂矿月月超额完成计划，大同发电厂已全面地均衡地安全地超额完成计划。
    （二）
    党的政治思想工作之所以取得上述成绩是和我们不断地反对党组织的包办代替的作风分不开的。它主要表现在党的工作和行政工作和工会、青年团工作混淆不清，以党代政，包办了行政工作。这种领导方法的结果是：一、党组织的领导干部整天纠缠在行政业务中拔不出来，辛辛苦苦，忙忙碌碌，无法考虑方针、政策及其他重大问题，削弱或放松了党的政治思想领导；二、行政工作干部的主动性和积极性削弱了，滋长了依赖性；三、工会、青年团也就自然地过多地作了行政工作，放松了群众工作。在这种领导方法之下，党、行政、工会、青年团应发挥的作用都被削弱了。
    在反对包办代替作风的过程中，我们也曾遇到不少的抵抗和困难。有的同志认为这种领导方法好，做起来顺手。但是他们不了解这是违反党领导经济建设的基本原则的，即明确划分党和经济机关之间的职能的原则。他们也不了解只有党组织统一了各个系统的领导思想和工作步调，才能充分发挥各组织系统的作用，才能劲头更大，力量更足；相反地，如果党包办一切，各个组织系统的作用都不能发挥，工作的劲头决不会大，力量也决不会足。有些同志虽不拥护这种领导作风，但是反对普遍地加强政治思想领导。他们认为政治思想领导只是对落后的部门、车间、人物才需要，而对先进的单位则是多余的。他们在实际工作中还没有体会到有些先进的单位和人物所以不能继续前进的症结是什么；也不了解“思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。我们必须时刻记住，社会主义思想影响的任何削弱，都是资产阶级思想影响的增强。”（马林科夫：“在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”第九十二页）还有些同志认为这种领导作风应该反对，但对究竟如何进行政治思想领导，则不得要领。有些党组织的工作人员认为不代替行政工作，就是可以不去掌握和了解经济工作；行政工作人员则认为政治思想工作是党、工会、青年团的事，与己无关。他们都不了解“在生活中，在实践中，政治和经济是分不开的。它们两者一同存在，一同起作用。谁想在我们的实际工作中把经济和政治分开，以减弱政治工作为代价来加强经济工作，或者相反地，以减弱经济工作为代价来加强政治工作，那他就一定要陷入绝境。”（斯大林：“论党工作底缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”四十二页）
    （三）
    为了解决党究竟如何领导经济工作的问题，我们首先划分了党和经济机关的不同职责。党要领导经济工作，但并不是直接管理经济事务，而是用加强政治思想领导来保证和监督国家计划的完成和超额完成及党的政策在经济机关中的正确实施，并正确地挑选干部和领导工会、青年团。根据我们的体会，党加强经济工作中的政治思想工作要掌握以下几个环节，即：统一思想，统一步调；发动群众开展劳动竞赛；经常地检查工作和开展批评与自我批评，批判各种错误思想作风。
    为了保证国家建设计划的胜利完成，统一党、行政、工会、青年团对国家计划的认识和执行计划的步调是一个重要的问题。对国家交付的任务，大家最初的认识往往是不一致的。如开展增产节约竞赛时，有人认为这是“要钱要粮”；有人认为“潜力挖光，窍门找尽”，困难重重，要完成任务就须突击生产。这就说明，认识最易分歧的是在对于每一任务的意义、目的、完成任务的条件以及完成任务的方针政策上。所以党组织的任务首先在于使各个系统的领导干部对这些问题取得一致的认识。大同矿务局三矿等单位提供了解决这一问题的方法：三矿在讨论国家计划时，先学习文件，然后根据文件的精神和本矿具体情况，提出问题，展开讨论，找出关键，想出办法，并在这个基础上召开党总支委员会，统一大家的认识。根据他们的经验，为了统一思想，统一步调，就需要有计划地组织学习党的路线、政策以及工作方针，揭露和批判思想上、行动上离开党的路线、政策和工作方针的一切偏向和错误，然后分别在这个基础上制订工作计划，并把它由上到下、先党内后党外，先干部后群众，一直传达下去。无论是指导各个时期的中心工作，贯彻党的政策以及检查和总结工作，都应该采取这种办法。
    发动群众开展劳动竞赛是保证完成国家任务的极其重要的工作。在发动群众时，了解与解决群众的思想问题是一个首要环节。大同矿务局三矿在发动工人讨论修改定额时，发现工人有以下几种思想情况：有些人对领导上的官僚主义不满；有些人盲目接受任务；还有些人对开展竞赛有对抗情绪。这些思想反映，告诉了我们发动群众必须首先解决三个问题，即：一、要信任工人群众，这是取得工人群众信任领导的前提。工人对领导的不满，是领导不信任工人的结果。我们的干部为响应上级号召，常常发动工人找窍门、提批评、提建议，但是他们在思想上并不相信这些窍门、批评和建议，因而还是采取官僚主义的态度，并不认真处理工人的建议、批评。一次如此，再次如此，工人就不信任领导，领导就和群众隔绝了。因之，要发动群众必须不断地反对领导上的官僚主义，切实树立依靠工人阶级的思想，真正重视工人的创造发明、批评、建议。二、每当一件任务付诸实行时，应把这一任务的性质、意义、目的、方针、政策以及完成这一任务的有利条件和困难条件，向广大职工进行广泛深入的宣传解释。三、更重要的是要根据群众的切身体验，详细解释国家利益和个人利益的一致性。有些单位已经注意了这个问题，并学会了用生动活泼的事例教育群众。
    发动群众要注意表扬先进人物的事迹和思想，树立榜样以带动中间，同时帮助教育落后方面。大同矿务局二、三矿的经验证明：改造落后是一场新旧思想的斗争，惩办主义强迫命令是无济于事的。工作中必须分清落后现象与工人阶级的本质，根据其落后表现，寻找思想根源，耐心地进行教育，并帮助其解决实际困难，一有进步即予适当鼓励和表扬，以增长其前进的信心和力量。事实证明落后分子是可以转变的，关键在于党的领导是否注意这一个问题。
    发动群众时要重视发动工程技术人员和职员。这是目前改善企业管理中必须解决的问题，可惜，我们在这方面作的工作不多，甚至有的一提发动群众，就只注意车间工人，而把工程技术人员和职员放到“群众”之外，这个问题今后必须设法解决。
    检查工作是发挥党对经济工作的保证监督作用的最好方式之一。要通过检查，发现违反党的路线政策和工作方针的偏向和错误，并给予无情的揭发与批判。要通过检查，总结经验和帮助其克服困难，使工作不断地提高。但是不少同志对检查工作是不重视的，有的领导干部只满足于工作的布置而不去认真检查；有的虽然进行了检查但只是给予批评而不讲清道理，更不总结经验；被检查的干部则喜欢表扬，不爱接受批评，事实略有出入就碍难接受；有些做行政工作的党员干部不愿接受党的检查和监督，显然，这都是不对的。因此，党组织在自己的领导工作中，必须掌握检查工作这一重要环节。不仅要检查下级党组织的工作，而且要检查同级行政、工会、青年团的工作；不仅要检查下级执行任务中发生的问题，也要检查与发现自己工作中的缺点和错误，而这一点常常是不被注意的；不仅要自上而下的检查，更重要的，还要发动群众自下而上的检查。这一点也常常做得不够。根据我们的经验，检查工作必须经常而且要有一定的制度，否则即会忽紧忽松，不能及时解决工作中的问题。大同矿务局三矿一九五二年亏煤一万二千多吨，当时如能坚持经常的检查制度，则其错误就不会发展到如此严重。市委工作组下去检查工作，发现了各厂矿许多急待解决的问题，其中好多是长期存在而未被发现的。这些教训都是应该接受的。
    必须紧紧掌握批评与自我批评这一个武器。因为统一思想，发动群众，检查工作，都是一个思想斗争过程，没有斗争是达不到目的的。十个多月来党的政治思想工作的加强是和批评与自我批评的开展分不开的。但是，少数人还存在着以下几种错误思想：一、痛快地接受批评，顽强地坚持错误；二、成绩都是自己的，错误都是别人的，或者自己的错误是客观造成的；三、要求来自群众的批评十全十美；四、反对强迫命令后，对下不敢进行批评。因此，必须经常用马克思列宁主义的原则教育大家，使大家了解批评与自我批评、特别是自下而上的批评的意义和对待批评的态度，扫清开展思想斗争的障碍。党组织要严肃认真地对待批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。大同煤矿党代表大会上提出的三百七十五件批评建议和提案中有一部分是批评党的领导的，党委分别情况接受了批评，会后并件件作了交代和处理，效果很好。我们的经验是：党的各种会议是展开批评与自我批评的主要场所，而当地党的领导机关干部和领导带头，并以之教育下级，层层仿行，是开展批评与自我批评的重要方法。
