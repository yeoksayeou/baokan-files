    Developing Southwest Highways
    Zhang Guangpu
    In order to adapt to national construction, meet the needs of urban and rural material exchanges, and help minority areas develop their economies and cultures, the Southwest region, in the four years since liberation, has not only vigorously restored the Sichuan-Shaanxi, Sichuan-Hunan, Sichuan-Yunnan, Sichuan-Guizhou, and Sichuan-Xikang highways, but also carried out large-scale highway construction. Investment in highway construction in 1953 increased more than eleven times compared to 1950, when the area was first liberated. According to statistics at the end of 1952, the total mileage of roads open to traffic in the Southwest region had increased from more than 8,000 kilometers in 1950 to more than 20,000 kilometers. In 1953, the region built 23 new highways, with a total length of about 2,000 kilometers. Eighty percent of the newly built highways are in minority areas. The increasingly developed southwest highways will connect the Kangzang Plateau, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and the high mountain areas along the edge of Sichuan with the interior. The investment in highway construction in 1954 is still very large, and many multi-year projects are continuing. The Kangzang Highway has been extended to more than 400 kilometers west of Qamdo and is extending westward towards Lhasa. The Chengdu-Aba Highway has been opened to traffic to Zhegushan, and two-thirds of it has been completed. It will soon be extended to the Aba prairie in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province and merge with the Lanzhou-Langmusi Highway (northwestern Sichuan), becoming a transportation artery for the Tibetan people in northwestern Sichuan. In order to cooperate with grain transportation, Sichuan Province will renovate more than 300 kilometers of highways in the main grain-producing areas.
    The Southwest is a mountainous region, and most of the newly built highways are in mountainous areas, making the project exceptionally difficult. The Kangzang Highway is built on the snow-capped Kangzang Plateau; the Chengdu-Aba Highway runs along mountains more than 3,000 meters above sea level, crossing the Minjiang River, Zagunao River, and Dajinchuan River, which are turbulent and swift, and goes straight into the vast prairie that stretches for more than 600 miles; many newly built highways in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces must cross the precipitous cliffs of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and cross countless rapids such as the Wujiang River, Nujiang River, and Lancang River. Those fighting on the Kangzang Highway are on snow-capped mountains where the temperature is twenty or thirty degrees below zero, the cold wind is biting, and the air is thin. They use one hand and one shovel to shovel away the snow, dig away the soil, and hang themselves with ropes on cliffs where they cannot stand, blasting holes to build the highway to Lhasa. When the Chengdu Plain is already warm, the military engineers and civilian workers building the Chengdu-Aba Highway are still working in a world of snow, wearing cotton-padded clothes. In places where they cannot straighten their backs or stand firmly, the workers kneel down to work. Their knees are worn out, and their pants are soaked with blood, but they still persevere to the end. On the Kunming-Daluo Highway, the road-building workers and civilian workers have to pass through areas with hot climates and endemic diseases to build the highway from Kunming to the border of the motherland. The civilian workers building the Fulin-Huili section of the Kangdian Highway said, "Building the road is our own business." During the construction of the Shimian and Dadu River Bridge, one of the most difficult projects on the road, they launched a red flag competition and completed the entire project ten days ahead of schedule. Soldiers and workers also overcame temporary supply difficulties. When the Chengdu-Aba Highway started construction, vegetables could not be supplied, so the soldiers dug wild grass to eat. When tents were lacking, they went to the mountains to cut trees, split the trunks to use as tiles, and built houses. Without beds, they cut willow branches and bamboo to weave "sofa beds," and they also made their own soil baskets, burned lime, and burned charcoal. By October 1953, they had saved the country more than 1.3 billion yuan. Military engineers and civilian workers not only overcame difficulties with their own hands but also used their wisdom and creative spirit to invent many advanced operating methods, promoting the progress of the project. In the road-building troops of the Kangzang Highway, rationalization proposals were put forward one after another, and each unit came up with twenty or thirty new inventions and creations. In the construction of other highways, the workers' creations also emerged continuously. Advanced operating methods such as the "automatic lifting cable" method of transporting materials across the river, the "three-fast hammering stone method," "trapezoidal blasting," and "saltwater quenching drill" have all improved work efficiency and saved raw materials to varying degrees. In highway construction, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was also promoted. The Soviet Union's "graded pavement" was adopted on the Chengdu-Aba, Kangzang, and Kunming-Daluo highways, using local materials, saving labor and materials, and the road surface does not raise dust when the weather is sunny, and it does not slip when it rains. The Chengdu-Aba Highway adopted the Soviet expert's suggestion of "balancing excavation and filling, processing filling, and strengthening necessary structures." Last year, the route was re-measured before construction in the Zagunao River basin, thus avoiding a large amount of waste excavation, collapse, and landslides, and reducing culverts, half-mountain tunnels, and tunnels, saving the country billions of yuan. Secondly, according to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, three-hole large-diameter wooden slab bridges were built for the first time on the Kangzang Road, and the Jiawu-style wooden truss bridges and lightweight bridge abutments on the Chengdu-Aba Road, and the oval culverts on the Yuannan (Chongqing)-Guizhou Road, are all suitable for using local materials to achieve "spending less money and building good roads." The gradual promotion of these advanced experiences in the construction of southwest highways has brought new impetus to southwest highway construction.
    Eighty percent of the newly built highways in the Southwest are in minority areas. In order to welcome the arrival of prosperous days, people of more than 40 ethnic minorities have actively participated in road construction for the past four years, undertaking transportation tasks. The Tibetan people on the Kangzang Highway organized tens of thousands of yaks to safely transport materials to the construction site. The Tibetan people in various zong (administrative units) in the Qamdo area organized "Tibetan civilian worker brigades," and tens of thousands of Tibetan people participated in the road construction work. According to statistics from the Huishui-Luodian, Weining-Shuicheng, and Jinping-Rongjiang highways in Guizhou Province alone, farmers of the Miao, Yi, Buyi, and Hui ethnic groups contributed more than 1.14 million workdays. Minority civilian workers are enthusiastic in their work. During the construction of the Huishui-Luodian Highway, Buyi and Miao civilian workers also launched labor competitions and rationalization proposal movements, creating and promoting advanced operating methods such as wooden carts and wooden skateboard for transporting stones. People of all ethnic groups not only sent their children to participate in road construction and transportation work but also supported highway construction in all aspects. The Tibetan people on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway expressed great welcome to the road construction, and they automatically collected yak dung as fuel for the road-building workers. During the construction of the Huangmu Bridge, every morning they brought fresh milk and butter from twenty miles away for the workers to eat. The road-building employees strictly implemented the ethnic policies and established deep friendship with the people of fraternal ethnic groups.
    The rapid development of highway construction has increasingly changed the face of transportation in the Southwest, bringing prosperity and happiness to the people of all ethnic groups. The People's Government has transported salt to minority areas through the extensive highway network. With the opening of the Weining-Shuicheng Highway in Guizhou Province, salt transportation costs were reduced by a quarter, and the local Yi people were able to eat cheap salt. The Sinan-Tongren Highway connects all the highways in Guizhou Province, and the mercury, cinnabar, saltpeter, sulfur, iron, and other minerals, as well as timber, tung oil, animal skins, medicinal herbs, and other local specialties of the Tongren area, can be transported to Sichuan and Hunan, and the "dead-end grain" that could not be transported out in the past in the Jiangkou area can be transported to Sichuan via the Si-Tong-Qian Highway. The opening of the Kunming-Daluo Highway in Yunnan to Cheli, the capital of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, has shortened the round-trip schedule between Kunming and Cheli. People no longer need two months of long-distance travel. You can get to Cheli from Kunming by car in just seven days. This Yunnan "granary" and the main producing area of the famous "Pu'er tea" will become increasingly prosperous. The Dongchuan Copper Mine, which ranks first in the country, has built highways in the mountains, and trucks carrying equipment, small steel rails, and grain are coming in an endless stream. Now, it no longer takes hundreds of civilian workers several months to transport a machine over mountains and ridges. The highway of the Xikang Asbestos Mine, the largest in the country, has been opened, and minerals will be transported out in large quantities to support my country's industrial construction. The desolate scene of the Kangzang Plateau is changing. The people on both sides of the Kangzang Highway have settled down, and new houses have appeared. On the formerly desolate grassland, lush vegetable gardens and farms have appeared. Ganzi, the trade center of Kang, Qing, and Tibet, was a small market town two years ago, but today it has become a new city with a preliminary scale and prosperous commerce. The ancient city of Qamdo has now been completely renewed, the urban area has almost doubled, and many tall buildings are under construction. The tragic life of the Tibetan people lacking salt and cloth will never return. The highway has brought prosperity and happiness to the Kangzang Plateau.

    发展中的西南公路
    张光普
    为了适应国家建设，满足城乡物资交流，帮助少数民族地区发展经济与文化，西南区在解放后四年来，不仅大力恢复了川陕、川湘、川滇、川黔、川康等公路，而且进行了规模较大的公路建设。一九五三年公路建设的投资，即比一九五○年刚解放时增加十一倍多。据一九五二年底统计：西南全区通车里程已由一九五○年的八千多公里增至二万公里以上，一九五三年全区又新修公路二十三条，约长二千公里。新修的公路中，百分之八十在少数民族地区。日益发展的西南公路，将把康藏高原、云贵高原、四川边沿高山地区与内地联结起来。一九五四年公路建设投资还是很大，许多跨年度的工程正在继续进行。康藏公路已修至昌都以西四百多公里，正向西伸入拉萨。成（都）阿（坝）公路通车到鹧鸪山，已完工三分之二，将迅速修到四川省藏族自治区的阿坝大草原，与兰（州）郎（川西北郎木寺）公路汇合，成为川西北藏族人民的交通大道。四川省为了配合粮运，将整修主要产粮区的公路三百余公里。
    西南是多山地区，而新建公路大部在山岳地带，工程是异常艰巨的。康藏公路修筑在白雪参天的康藏高原上；成阿公路沿着拔海三千公尺以上的高山，跨过惊湍急流的岷江、杂谷脑河和大小金川，直入纵横六百余里的大草原；云南、贵州两省许多新建公路，则要翻越峭壁悬崖的云贵高原，涉过乌江、怒江、澜沧江等无数急流。战斗在康藏公路上的人们，在零下二、三十度，寒风凛冽，空气稀薄的雪山上，一手一锹地铲开白雪，挖掉泥土，用绳子挂在腰间，在无法立脚的悬崖绝壁，打眼炸方，要把公路修到拉萨。当成都平原已是暖和的时候，而修筑成阿公路的军工、民工们，还穿着棉衣在白雪世界里劳动。在伸不起腰，站不稳脚的地方，工人们就跪下工作，膝盖磨破了，血湿透了裤子，他们仍然坚持到底。在昆（明）洛（打洛）公路上，筑路职工与民工们，要经过气候炎热、瘴疠流行的地区，把公路从昆明修到祖国的边疆。修筑康滇公路富（林）会（理）段的民工们说：“修路是我们自己的事”，在修该路最艰巨工程之一的石棉、大渡河桥时，展开了红旗竞赛，提前十天完成了全部工程。战士和工人们还克服一时供应不上的困难。成阿公路开工时，菜供应不上，战士就挖野草吃，帐篷缺乏，他们就上山砍树，劈开树干当瓦，盖起了房子；没有床，砍下柳条、竹子编起了“沙发床”，而且自己编土箕、烧石灰、烧木炭样样都来，至一九五三年十月止，他们就为国家节约十三亿元以上。军工、民工们不仅凭双手克服着困难，而且用自己的智慧和创造精神，发明了许多的先进操作方法，推进工程的进展。康藏公路的筑路部队中，纷纷提出合理化建议，各个单位出现了二、三十种新发明和新创造。在其他公路修筑中，工人们的创造也不断涌现。“自动升降飞缆”隔河运料法、“三快捶石法”、“梯形爆破”、“盐水淬钎”等先进操作法，都不同程度地提高了工作效率，节省了原料。在公路建设中并推行了苏联的先进经验。在成阿、康藏、昆洛公路，采用了苏联的“级配路面”，就地取材，节省工料，而且路面天晴不起灰，天雨不滑车。成阿公路采用苏联专家的“挖填平衡，加工填方，加固必要的构造物”的建议，去年在杂谷脑河流域施工前进行了路线改测，因而避免了大量的废方、坍方与滑坡，减少了涵洞、半山洞、山洞，给国家节省数十亿元。其次，根据苏联的先进经验，在康藏路上还第一次修了三孔大孔径木板桥，成阿路上的戛乌式木桁构桥、轻型桥台，渝南（充）路上的卵形涵洞，都宜于就地取材，做到“少花钱，修好路”。这些先进经验在西南公路建设中的逐步推广，给西南公路建设带来了新的动力。
    西南新修公路百分之八十在少数民族地区，各族人民为了迎接繁荣日子的到来，四年来有四十多个少数民族的许多同胞积极参加了筑路工作，担负运输任务。康藏公路上的藏族人民组织了上万的牦牛，安全地把物资运到了工地。昌都地区各宗的藏民组织了“藏民民工大队”，成千成万的藏民参加了筑路工作。贵州省仅惠（水）罗（甸）、威（宁）水（城）、锦（屏）榕（江）等公路统计，苗、彝、布依和回族的农民就作了一百一十四万多个工日。少数民族民工，工作积极，在惠罗公路修筑中，布依、苗族民工，还开展了劳动竞赛和合理化建议运动，创造和推广了木板推车、木棍滑板运石等先进操作法。各族人民不但派自己的子弟参加筑路和运输工作，而且从各方面支援公路建设。青藏公路上的藏民对修路表示极大的欢迎，他们自动为筑路职工收集牦牛粪作燃料；黄木桥施工时，每天早上他们从二十里以外背来新鲜的牛奶和酥油给工人们吃。筑路员工严格执行了民族政策，与兄弟民族人民建立起深厚的友情。
    公路建设的迅速发展，已日益改变着西南交通的面貌，它给各族人民带来了繁荣和幸福。人民政府通过四通八达的公路把食盐运到了少数民族地区。贵州省威水公路的通车，食盐运费就降低了四分之一，当地彝族人民吃到了廉价的食盐。思
  （南）铜（仁）公路把贵州全省公路连成了一气，铜仁专区的汞、朱砂、硝磺、铁等矿产和木材、桐油、兽皮、药材等土特产，可运销四川、湖南，江口一带；过去无法运出的“死角粮”，可以由思铜公路转川黔公路运到四川。云南昆洛公路通车到西双版纳傣族自治区首府的车里，它把昆明和车里之间的往返日程缩短了，人们再不需要两个月的长途旅行了，你从昆明坐上汽车只需要七天就到了车里。这个云南“谷仓”和著名的“普洱茶”主要产地，将日益繁荣起来。居全国第一位的东川铜矿，在崇山峻岭中修起了公路后，载着器材、小钢轨、粮食的汽车源源奔来。现在运一部机器再用不着弄几百民工花上几个月翻山越岭去搬运。全国最大的西康石棉矿的公路已修通了，矿产将要大量外运支援我国的工业建设。康藏高原荒凉的情景在改变着，康藏公路两旁的人民定居了下来，新房屋出现了，在过去荒凉的草原上，出现了葱绿的菜地和农场。康、青、藏贸易中心的甘孜，在两年前还是一个狭小的集镇，而今天，已成为一个初具规模、商业繁荣的新城市。古老的昌都城现在已焕然一新，市区几乎扩展了一倍，许多高大的楼房正在建筑中。藏族人民少盐缺布的悲惨生活将会一去不复返，公路给康藏高原带来了繁荣和幸福。
