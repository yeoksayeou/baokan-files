    Sichuan is focusing on launching a new agricultural implement rental program this year to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture and support the patriotic production increase campaign of farmers. Currently, more than 3,500 new-style walking plows, horse-drawn farm implements, etc., and more than 2,600 sprayers, cotton gins, corn threshers, etc., have been successively transported to twelve special districts and the Tibetan Autonomous Region throughout the province. These new agricultural implements will be mainly rented to organized farmers in order to maximize their effectiveness on large areas of farmland. Local agricultural technology guidance stations and state-owned farms will be responsible for handling the rental of new agricultural implements. This work will focus on the six special districts of Wenjiang, Suining, etc., which are the main grain and cotton producing areas, while other special districts will each select one or two counties with better conditions for pilot implementation. In addition, areas with suitable conditions will trial one or two small tractor stations this spring to help large-scale agricultural production cooperatives implement mechanized farming.
    Since last December, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Sichuan Provincial People's Government has successively trained more than 600 agricultural technology cadres in three batches, teaching them how to use and repair various new agricultural implements. Now, more than 400 agricultural technology cadres who have completed their studies and returned to their respective counties are organizing local agricultural production cooperative technicians, mutual aid team leaders, and peasant activists to carry out technical instruction.

    四川开展新式农具租借工作
    四川省今年有重点地举办新式农具租借工作，来促进对农业的社会主义改造和支援农民的爱国增产运动。目前，已有新式步犁、马拉农具等三千五百多部，喷雾器、轧花机、玉米脱粒机等二千六百多部，陆续地分别运到全省十二个专区和藏族自治区。这些新式农具将主要租借给组织起来的农民，以便在大面积田地上发挥它们的效能。各地农业技术指导站和国营农场将负责办理新式农具的租借工作。这一工作以主要粮、棉产区温江、遂宁等六个专区为重点，其他专区各选择一两个条件较好的县重点试办。此外，有条件地区在今年春天将试办一两个小型拖拉机站，帮助大型农业生产合作社实行机械耕作。
    四川省人民政府农林厅在去年十二月以来，曾先后分三批调训六百多名农业技术干部，让他们学习使用和修理各种新式农具的方法。现在，已经学习完毕回到各县的四百多名农业技术干部，正组织当地农业生产合作社的技术员、互助组的组长和农民积极分子等，进行技术传授。
