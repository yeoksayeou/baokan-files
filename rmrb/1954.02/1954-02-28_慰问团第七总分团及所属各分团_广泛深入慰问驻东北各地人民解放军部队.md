Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 27th: The Seventh General Sub-Delegation of the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army and its thirteen subordinate sub-delegations have launched extensive慰问 activities among the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in various parts of Northeast China, receiving a warm welcome from the People's Liberation Army.

    The First Sub-Delegation of the Seventh General Sub-Delegation has already held eighteen慰问 conferences in Shenyang. Some representatives of the Seventh General Sub-Delegation, led by Deputy Heads Bai Xiqing, Zhang Panxin, and Zhang Dongchuan, went to Anshan and Changchun, and jointly held conferences with the local sub-delegations to extend慰问 to the People's Liberation Army.

    After holding慰问 conferences, all the sub-delegations under the Seventh General Sub-Delegation were divided into groups to visit companies, military schools, and army hospitals, among other units, to extend慰问. Some representatives even went into the soldiers' dormitories and kitchens to extend慰问, so that the soldiers on duty and in their hospital beds could see the representatives sent by the people of the whole country and Chairman Mao. During the慰问 period, the representatives also held many symposiums with the heroes and models of the troops. The labor models and combat heroes among the慰问 delegation representatives introduced each other's heroic and model deeds and expressed their willingness to learn from each other.

    Everywhere they went, the representatives of each sub-delegation received a warm welcome and cordial hospitality from the People's Liberation Army. When the representatives of the慰问團 arrived, the commanders and fighters of various units often greeted them from afar, vying to carry the representatives to their stations. The blackboards and wall newspapers of various units all published special issues to welcome the慰问團. Many PLA commanders and fighters also exchanged souvenirs with the representatives of the慰问團. Liu Fuzhen, a model cultural instructor of a certain unit, and Gao Baochen, a first-class meritorious person of a certain unit, presented their model medals and treasured Selected Works of Mao Zedong to Zhao Guilan, a representative of the慰问團 and an industrial labor model. The commanders and fighters of various units deeply thanked the慰问團 for its慰问. They all expressed their determination to respond to the care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country with practical actions. Soldiers of a certain unit stationed in Changchun requested the慰问團 to bring three "goods" to Chairman Mao: First, wishing Chairman Mao good health; Second, we must learn our skills well and build a modern national defense well; Third, we guarantee to study and implement the general line well. The soldiers of the Second Squad of a certain company, in order to thank the慰问 from the people of the motherland, proposed to save national expenses so that the motherland could achieve socialist industrialization as soon as possible. To this end, they revised their patriotic and economical plan.
