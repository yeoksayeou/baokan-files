Currently, after agricultural production cooperatives have developed relatively extensively in many regions, the difficulty of insufficient leadership has become widespread; the masses have a high enthusiasm for establishing cooperatives, but there are very few cadres in the county and district leadership responsible for establishing cooperatives and core members within the cooperatives. To solve this problem, in addition to actively training and cultivating cadres and core members for establishing cooperatives, some regions are trying out new leadership methods.

In Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, with the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative and five other cooperatives that have a good foundation, strong leadership, high mass awareness, and experience in establishing cooperatives as the center, all agricultural production cooperatives in their respective townships are united to form a "Joint Cooperative Committee." The director of the central cooperative serves as the chairman of the committee. Regular meetings are held to exchange experiences, and methods such as conducting circuit inspections and demonstration visits are adopted to strengthen guidance for general cooperatives and new cooperatives. Xiangling County, based on the natural environment, divided areas and established ten "Agricultural Production Cooperative Networks" by region; in addition to assigning capable cadres to strengthen the regular and specific leadership of the "networks," the county party committee also decided to hold regular meetings of responsible cadres from each "network" to draw on experience and guide the county's cooperative work. Hongdong and other counties also divided appropriate areas and, through mutual reporting and voluntary combination, stipulated systems such as new cooperatives visiting old cooperatives and old cooperatives imparting experience to new cooperatives, determining that one old cooperative would lead two to three new cooperatives so that new cooperatives could continuously absorb the experience of old cooperatives. Huguan County also formed twenty-five "Mutual Aid and Cooperation Networks" centered on better old cooperatives to strengthen close ties between cooperatives, continuously exchange experiences, learn from each other, and learn from each other's strengths. This approach can solve the problem of having many cooperatives but few cadres and can ensure close unity between new and old cooperatives; in addition, each cooperative can further lead a group of mutual aid teams forward through the form of "small networks."

In Beijiasu Township, Xingtang County, Hebei Province, seven small cooperatives formed a joint guidance committee, with the directors of the seven cooperatives serving as members, and Feng Shuanyin, a member of the township general branch, was elected as the "general director." Although each cooperative still maintains its independent management, with unified leadership, more people have more ideas, which can overcome the difficulties of having many cooperatives but few core members and being difficult to lead. They plan to convene specialized meetings of cadres and accountants in charge of agriculture, sideline occupations, and women from various small cooperatives at different times of the year, as needed, without affecting production, to review work, exchange experiences, and improve working methods. When necessary, on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, various small cooperatives can also closely cooperate and support each other in terms of funds, farm tools, and labor.

In Qingfeng County, Henan Province, in order to solve the problem of having many new cooperatives and few cadres, it was decided to connect new and old cooperatives by region and organize eight "Transmission Stations," with the directors of old cooperatives as station directors and the directors of new cooperatives as members, using old cooperatives to lead new cooperatives. Each district is equipped with full-time cadres to serve as station directors for the entire district, responsible for guiding the work of each station.

    翼城行唐等地成立农业合作社联合机构
    克服了办社干部不够和经验不足的困难
    目前不少地区在农业生产合作社比较大量地发展起来了以后，普遍感到了领导力量不足的困难；群众办社的热情很高，县区领导办社的干部和社内骨干却很少。为了解决这个问题，除了积极训练和培养办社干部和骨干分子以外，有些地区正在试行一些新的领导方法。
    山西省翼城县以基础较好，领导骨干较强、群众觉悟较高、有办社经验的吴春安农业生产合作社等六个社为中心，各把本乡所有的农业生产合作社联合起来，组成“联社委员会”，以中心社的社长为主任委员，定期开会，交流经验，并采用巡回检查，示范参观等办法，加强对一般社和新社的指导。襄陵县根据自然环境，划分地区，分片建立了十个“农业生产合作社网”；县委除派得力的干部加强对“网”的经常的具体领导之外，还决定定期召开各个“网”的负责干部会议，吸取经验，指导全县办社工作。洪洞等县也划分适当地区，用互相自报、自愿结合的方式，规定新社访问老社、老社传授经验给新社等制度，确定一个老社带动两个到三个新社，使新社能不断地吸取老社的经验。壶关县也以较好的老社为中心，组成二十五个“互助合作网”，加强各社之间的密切联系，不断交流经验，互相学习，取长补短。这样作，既可以解决社多干部少的问题，又可以保证新社老社之间的亲密团结；此外，并且用“小网”的形式，每个社再带动一批互助组前进。
    河北省行唐县北贾素乡由七个小社组成了一个联合指导委员会，七个社的社长做委员，推选乡总支委员封拴银做“总社长”。虽然各个社仍然保持了各自经营的独立性，但是有了统一的领导，人多办法多，就能克服社多骨干少、不好领导的困难。他们打算在各个不同的季节，根据需要，在不影响生产的原则下分别召集各小社领导农业、副业、妇女的干部和会计，开专业会议，检查工作，交流经验，改进工作方法。必要的时候，在自愿互利的原则下，各个小社在资金、农具、劳力等方面还可以密切配合，互相支持。
    河南省清丰县为解决新社多、干部少的问题，决定按地区把新社和老社联系起来，组织了八个“传授站”，以老社社长为站长，新社社长为委员，用老社带动新社。各区配备专职干部做全区的站务主任，负责指导各站工作。
