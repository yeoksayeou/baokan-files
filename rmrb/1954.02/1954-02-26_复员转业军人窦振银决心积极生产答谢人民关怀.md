    Demobilized and Transferred Soldier Dou Zhenyin Resolves to Actively Produce to Repay the People's Care
    Dou Zhenyin from Xiniangniangzhuang, Seventh District, Zunhua County, Hebei Province writes: I am a demobilized and transferred soldier. When I was in the army, I often worried about how my family was doing and how the government was taking care of them. Last October, I was transferred back home due to illness. Before returning home, the leadership cared for us very much, examining our health and providing us with medical expenses and production subsidies for treatment at home. On the way, governments in various places warmly received us. On the afternoon of October 24th, I arrived home. As soon as I entered the gate, I saw my fourth younger brother wearing new cotton clothes and new cotton shoes, plump and playing in the courtyard. When I went inside, hey! The inside was whitewashed with lime, completely different from when I joined the army and left home, when the walls were as black as the bottom of a pot. My younger siblings were all in school. The family was eating rice and millet porridge, and there were also fried eggs. I asked my father how the harvest was this year. My father said, "There was a lot of rain, but not a single piece of land was left uncultivated. The government and the masses took good care of us, giving us enough work points, and the masses who were helping us farm were all rushing to do the work for us. One day we wanted six people to whitewash the house, but eight people came at once." The next day, I went to the home of a revolutionary martyr's family, and they were even raising a flock of large sheep.
    These facts that I saw with my own eyes made me very ashamed: I often missed home when I was in the army and did not do my job well, failing the Party and Chairman Mao, and failing the people's care for me. In the future, I am determined to produce well and contribute my strength to the country's economic construction.

    复员转业军人窦振银决心积极生产答谢人民关怀
    河北省遵化县七区西娘娘庄窦振银来信：我是一个复员转业军人。我在部队时，时常惦念家里生活怎样，政府照顾得怎样。去年十月，我因病转业回家。回家前，上级对我们非常关心，为我们检查病情，并发给回家治病的医药费和生产资助金。路上，各地政府都热情地接送我们。十月二十四日下午我到了家。一进大门，就看见四弟穿着新棉衣、新棉鞋，肥胖胖的，在当院玩。进屋一看，嘿！里边用石灰粉刷得雪白，和我参军离家时墙黑得像锅底一样的情况完全不同了。弟妹们也全上学了。家里吃的是大米、小米两样粥，还有炒鸡蛋。我问父亲今年年成怎样？父亲说：“雨水很多，可是地一点也没荒。政府和群众对我们照顾得可好，发给我们足够的工票，代耕的群众也都抢着给我们干活。有一天刷房想用六个人，一下却来了八个。”第二天我又到一个烈属家里去，他家里还养着一群大绵羊呢。
    我亲眼看到的这些事实，使我十分惭愧：在部队时常因想家而没有把工作做好，对不起党和毛主席，对不起人民对我的关怀。我今后决心好好生产，在国家经济建设中贡献我一份力量。
