Xinhua News Agency report: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference continued on the 9th at the former Allied Control Council building, chaired by Eden.

As everyone knows, at the meeting on the 6th, Dulles and Eden suggested postponing the discussion of the German question and immediately moving on to the third agenda item. However, the Soviet delegation pointed out that this was inappropriate and that the second agenda item must continue to be discussed. The Western foreign ministers could not publicly defend their suggestion and had to agree with the Soviet delegation's opinion. The Western foreign ministers' trick finally failed, and the conference continued to discuss the German question.

However, here is the question: What prompted Dulles and Eden to play this conspiracy? What was the purpose of their suggestion? A simple examination of the discussion of the German question can provide the answer. The speeches of the Western foreign ministers during the discussion of the second agenda item proved that they were merely pretending to want to solve the German question. Any unbiased observer can see that the Eden plan, supported by the three Western foreign ministers, contains no constructive suggestions that could facilitate the resolution of the main issues. The main issue is to prevent the revival of German militarism, to reunify Germany into a peaceful, independent, and democratic country, thereby ensuring the security of European countries and satisfying the legitimate national aspirations of the German people. In short, as Molotov pointed out, this "plan," which Western newspapers have been touting, only focuses on various formal issues related to the organization and technical nature of elections. Moreover, the above plan stipulates that this task should be carried out by the occupying powers, while the Germans themselves are excluded.

In contrast, the Soviet delegation put forward a concrete plan of action that opened up a path for unifying Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, for ensuring European security through concerted action by the four powers, and for safeguarding the national rights and fundamental interests of the German people.

From the first day of the discussion of the German question, the three Western foreign ministers adopted a negative attitude towards the Soviet Union's clear and concrete suggestions. They opposed the Soviet delegation's suggestion to invite representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the discussion of the German question, although the suggestion was well-founded. At the same time, the three Western foreign ministers refused to give a clear answer to the Soviet delegation's suggestion regarding the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany and the convening of a peace conference on the German peace treaty. Dulles, Bidault, and Eden also opposed the Soviet delegation's proposal to hold a plebiscite in Germany to see whether the German people supported the Bonn and Paris Treaties or the peace treaty. The three Western foreign ministers also rejected the Soviet delegation's proposal to establish a provisional all-German government and hold free all-German elections, without offering any convincing arguments. No trick can make peace-loving people think that the Western countries' rejection of the Soviet delegation's proposals is justified, because these proposals advocate solving the German question in a way that is conducive to peace and European security and to the benefit of the German people themselves. In fact, the attempt to avoid the Soviet Union's clear and concrete suggestions has failed.

In the course of the discussion, the three Western foreign ministers attempted to avoid some other Soviet suggestions as well. Some local democrats are asking: Isn't this the West attempting to shelve the discussion of the German question? For example, Dulles's failure to mention the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet government at several meetings illustrates the problem. Eden and Bidault also failed to express their opinions on this draft treaty. On February 5th, the Soviet delegation suggested that the occupying forces be withdrawn from East and West Germany before the elections, leaving only a limited number of troops to maintain security. This important new suggestion was intended to facilitate the successful completion of the task of preparing for and holding free all-German elections, so as to avoid any foreign interference or pressure during the elections. As everyone knows, the foreign ministers of the three Western powers rejected this suggestion, merely insisting unconvincingly that the suggestion was unacceptable and offered unrealistic criticisms. The three Western foreign ministers also took a silent attitude towards another important Soviet suggestion regarding reducing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the consequences of the war. Facts have proved that not only the representatives of Western countries have not responded to this suggestion, but also Western European, Bonn, and American newspapers have adopted a similar attitude of silent resistance to this suggestion and the suggestion regarding the withdrawal of occupying forces.

At the beginning of the meeting on the 9th, Molotov delivered a speech on "The German Question and the Position of the Three Powers" (full text to be issued separately), summarizing the discussion of the German question at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

As soon as Molotov finished speaking, Dulles spoke next, but he only said that he did not want to speak. Therefore, Dulles definitely indicated his attempt to avoid answering the Soviet Union's specific suggestions.

Bidault actually took a similar attitude. When he talked about the Soviet proposal to reduce Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the consequences of the war, he said that the French delegation "believed that it was not appropriate to talk about this issue on this occasion" and that "this issue is purely commercial, not political." Bidault did not answer any of the questions raised in Molotov's speech on February 9.

Eden then spoke, saying that he believed that the Soviet proposal to reduce Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the consequences of the war was not related to the agenda being discussed. Eden insisted that the Western countries had already exempted Germany from its financial and economic obligations. He even said that Britain had never collected any reparations from Germany. This statement clearly violates irrefutable facts. The fact is that the Western countries, including Britain, have taken away a large amount of materials and wealth from West Germany as reparations, especially the dismantling of industrial enterprises in West Berlin and West Germany, the confiscation of German foreign property, the removal of gold from the German Reichsbank, the confiscation of securities and patent rights, the confiscation of German merchant ships, and the forced export of Ruhr coal, scrap iron, and other raw materials. As for the other questions raised by the Soviet delegation, Eden did not mention them at all. He said that the representatives of the Western countries and the Soviet delegation held extremely opposing views on the issues currently being discussed. He bluntly stated that he refused to seek a solution to the German question on a mutually acceptable basis.

Molotov then spoke, reminding the participants that the second agenda item was called "The German Question and the Task of Ensuring European Security." However, the speeches of the representatives of the three Western powers were actually just defending the plan to establish a six-nation military group - the "European Defence Community." This cannot solve the problem of European security. The German question is directly related to the entire European security issue. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet delegation is asking today whether the governments of France, Britain, and the United States have anything to say about ensuring European security and the true security of the peoples of Europe. Molotov spoke about the speech by Eden, who was chairing the meeting, summarizing the results of the discussion of the second agenda item. He said that the Soviet delegation understood the result of the discussion to be that the Western countries currently have no considerations or suggestions on the issue of ensuring the security of the peoples of Europe.

Dulles then spoke. He was unwilling to make any specific statements on the questions raised by Molotov. He supported Eden's opinion, believing that it must be affirmed that the positions of the Western countries and the Soviet Union on the issues under discussion were completely contrary and that it was impossible to reach an agreement.

Bidault also repeated that, since it was certain that it was impossible to reach a compromise at this stage, he did not think it was worthwhile to continue discussing the German question and the task of ensuring European security. He suggested moving on to discuss other issues and then returning to the issues currently being discussed. Bidault suggested holding another secret meeting on February 10 to continue discussing the issues discussed at the secret meeting on February 8.

Eden supported Bidault's motion and agreed to hold another secret meeting on February 10.

Molotov said that the Soviet delegation also believed that it was appropriate and beneficial to hold another secret meeting on the first agenda item in the next few days. However, the Soviet delegation believed that it was not appropriate to interrupt the discussion on the German question and the task of ensuring European security. The Soviet delegation intends to put forward concrete suggestions on ensuring European security.

However, Dulles and Bidault continued to insist on interrupting the discussion of the German question and advocated that the secret meeting be scheduled for February 10.

Molotov said that the Soviet delegation could put forward concrete suggestions on ensuring European security at the meeting on February 10, and that the secret meeting to discuss the first agenda item should preferably be held on February 11.

Chairman Eden agreed with this suggestion, and no one objected. The meeting was adjourned.

    四外长会议继续讨论第二项议程
    莫洛托夫谈解决德国问题的原则
    据新华社讯：四国外长会议于九日在前盟国管制委员会大厦继续举行，由艾登担任主席。
    大家知道，在六日的会议上，杜勒斯和艾登曾建议延期讨论德国问题，立即转而研究第三项议程。然而，苏联代表团指出这是不合适的，认为必须继续讨论第二项议程。西方外长无法公开为自己的建议辩护，不得不同意苏联代表团的意见。西方外长的诡计终于失败了，会议继续讨论德国问题。
    然而，这里有一个问题：是什么东西促使杜勒斯和艾登玩弄这个阴谋的呢？他们的建议目的何在呢？简单地检查一下德国问题的讨论，便可以得到回答了。西方外长在讨论第二项议程时的发言，证明他们不过是在装模作样地想要解决德国问题罢了。任何一个没有偏见的观察家都可以看出，在为西方三国外长所支持的艾登计划中，并无任何建设性的建议足以促成主要问题的解决。这个主要问题就是：防止德国军国主义复活，使德国重新统一成为一个和平、独立、民主的国家，从而保障欧洲各国的安全并且满足德国人民正当的民族愿望。总之，正如莫洛托夫所指出的，西方报纸大吹大擂的这个“计划”，仅仅着眼于各种关乎进行选举的组织和技术性质的形式问题。而且，上述计划规定，应由占领国来执行这项任务，而德国人自己则被排除在外。
    与此相反，苏联代表团提出了一个具体的行动计划，这个计划为在和平民主的基础上统一德国、通过四国一致行动以保障欧洲安全以及保障德国人民的民族权利和根本利益开辟了道路。
    西方三国外长从讨论德国问题的第一天起，就对苏联明确具体的建议抱着否定的态度。苏联代表团建议邀请德意志民主共和国代表与德意志联邦共和国代表参加讨论德国问题，而他们表示反对，虽然这个建议的理由十分充足。同时，西方三国外长对于苏联代表团关于准备对德和约及召开关于对德和约的和平会议的建议，拒不作明确的答复。苏联代表团主张在德国进行公民投票，看看德国人民究竟是拥护波恩和巴黎条约还是拥护和约，杜勒斯、皮杜尔和艾登也表示反对。西方三国外长同样拒绝苏联代表团关于成立临时的全德政府和举行全德自由选举的建议，而没有提出任何令人服信的论据。任何把戏都不能使爱好和平的公众认为西方国家拒绝苏联代表团的建议是正当的，因为这些建议主张在有利于和平与欧洲安全以及有利于德国人民自己的情况下解决德国问题。实际上，要避开苏联明确具体的建议的企图是失败了。
    在讨论过程中，西方三国外长企图对苏联其他一些建议也避而不谈。当地的一些民主人士在问：难道这不是西方三国企图搁置德国问题的讨论吗？例如，杜勒斯在几次会议上对苏联政府提出的对德和约草案只字不提，这一事实就说明了问题。艾登和皮杜尔对这个和约草案同样不发表自己的意见。苏联代表团在二月五日建议：在选举前就自东西德撤退占领军，只留下有限的军队来维持安全。这一重要的新建议是为了促成胜利地完成筹备和举行全德自由选举的任务，以免在选举期间受到外国的任何干涉和压力。大家知道，西方三国的外交部长拒绝了这一建议，只是毫不能令人信服地硬说这个建议是不能接受的，并且提出了不切实际的批评。西方三国外长对于苏联关于减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政与经济义务的另一个重要建议，也采取
  了默不作声的态度。事实证明，不但是西方国家的代表对于这个建议毫无反应，而且西欧的、波恩的和美国的报纸也对这个建议以及关于撤退占领军的建议，采取类似的缄默抵制的态度。
    在九日会议开始时，莫洛托夫发表了关于“德国问题与三国的立场”的演说（全文另发），对四国外长会议关于德国问题的讨论加以总结。
    莫洛托夫发言刚结束，杜勒斯就接着发言，然而他只说他不想发言。因此，杜勒斯肯定地表明了他企图避免答复苏联的具体建议。
    皮杜尔实际上采取了类似的态度。他谈到苏联关于减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政和经济义务的建议时说，法国代表团“认为在这个场合谈这个问题是不适宜的”，“这个问题是纯商业性的，不是政治性的”。皮杜尔没有对莫洛托夫二月九日的发言中提出的任何一个问题作答复。
    艾登接着发言说，他认为，苏联关于减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政和经济义务的建议与目前讨论的议程没有关系。艾登硬说西方国家已经免除了德国的财政和经济义务。他甚至说，英国从未自德国收取任何赔偿。这种说法显然违反了无可辩驳的事实。而事实是，西方国家，包括英国在内，自西德运走了大量物资和财富作为赔偿，特别是拆卸西柏林和西德的工业企业，没收德国的国外财产，运走德国帝国银行的黄金，没收证券和专利权，没收德国的商船，强迫德国输出鲁尔的煤，废铁和其他原料等。至于苏联代表团提出的其他问题，艾登绝口不谈。他说，西方国家的代表和苏联代表团对目前讨论的问题双方各持极端相反的看法。他直截了当地说，他拒绝寻求在互相可接受的基础上解决德国问题的办法。
    莫洛托夫接着发言，他提醒与会者，第二项议程叫做“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”。但是，西方三国代表的发言实际上都不过是为成立六国军事集团——即“欧洲防务集团”的计划进行辩护。这是不能解决欧洲安全问题的。德国问题与整个的欧洲安全问题有直接的关系。正是因为这个原因，苏联代表团今天要问一问，法、英、美三国政府对保障欧洲安全，对欧洲各国人民的真正安全是否有话要说。莫洛托夫谈到担任主席的艾登总结第二项议程讨论结果的发言。他说，苏联代表团是这样来了解讨论的结果的，就是西方国家目前在保障欧洲各国人民安全的问题上没有考虑，也没有建议。
    杜勒斯接着发言。他不愿对莫洛托夫提出的问题作任何具体的表示。他支持艾登的意见，认为必须肯定，西方国家和苏联对讨论中的问题的立场是完全背道而驰的，不可能取得协议。
    皮杜尔也跟着重复说，由于已肯定不可能在目前阶段取得折衷，他认为不值得继续讨论德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题。他建议转而讨论其他问题，然后再回转来讨论现在讨论的问题。皮杜尔建议在二月十日再举行一次秘密会议，继续讨论在二月八日的秘密会议上讨论的问题。
    艾登支持皮杜尔的动议，赞成在二月十日再举行一次秘密会议。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团也认为在今后几天内再就第一项议程举行一次秘密会议是合适的而且是有好处的。然而，苏联代表团认为，不宜中断关于德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务的讨论。苏联代表团打算提出关于保障欧洲安全的具体建议。
    然而，杜勒斯和皮杜尔继续坚持中断德国问题的讨论，并主张定于二月十日举行秘密会议。
      莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团可以在二月十日的会议上提出关于保障欧洲安全的具体建议，讨论第一项议程的秘密会议最好在二月十一日举行。
    主席艾登赞成这个建议，没有人表示反对。会议至此休会。
