    State-owned Hardware and Machinery Company Jinan Branch
    Actively Supplies Rural Small Hardware
    The state-owned Hardware and Machinery Company Jinan Branch actively organizes the distribution of small hardware to rural areas through state-owned department stores and cooperatives at all levels to meet the needs of farmers and handicraftsmen. Last year, according to instructions from higher authorities, the company conducted surveys in nine special districts, including Changwei and Huimin, and solicited opinions from state-owned department stores and cooperatives in various counties. They solved some problems in the price and variety of hardware products, harmonized the relationship between the two parties, and reversed the thinking of some department stores and cooperatives that were unwilling to deal in hardware products. Through the patient explanation and promotion by sales personnel, state-owned stores and cooperatives in various regions have successively submitted purchase plans. According to incomplete statistics, the company has signed supply contracts with various places for more than 2,000 tons of pig iron, aluminum wire, nails, and other items.
    Through this organization of hardware and equipment to the countryside, the erroneous understanding of some people in the company who were unwilling to organize hardware to the countryside was broken. Before organizing hardware to the countryside, many cadres in the company believed that the sales of hardware and equipment in rural areas were "too small" and there were many difficulties, so they had no confidence in the sales work. However, after organizing hardware to the countryside, even goods that had been backlogged internally for more than a year were sold.
    At present, in order to further expand the distribution of hardware and equipment to the countryside, the company has summarized the experience of organizing hardware and equipment to the countryside in the fourth quarter of 1953 and continues to expand its supply to rural areas. In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of state-owned department stores and cooperatives at all levels, it is prepared to give the stores and cooperatives convenience in operation and preferential treatment in price. At the same time, in order to correctly utilize small wholesalers between urban and rural areas, it is prepared to wholesale to some small hardware businesses.

    国营五金机械公司济南支公司
    积极供应农村小五金
    国营五金机械公司济南支公司通过各级国营百货商店、合作社积极组织小五金下乡，满足农民和手工业者的需要。去年，该公司根据上级指示，曾分别到昌潍、惠民等九个专区调查农村需要，征询各县国营百货商店和合作社的意见，解决了经营五金商品的价格及品种上的一些问题，融洽了双方的关系，也扭转了部分百货商店、合作社不愿意经营五金商品的思想。经过推销人员耐心地解释和宣传，因而各地区的国营商店、合作社纷纷提出要货计划。据不完整统计，该公司先后与各地签订了包括生铁、铝丝、钉子等达二千余吨的供应合同。
    通过这次组织五金器材下乡，打破了该公司某些人员不愿组织五金下乡的错误认识。在没有组织五金下乡前，该公司有不少干部认为五金器材在农村的销量“太少”，困难很多，因此对推销工作没信心。但经过组织五金下乡后，连内部积压一年多的商品，也销出去了。
    目前，该公司为了进一步扩大五金器材下乡，已总结了一九五三年第四季度组织五金器材下乡工作的经验，继续扩大对农村的供应。为了充分发挥各级国营百货商店、合作社的积极性，准备给予店、社经营上的便利和价格上的优待。同时为了正确利用城乡之间小批发商，准备批发给一部分小五金。
