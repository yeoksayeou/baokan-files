    Large-Scale Geological Exploration in Central South China
    Since last year, Central South China has launched an unprecedented large-scale exploration of underground resources. After a year of arduous efforts by more than a dozen geological exploration teams, a considerable amount of mineral deposits has been found to meet the resource needs of the country's First Five-Year Plan, laying the foundation for future exploration work.
    Central South China, which ranks first in the country in grain production, is not only fertile and has abundant water resources suitable for agricultural development, but also a mineral-rich area with huge reserves. It is particularly rich in non-ferrous metals, and has enough iron and coal to establish a giant ferrous metallurgical joint enterprise. Tin ore reserves are also quite abundant. In addition, Central South China also has a variety of other useful minerals. They are the foundation of heavy industry, indispensable for building factories, railways, tractors, and establishing national defense industries. In order to establish a second iron and steel base, Team 429, directly under the Ministry of Geology, conducted iron ore exploration in the vast area of ​​the Daye mining area last year. They explored and discovered huge iron ore and iron-manganese symbiotic deposits. Last year, a manganese ore exploration team of the Central South Geological Bureau discovered a huge manganese ore deposit spreading across several counties. Coking coal, the "grain" of the steel industry, has been explored for only one year, and two main coal seams have been explored in a certain county. The known mineral reserves are three times larger than expected, and it can be affirmed that it is very good coking coal. Even more exciting is the discovery of prime coking coal in a certain place, which is a very high-quality coking coal that is no less than the coal from the famous Pingxiang Coal Mine in Jiangnan. This series of gains has provided a solid foundation for a new steel center to be built in our country.
    Last year, the lead-zinc, copper, and tungsten ore exploration teams also achieved great results. A lead-zinc ore exploration team of the Central South Geological Bureau discovered a concentrated lead-zinc ore area last year. From its exploration prospects, it is a lead-zinc ore that occupies an important position in the world. Another lead-zinc ore exploration team also explored lead-zinc ore reserves that can initially solve urgent needs. A tungsten mining area also underwent large-scale exploration last year.
    This year, Central South China, which ranks first among the key exploration areas of the Ministry of Geology, has nearly doubled the number of exploration mining areas compared to last year. Red, green, black, and yellow dots marking general surveys and explorations are densely distributed on the map of Central South China. Almost all of the lead-zinc mineral deposits expected to be proven nationwide this year are in Central South China.
    This year, the Central South Geological Bureau will focus on the exploration of coal (especially coking coal), lead-zinc, and manganese ore, and will also begin exploration of pyrite and diamonds; it will also carry out general survey work in central Henan and western Hunan. This year, the focus of coking coal exploration will be to determine mineral reserves. Currently, roads dedicated to the needs of exploration mining areas are under construction, large teams of geological exploration personnel are being assembled, and large numbers of drilling rigs are being transported to the mining areas. In terms of iron ore, in addition to the continued progress of existing exploration work, preparations are underway for new iron ore exploration. The various non-ferrous metal mining areas that began exploration last year will further acquire mineral reserves this year. The newly opened non-ferrous metal exploration mining areas this year will be drilled, trenched, and tunnelled in stages.

    中南区进行大规模地质勘探
    中南区自去年开始，展开了空前规模的地下资源勘探工作。经过十几支地质勘探队一年的艰苦努力，为满足国家第一个五年建设计划所需要的资源找到了可观的矿藏量，并奠定了今后进行勘探工作的基础。
    粮食产量占全国第一位的中南区，不仅土壤肥沃，水源充足，适于农业发展，它还是一个有着巨大储量的矿产汇集地带，有色金属特别丰富，铁和煤足够建立巨型的黑色冶金联合企业使用。锡矿储量也相当丰富。此外，中南还有其他多种有用矿物。它们是重工业的基础，开工厂，修铁路，制拖拉机，以及建立国防工业，都离不了这些宝物。为了建立第二个钢铁基地，中央地质部直属四二九队，去年在大冶矿区广大面积内进行了铁矿勘探，他们探明和发现了巨大的铁矿和铁锰共居矿床，去年，中南地质局某锰矿勘探队发现了一个铺展数县的巨大的锰矿床。钢铁工业的粮食——炼焦煤，经过仅仅一年的勘探，在某县就探出了两层主要煤组，已知的矿量远景比预期的矿量大三倍，并可肯定它是很好的炼焦煤。更令人兴奋的是在某地发现了主焦煤，这是一种十分优良的炼焦煤，它比江南著名的萍乡煤矿的煤并无逊色。这一连串的收获，使我国将要新建的一个钢铁中心有了牢靠的根基。
    去年铅锌、铜、钨矿勘探队，也取得了很大的成绩。中南地质局某铅锌矿勘探队去年发现了一个矿区集中的铅锌矿，从他的勘探远景来说，是一个在全世界占有重要地位的铅锌矿。另一铅锌矿勘探队也探得了能够初步解决迫切需要的铅锌矿量。一个钨矿区去年也进行了大规模的勘探。
    今年，位列中央地质部全国重点勘探地区第一位的中南，勘探矿区数目比去年增加近两倍。标志着普查、勘探的红、绿、黑、黄圆点，密密麻麻地分布在中南的地图上。今年全国预期探明的铅锌矿藏几乎全部在中南。
    中南地质局今年将以煤（特别是炼焦煤）、铅锌、锰矿等为勘探重点，并开始勘探黄铁矿和金钢石等；还要在河南中部和湘西地区展开普查工作。今年炼焦煤勘探重点将探明矿量；现在，专供勘探矿区需用的公路正在修筑中，大队地质勘探工作人员正在集中，大批钻机正在往矿区调运。在铁矿方面，除原有勘探工作继续进行外，正筹备进行新的铁矿勘探。去年开始勘探的各有色金属矿区，今年将进一步取得矿量。今年新辟的有色金属勘探矿区，将分期进行钻探、槽探、洞探等工程。
