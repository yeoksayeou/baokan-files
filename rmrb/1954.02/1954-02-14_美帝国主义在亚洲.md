American Imperialism in Asia

So-Called "Technical Assistance"
According to a TASS dispatch from Tehran on January 27, the automobiles of the American mission executing the so-called Truman Point Four Program in Iran have recently been frequently attacked by Iranian farmers. Why does Iran hate the Americans so much? A reporter from the Iranian newspaper "Kachaer" said that the US government, under the guise of "technical assistance," imported a large number of "plague-infected chickens into Iran," resulting in "the mass death of poultry" in Iran. Now, not only have "the prices of chickens and eggs in Iran soared," but even "Iranian dairy products will become rare treasures." In this situation, how can Iranian farmers not be angry!

The Truman Point Four Program, cloaked in "aid" and the so-called development of "backwardness," is just such a trick!

Old Conspiracy with a New Mask
After Nehru openly expressed dissatisfaction with the US-Pakistan conspiracy to conclude a military agreement at a press conference in New Delhi on November 15 last year, Eisenhower, feeling guilty, came out to deny it, saying that his government had not discussed military "aid" and the establishment of bases in Pakistan with Pakistan.

Less than two months later, Eisenhower's lies were exposed by his subordinates. According to United Press International on January 9, citing Washington "authorities," the US government "is about to announce that the US will provide military aid to Pakistan and Iraq." Moreover, according to a reporter from the Lebanese "Life Daily" in Washington, the US "aid" to Pakistan is conditional: after receiving "US aid," Pakistan must join the aggressive alliance planned by the United States with Turkey, Iraq, and other countries. People know that the Middle East aggressive bloc pieced together by the United States for several years has not been realized. This so-called "alliance" being pieced together is precisely an old conspiracy of the US government wearing a new mask.

Afraid of the People's Eyes
According to a TASS dispatch from Cairo on January 20, the US government proposed to Arab countries that if Arab countries accepted its "aid," they must "allow the establishment of US military bases in important strategic areas that can be avoided from the eyes of the people as much as possible."

The US government is so afraid of "the people's eyes," which shows how shameful its activities are!

"Difficult to Drive Them Away"
On January 24, the Prime Minister of Kashmir, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, said at an Indian National Congress meeting held in Kalyani near Calcutta: "Today, Americans come to Kashmir and tell us that they can develop our resources and make us prosperous." "But once they gain a foothold, it will be difficult to drive them away."

After listing the lessons learned from the experiences of countries such as Iran and Egypt, Mohammad said that the only motive for the US to engage in conspiracies in Kashmir is to establish military bases there. Kashmir must oppose any actions by anyone to establish military bases on Kashmiri land.

Building Airfields in Thailand
According to a TASS dispatch from January 13, not long ago, the US government ordered Thailand to speed up the construction of a railway in Thailand passing through Cambodia. Now, the United States is continuing to transport weapons and ammunition to Thailand and has built airfields in northern Thailand that can take off and land heavy aircraft.

It is known that Thailand is bordered by Indochina on its east, south, and north sides. Currently, all the US's conspiratorial activities in Thailand are another way for it to openly interfere in the Indochina war.

    美帝国主义在亚洲
    如此“技术援助”
    据塔斯社德黑兰一月二十七日电讯报道，近来，在伊朗执行所谓杜鲁门第四点计划的美国使团的汽车，时常受到伊朗农民的袭击。伊朗为什么这样痛恨美国佬呢？伊朗“卡查尔报”的记者说，美国政府在“技术援助”的假面具下，把大批“染瘟疫的鸡输入伊朗”，结果造成伊朗“家禽的大批死亡”。现在不仅“伊朗的鸡和鸡蛋价格猛涨”，而且连“伊朗的乳产品将要变成难得的珍品”了。在这种情况下，伊朗农民怎么能不气愤呢！
    披着“援助”和所谓开发“落后”外衣的杜鲁门第四点计划，就是这样的一种把戏！
      戴着新面具的旧阴谋
    去年十一月十五日，尼赫鲁在新德里记者招待会上，对美巴阴谋缔结军事协定公开表示不满后，艾森豪威尔做贼心虚，跟着就出来抵赖说：他的政府并没有和巴基斯坦讨论过军事“援助”和在巴基斯坦建立基地的问题。
    时隔不到两月，艾森豪威尔的谎言就被他的下属揭穿了。据合众社一月九日引华盛顿“权威”人士的话说，美国政府“即将宣布美国以军事援助巴基斯坦和伊拉克”，而且据黎巴嫩“生活报”驻华盛顿记者说，美国“援助”巴基斯坦是有条件的，巴基斯坦得到“美援”后，必须要和土耳其、伊拉克等国一起参加美国策划的侵略联盟。人们知道，美国几年以来所拼凑的中东侵略集团，一直没有实现，这个正在拼凑的所谓“联盟”，正是美国政府戴着新面具的一个旧阴谋。
    害怕人民的眼睛
    据塔斯社开罗一月二十日电讯报道，美国政府曾向阿拉伯国家提议，如果阿拉伯国家接受了它的
  “援助”，必需“允许在尽可能可以避开人民眼睛的重要战略地区，建立美国军事基地”。
    美国政府如此害怕“人民眼睛”，足见它自己干的勾当是多么见不得人了！
        “很难把他们赶走”
    一月二十四日，克什米尔的总理巴克希·吴拉姆·穆罕默德，在加尔各答附近的卡利阿尼举行的印度国大党会议上说：“今天美国人到克什米尔来对我们说，他们能开发我们的富源，使我们昌盛”，“但是，一旦他们取得了一个据点后，便很难把他们赶走”。
    穆罕默德列举了从伊朗、埃及等国的经验中所吸取的教训后说：美国在克什米尔进行阴谋的唯一动机，是想在那里建立军事基地，克什米尔一定要反对任何人在克什米尔的土地上建立军事基地的行动。
      在泰国修飞机场
    据塔斯社一月十三日电讯报道，不久以前，美国政府曾命令泰国加紧修筑泰国通过高棉的一条铁路，现在美国正继续不断地把武器弹药运往泰国，并在泰国北部建筑了能够起落重型飞机的飞机场。
    人们知道，泰国的东、南、北三面紧临着印度支那，目前美国在泰国的一切阴谋活动，正是它公开干涉印度支那战争的另一种方式。
