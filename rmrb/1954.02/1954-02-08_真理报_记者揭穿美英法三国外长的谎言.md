Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 6th (TASS dispatch): "Truth" correspondents Yu. Zhukov and D. Kraminov, in a Berlin dispatch, compared the Western representatives' empty talk at the Berlin Conference about the German people's "freedom of choice" with the cold facts of the Bonn and Paris Treaties.

The correspondents wrote: No matter how much American propaganda embellishes the Bonn and Paris Treaties, the broadest masses of the European people, including the German people, are increasingly aware of the true nature of these treaties. More and more people recognize that these treaties are no better than the oppressive Treaty of Versailles.

Knowing this situation, the Western representatives played tricks at the Berlin Conference, trying to lull the vigilance of the European people. They said that ratifying the Bonn and Paris Treaties does not equal the final decision for West Germany to join the "European Defence Community." They told the German people: "You have the freedom to choose."

However, on the other hand, the entire western part of Germany is firmly trapped in the aggressive bloc and isolated from eastern Germany. In fact, if the Bonn and Paris Treaties are ratified, it will be completely impossible for Germany to restore unification. Because the Federal Republic will no longer have the right to withdraw from the "European Group," and the German Democratic Republic will never put its head in this noose.

Western diplomats cannot conceal this purpose of the Bonn and Paris Treaties, so they verbally deny the consequences of the treaties they themselves drafted.

But no matter how much they embellish the so-called "freedom of choice" of the German people regarding the "European Army" and the "European Defence Community" at the Berlin conference table, they still cannot conceal this cold fact: the drafters of the Bonn and Paris Treaties not only did not give the Germans this freedom, but instead want to deprive the people of West Germany of their already meager rights, and attempt to infringe upon the rights of the people of eastern Germany.

Only West German revanchists can agree to these treaties, and they only want to use this convenient opportunity to establish their own armed forces under the guise of the "European Army," and then, like they did after the First World War, "stage a comeback."

The "Truth" correspondent pointed out: It is precisely for this reason that the abolition of the Bonn and Paris Treaties is now the main prerequisite for restoring German national unification on a democratic basis, according to the demands of the German people. As the government of the German Democratic Republic emphasized in its memorandum, these treaties are the main obstacle to free elections in Germany.

    “真理报”记者揭穿美英法三国外长的谎言
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：“真理报”特派记者尤·茹科夫和德·克拉米诺夫，在一篇柏林通讯里把西方国家代表在柏林会议上所谓德国人民有“选择自由”的花言巧语，和波恩条约与巴黎条约的冷酷事实作了一番比较。
    记者写道：不管美国的宣传把波恩和巴黎条约说得如何天花乱坠，最广泛的欧洲人民，包括德国人民在内，已经越来越明白这些条约的真正性质。越来越多的人认识到，这些条约绝不比压迫性的凡尔赛条约高明。
    西方国家的代表知道这种情况，于是在柏林会议上玩花样，想麻痹欧洲人民的警惕。他们说，批准波恩和巴黎条约并不等于最后决定西德加入“欧洲防务集团”。他们告诉德国人民说：“你们有选择的自由。”
    但是，另一方面，德国的整个西部却被死死套在侵略集团里面，和德国的东部隔离了。事实上，如果波恩和巴黎条约得到批准，德国就完全不可能恢复统一了。因为联邦共和国再不会有权退出“欧洲集团”，而德意志民主共和国是绝不会把它的头伸进这个绞索中去的。
    西方外交家无法隐瞒波恩和巴黎条约的这个目的，因此他们就空口说白话地否认他们自己所拟订的这些条约的后果。
    但是，不管他们在柏林会议桌上把德国人民对于“欧洲军”和“欧洲防务集团”的所谓“选择自由”说得如何天花乱坠，他们仍然不能掩饰这个冷酷的事实：波恩和巴黎条约的草拟者不仅没有给德国人这种自由，相反地要剥夺西德人民的已经少得可怜的权利，并且企图侵犯德国东部人民的权利。
    只有西德复仇主义者才能同意这些条约，而他们也不过是想利用这个方便的机会，在“欧洲军”的幌子下建立他们自己的武装部队，然后像他们在第一次世界大战以后那样，“卷土重来”。
    “真理报”记者指出：正是因为这个缘故，废除波恩和巴黎条约现在是按照德国人民的要求在民主基础上恢复德国国家统一的主要先决条件。正如德意志民主共和国政府在它的备忘录中所强调指出的，这些条约是阻碍德国自由选举的主要障碍。
