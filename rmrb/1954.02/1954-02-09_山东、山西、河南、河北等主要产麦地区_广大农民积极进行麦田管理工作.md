In major wheat-producing areas such as Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, wheat seedlings are generally growing well due to the widespread implementation of rolling, winter cultivation, watering, and topdressing. In Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, each wheat plant has developed five or six tillers, generally two more than in previous years. In Dezhou, Liaocheng, and Linyi Prefectures, Shandong Province, where wheat fields suffered from waterlogging and incomplete plowing last year, the wheat seedlings have turned from yellow to green due to timely deep cultivation by the farmers.

The local people's governments generally attach great importance to the leadership of wheat field management. In Henan Province, through the implementation of the General Line and meetings on production and disaster relief, the past phenomenon of neglecting wheat field management has been basically reversed. After checking and replanting seedlings, Shangqiu, Anyang, Puyang and other prefectures carried out rolling and topdressing. In Shandong Province, Liaocheng, Linyi, Dezhou, and Huimin Prefectures issued pamphlets on "Wheat Overwintering Management Methods" for technical guidance. In Hebei Province, with the specific assistance of technical extension stations, many farmers have changed their past habit of not paying attention to wheat field management. Linyu County originally had no habit of rolling wheat, and wheat seedlings often suffered from frost damage and reduced production. After learning management techniques, most wheat fields were rolled once. In Shanxi Province, Changzhi, Gaoping and other places organized farmers to catch and kill pests in large numbers. In Dongmiao, Hexi and other twenty-two townships and villages, more than 8,000 people were mobilized to catch more than 900 kilograms of locusts. The masses in Ruicheng, Xiaxian and other places actively eliminated wheat aphids, red spiders and other pests. In Xinjiang, Hejin and other places, militias were organized to patrol and eliminate geese damage. The people's governments of Xiaoyi, Fenyang, Pingyao and other counties have explicitly prohibited grazing on wheat seedlings. Some places also held sheep workers' meetings to educate them on the protection of wheat seedlings. All areas with water conservancy conditions have generally carried out watering for frost prevention. For example, in Xingtai Prefecture in Hebei Province, Linyi and Laiyang Prefectures and Laiwu and Jimo Counties in Shandong Province, more than 80% of the wheat fields have been watered for the winter. In Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, six rivers have released water to winter irrigate 160,000 mu, and more than 80,000 mu have been irrigated by wells. Wheat fields in Anyang, Qi County, and Ye County have also been watered once. Other areas such as northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui have carried out winter cultivation, soil compaction, soil mulching, and topdressing.

    山东、山西、河南、河北等主要产麦地区
    广大农民积极进行麦田管理工作
    山东、山西、河南、河北等主要产麦地区，由于较普遍地进行了镇压、冬锄、浇水、施追肥等工作，目前各地麦苗大都生长较好，山东省莱阳专区的小麦每棵已发杈五、六个，一般都比往年增加两个。德州、聊城和临沂等专区去年受涝积水，地未耕透就播种的小麦，由于农民及时加工深锄，麦苗也已由黄变青。
    各地人民政府对麦田管理工作的领导一般都很重视。河南省通过贯彻总路线和生产救灾等会议，已基本上扭转了过去忽视麦田管理工作的现象。商邱、安阳、濮阳等专区在查苗补苗之后，又进行镇压和施追肥等工作。山东省的聊城、临沂、德州、惠民等专署印发了“小麦越冬管理办法”的小册子，进行技术指导。河北省通过技术推广站的具体帮助，很多农民过去不注意小麦田间管理工作的习惯已有改变。临榆县原无轧麦习惯，麦苗常因受冻减产，传授了管理技术后，一般麦田都轧了一遍。山西省长治、高平等地曾大批组织农民捕灭害虫，仅东苗、河西等二十二个乡、村就发动群众八千多人，捕蝗九百多斤；芮城、夏县等地群众并积极除治麦蚜、红蜘蛛等虫害；新绛、河津等地以民兵为骨干组织青壮年轮流巡查，消灭雁害；孝义、汾阳、平遥等县人民政府都明令禁止牧放麦青。有的地方还召开了羊工会议，进行保护麦苗教育。凡是有水利条件的地区，都普遍进行浇冻水。如河北省的邢台专区、山东省的临沂、莱阳专区和莱芜、即墨等县，百分之八十以上的麦田都进行了冬浇。河南省新乡专区六条河渠已放水冬浇十六万亩，井浇八万余亩，安阳、淇县、邺县等地麦田也都浇了一遍。其他如苏北、皖北等地都进行了冬锄、压土、培土和施追肥等工作。
