How the Xichenggang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative Was Established
By our reporter Lü Jianzhong

The Xichenggang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative is the first agricultural production cooperative in Yanling County, Henan Province. This cooperative was established directly from a temporary mutual aid team. For the past two years, the cooperative's output has been consistently high, and the income of its members has been consistently substantial. This proves that, given the necessary conditions, cooperatives can be successfully established on the basis of temporary mutual aid teams.

In the first year after the establishment of the Xichenggang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, a bumper harvest was achieved: sorghum and millet production increased by about 30% compared to 1952, about 35% higher than that of the masses outside the cooperative; if sweet potatoes and cotton were also converted into grain, the average income per person was more than 1,100 jin of grain, and sideline production also earned more than 11 million yuan; in 1952, seven households among the cooperative members did not have enough to eat, but last year every household had surplus grain; Cheng Bo used to sell trees to buy grain to eat, but last year he sold 500 jin of grain to the state; Cheng Shao Yi had more than 20 mu of land, many children, and relied solely on his own labor. He used to get sick often, and everyone knew that he was constantly burdened by new debts on top of old ones. In the most difficult times, he even pulled the grass from the chicken coop to feed the livestock. Last year, he was sick for half a year and unable to work. Obviously, if he had not joined the cooperative, he would have been on the road to poverty and bankruptcy. However, last year, during the summer and autumn harvests, he had a net income of 3,000 jin of grain and 5,300 jin of sweet potatoes, paid off his debts, and even sold 100 jin of surplus grain.

The farmers of Xichenggang Village had intermittently organized temporary mutual aid teams as early as after the end of the land reform, which solved some of the difficulties of insufficient livestock, farm tools, and labor; however, the contradiction between collective labor and decentralized management of the mutual aid teams troubled them for a long time. In April 1952, they learned from reading the newspaper about the upgrading of the mutual aid team led by Su Dianxuan to an agricultural production cooperative, and they also had a preliminary understanding of the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, which made them very excited. At this time, nine poor peasant households and four middle peasant households voluntarily applied to join the cooperative. After another 20 days of deliberation, the cooperative's charter was drawn up, and it was decided that land would be contributed according to the number of mu on the land certificate, and Cheng Yingchen, a poor peasant who had worked as a car worker for ten years, was democratically elected as the head of the cooperative. By June, the cooperative was announced to be established.

After the establishment of the cooperative, some difficulties were quickly encountered: the members had not been trained in permanent mutual aid teams, lacked experience in work evaluation and scorekeeping, and lacked the habit of collective labor, etc. After Cheng Yingchen became the head of the cooperative, he promoted democracy in everything, led by example, not only actively participating in labor himself, but also organizing members to learn and improve production techniques. When planting wheat, they learned about close planting, rational fertilization, and watering from the newspaper, and when planting cotton, they learned from Qu Yaoli's advanced experience; he personally led the women to the fields to practice pruning and topping, and implemented a system of group-based contracting of cotton fields. The members were very satisfied with the democratic management methods and work evaluation and scorekeeping methods implemented by the cooperative. After the establishment of the cooperative, the members got rid of the burden of feeding their own livestock, and after dinner, they all gathered in the office to evaluate work points and arrange for the next day's work. Sometimes they also read newspapers, and their morale was high. However, at the beginning, the members were still a little reluctant to break through the face-saving barrier in evaluating work points, which made the cooperative cadres very busy and often resulted in unreasonable evaluations. The leaders of the district pointed out this shortcoming, and Cheng Yingchen discussed with the members the implementation of the so-called "rotating executive chairman" method, that is, three people would be in charge of the work evaluation and scorekeeping for one month, and after one month, they would summarize their experience and report the accounts to the chief accountant, and then another three people would be responsible for the next month. In this way, in addition to the head of the cooperative overseeing the whole situation, the members' work ability and sense of collective responsibility could also be trained. Once, the cooperative member Cheng Shaozeng took three and a half days to do two days' worth of work, and everyone criticized him and deducted nine points from him, which he did not understand. Afterwards, Cheng Yingchen personally went to work on his thinking, and although he said he had no objection, he was still unconvinced in his heart. Later, the members conducted several strict criticisms of the Youth League members Cheng Bo and Cheng Xi. Cheng Bo's parents had died of starvation in famine years, and he had not been taught or cared for in the old society, which had cultivated a lazy nature in him. The manure in his field was left until the second year before being composted. After joining the cooperative, he always wanted to smoke a cigarette before going to work, and he worked listlessly. Cheng Xi was impatient and often used sarcastic and attacking methods to treat Cheng Bo, so the two constantly quarreled, which affected production. The Youth League members took the lead in criticizing Cheng Bo, enlightening his class consciousness through recollection and comparison, and pointing out to him that only active labor could achieve a socialist happy life; at the same time, they also criticized Cheng Xi for his impatience and for not being patient with the members, which affected unity within the cooperative. Cheng Xi made a self-criticism, and Cheng Bo also received a profound education and gradually became active in labor. The masses praised, "That lazy child, Cheng Bo, has become a diligent person since joining the cooperative." This incident educated all the members, and even more so, Cheng Shaozeng. After some time, Cheng Wen Kui, who fed the livestock in the cooperative, fell ill, and the members wanted Cheng Shaozeng to temporarily replace Cheng Wen Kui in feeding the livestock. He worked very hard. In the past, the members took turns carrying water, but now he went to carry it himself, and he carried several loads of water, moved several baskets of soil, and chopped several bundles of grass every day, which he remembered clearly. When the ten days were over and the work points were being evaluated, the members evaluated fairly. Cheng Shaozeng did better than Cheng Shao Yi, so he was given 90 points, and Cheng Shao Yi was given 58 points. He carried more water than Cheng Wen Kui, but Cheng Wen Kui went to the fields to cut grass and feed the livestock more often than he did, so he was given the same number of points as Cheng Wen Kui, and he was secretly convinced.

Once, the cooperative's cow gave birth to a calf. Cheng Yingchen was too tired during the day and slept very soundly. When he woke up, the calf had already been born for two hours and was about to freeze to death. He quickly started a fire, and the calf slowly recovered. The members forgave Cheng Yingchen for this fault, but Cheng Yingchen sincerely examined his own shortcomings of not being responsible enough, not cherishing the cooperative's public property, and not caring about the interests of the cooperative's big family. His self-criticism educated and moved the members, and Cheng Shaozeng received an even more profound education. Soon, the cooperative's wheat ripened. Because the wheat had plenty of manure and water, and was densely planted, although it was attacked by severe frost, the damage was very light, and the average yield per mu was 204 jin, exceeding the original plan by 24 jin. Cheng Shaozeng unprecedentedly received four shi of wheat for the first time, more than two shi more than in 1952. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep at night. Recalling Cheng Yingchen's self-criticism, he suddenly felt a flash of enlightenment in his mind, and felt that criticism was not so hateful anymore. From then on, he cared about the cooperative from the bottom of his heart. Not only was he able to fairly carry out his "executive chairman" duties, but sometimes when everyone gave him a high score, he would voluntarily lower it. The members praised him: his stubborn mind had changed. He said, "From now on, if I do anything wrong, you can criticize me as much as you want."

The members increasingly felt that criticism and self-criticism were indispensable. No matter who it was, whenever everyone was preparing to criticize his shortcomings and mistakes, he would always sincerely say, "I should make progress again." In this way, the consolidation and unity of the whole cooperative and the production enthusiasm of the members were constantly maintained.

After this period of training, the Xichenggang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative obviously had a solid foundation. Therefore, during the spring plowing and sowing last year, it was dry, so it was necessary to water the wheat, sow seeds, and participate in the Huai River project. This was difficult for mutual aid teams, especially individual households, to balance. However, things were done in an orderly manner in their cooperative: six young cooperative members went to the Huai River construction site, and the cooperative rationally allocated 26 male and female laborers, with some people watering the wheat and others spring plowing and sowing; the uneven land in the past was leveled by hand; even Cheng Shao Yi's land, which had not been fertilized for 11 years, was fully fertilized. The cooperative's land was planted with cotton, millet, and sorghum according to different soil types. They enthusiastically learned the high-yield experience of "Golden Star Medal Winner - Ren Guodong," and also went to the fields to check seedlings and calculate carefully. For example, if one mu of sorghum was missing 200 seedlings, calculated at 1.5 taels of grain per seedling, one mu would yield 18 jin and 12 taels less, and the whole cooperative's 30 mu of sorghum would yield 562.5 jin less. Everyone suddenly realized, "We also lost a lot of horses in the past!" So they went to the fields in groups to "find horses"; the millet seedlings were filled in and a triangular seedling setting was implemented; the sorghum was also thinned, replanted, and pruned by women by hand. The masses outside the cooperative all looked at them with envious eyes. Cheng Yingchen also personally made a typical demonstration, promoting the cooperative and the whole village to break with conventions and launch a wheat watering campaign, which made the whole village repair wells and form a craze, achieving the goal of being able to water 90% of the land in the whole village.

During the wheat harvest and autumn planting season, it was dry again, and the cooperative once again demonstrated its superiority. Cheng Yingchen led 21 women to cut wheat, and 100 mu of land was originally planned to be cut in four days, but it was cut in three days. Cheng Liushuang, the agricultural director of the cooperative, led six people to transport wheat and threshing grounds with carts and livestock, and organized eight laborers to use the two water carts loaned by the government to water the land to plant beans and sweet potatoes, and to water sorghum and cotton, completing the summer harvest and summer planting tasks in a timely manner.

In November last year, when Cheng Yingchen was studying the general line at the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Training Class held by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, he made a typical speech on the experience and achievements of the Xichenggang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative over the past year. His speech aroused great interest among all the trainees and cadres. The trainees congratulated him on his victory and said: You have taken a step towards socialism earlier. If everyone has your spirit of unity and learning, our province will surely have many cooperatives established directly from temporary mutual aid teams.

After Cheng Yingchen returned to the village, he confidently led the members of the cooperative and the masses of the whole village to study the general line in light of their own practical experiences. Socialism became the goal of everyone's day and night dreams. They further clarified their understanding: the cooperative is more superior than the mutual aid team, and the members' lives can rise together more effectively because it has more socialist components. Everyone unanimously agreed to change the "four-six" dividend system to a fixed land rent, with land and labor sharing half of the dividends, and all increased production going to the labor dividend system. It was precisely because of this awareness that the temporary mutual aid teams and individual farmers in the whole village asked to "get on the boat to transition." The individual farmer Cheng Farong also joined the cooperative, and the cooperative expanded to 34 households.

    西程岗村农业生产合作社是怎样办起来的
    本报记者　吕建中
    西程岗村农业生产合作社是河南鄢陵县第一个农业生产合作社。这个合作社是由临时互助组直接办起来的。两年来，这个合作社的产量一直很高，社员收入一直很多。这就证明：只要具备必要的条件，在临时性互助组的基础上，同样可以办好合作社。
    西程岗村农业生产合作社成立后的第一年，就丰收了：高粱谷子比一九五二年增产三成左右，比社外群众约高百分之三十五；如果把红薯、棉花也折成粮食，每人平均收入一千一百多斤粮，副业生产也赚了一千一百多万元；社员中一九五二年有七户不够吃，去年家家都有余粮；程波过去把树卖了买粮食吃，去年却卖了五百斤粮食给国家；程绍伊二十多亩地，孩子多，全靠他一人劳动，他过去就时常生病，谁都知道他年年新债压旧债，最困难的时候，把鸡窝上的草都扒下来喂了牲口，去年又生了半年病，没能参加劳动，很显然，如果不参加合作社，他只有走上贫困破产的道路，但是去年夏秋两季，他却净收入三千斤粮食和五千三百斤红薯，还了债，还卖了一百斤余粮。
    西程岗村的农民，远在土地改革结束以后就曾断断续续地组织过临时互助组，也解决了一部分牲畜、农具和劳力不足的困难；但是互助组集体劳动和分散经营的矛盾，却使他们长期感到苦恼。一九五二年四月他们从读报中知道了苏殿选领导的互助组提高为农业生产合作社的消息，又初步认识了农业生产合作社的优越性，都非常兴奋。这时就有九户贫农、四户中农自愿报名参加社。又经过二十天的酝酿，订出社章，决定土地按土地证的亩数入股，并民主选出曾做过十年汽车工人的贫苦农民程应臣为社长。到了六月，合作社便宣告成立了。
    合作社建立后，很快碰到了一些困难：社员们没有经过常年互助组的锻炼，缺乏评工记分的经验和集体劳动的习惯，等等。程应臣当了社长以后，事事发扬民主，以身作则，不光自己积极劳动，还组织社员学习改进生产技术。种麦时从报纸上学习密植、合理施肥和浇水，种棉花时学习了曲耀离的先进经验；他亲自领导妇女们到田间实习整枝打杈，并实行分组包片管理棉田。社员们对社里实行的民主管理办法和评工记分办法，非常满意。建社以后，社员们去掉了自己喂牲口的负担，晚饭后都聚在办公室里评工分，安排明天的活，有时还读报纸，情绪很高。不过，社员们开始对评工记分还有些打不破情面，弄得社干部忙乱不堪，还往往评得不够合理。区的领导方面指出了这个缺点，程应臣便和社员们讨论实行所谓“轮流执行主席”的办法，即每三人掌握一个月的评工记分工作，一月完毕，总结一次经验，把账目汇报给总会计，下月再换另三人负责掌握。这样除社长全盘掌握外，还能锻炼社员们的工作能力与集体负责精神。有一次，社员程绍曾把两天的活做了三天半，大家批评他，给他扣了九分，他思想不通。事后程应臣亲自去打通他的思想，他口说没意见，心里仍然不服。后来社员们又对青年团员程波、程喜进行了几次严格的批评。程波的父母很早就在荒年里饿死了，他在旧社会没人教管，养成一种懒性，他场里的沫子放到第二年还不积肥。入社以后，每天人家都做活去了，他偏要吸会儿烟才走，干活疲疲沓沓。程喜性子急，常用讽刺打击的办法对待程波，因此两人不断吵架，影响生产。青年团员们带头向程波开展批评，通过回忆对比，启发他的阶级觉悟，并向他指出只有积极劳动才能实现社会主义的幸福生活；同时也批评了程喜性情暴躁，帮助社员不耐心，影响社内团结。程喜作了检讨，程波也受到深刻的教育，逐渐积极劳动起来。群众都夸奖：“程波那懒孩子入了社变成勤人啦。”这件事教育了全体社员，更教育了程绍曾。又过了些时，社里喂牲口的程文奎生病了，社员要程绍曾临时代替程文奎喂牲口。他干的很起劲，往常是社员们轮流挑水，现在他自己去挑，而且每天挑了几担水，抬了几筐土，铡了几把草，他记得清清楚楚。等到干完十天，进行评工记分的时候，社员们评的很公平。程绍曾比程绍伊干的好，因此给他评九十分，给程绍伊评五十八分。他比程文奎多挑了水，但程文奎却比他多下地割草喂牲口，因此给他和程文奎评的分数一样多，他心里暗暗地服气了。
    有一次，社里的母牛生小牛，程应臣因为白天过于疲劳，睡的挺沉，一觉醒来，小牛已经生下了两个钟头，快要冻死了。他连忙生起火，小牛才慢慢苏醒过来。社员们对程应臣这点过失是原谅的，但是程应臣却诚恳地检讨了自己的责任心不强、对社内公共财产不爱护、不关心合作社这个大家庭的利益的缺点。他的检讨，教育并感动了社员们，程绍曾受到更深刻的教育。不久，社里小麦熟了。小麦因为粪多水足，又是密植的，虽然遭到严霜的袭击，受害却很轻，每亩平均收二百零四斤，超过原计划二十四斤。程绍曾破天荒第一次收到了四石小麦，比一九五二年多收两石多。他兴奋得晚上睡不着，回忆起程应臣那次的检讨，忽然觉得脑子里亮了一下，感到开展批评不是那样的可憎了。从此他从心底关心合作社，不仅能够公正地执行他的“执行主席”的任务，而且有时大家给他评的分高了，他还主动地减低。社员们表扬他：死脑筋转变了。他说：“我呀，以后我啥事办的不对，你们尽管批评我啦。”
    社员们越来越感到批评与自我批评是不可缺少的了。不论谁，每当大家准备对他的缺点和错误进行批评的时候，他总是诚恳地表示：“我又该进步了。”这样便经常保持了全社的巩固团结和社员们的生产积极性。
  经过这一时期的锻炼，西程岗村农业生产合作社显然有了巩固的基础。因此，在去年春耕播种的时候，天旱了，要浇麦，要播种，还要参加治淮，这在互助组，尤其是单干户是很难兼顾的。他们社里却做得井井有条：六个青年社员上了治淮工地，社里把二十六个男女劳动力合理地搭配开，一部分人浇麦，一部分人春耕播种；过去不平的地，用人工翻平了；程绍伊那十一年没上粪的地，也上足了粪。全社土地分别不同土质播种棉花、谷子和高粱。他们热情地学习了“金星奖章获得者——任国栋”的丰产经验，也下地查苗，算细账。例如，高粱一亩，缺苗二百棵，以每棵收一两半粮计算，一亩就少收十八斤十二两，全社三十亩高粱，就少收五百六十二斤半。大家恍然大悟地说：“过去咱也丢了不少的马呀！”于是便分组下地“找马”；谷子补齐了苗，并实行三角定苗；高粱也由妇女用手工间苗、补苗和打杈了。社外群众都以羡慕的眼光望着他们。程应臣并亲自做了典型示范，推动全社和全村打破惯例，展开了浇麦运动，使全村整修水井形成热潮，做到了全村百分之九十的土地都能浇水。
    收麦种秋季节，天又旱了，合作社再次显示了它的优越性。程应臣带领二十一个妇女割麦，一百亩地原计划割四天，三天就割完了。社里农业股长程留双领着六个人用大车、牲口拉麦和辗场，又组织八个劳力，用政府贷给的两部水车，一面浇地种豆子，栽红薯，一面浇高粱和棉花，及时地完成了夏收夏种任务。
    去年十一月间，程应臣在中共河南省委举办的互助合作训练班学习总路线时，把西程岗村农业生产合作社一年多来的经历和成绩做了典型发言。他的发言引起了全体学员和干部的极大兴趣。学员们祝贺他的胜利，说：您们早朝社会主义走了一步，如果大家都有您们那样的团结和学习精神，咱全省一定会出现不少由临时互助组直接办起来的合作社。
    程应臣回村以后，便满怀信心地领导社员和全村群众，结合自己的实际体验学习了总路线。社会主义更成为大家朝思暮想的奋斗目标了。他们进一步明确认识了：合作社所以比互助组更优越，社员生活所以更能共同上升，就是因为它有更多的社会主义成分，大家便一致同意把“倒四六”的分红制改为固定地租，土地劳力对半分红，增产部分全归劳力的分红制。也正因为有了这种觉悟，全村那些临时互助组和单干农民纷纷要求“上船过渡”，单干农民程发荣也入了社，合作社扩大到三十四户。
