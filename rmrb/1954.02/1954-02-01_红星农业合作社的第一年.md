    The First Year of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Xueke
    The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, established in 1953, with a total of nineteen member households, experienced an unprecedented bumper harvest in its first year of growth. The cooperative's total land area of ​​more than 169 mu yielded an average rice harvest of 620 jin per mu, an increase of 15 percent compared to the mutual aid team years. It also exceeded the local mutual aid teams' yield by 10 percent. Thanks to collective management, costs were reduced by 59.7 percent compared to the mutual aid team years. As a result, the total rice income of the cooperative members for the whole year was over 100,000 jin, with a net income reaching 79,228 jin.

    The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in Changlou Township, Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province. Situated in the Yangtze River Delta, a relatively developed region economically and culturally, with fertile land, it is a rice paddy area with complex cultivation requiring a large labor force. Farmers originally had various forms of primitive mutual aid. Therefore, although this is a new area where the mutual aid and cooperation movement only began after the land reform ended in 1950, the movement developed rapidly. The predecessors of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, the Shen Jinyun and Wu Baoyun perennial mutual aid teams, were developed and improved from temporary seasonal mutual aid teams in 1950. During the mutual aid team period, the advantages of collective labor were leveraged, which promoted the year-by-year increase in output. According to the statistics of the twelve households in the Shen Jinyun team, the output per mu in 1948 before liberation was 377 jin of rice, which increased to 408 jin per mu in 1950 when it was first organized, 477 jin in 1951, and 539.5 jin in 1952. However, the potential of collective labor built on the basis of decentralized management is, after all, limited. A year ago, with the requirements of production development, the team members already felt that there were unsolvable contradictions between collective labor and decentralized management. Labor, land, and animal power could not be fully utilized, and the effectiveness of tools could not be brought into play. In addition, they were educated on the direction of the Party's agricultural production development and influenced by the establishment of cooperatives in neighboring counties, so the demand for building a cooperative rapidly increased. They established their own agricultural production cooperative in 1953. After the establishment of the cooperative, land was pooled as shares and managed uniformly, which not only overcame the contradictions that occurred in production during the mutual aid team period, but also created conditions for carrying out planned agricultural basic construction, engaging in various production reforms, and opening up broad avenues for generally and rapidly increasing production and income.

    After the establishment of the cooperative, all fifty plots of land in the community were merged and adjusted to forty-three plots, turning fragmented fields into whole fields. More than nine mu of land distributed more than three li away were negotiated and exchanged with farmers from other villages, turning distant fields into nearby fields. This saved time and labor wasted on traveling long distances in the past. In the past, during the mutual aid team period, four middle-peasant households occupied more than twenty mu of land, averaging 3.35 mu per person, with only four full laborers and seven half laborers. They felt a shortage of labor and were afraid of high costs, so they dared not invest much in the land; while fifteen poor and farm laborer households occupied only 105 mu of land, averaging 2.2 mu per person, but had thirteen full laborers and thirteen half laborers, and the surplus labor force felt they could not find a way out. Since the unified management of land after the establishment of the cooperative, labor has been rationally used according to the actual needs of each plot of land. Not only can land processing be vigorously carried out, but also the surplus labor force can be invested in sideline production to increase income. Last year, in addition to jointly raising four pigs and planting more than six mu of vegetables, the cooperative obtained 2,916 jin of rice from planned dispatch of surplus labor to work outside.

    In the past, during the mutual aid team period, each household had four cattle and seven waterwheels. Among them, the middle peasants occupied 3.5 cattle and five waterwheels. When plowing the fields and drawing water, the poor and farm laborers watched them do it first, and it was impossible to do timely and careful farming. After the establishment of the cooperative, plowing cattle and farm implements were used uniformly. Generally, the fields were plowed three times and harrowed ten times, and the deep plowing reached five inches. Because the field boundaries were opened up, water was applied by zones, and the number of waterwheel inlets was reduced to seven. The irrigation efficiency of the waterwheels expanded from 25 mu to 40 mu. Not only did the whole cooperative not feel that it was not enough, but it also had the strength to help farmers outside the cooperative to draw water for 14.5 mu.

    Not only that, but due to the unified management, the whole cooperative, based on the distribution of land, uniformly and rationally organized the labor force and concentrated the financial resources of the members to carry out basic agricultural production construction in a planned way, and managed each piece of land well, creating material conditions for generally increasing production. In the preparation stage of spring plowing, the whole cooperative used 400 man-days to repair seven small rivers and two ponds, benefiting 150 mu of fields. They also used more than 30 man-days to carry 1,600 dan of river mud to improve the soil of 16 mu of white alkaline land. At the same time, due to the members' investment in fertilizer accumulation and the government's loan assistance, every field was fertilized. In the past, Zhang Xueqing and other four households' 21 mu of fields had not been sufficiently fertilized for decades due to financial difficulties, and the yield was very low. Last year, because it was fertilized the same as other fields in the cooperative, the yield per mu increased to more than 560 jin.

    Other agricultural science and technology could not be well promoted due to the past decentralized management. After the establishment of the cooperative, they systematically learned and applied the rice cultivation technology of Chen Yongkang, the national rice high-yield model. Although the first year of the establishment of the cooperative encountered severe droughts in both spring and autumn, the cooperative's unified use of labor, land, and the promotion of new technologies ensured the victory over the drought and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    Establishing agricultural production cooperatives to transform the backward small-peasant economy into an advanced cooperative economy is an arduous process of socialist transformation. The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative was able to fully exert the superiority and role of collective management, increase production, because all the members continuously improved their socialist consciousness in the process of establishing the cooperative, production, and distribution, and gradually and profoundly realized the superiority of collective management and constantly overcame individualism and conservative ideas.

    In the process of building the cooperative, although the members had gone through the Party's education on the socialist prospects and the various policies for building the cooperative, and smoothly solved the problem of land appraisal and investment, and formulated various methods for business management, distribution of income from agriculture and sideline industries, everyone happily joined the cooperative. However, before everyone had personally benefited from the cooperative and had the habit and experience of collective management, the farmers had more concerns and more problems occurred. In the preparation stage of spring plowing, after everyone began to see the benefits of collective management from the construction of farmland water conservancy and soil improvement, on the one hand, they expressed confidence in running the cooperative, on the other hand, everyone tried to earn more "work points." For example, during spring plowing, because hoeing the fields was heavy work, it was quality- and quantity-oriented and paid by the piece. You could get more work points every day, so many people did not obey the cooperative's unified organization and deployment of labor and crowded to hoe the fields; some people only cared about the quantity of hoeing the fields and did not care about the quality, and the fields were not hoed to a depth of five inches. Later, under the leadership of the Party, collective education that the interests of the cooperative and the members were consistent was carried out in a timely manner. After everyone clearly realized that each member was the master of the cooperative, they corrected their behavior. After the members' awareness was raised, they not only actively worked themselves, but also dared to criticize behaviors that harmed the collective interests. Especially after the autumn harvest, when the members saw that the output had increased so much and everyone's income had increased so much, they further realized the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives. Especially after the Party carried out a large-scale publicity of the general line to the farmers in late November last year, the socialist awareness of the members was raised another step. In recollection and comparison, everyone not only further recognized that the small-peasant economy was the root of poverty and suffering, but also recognized that the first year of building the cooperative was only the first step on the road to getting rid of the poverty of the small-peasant economy. To reach socialism and completely get rid of poverty, we must go through a long process of hard work. In order to support the general line with practical actions, in addition to selling more than 51,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, after selling the grain, they actively carried out expanded reproduction this year. Thirteen members with surplus grain invested 6.95 million yuan in the cooperative to expand the cooperative's reproduction this year. Now, in addition to actively planning to buy two more plowing cattle, repair boats, add plows, waterwheel boards and other farm implements, and purchase 100 dan of cottonseed cake fertilizer and 3,400 jin of field fertilizer, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative is also actively carrying out winter production. In addition to planting 6.7 mu of vegetables well, before the Spring Festival, they will break up the mud on 140 mu of safflower grass fields and apply a top dressing of fertilizer once on 30 mu of fields to increase production.

    红星农业合作社的第一年
    本报记者　朱学科
    红星农业生产合作社，是一九五三年建立的，共十九户社员。它成长的第一年，就给社员们带来了空前的大丰收。全社一百六十九亩多土地，平均每亩收稻达六百二十斤。比前年在互助组时增产百分之十五。比当年当地互助组多收百分之十。由于集体经营，成本也比前年互助组时降低了百分之五十九点七。因之，社员们全年总收入稻子为十万余斤，纯收入即达七万九千二百二十八斤。
    红星农业生产合作社，在江苏省松江县长娄乡。地处长江三角洲，经济文化比较发达，土地肥沃，是水稻田地区，耕作较复杂，需要劳动力较多，农民们原就有各种原始的互助伴工形式，因之，这里虽是新区，在一九五○年结束土地改革后才开展互助合作运动，但运动发展很快。红星农业生产合作社的前身沈金云、吴宝云两个常年互助组，就是由一九五○年临时季节性互助组发展提高起来的。在互助组时期，由于发挥了集体劳动的优越性，曾促使产量逐年提高，据沈金云组十二户的历年产量统计，在解放前的一九四八年，每亩产稻三百七十七斤，刚组织起来的一九五○年，每亩产量提高到四百○八斤，一九五一年为四百七十七斤，一九五二年为五百三十九斤半。但建筑在分散经营基础上的集体劳动，对于生产潜在力的发挥，毕竟是有限度的。一年以前，随着生产发展的要求，组员们已经感到集体劳动与分散经营之间存在着矛盾不能解决，劳力、地力和畜力不能充分利用，工具效能不能发挥。加之，他们受到党的农业生产发展方向的教育，及邻县办社的影响，建社的要求就迅速高涨起来。在一九五三年建立了自己的农业生产合作社。建社后，由于土地入股统一经营，不仅克服了互助组时生产上所发生的矛盾。而且有条件来进行有计划的农业基本建设。从事各项生产改革，为普遍而迅速的提高产量，增加收入，开辟了广阔的道路。
    建社后，全社五十块土地，归并调整为四十三块。使零田变为整田。并把分布在三里以外的九亩多田，与外村农民议换，使远田变为近田。这样就节约了过去跑远路的时间和劳力浪费。过去是互助组时，四户中农占有二十多亩土地，每人平均三亩三分五厘，只有四个全劳动力，七个半劳动力，感到劳力缺乏，又怕成本费用大，不敢放手在土地上加工；而十五户贫、雇农，占有土地只有一百○五亩，每人平均为二亩二分，却有十三个全劳动力，十三个半劳动力，剩余劳动力感到找不到出路。自建社后土地统一经营，根据每块土地的实际需要，合理使用劳动力，不但能大力进行土地加工，还能把剩余劳动力投入副业生产，增加收入。去年，社里除合养四只猪，种六亩多蔬菜以外，单是有计划的调派剩余劳力出外做工，就获得工资二千九百十六斤稻谷。
    过去在互助组时，各户共有四头牛，七部水车。其中中农又占有三只半牛，五部水车，耕田打水，贫、雇农都看着他们先做，无法做到及时的精耕细作，成立合作社以后，耕牛、农具统一使用，一般田都做到三耕十耙，深耕达五寸，由于田界打通了，进行划片上水，车水口减少为七个。水车的灌溉效能从二十五亩扩大到四十亩。全社不但不感到它不够用，而且还有力量帮社外农民打水十四亩半。
    不仅如此，由于统一经营以后，全社根据土地分布的形势，统一而合理的组织劳动力，集中社员财力来有计划的进行农业生产基本建设，经营好每一块土地。为普遍提高产量创造了物质条件。在春耕生产准备阶段，全社以四百个人工，兴修了七条小河，二个水塘，使一百五十亩田受益。又以三十多个人工，挑了一千六百担河泥，改良了十六亩白坂田的土壤。同时，由于社员投资、积肥，和政府的贷款帮助，使每一块田都上了肥料。过去张雪庆等四户的二十一亩田，因为生活困难，几十年来就没下足肥料，产量很低，去年因它与社里别的田同样上肥，每亩产量都提高达五百六十斤以上。
    其他农业科学技术也由于过去分散经营，不能很好的推广。建社后他们系统地学习和运用了全国水稻丰产模范陈永康的水稻栽培技术，虽然建社的第一年就遇到了春、秋两季大旱，由于社的统一使用劳力、土地及推行了新技术，保证了胜利地战胜旱灾，获得了空前的丰收。
    建立农业生产合作社，使落后的小农经济，变为先进的合作社经济，是一个艰苦的社会主义改造过程。红星农业生产合作社在建社一年中，所以能够充分发挥它集体经营的优越性和作用，提高产量，这是与全体社员在建社、生产和分配的过程中，不断提高社会主义觉悟，逐步深刻认识到集体经营的优越性，和不断克服个人主义及保守思想是分不开的。
    在建社过程中，社员们虽经过党的社会主义前途、建社的各项政策教育，顺利地解决了土地评产入股问题，制订出经营管理、农副业收益分配等各项办法，大家高兴地入了社。但当每个人还没有亲身得到社的好处，还没有集体经营的习惯和经验以前，农民的顾虑是较多的，发生问题也是较多的。在春耕生产准备阶段，大家从兴修农田水利，改良土壤等工作上，开始看到集体经营的好处后，一方面表示对办社有信心，另方面各人又变着方儿想多挣“工分”。如春耕时，由于刨田活重，是定质定量、按件计工，每天可以多得工分，很多人就不服从全社对劳动的统一组织调配，都拥去锛田；有些人刨田只顾量，不顾质，田刨不到五寸深。后来，在党的领导下，及时进行社与社员利益一致的集体主义教育，大家明确认识到每个社员都是社的主人以后，才改正过来，社员们觉悟提高后，不但自己积极劳动，对破坏集体利益的行为也敢进行批评了。特别是秋收以后，社员们见到产量提高得这样多，每人收入增加得这样多，才进一步认识了农业生产合作社的好处，尤其是经过去年十一月下旬党大张旗鼓地向农民进行了总路线宣传后，社员们的社会主义觉悟，又提高了一步。在回忆、对比中，大家不但进一步认清了小农经济是穷困的苦根，更认识到建社第一年，才是在摆脱小农经济穷困的道路上走了第一步。要走到社会主义，完全摆脱穷困，还要经过长期的努力过程。他们为了以实际行动来拥护总路线，除将全社五万一千斤余粮售给国家外，在售粮后更积极地进行今年的扩大再生产，有余粮的十三户社员向社投资达六百九十五万元，以扩大全社今年的再生产。现在，红星农业生产合作社除积极计划再添买两头耕牛、修理船只、添置犁头、水车板等农具和购肥一百担棉子饼及三千四百斤肥田粉外，还积极开展了冬季生产，他们除把六亩七分蔬菜种好外，在春节前，要敲碎一百四十亩红花草田的泥块，在三十亩田中增施一次追肥，以提高产量。
