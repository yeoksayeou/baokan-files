Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7th: Marshal Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, issued an order to all officers and men of the Korean People's Army to celebrate Army Day. The full text is as follows:

Comrades, heroic soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers, and generals of the Korean People's Army!

Today, all the Korean people and the soldiers of the People's Army are welcoming the sixth anniversary of the founding of the heroic Korean People's Army in an environment of solemnly struggling to restore and develop the post-war people's economy and to strive for the peaceful reunification and independence of the motherland.

Our people have entered a new stage of their development after achieving a great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. Now, the Korean people, receiving tremendous material and technical assistance from the great Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, are rising up to carry out the restoration and construction of the post-war people's economy by strengthening the democratic base.

On the occasion of welcoming the first Army Day after the war, I congratulate you in the name of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government, and order you:

One, the American imperialists, disregarding the common will and desire of the people to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, are openly creating a series of provocative actions that violate the armistice agreement. Under such circumstances, all soldiers of the People's Army must unremittingly maintain a tense and mobilized posture, sharply monitor the enemy's every move, and resolutely defend the already achieved results of the armistice and the people's peaceful labor.

Two, all soldiers of the People's Army must further consolidate the fighting friendship and unity with the heroic soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In order to make our People's Army a powerful army with a high level of proficiency, we must vigorously strengthen the military discipline and organization of the troops; give full play to all initiative and talent; vigorously conduct combat and political training; and master, cherish, and safeguard our weapons and combat equipment. The soldiers of all technical arms units must do their utmost to improve their technical level.

Three, all commanders and political workers must further improve their military and political knowledge, improve their art of leadership in educating their subordinates, and tirelessly educate every soldier to develop loyalty to the motherland, the people, and the Korean Workers' Party, and the spirit of consciously carrying out their military tasks and defending the responsibilities of the motherland.

Comrades, soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers, and generals of the People's Army!

I am confident that you will faithfully carry out the above tasks, firmly defend the victory we have won with blood, strengthen the combat effectiveness of the People's Army as solid as an iron wall, and actively assist the people in their construction struggle.

Long live the heroic Korean People's Army!

Long live the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers!

Long live our glorious motherland – the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

Long live the Korean Workers' Party, the leading and guiding force of the Korean people!

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7th: The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, and the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, respectively sent telegrams to all officers and men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Korean People's Army, congratulating them on the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Army.

The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Workers' Party pointed out the historic great victory achieved by the soldiers of the People's Army in the Fatherland Liberation War, and called on them to monitor every move of the American and Li bandit gangs with high vigilance, constantly improve their military technology and political level, cherish weapons and ammunition, and further strengthen the fighting friendship with the brotherly soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The telegram said: The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party is confident that the heroic soldiers of the Korean People's Army will definitely be able to fruitfully carry out the glorious task of defending the motherland, and will defend with ironclad strength the victory of our people in engaging in post-war restoration and construction and striving for the peaceful reunification and independence of Korea.

    英勇的朝鲜人民军战士、下士官、军官和将领同志们！
    今天，全体朝鲜人民和人民军将士们，在为恢复与发展战后人民经济，为争取祖国的和平统一与独立而庄严斗争的环境中，迎接英雄的朝鲜人民军建军六周年。

    一、美帝国主义者无视人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的共同意志和愿望，公然制造违反停战协定的一连串的挑衅行动。在这样的情况下，人民军全体将士要毫不松懈地以紧张和动员的姿态，锐利地监视敌人的一举一动，坚决地保卫已经取得的停战成果和人民的和平劳动。
    二、人民军全体将士们要更加巩固与英雄的中国人民志愿军将士们的战斗友谊和团结。为使我们人民军成为强大的具有高度水平的军队，要大力加强部队的军事纪律和组织性；发挥一切积极性和才能，强有力地进行战斗、政治训练，精通并爱护和保管自己的武器与战斗器材。各技术兵种部队的军人们要以全力提高自己的技术水平。
    三、全体指挥官和政治工作人员们要更加提高自己的军事和政治知识，提高对部下进行教育的领导艺术，不倦地教育每一个军人发挥对祖国、人民和朝鲜劳动党的忠诚，自觉地执行自己的军事任务和捍卫祖国的责任的精神。
    人民军战士、下士官、军官和将领同志们！
    我确信：你们一定会忠实地执行上述的任务，牢固地保卫我们用鲜血取得的胜利，把人民军的战斗力加强得像铜墙铁壁一般，并积极协助人民进行建设斗争。
    英雄的朝鲜人民军万岁！
    英雄的中国人民志愿军万岁！
    我们光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    朝鲜人民的领导和主导力量——朝鲜劳动党万岁！
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜劳动党中央委员会、朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁，分别致电朝鲜人民军陆、海、空军全体将士，祝贺人民军建军六周年。
    劳动党中央的贺电指出了人民军将士在祖国解放战争中所获得的历史性的伟大胜利，并号召他们以高度的警惕性监视美李匪帮的一举一动，不断提高军事技术和政治水平，爱护武器和弹药，进一步加强和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军将士的战斗友谊。贺电说：朝鲜劳动党中央委员会确信：英雄的朝鲜人民军将士一定能有成果地执行捍卫祖国的光荣任务，钢铁般地保卫我国人民从事战后恢复建设，争取朝鲜的和平统一与独立的伟大事业的胜利。
