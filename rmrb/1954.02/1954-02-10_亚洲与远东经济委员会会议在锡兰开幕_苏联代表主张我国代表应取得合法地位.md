Xinhua News Agency, February 9th: According to a TASS dispatch from Kandy: The tenth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) opened in Kandy, Ceylon, on the 8th. The agenda of the meeting includes: discussing the economic situation in Asia, discussing the reports of the Inland Transport Committee, the Industry and Trade Committee, the Bureau of Flood Control and Water Resources Development, and the specialized agencies of ECAFE. Representatives from the 23 countries and regions participating in ECAFE, as well as observers from Canada and Yugoslavia, attended the meeting.

The head of the Soviet delegation was the Soviet Ambassador to India, M.A. Menshikov.

A nine-member delegation from the World Federation of Trade Unions, headed by Li Jiebo, also attended the meeting.

The Prime Minister of Ceylon, Kotelawala, delivered a speech at the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 9th: The delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions, headed by its leader Li Jiebo, which is attending the tenth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held in Kandy, Ceylon, arrived in Colombo by plane on the 6th. The Mayor of Colombo, Rudra, and others welcomed them at the airport.

Xinhua News Agency, February 9th: TASS, Kandy: Soviet representative M.A. Menshikov made the following statement at the tenth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East on the 8th:

    It is necessary to remind the representatives attending the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East that the Kuomintang elements have once again illegally participated in the meeting. He has no relationship with the great Chinese people and China. As everyone knows, the Soviet delegation has repeatedly advocated that the only legitimate representative of the Chinese people, the representative of the People's Republic of China, should participate in the meeting. However, for several years, those who have represented China in the committee have been figures who have no right to represent the country, while representatives of the legitimate government of this country have been excluded from the committee by various artificial obstacles. Due to the proposals of certain countries, the issue of China's representation was not resolved at the last session of the committee, and the basic principles of international law were violated, and thus it has been illegally dragged on to this session.

    The participation of the representatives of the great Chinese people and the People's Republic of China, a major country, is essential for the effective work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, because this country has a vast territory on the Asian continent, has about a quarter of the world's population, and has traditional ties with Asian and Far Eastern countries. To date, twenty-five countries, large and small, including about one billion people, have established or are in the process of establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. For example, Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Burma have long established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. Isn't it time to change the attitude of "non-recognition" of facts and historical events? It is clear that continuing to ignore the fundamental changes taking place in Asia (which are primarily manifested in the victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China) will not contribute to improving relations between countries, nor will it contribute to improving the economic situation that is closely related to the people of Asia and the Far East.

    In view of the above reasons, and in view of the fact that the ninth session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has left this issue pending until the tenth session, the Soviet delegation submits the following proposal to the tenth session of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East for discussion: "The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East believes that it is necessary for the representatives appointed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to obtain China's legal status in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East."

    The Soviet delegation also believes that it is necessary to remind the committee that the participation of the Syngman Rhee elements and the Bao Dai elements in the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is illegal, and they cannot actually represent Korea and Vietnam.

    亚洲与远东经济委员会会议在锡兰开幕
    苏联代表主张我国代表应取得合法地位
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社康提讯：联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第十届会议于八日在锡兰的康提开幕。会议议程包括：讨论亚洲经济情况，讨论内陆运输委员会、工业与贸易委员会、治洪与水利开发局及亚洲与远东经济委员会各专门机构的报告。参加会议的有参加了亚洲与远东经济委员会的二十三个国家与地区的代表，以及加拿大和南斯拉夫的列席代表。
    苏联代表团团长是苏联驻印度大使米·阿·曼希科夫。
    参加会议的还有以李颉伯为首的世界工会联合会九人代表团。
    锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在会上发表了演说。
    【新华社新德里九日电】列席在锡兰的康提举行的联合国亚洲和远东经济委员会第十届会议的世界工会联合会代表团，在李颉伯团长率领下，于六日乘飞机到达科伦坡。到机场欢迎的有科伦坡市市长鲁德拉等。
   【新华社九日讯】塔斯社康提讯：苏联代表米·阿·曼希科夫八日在联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第十届会议上发表下列声明：
    必须提醒出席亚洲与远东经济委员会的代表们注意，国民党分子这次又非法地参加了会议，他和伟大的中国人民以及中国是没有任何关系的。大家知道，苏联代表团不止一次地主张由中国人民的唯一合法的代表——中华人民共和国的代表参加会议。可是几年来，在委员会中代表中国的，只是一些没有任何权利代表国家的人物，而这一国家的合法政府的代表却始终被种种人为的阻碍摈斥于委员会之外。由于某些国家的主张，使中国代表资格的问题不能在上届委员会会议上获得解决，并且破坏国际法的起码原则，因而也就非法地一直拖到这一届会议。
    伟大的中国人民、中华人民共和国这个大国的代表的参加，是亚洲与远东经济委员会有成效地进行工作所十分必需的，因为这个国家在亚洲大陆上拥有广大的领土，有约占全世界四分之一的人口，与亚洲和远东国家有其传统的联系。到现在已有二十五个包括约十亿人口的大大小小的国家和中华人民共和国建立了或正在建立外交关系。例如印度、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、缅甸这些亚洲国家早就与中华人民共和国建立了外交关系。难到现在还没有到改变“不承认”事实和历史事件的态度的时候吗？很明显，继续无视在亚洲发生的根本性的变化（这种变化首先表现在中国人民的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立上），既不能有助于各国之间的关系的改善，也不能有助于与亚洲和远东国家人民有切身关系的经济状况的改善。
    鉴于上述理由，鉴于亚洲与远东经济委员会第九届会议把这个问题一直搁置到第十届会议，苏联代表团将下列建议提交亚洲与远东经济委员会第十届会议讨论：“亚洲与远东经济委员会认为有必要使中华人民共和国中央人民政府所委派的代表在亚洲与远东经济委员会中取得中国的合法地位。”
    苏联代表团还认为必须提醒委员会注意：李承晚分子和保大分子参加亚洲与远东经济委员会是不合法的，他们实际上不能代表朝鲜和越南。
