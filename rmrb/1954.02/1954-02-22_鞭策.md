    Encouragement
    Mu Wendong
    Han Fengge, the township head of Miaozhuang Township, Pingyi County, Shandong Province, was re-elected as deputy township head in the general election last year. After his election, he often said to people: "As a servant of the masses, you must consult with the masses on matters and do good things for them. Otherwise, the masses will not want you."
    This saying has a story behind it.
    During the voter group discussions of representative candidates, only one voter group out of the seven in the village where Han Fengge lived nominated him as a candidate, and even this group "shifted its target" without discussion. Han Fengge was present at the time and felt very distressed when he saw this situation.
    In terms of work, Han Fengge was quite active, but his work style had problems. For example, during the autumn grain requisition the year before last, the villagers discussed reductions and exemptions, proposing reductions for 75 out of 115 households, which was considered too lenient. Han Fengge impatiently explained the situation to the masses but got angry instead: "Only 17 households are allowed exemptions; the rest is a waste of discussion." He believed: "The opinions of the masses are for personal gain; if you talk about democracy, work becomes impossible." Therefore, he reported the number of exemptions according to his own opinion, and somehow, he carelessly forgot the original regulation to reduce the quota for families of revolutionary martyrs by 20%. As a result, the masses had a lot of complaints.
    The right to vote is the whip in the hands of the people. The people use this whip to encourage cadres to correct their shortcomings and move forward continuously; the people also use this whip to drive out those bad elements and those who have committed serious mistakes and are extremely dissatisfied with the people. In the past, Han Fengge did not pay much attention to the opinions of the masses; this time, the fact that all seven voter groups in the village did not discuss his candidacy for representative made him very distressed.
    The general election work team discovered that Han Fengge was in a bad mood and asked Lao Mu to help him. Lao Mu asked him to summarize his work, review his shortcomings to the masses, and correct his shortcomings. Han Fengge became impatient when he heard this. He believed that he had no selfish motives in his work and said to Lao Mu with confidence: "How can it be wrong to act according to policy?" After a pause, he said sadly: "It is difficult to satisfy everyone; I really can't do the work in the future." Lao Mu pointed out his strengths, offered critical opinions, and repeatedly enlightened him. Han Fengge repeatedly thought: "That time for the public grain reduction and exemption, I was responsible for forgetting the 20% reduction for the families of revolutionary martyrs, and upon closer inspection, the Han Fengsheng family should not have been granted an exemption either..." After thinking about it slowly, he realized the problems in his work, but although he admitted his mistakes in his heart, he was still hesitant and unwilling to admit them publicly.
    At this time, the district party committee held a district and township cadre meeting, which summarized the summer work in the spirit of opposing bureaucracy and commandism. Han Fengge attended this meeting and personally saw the district party secretary review the errors in his work and ask everyone to criticize him. The district party secretary said that boldly reviewing the shortcomings in the work, finding the causes and improving the methods, is the only way to do the work well. Accepting the supervision of the masses and conducting self-criticism is not a disgrace, but a responsibility to the revolution and a sign of progress. He also said that only in this way can we gain the understanding and trust of the masses. Cadres' coercive orders in work are due to their own undemocratic style and failure to listen to the opinions of the masses, in addition to the responsibility of the superiors... These words were spoken to Han Fengge's heart and were very pleasant to hear. He thought: if I hadn't been subjective and didn't consult with the masses, how could there have been "loopholes" in the public grain reduction and exemption? Even the superiors have made a review, so why shouldn't I?
    Han Fengge's mind opened up. When he returned to the township, he convened an enlarged meeting of township cadres, summarized the work of the township, and reviewed his own mistakes. Then he returned to the village where he lived and reviewed his subjective rigidity, his failure to consult with everyone when handling affairs, and his impatience, etc. Han Fengge said sincerely: "These are all my mistakes. I hope everyone will criticize me, and I will definitely try to correct them."
    Han Fengge's review immediately sparked discussion in the village. Some said: "Old Han is good at his work. Who can be without mistakes? As long as he corrects them, he is a good cadre." Others opposed this opinion: "Who can guarantee that he can definitely change?" Others said: "As long as everyone helps him often, he will still be great at his work!" The seven voter groups were all arguing.
    At that time, the weather in this area was very dry, and the crops were seriously threatened. The higher authorities called on cadres to lead the masses in fighting drought. Han Fengge accepted this arduous task. On the evening of September 14th, at the cadre and team leader meeting, he proposed to divert the spring water on Beiling Ridge, build a bridge to lead it to the eastern ridge, and then build a bridge across the gully to lead it to the south of the village. In this way, dozens of acres of land behind the village and in front of the village could be irrigated. This idea was originally proposed by Director Zhang (the district party secretary) in the autumn of 1951; at that time, the matter was not completed because the masses could not be mobilized. After Han Fengge mentioned it, a debate broke out at the meeting: "This is a good thing. Not only can we irrigate the land this year, but the land in front and behind the village will not have to worry about drought in the future." "But it's too much work. Everyone is busy with the autumn harvest; who has free time?" Some people slipped away before the meeting was over. Others said behind their backs: "Old Han is showing off his ability. Director Zhang is so great, but it didn't work; you better not show off that trick of yours." This meeting did not produce any results.
    Everyone who attended the meeting had left, and Han Fengge squatted on the edge of the field alone, thinking over and over with his head hanging: "The superiors called for consulting with the masses on matters. If the masses don't move, isn't this a problem?" He also thought: "No wonder; naturally, he doesn't want to do it if his land can't be irrigated. So, whoever's land can be irrigated, mobilize them. First mobilize party members and members of the Youth League!"
    The next day after breakfast, Han Fengge went to Zhang Baozhu's house. Han Fengge knew that Zhang Baozhu was an active and willing person to take the lead and work hard, so he told him the benefits of repairing the bridge for everyone and encouraged him, and finally said: "It's just that Wu Jingan and Ma Wanyang don't have the energy and are not easy to mobilize." Zhang Baozhu said with certainty: "No problem, don't worry, leave it to me." It turned out that these people trusted Zhang Baozhu the most.
    Han Fengge climbed Beiling Ridge and found Hao Cunshan. Talking about repairing the bridge, he asked Hao Cunshan: "You say it's so busy, how can we mobilize people?" Hao Cunshan said: "It's not too busy, it's just that the red-eyed mouse looks at everyone; if one doesn't move, none of them move. As long as Zhang Baozhu can lead those few households, it will be easy." Han Fengge said: "They have no problem; I guarantee it. The Li Jingcheng and Han Xingyuan households are the difficulty." Hao Cunshan offered to mobilize them himself.
    In the evening, everyone was there. Han Fengge talked about the principles of drought resistance, calculated the details, deliberately encouraged the group that Hao Cunshan had mobilized, and finally asked everyone: "Let's discuss what to do, shall we?" Zhang Baozhu rushed to say: "The things that the higher authorities call for are all good for us. Even if others don't do it, I will!" Then Ma Wanyang, Ma Wanquan, Wu Jingan, and others all said they agreed to repair the bridge. Hao Cunshan's group also shouted: "Let's start tomorrow!" "Don't shout, just go automatically!"
    After working for three days in a row, two water bridges were repaired. The water from Beiling Ridge reached the eastern ridge and then crossed the gully from the eastern ridge, winding its way to the front of the village. More than 30 acres of autumn crops were irrigated, and more than 10 acres of wheat land that could not be cultivated due to drought were also irrigated.
    The people of the whole village went from doubt to admiration, watching Han Fengge lead everyone to overcome the drought. Everyone said that this time it was done well and energetically. Li Jingcheng said: "I wanted to fix it for several years but couldn't. This time, township head Han held a meeting for us, asked us to come up with ideas, led us to do it, and suddenly the water flowed across the gully and ran into the fields!" Ma Wanquan said: "Thanks to the township head for leading us to build the bridge and change the waterway. Now I can not only irrigate sweet potatoes but also plant wheat!"
    The facts further educated Han Fengge. Once, when he met Lao Mu, he talked about his feelings: "It's not that the masses don't move; it's that my work wasn't done. As long as I talk and run diligently and mobilize the masses, anything can be done."
    At the election meeting, Han Fengge was trusted by the masses and was honorably elected.

    鞭策
    穆文东
    山东省平邑县苗庄乡乡长韩凤阁，在去年普选中又被选为副乡长。他当选以后，常对人说：“当了群众的勤务员，就得有事和群众商量，给群众办好事。要不，群众就不要你。”
    这话是有来历的。
    在选民小组讨论代表候选人的时候，韩凤阁住的那个村子七个选民小组，只有一个选民提他为候选人，就是这个小组也没有讨论就“转移目标”了。当时，韩凤阁也在场，他看到这种情形，很是苦闷。
    论工作，韩凤阁是挺积极的，可就是作风上有毛病。比如说，前年秋征时，村里群众讨论减免，一百一十五户中要减免七十五户，条件是宽了些。韩凤阁没有耐心地向群众解释说明，却发了火：“只准减免十七户，剩下的算白讨论。”他认为：“群众的意见是个人打算，一讲民主，工作就没法干了。”因此，他按照自己的意见报了减免数目，并且又不知怎的，一时粗心大意，把原规定烈军属减免二成的事也忘记了。这一来，群众的意见可多了。
    选举权利，是人民手中的鞭子。人民用这条鞭子鞭策干部，使他们改正缺点，不断前进；人民也用这条鞭子，把那些坏分子和犯有严重错误，为人民所极不满意的分子赶下台去。在过去，群众有意见，韩凤阁是不大在意的；这一回，全村七个选民小组都不讨论他当代表候选人的问题，就使他苦闷煞了。
    普选工作组发现韩凤阁闹情绪，便要老穆去帮助他。老穆要他总结工作，向群众检讨缺点，改正缺点。韩凤阁一听就有些不耐烦起来。他认为自己在工作中并没有私心，理直气壮地对老穆说：“按政策办事，怎么不对呀？”停了一会，又伤心地说：“一事难如百人意，以后的工作咱真干不了。”老穆给他指出他的长处，又提出了批评的意见，再三地开导他。韩凤阁反复地想：“那次公粮减免，忘掉烈军属的二成减免自己是有责任，再仔细考察起来，韩凤胜家也不应减免……”慢慢想过之后，他觉出自己工作中的毛病来了，可是心里虽然认错，面上还犹犹豫豫，不肯公开承认。
    这时，区委召开区乡干部会议，以反对官僚主义、反对命令主义的精神总结了夏季工作。韩凤阁参加了这个会议，亲眼看到区委书记检讨了工作中的错误，还要求大家批评。区委书记说，大胆检讨工作中的缺点，找出原因和改进的办法，才能做好工作。接受群众监督，进行自我批评，不是丢人，而是对革命负责，是进步的表现。他又说，只有这样，才能得到群众的谅解和信任。干部在工作上强迫命令，除上级有责任外，是由于自己作风不民主，不倾听群众意见……这些话，正说到韩凤阁心里，听来十分入耳。他想：要不是自己主观，不和群众商量，减免公粮怎会出“漏子”，上级都检讨啦，我怎么不检讨呢？
    韩凤阁的思想开窍了。他回到乡里，就召开了乡干部扩大会，总结了乡里的工作，并对自己的错误做了检查。跟着又回到自己住的村子向群众检讨了自己主观生硬、办事不和大家商量、性急不耐烦等等缺点。韩凤阁诚恳地说：“这些都是我的错误，希望大家批评我，我一定努力改正。”
    韩凤阁的检讨，马上在村子里议论开了。有的说：“老韩干工作是行，谁能没错处，只要改了，就是好干部。”有的反对这个意见：“谁能保险他一定改得了？”也有的说：“只要大家常帮助他，干工作还是顶呱呱的！”七个选民小组都在争论着。
    当时，这一带天气十分干旱，庄稼受到严重威胁，上级号召干部领导群众抗旱，韩凤阁接受了这个艰巨的任务。九月十四日晚上，在干部、组长会上，他提议把北岭上的泉水，架上桥引到东边岭上去，再架桥跨过山沟引到村南来。这样，村后岭上和村前的几十亩地都能用水浇了。这个主意本来是在一九五一年秋天张指导员（区委书记）提出来的；那一回，因为没有能把群众发动起来，事情就没有办成。经韩凤阁一提，会上就发生了争论：“这是个好事，不光今年浇地，以后村前村后的地就不愁旱的了。”“不过太费工夫，都忙着秋收，谁有闲空？”有的人没有等开完会就溜跑了。还有的人背后说：“老韩瞎逞能，张指导员多棒，都不行；你那一手趁早别露。”这次会议没得到结果。
    开会的人都走了，韩凤阁一人在场边上蹲着，搭拉着头想来想去：“上级叫有事跟群众商量，群众不动，这不叫人难煞吗？”又想：“也难怪，浇不到他的地自然他不愿意干。这么着，谁的地能浇到就动员谁去。先发动党团员！”
    第二天吃过早饭，韩凤阁到了张宝珠家里。韩凤阁知道张宝珠是个工作积极、肯带头苦干的人，便一边说修桥对大家的好处，一边鼓励他，最后说：“就是吴景安、马万洋没劲头不好动员。”张宝珠有把握地说：“不成问题，你放心，交给我吧。”原来这几个人最信张宝珠的话。
    韩凤阁爬上北岭，找着了郝存善。谈话谈到修桥的事情，他便问郝存善：“你说这样忙，怎么能动员起来？”郝存善说：“忙是不多忙，就是红眼老鼠看大家，一个不动都不动，只要张宝珠能带动那几户就好办。”韩凤阁说：“他们没有问题，敢保证。李景成、韩兴元那几户倒是个困难。”郝存善提出自己去动员。
    晚上，人到齐了。韩凤阁讲了抗旱的道理，又算了算细账，有意识地鼓励郝存善动员的那一伙，最后又问大家说：“咱研究研究怎么办好吧？”张宝珠抢着说：“上级号召的事情都是对咱有好处的，别人不干我也干！”接着马万洋、马万全、吴景安等都说赞成修桥。郝存善那伙也嚷起来：“明天就动手！”“不要喊，自动去！”
    一连干了三天，两座水桥修好了。北岭的水到了东边岭上，又从东岭越过山沟，弯弯曲曲地淌到庄前。浇了三十多亩秋庄稼，又浇了十来亩干得耕不动的麦地。
    全村的人从怀疑到钦佩，看着韩凤阁带领大家战胜了干旱，谁都说这回办得又好又带劲。李景成说：“几年想治都没治成，这回韩乡长给咱开了个会，叫咱出主意，领着咱干，一下子水就流过山沟，跑到地里去啦！”马万全说：“亏了乡长，领咱修上桥，改过水道来，现在我不光能浇地瓜，还能种麦子哩！”
    事实更教育了韩凤阁。有一回遇到老穆，他就谈起自己的感想：“不是群众不动，是自己的工作没有作到。只要自己勤说勤跑，发动群众，什么事情也能办到。”
    在选举大会上，韩凤阁受到群众的信任，光荣地当选了。
