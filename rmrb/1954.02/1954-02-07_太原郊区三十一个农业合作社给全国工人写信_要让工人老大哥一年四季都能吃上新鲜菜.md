Thirty-one Agricultural Cooperatives in the Suburbs of Taiyuan Write to Workers Across the Country
Ensuring Worker Brothers Can Eat Fresh Vegetables All Year Round

    Dear worker brothers across the country:

    As the people of the whole country are further studying the general line, we, the thirty-one agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, are writing this letter to you with incomparable joy and excitement, sincerely thanking you for your support to us and reporting our production situation and achievements last year.

    In 1953, our agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The thirty-one agricultural cooperatives in the entire suburbs produced a total of 2,024,280 jin of grain, with an average yield of 261 jin per mu, exceeding the average yield of individual farmers by 36 jin, exceeding the average yield of the entire suburbs by 32 jin, and increasing production by 10 to 40 percent compared with last year. The income from sideline production was also very large. According to incomplete statistics from 26 cooperatives, the annual sideline income was 370 million yuan, accounting for 26 percent of the agricultural income.

    The reason why we were able to achieve the above results is because the Communist Party and Chairman Mao guided us onto the road of common prosperity, and also thanks to the strong support of the working class. The Nanjie Agricultural Cooperative in the Sixth District has more than 120 mu of paddy fields, with an average yield of about 600 jin per mu in previous years. Last year, 60 jin of ammonium sulfate was applied per mu, and the result was that the yield increased to 900 jin. The ten mu of drought-resistant corn and 83 mu of sloping millet land in the Xiaohuyu Agricultural Cooperative in the Fifth District used new-style step plows for deep plowing of about five inches, which prevented the autumn drought. In addition, 30 jin of fertilizer powder was applied per mu as top dressing, resulting in high yields. The average yield of corn was 1,197 jin per mu, with 2.04 mu yielding 1,300 jin per mu; the average yield of millet was 345 jin per mu, also achieving an overall bumper harvest. The Gucheng Camp Agricultural Cooperative planted more than 40 mu of vegetable land, which used to suffer from insect pests and low yields. Since the use of DDT last year, the insect pests have been eliminated and a bumper harvest has been achieved; the nine mu and three fen of cabbage alone produced more than 90,000 jin. With the development of industry, industrial products have also become cheaper. For example, a seven-inch step plow cost 420,000 yuan in 1950, but now it only costs 290,000 yuan; daily necessities are also becoming cheaper year by year. All of this proves that the development of agricultural production and the improvement of farmers' lives cannot be separated from the leadership and support of the worker brothers.

    In order to further strengthen the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class and realize socialism as soon as possible, our thirty-one agricultural cooperatives sold a total of 600,000 jin of surplus grain to the state last year to support the country's industrial construction. This year, we will work hard to increase production and appropriately expand the wheat acreage, striving to sell more grain to the state. At the same time, we have also made preliminary plans to expand the vegetable acreage by 377 mu to drive the masses to grow a large number of vegetables and to try to build greenhouses to grow fresh winter vegetables, so as to achieve year-round greenery and allow worker brothers to eat fresh and fine vegetables all year round. In addition to planting a large number of fruit trees, the agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas will also do a good job in maintaining soil and water, controlling floods in the Zha Shankou, so as to green the suburbs and protect the safety of industrial construction. In addition, we will raise more chickens and pigs to supply the city with non-staple foods.

    Dear worker brothers, in the future, we hope to communicate frequently, encourage each other, and work together to victoriously and overfulfill this year's production increase plan!

### 太原郊区三十一个农业合作社给全国工人写信  要让工人老大哥一年四季都能吃上新鲜菜

    太原郊区三十一个农业合作社给全国工人写信
    要让工人老大哥一年四季都能吃上新鲜菜
    亲爱的全国工人老大哥们：
    当全国人民正在进一步学习总路线的时候，我们太原市郊区的三十一个农业生产合作社，以无比欢欣鼓舞的心情给您们写这封信，衷心地感谢你们对我们的支援，并报告我们去年的生产情况和成绩。
    一九五三年我们的农业生产获得了空前未有的丰收。全郊区三十一个农业社共产粮食二百零二万四千二百八十斤，每亩平均产量二百六十一斤，超过个体农民平均产量三十六斤，超过全郊区平均产量三十二斤，比去年增产了百分之十至四十以上。副业生产收益也很大，据二十六个社的不完全统计，全年副业收入三亿七千万元，占农业收入的百分之二十六。
    我们所以能够获得上述成绩，是因为共产党、毛主席指引我们走上了大家富裕的道路，也多亏工人阶级的大力支援。六区南街农业社有稻田一百二十余亩，往年每亩平均产量六百斤左右，去年每亩地上了六十斤硫酸錏，结果产量就提高到九百斤。五区小虎峪农业社的十亩旱地丰产玉米和八十三亩坡地谷子，由于使用了新式步犁，深耕五寸左右，防止了秋旱，加上每亩地又上了三十斤肥田粉的追肥，结果获得了高额丰产，玉米每亩平均产一千一百九十七斤，其中有二亩零四分每亩产到一千三百斤；谷子每亩平均产三百四十五斤，也达到了全面丰收。古城营农业社种四十余亩菜地，过去常发生虫害，产量不高，自从去年用上滴滴涕后，就扑灭了虫害，获得了丰收；其中九亩三分白菜，就产了九万余斤。随着工业的发展，工业品也降低了，如一九五○年买一张七寸步犁要四十二万元，现在只要二十九万元了；生活日用品也是一年比一年便宜。所有这些，都证明了农业生产的发展和农民生活的改善绝不能离开工人老大哥的领导和支援。
    为了在工人阶级领导下进一步地加强工农联盟，使社会主义早日实现，我们三十一个农业社去年共卖给国家余粮六十万斤，以支援祖国工业建设。今年我们还要努力增产，并适当扩大麦地面积，争取把更多的粮食卖给国家。同时，我们又初步计划扩大菜地三百七十七亩，以带动群众大量种菜，并试办温室种植冬季鲜菜，做到冬夏常青，让工人老大哥一年四季都能吃上鲜菜和细菜。靠山的农业合作社，除大量栽种果木树外，并做好保持水土，闸山沟防治洪水的工作，以便绿化城郊和保卫工业建设的安全。另外，还要多养鸡、多喂猪，供应城市的副食品。
    亲爱的工人老大哥们，今后希望经常通信，互相鼓励，共同为胜利地、超额地完成今年的增产计划而奋斗！
    太原市郊区小虎峪、瓜地沟等三十一个农业社
                    （樊宝珠　赵修身代笔）
