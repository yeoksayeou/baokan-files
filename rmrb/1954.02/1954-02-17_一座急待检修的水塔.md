    A Water Tower Urgently Awaiting Repair
    Xiao Lian from the Supervision Office of the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau writes: The Dongxiang Station of the Nanchang Transportation Sub-bureau of the Guangzhou Railway Administration has a water tower with a storage capacity of 100 tons, which was built in May 1950 by the water supply engineering team of the former Nanchang Sub-bureau of the Shanghai Railway Administration. This water tower is 21.4 meters high and is constructed entirely of reinforced concrete, making it very heavy. However, it is supported by only four pillars, which are shallowly embedded in the ground and have no bracing at the base. As a result, the water tower appears top-heavy and has been swaying frequently in strong winds since it began supplying water to train locomotives in 1951. Workers at the Dongxiang water supply station, seeing this dangerous situation, have reported it to the Nanchang Railway Sub-bureau several times. However, the sub-bureau stated that reinforcing or rebuilding the water tower falls under capital construction projects, which they are unable to handle. It was not until after the Guangzhou Railway Administration conducted a major inspection of water supply structures in October 1953 that the Sub-bureau's locomotive department reported the situation of this water tower to the Administration's locomotive department, requesting that the capital construction department send someone to inspect and deal with it promptly. However, up to now, the Administration has not sent anyone to the site for inspection.
    Currently, many cracks have appeared on the outside of the water tower, and the situation is very unsafe. If it collapses, it will cause significant losses to the state. It is suggested that the Guangzhou Railway Administration quickly send personnel to repair this water tower, which has been swaying for more than three years, to ensure the safety of the staff and residents along the railway line.

    一座急待检修的水塔
    南昌铁路分局监察室效廉来信：广州铁路管理局南昌运输分局东乡车站有座储水一百吨的水塔，是一九五○年五月间由前上海铁路管理局南昌分局给水工程队负责修建的。这座水塔高达二十一点四公尺，所用建筑材料全部是钢筋混凝土，分量很重；但是撑持储水池的支柱只有四根，柱脚入土很浅，而且下面没有跨度。因此，这个水塔显得头重脚轻，从一九五一年开始为列车机车上水以来，经常在刮大风时发生摇摆现象。东乡给水所工人看到这种危险情况，曾几次向南昌铁路分局反映；但分局说水塔加固或改建属于基本建设工程，本单位没法解决。直到一九五三年十月广州铁路管理局举行给水建筑物大检查后，分局机务科才把这座水塔的情况呈报管理局机务处，要求基本建设处迅速派人来检查处理。但直到现在，还未见管理局派人到现场检查。
    现在，水塔的外面已经出现很多裂纹，情况很不安全，万一倒塌下来，将给国家造成很大的损失。建议广州铁路管理局迅速派员检修这座已经摇摆了三年多的水塔，以保障沿线职工和居民的安全。
