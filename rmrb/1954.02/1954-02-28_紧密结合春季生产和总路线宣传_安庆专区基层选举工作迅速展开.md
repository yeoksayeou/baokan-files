Anqing Special District, Anhui Province, has rapidly unfolded its basic-level election work, closely integrating it with spring production and propaganda for the general line. The broad masses of the district actively participated in the general election activities, aiming to elect good representatives to lead them on the socialist road and create a better life.

Anqing Special District has 1,676 basic-level units such as townships and towns. Among these, 92 conducted pilot basic-level elections last year, and the remaining 1,584 began their election work successively from early February. Under the attention and correct leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, the district's election work has progressed healthily and rapidly. As of February 15th, 402 townships (towns) had completed propaganda mobilization and the division of electoral districts; 998 townships (towns) and two urban districts were about to complete population surveys and voter registration; and 123 townships (towns) were in the process of nominating representative candidates. In the course of the election work, all localities closely integrated it with the propaganda of the Party's general line during the transition period, enhancing the socialist consciousness of the broad masses and encouraging their active and enthusiastic participation in the general election activities. People in many areas proposed to elect "leaders on the socialist road" to lead them on the socialist road and create a more fulfilling and happier life. When voters in the 12th electoral district of Changhe Township, Zhide County, discussed representative candidates, they unanimously proposed Liu Tonglang, an activist in grain purchase work, as a candidate, while disagreeing with Zhou Laizhi, who was not active in selling surplus grain to the state. During the election work, all localities also mobilized the masses to carry out spring production simultaneously, promoting production work. Under the education of the general election, farmers in Xinping Township, Huaining County, broke the old custom of "not moving earth in the first month," and many farmers went to the fields to weed and fertilize as early as the third day of the new year. During the population survey and voter registration phase, Yuantan Township, Qianshan County, weeded 1,199 mu of spring fields and carried out spring repairs. All forty-six mutual aid teams that had collapsed in the township were also reorganized in the general election movement.

    紧密结合春季生产和总路线宣传
    安庆专区基层选举工作迅速展开
    安徽省安庆专区基层选举工作，紧密结合春季生产和总路线宣传，迅速展开。全区广大人民为选好代表，带领他们走社会主义道路，创造更美好的生活，积极地参加了普选活动。
    安庆专区共有乡、镇等基层单位一千六百七十六个，其中除九十二个在去年进行了基层选举典型试办外，余下的一千五百八十四个均从二月上旬起先后开始了选举工作。全区选举工作在各级党委和政府重视与正确领导下，得到健康的迅速的进展。截至二月十五日止，已有四百零二个乡（镇）完成了宣传动员、划分选区等工作，九百九十八个乡（镇）和两个城关区即将结束人口调查与选民登记；一百二十三个乡（镇）正在提代表候选人。在选举工作进行中，各地都紧密结合了国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传，使广大群众提高了社会主义觉悟，积极热烈地参加了普选活动。许多地区人民提出要选“社会主义的带路人”，以带领他们走社会主义道路，创造更美满幸福的生活。至德县长河乡第十二选区选民在讨论代表候选人时，一致提出购粮工作中的积极分子刘同浪为候选人，而不同意不积极卖余粮给国家的周来芝。在选举工作进行中，各地还同时发动群众进行春季生产，推动了生产工作。怀宁县新平乡农民在普选教育下，打破了“正月不动土”的老规矩，许多农民在正月初三就下田锄草、施肥。潜山县原谭乡在人口调查与选民登记阶段，锄完一千一百九十九亩春田，并进行了春修工作。该乡有四十六个已经垮台的互助组，也全在普选运动中重新组织起来。
