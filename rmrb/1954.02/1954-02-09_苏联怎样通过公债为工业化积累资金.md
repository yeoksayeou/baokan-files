    How the Soviet Union Accumulated Funds for Industrialization Through Public Bonds
    Wang Genjian
    In 1926, the Soviet Union's economic recovery work had ended, but the national economy still could not eliminate its backwardness, and the material basis of socialism had not yet been established. To establish the material basis of socialism, it was necessary to realize socialist industrialization and concentrate efforts on developing heavy industry first. To establish a strong heavy industry in a short period of time required huge investments. Therefore, the source of funds for national industrialization was of great significance.
    The Soviet state could only rely on its own accumulation to obtain the funds needed for industrialization. That is to say: rely on the accumulation of nationalized industries themselves; rely on the state budget to mobilize the accumulation of other sectors of the national economy; and rely on absorbing idle funds in the hands of residents. Issuing public bonds was an important way to absorb idle funds from residents.
    In 1926, Stalin pointed out the important significance of issuing public bonds for accumulating industrialization funds in his report "On the Economic Situation of the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy": "We must ensure that the surplus accumulated domestically is not dispersed, but gathered in our cooperative and state-owned credit institutions, and that domestic public bonds are issued, with a view to using them primarily for industrial needs... The task of issuing domestic debt undoubtedly lies before us and has become an urgent task, and we must solve this task in any case."
    The task put forward by Stalin was victoriously completed by the Soviet people. In the years of struggle to realize socialist industrialization, the Soviet state issued public bonds every year, and the amount of public bonds issued increased year by year. In the 1929-1930 fiscal year, public bond income in the national budget increased to 8.8 times that of the 1925-1926 fiscal year, while in the same period, the proportion of public bond income in the national budget revenue increased from 3.4 percent to 9.2 percent. During the First Five-Year Plan period, public bond income accounted for 38.3 percent of the total industrial investment; during the Second Five-Year Plan period, it accounted for 32 percent. Public bond income was only 9.5 billion during the First Five-Year Plan period, and 24.3 billion during the Second Five-Year Plan period. In the years 1938-1941, it reached 34.9 billion rubles.
    It can be seen that public bond income was increasing, and public bonds became an important and regular source of funds for Soviet industrialization.
    The fundamental reason why public bond income became an important and regular source of funds for Soviet industrialization and increased year by year was the development of the national economy and the increase in national income. The economic basis of Soviet public bonds was the ever-increasing savings of the working people. The continuous growth of people's income and savings created greater and greater possibilities for the Soviet state to issue public bonds. The annual issuance of public bonds by the Soviet state was determined according to the unified national economic plan, that is, according to the development of residents' monetary income and expenditure and the increase in savings. However, it must be pointed out that the huge success of the Soviet Union in issuing public bonds was also due to the continuous improvement of the Soviet people's political awareness and the continuous upsurge of patriotic enthusiasm. They clearly realized that the realization of national industrialization was a guarantee of their long-term happiness. Therefore, once public bonds were issued, a wave of subscription was set off among the broad masses of the people, which caused the actual sales of public bonds to often exceed the original issuance amount.
    Heavy industry requires long-term investment. Therefore, the term of public bonds must be extended so that the state can stably utilize this fund for a considerable period of time and invest it in the construction of heavy industry. Therefore, most of the public bonds issued during the industrialization period were repaid in ten years, except for a very few that were repaid within eight years; and since 1936, the term of public bonds has been changed to twenty years.
    The huge success of the public bonds issued to realize industrialization was inseparable from the meticulous organizational work of the Party and the government. In order to facilitate the purchase of public bonds by the broad masses, most of the public bonds were sold through the method of "collective subscription and installment payment," except for a few sold by savings bureaus in cash. Experience has proven that this method of promoting public bonds is most suitable for the vast number of employees in government agencies, organizations, and enterprises.
    In addition, in the work of promoting public bonds in the early stage of industrialization, a specialized social organization, the National Public Bonds and Savings Business Promotion Committee, was established due to the initiative of workers and the support of the Party. This organization was composed of representatives from various social groups in various agencies, organizations, and enterprises, and worked under the leadership of local Party and trade union organizations. Its work was to specifically organize the subscription and registration of public bonds, and to redeem, collect interest, and receive prizes for bondholders. This social organization further expanded the sales volume and sales scope of public bonds, and further ensured the smooth issuance of public bonds.
    The public bonds issued by the Soviet Union to realize socialist industrialization were diverse. For example, according to the method of paying interest, there were: interest-bearing public bonds—bondholders could receive a fixed amount of interest every year; interest-bearing and prize-bearing public bonds—bondholders could not only receive a fixed amount of interest, but also had the opportunity to win prizes; non-interest-bearing and prize-bearing public bonds—all interest was paid in the form of bonuses, and bonds that did not win prizes could be redeemed for principal when they matured; non-interest-bearing and non-blank public bonds—during the validity period of the public bond, each bond could receive a bonus of varying amounts.
    In addition to these types of public bonds, a type of public bond in the form of reservation coupons (such as bicycle reservation coupons, camera reservation coupons, etc.) was also issued in the 1930-1931 fiscal year. The funds mobilized by these public bonds were all invested in the construction of the respective industrial departments. Once the bonds matured, bondholders could obtain the originally reserved products or obtain currency according to their own wishes.
    At that time, the face value of public bonds was very small at first (for example, in 1927-1928, there was a face value of 25 rubles), which was stipulated in accordance with the low income level of residents at that time. Later, with the growth of residents' income, the face value of public bonds gradually increased. For example, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, there were face values of one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, and even five hundred rubles.
    The Soviet Union was able to complete a journey of more than 100 years for capitalist countries in a short period of 13 years and realize its industrialization, which was related to the Soviet people's enthusiastic purchase of public bonds.
    As early as January 1933, Comrade Stalin pointed out in the summary report of the First Five-Year Plan that Soviet industrialization had been victorious, and the Soviet Union now had ferrous metallurgy, tractor manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, machine manufacturing, major modern chemical industry, truly major modern agricultural machinery manufacturing, and aviation industry that it did not have before. Due to the rapid development of heavy industry, it also created material prerequisites for agricultural collectivization and the technical transformation of the entire national economy.
    It was precisely because the Party and the government resolutely implemented the policy of socialist industrialization that the Soviet Union rapidly transformed from an agricultural country into a powerful industrial country. At the end of 1932, industry accounted for 70.7 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural production, and in 1937 it increased to 77.4 percent. In the entire industrial production, the production of means of production took priority, reaching 55 percent in 1937; and in terms of the development level of the machine manufacturing industry, the Soviet Union at that time was the first in Europe. It was precisely because of the rapid and powerful development of heavy industry that the Soviet Union's national defense was consolidated, which was the material guarantee for defeating the German fascist aggressors.
    In line with the rapid development of industry, Soviet agriculture has also been greatly developed. In 1937, 91 percent of the cultivated land in Soviet collective farms and all cultivated land in state farms were cultivated by tractors, and Soviet agriculture has become the largest mechanized agriculture in the world.
    Due to the development of industry, agriculture, and the entire national economy, the material and cultural life of the Soviet people has been fundamentally improved. The national income in 1932 increased by 85 percent compared with 1928, and in 1938 it increased by more than double compared with 1932; the average annual wage of workers and staff in 1932 increased by 67 percent compared with 1928, and in 1937 it increased by more than double compared with 1932. In these years, the state's allocations for social and cultural measures (education, health care, social insurance...) increased from nearly 20.2 billion rubles in the First Five-Year Plan period to more than 93.6 billion rubles in the Second Five-Year Plan period, and reached more than 113.5 billion rubles in the first three years of the Third Five-Year Plan.
    All of this proves that the success of national industrialization is a guarantee of the long-term happiness of the people, and national industrialization has brought the Soviet people the wealthiest and most civilized life in the world.
    But do not forget that the happy life that the Soviet people now have was obtained through the hard work of the Soviet people, and is inseparable from their saving personal expenses and enthusiastically purchasing public bonds in the early stage of industrialization. Our country is now in the early stage of industrialization, so the issue of funding sources has also been put on our agenda. Like the Soviet Union, public bonds will also be an important and regular source of funds for my country's industrialization. Our people must learn from the spirit of hard work of the Soviet people, strive for frugality in clothing, food, housing, and other aspects, and save all the funds that can be saved to support national industrial construction. In this way, after a considerable period of time, our country's economic situation will be completely changed, and the lives of our people will be fundamentally improved. The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow, and a picture of prosperity and well-being is in front of us.

    苏联怎样通过公债为工业化积累资金
    王亘坚
    一九二六年苏联的经济恢复工作已经结束，但是，国民经济还不能消除其落后状态，社会主义的物质基础还没有建立起来。要建立社会主义的物质基础，就必须实现社会主义工业化，必须首先集中力量发展重工业。要在很短的时期内建立起强大的重工业，就需要有巨额的投资，因此，国家工业化的资金来源问题，就具有非常重大的意义。
    苏维埃国家取得工业化所需的资金，只能依靠自己的积累。这就是说：靠国有化工业本身的积累；靠国家预算动员国民经济其他部门的积累；靠吸收居民手中的闲散资金。而发行公债就是吸收居民闲散资金的重要方法。
    一九二六年，斯大林在“论苏联的经济状况和党底政策”这一报告中指出发行公债对于积累工业化资金的重要意义：“必须使国内积累的盈余不要分散开来，而要汇集于我们的合作社的及国营的信用机关，并举行国内公债，以期首先利用它们于工业的需要，……举行内债的任务，无疑地摆在我们面前而成为迫切的任务，我们无论如何要解决这一任务。”
    斯大林所提出的任务，被苏联人民胜利地完成了。在为实现社会主义工业化而斗争的年代中，苏维埃国家每年都发行了公债，而且公债发行的数额是逐年增长的。一九二九——一九三○年度国家预算中的公债收入增长到一九二五——一九二六年度的八点八倍，而在同一时期中，公债收入在国家预算收入中所占的比重，则从百分之三点四增长到百分之九点二。在第一个五年计划时期内，公债收入占工业投资总额的百分之三十八点三；在第二个五年计划时期占百分之三十二。在第一个五年计划时期公债收入只是九十五亿，在第二个五年计划时期中是二百四十三亿。而在一九三八——一九四一年这几年内，就达到了三百四十九亿卢布。
    由此可见，公债收入是越来越多了，公债成了苏联工业化资金重要和经常的来源。
    公债收入之所以成为苏联工业化资金的重要和经常的来源，而且逐年增加，其根本原因是国民经济的发展和国民收入的增加。苏维埃公债的经济基础，就是日益增长着的劳动人民的积蓄。由于人民群众的收入和积蓄不断增长，就给苏维埃国家发行公债创造了越来越大的可能性。苏维埃国家每年公债的发行额，都是根据统一的国民经济计划规定的，即根据居民货币收支的发展情况和积蓄增加的情况确定的。但是必须指出，苏联发行公债之所以得到巨大的成功，还由于苏联人民政治觉悟的不断提高和爱国热情的不断高涨。他们清楚地认识到，国家工业化的实现就是自己长远幸福的保证。因此，公债一经发行，就在广大的人民群众中间掀起认购的热潮，这种热潮使公债的实际销售额经常超过原定的发行额。
    重工业需要长期的投资。因此必须把公债的期限放长，使国家能够在一个相当长的时期内，稳当地利用这项资金，将它投入于重工业的建设。因此，工业化时期所发行的公债，除极少数是八年以内偿还外，绝大部分是十年偿还的；而自一九三六年起，公债期限又改为二十年了。
    为实现工业化而发行的公债之所以得到巨大的成功，这是和党与政府周密的组织工作分不开的。为了便利广大群众购买公债，除少数由储金局以现款出售外，绝大部分的公债都是采取“集体认购、分期付款”的方法推销。经验证明，在机关、团体和企业的广大职工中，采取这种推销公债的方法是最适宜的。
    此外，在工业化初期推销公债的工作中，由于劳动者的倡议和党的支持，产生了一种专门的社会组织——国家公债与储蓄事业促进委员会。这种组织是由各机关、团体和企业中的各种社团推出代表组成的，并在当地党和工会组织的领导下进行工作。它的工作是专门组织公债的认购和登记事宜，并替债券持有人兑签、领息和领奖。这种社会组织，进一步扩大了公债的销售数额和销售范围，进一步保证了公债的顺利发行。
    苏联为实现社会主义工业化所发行的公债是多种多样的。如按支付利息的方式划分，则有：有息公债——债券持有人每年可以得到固定数目的利息；有息有奖公债——债券持有人除能得到固定数目的利息外，还有得奖的机会；无息有奖公债——其全部利息都以奖金的形式支付，不中奖的债券则可于到期时领回本金；无息无空签公债——在公债的有效期内，每份债券都可以得到多少不等的奖金。
    除以上这些种类的公债外，在一九三○——一九三一年度还发行过一种预约券形式的公债（如自行车预约券，照像机预约券……等），用这些公债所动员的资金，全部投入各该工业部门的建设。债券一经到期，债券持有人则可根据自己的意愿取得原来预约的产品，或取得货币。
    当时公债的票面额，最初是很小的（例如一九二七——一九二八年时有二十五卢布的票面额），这是适应当时居民收入水平较低的情况而规定的。后来，随着居民收入的增长，公债票面额也逐渐扩大起来，例如在第二个五年计划期间，就有了一百、二百、三百乃至五百卢布的票面额。
    苏联在短短的十三年期间，就能走完资本主义国家一百多年的路程，实现了自己的工业化，这是和苏联人民踊跃购买公债有关的。
    还在一九三三年一月，斯大林同志在第一个五年计划的总结报告中就指出，苏联工业化已经得到了胜利，苏联以前没有的黑色金属冶炼业、拖拉机制造业、汽车制造业、机器制造业、重大的现代化学工业、真正重大的现代农业机器制造业、航空工业……现在都有了。由于重工业的迅速发展，也就为农业集体化和整个国民经济的技术改造创造了物质前提。
    正由于党和政府坚决执行了社会主义工业化的政策，才使苏联迅速地从农业国变成了强大的工业国。一九三二年底，工农业生产总值中，工业就占到了百分之七十点七，一九三七年又增加到百分之七十七点四。在整个工业生产中，生产资料的生产占了优先的地位，一九三七年达到百分之五十五；而在机器制造业的发展水平方面，苏联当时已居于欧洲第一位。正由于重工业如此迅速而强大的发展，就使苏联的国防得到了巩固，这是战胜德国法西斯侵略者的物质保证。
    与工业迅速发展相适应，苏联的农业也得到了巨大的发展。一九三七年，苏联集体农庄耕种面积的百分之九十一和国营农场的全部耕地就都用拖拉机来耕种，苏联的农业已成为世界上最大机械化的农业。
    由于工业、农业以及整个国民经济的发展，就使苏联人民的物质与文化生活得到了根本的改善。一九三二年的国民收入就比一九二八年增加了百分之八十五，而一九三八年又比一九三二年增加了一倍以上；一九三二年工人和职员的全年平均工资就比一九二八年增加了百分之六十七，而一九三七年又比一九三二年增加一倍以上。这些年中，国家用于社会文化措施（教育、保健，社会保险……）方面的拨款，从第一个五年计划时期中的近二百零二亿卢布增加到第二个五年计划时期中的九百三十六亿卢布以上，而在第三个五年计划的头三年中，又达到了一千一百三十五亿卢布以上。
    所有这一切都证明：国家工业化的成功，是人民长远幸福的保证，国家工业化给苏联人民带来了全世界最富裕和最文明的生活。
    但是，不要忘记，苏联人民现在这种幸福的生活，是苏联人民艰苦奋斗得来的，是和他们在工业化初期节约个人开支、踊跃购买公债分不开的。我们的国家现在正处在工业化初期，因此，资金来源问题也提到我们的日程上来。和苏联一样，公债也将是我国工业化资金的重要和经常的来源。我国人民必须学习苏联人民那种艰苦奋斗的精神，在衣、食、住各方面力求节俭，把一切可以节省下来的资金都节省下来，支援国家工业建设。这样，再过一个相当长的时期以后，我国经济状况将全部改观，我国人民的生活也将得到根本的改善。苏联的今天就是我们的明天，我们的前面是一幅富强康乐的图画。
