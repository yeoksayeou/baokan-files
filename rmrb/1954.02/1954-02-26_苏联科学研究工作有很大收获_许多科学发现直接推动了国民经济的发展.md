(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 25th) According to TASS Moscow: In 1953, the Soviet Academy of Sciences' research work achieved great successes. The various research institutions of the Academy closely combined their work with the task of developing the national economy, and studied approximately three thousand scientific problems using the latest research methods.

Last year, Soviet scientists conducted large-scale geological-geographical and economic surveys in Siberia, the Far East, and Central Asia, and wrote survey reports. These reports are of great value for the exploitation of useful mineral resources. Scientists from the Kazakh, Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Georgian Republics, together with staff from the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Soil Institute, studied the soils of Kazakhstan and Transcaucasia. Their new discoveries in the research work are very useful for mapping the soil of the entire country. In chemistry, of great practical significance is the method invented by Soviet scientists for manufacturing new, high-quality synthetic fibers. They also invented a new anesthetic, "Promedol," which is more effective than morphine and has very few toxins. This anesthetic has been widely used domestically. The research work of Soviet biologists also directly promotes the development of the national economy. With the help of labeled atoms and other methods, they established many important laws governing plant nutrition and growth. The new antibiotics invented by microbiologists can effectively combat various bacterial diseases of crops. Scientists in physics and mathematics have also conducted research on cosmic rays, nuclear physics, and optics.

In technical sciences, Soviet scientists have also made great gains in research on the manufacture of turbines, shortening the smelting process, and automation and power issues. Scientists have designed a new measuring instrument that is helpful for solving automation and remote control problems, as well as designing computers.

In the social sciences, Soviet economists last year studied several important economic issues in the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Historians have completed two volumes of works on Soviet history, three volumes of works on the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, and several works on the history of various nationalities of the Soviet Union. Linguists studied the grammatical structure of various languages and compiled a book on Russian punctuation.

In the past year, the organizational structure of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has also greatly developed. The Academy elected a total of fifty-one new academicians and one hundred and forty-eight corresponding academicians, increasing the number of academicians by forty percent and the number of corresponding academicians by fifty percent. Last year, the Academy also established several new research institutes, including the Institute of Biophysics, the Institute of Electronics and Radio Engineering, and others. The contacts between Soviet scientists and foreign scientists have also been greatly strengthened. Last year, the Soviet Academy of Sciences sent a total of thirty delegations to international scientific conferences. Last year, fourteen delegations of foreign scientists visited the Soviet Union, including delegations from China, North Korea, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, Japan, and other countries.

    苏联科学研究工作有很大收获
    许多科学发现直接推动了国民经济的发展
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：一九五三年苏联科学院的研究工作有很大收获，科学院的各个研究机关密切结合发展国民经济的任务，用最新的研究方法研究了约三千个科学问题。
    苏联科学家去年在西伯利亚、远东和中亚细亚境内进行了大规模的地质—地理和经济调查工作，并写成了调查报告。这些报告对于开发有用矿藏有着非常重要的价值。哈萨克、阿塞拜疆、亚美尼亚、格鲁吉亚等共和国的科学家们，和苏联科学院土壤研究所的工作人员一起，研究了哈萨克和外高加索的土壤。他们在研究工作中的新发现对于绘制全国土壤地图很有用处。在化学方面有很大实际意义的是，苏联科学家发明了制造新的质量很高的人造纤维的方法。他们还发明了一种比吗啡更有效而且毒素很少的新麻醉剂“普罗麦多尔”。这种麻醉剂已在国内广泛应用了。苏联生物学家们的研究工作也直接推动国民经济的发展。他们借标记原子的帮助和其他方法确立了许多支配植物营养和生长的重要法则。微生物学家们所发明的新的抗生素，可以有效地对付农作物的各种细菌疾病。物理和数学方面的科学家们对宇宙线、原子核物理学和光学等也都进行了研究。
    在技术科学方面，苏联科学家对于制造透平、缩短冶炼过程，以及自动化和动力问题的研究，也都有很大收获。科学家们已经设计出一种新测量仪器，这种仪器对于解决自动化和远距离操纵问题以及设计计算机等都有很大帮助。
    在社会科学方面，苏联经济学家去年研究了苏联和人民民主国家的若干重要经济问题。历史学家完成了两卷关于苏联历史的著作、三卷有关乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年的著作和若干关于苏联各民族历史的著作。语文学家研究了各种文字的文法结构，并编纂了一本关于俄文标点符号的书籍。
    在过去一年中，苏联科学院的组织机构也有很大发展。科学院共选出了五十一位新院士和一百四十八位通讯院士，使科学院院士的人数增加了百分之四十，通讯院士增加了百分之五十。去年科学院还成立了若干新的研究所，其中包括生物物理学研究所、电子学和无线电工程研究所等。苏联科学家和外国科学家的联系也大大加强了。去年，苏联科学院共派出三十个代表团出席国际性的科学会议。去年有十四个外国科学家的代表团访问了苏联，其中包括中国、朝鲜、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、英国、意大利、芬兰、日本等国的代表团。
