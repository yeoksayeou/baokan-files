Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: According to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch on the 20th, the People's Daily, the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, published an editorial entitled "Let Us Fight for Peace and Strengthen the Friendship Between the French and Vietnamese People."

The editorial stated: Since President Ho Chi Minh's response to the Swedish "Expressen" reporter in November 1953, the French people's struggle to stop the war of aggression against Vietnam has grown unprecedentedly. In particular, the recent victories of the military and civilians of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have given new encouragement to the resolute struggle waged by the French people under the leadership of the working class and the French Communist Party. Every honest French person, upon hearing President Ho Chi Minh's reply, received great hope and new enthusiasm, thereby strengthening their determination to fight to end the war of aggression against Vietnam. People from broad strata of French society are clearly aware that one of the main sources of the current high cost of living, the increasing number of unemployed, the declining prices of agricultural products, and the various exorbitant taxes pressing on their shoulders is the war of aggression against Vietnam. They realize that their living conditions will only improve when peace is restored in Vietnam and world peace is maintained and consolidated.

After citing some prominent examples of the French people's ardent pursuit of peace and their persistent struggle to demand an immediate end to the war of aggression against Vietnam and to hold peace talks with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the editorial wrote: All these facts clearly demonstrate the French people's friendship towards the Vietnamese people. This friendship is now becoming a force to stop the bloody hands of the aggressors and prevent them from arbitrarily reversing the wheels of history.

Greatly encouraged by the wholehearted support of people around the world—especially the French people—the Vietnamese people are stepping up their resistance war in order to defeat the French aggressors and the American interventionists, regain national independence and unification, and contribute to the defense and consolidation of world peace and international friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnam Youth League, on the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System," sent telegrams to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, as well as youth in France, French colonies, Cambodia, Laos, and other Southeast Asian countries, expressing their respect.

The Vietnam Youth League's telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth stated: The Vietnamese youth warmly support the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System," and guarantee to fight alongside youth around the world against the colonial system, demanding an end to wars of aggression and the oppression and enslavement of people of all countries, and striving to ease international tensions.

The Vietnam Youth League's telegram to French youth stated: Vietnamese youth warmly hail the increasingly strengthened struggle of French youth and the people against the war of aggression in Vietnam. We express our deep admiration for French men and women heroes like Henri Martin and Raymond Dien who have emerged in this struggle. We are deeply grateful for the support of our French friends to the Vietnamese people.

We believe that as long as the youth and people of France and Vietnam, in the spirit of the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System," strengthen unity and intensify their struggle, they will repel the bellicose French colonialists and American interventionists, rebuild peace in Vietnam, guarantee the complete and genuine independence of the people of France and Vietnam, protect the lives and legitimate rights of youth, and promote the easing of international tensions.

The Vietnam Youth League's telegram to the youth of countries still under the rule of French colonialists stated: We are fighting against a common enemy—the French colonialists. Vietnamese youth are deeply indignant at the brutal exploitation, oppression, and terror carried out by the French colonialists in your countries. We are heartened by the achievements of your struggle. And we hail your struggle against the war of aggression in Vietnam.

In a telegram to Lao youth, the Vietnam Youth League warmly hailed the recent great victories of the Lao People's Liberation Army and praised the heroic fighting spirit of the Lao military and civilians.

In a telegram to Cambodian youth, the Vietnam Youth League pledged to unite even more closely with Cambodian youth and believed that the struggle of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos would achieve complete victory.

    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社二十日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”发表社论，题为：“让我们为争取和平与加强法、越两国人民之间的友谊而斗争”。
    社论写道：自从一九五三年十一月胡志明主席答瑞典“快报”记者问以来，法国人民为停止侵越战争而进行的斗争空前壮大了。特别是越南、高棉和寮国军民在最近取得的胜利，使法国人民在工人阶级和法国共产党领导下进行的坚决斗争得到了新的鼓舞。每一个正直的法国人在听到胡志明主席的答复时，都得到了巨大的希望和新的热情，从而加强了他们为结束侵越战争而斗争的决心。法国各地广泛阶层的人民都清楚地认识到：目前生活费用的高昂、失业人数的日益增加、农产品价格的日益降低以及压在他们肩上的各种苛捐杂税的主要根源之一就是侵越战争。他们认识到：只有在越南和平重新实现、世界和平得到维护和巩固的时候，他们的生活条件才会得到改善。
    社论在举出一些法国人民热烈谋求和平、为要求立即停止侵越战争和与越南民主共和国政府举行和谈而进行坚持不懈斗争的一些突出例子后写道：这一切事实清楚地证明了法国人民对越南人民的友情。这种友情现在正在变成一股力量，来制止嗜血的侵略者的魔掌，不让它们随意扭转历史的车轮。
    在全世界人民——特别是法国人民全心全意支持的巨大鼓舞下，越南人民正在加紧进行抗战，以便击败法国侵略者和美国干涉者，重新获得国家的独立和统一，并对保卫和巩固世界和平与国际友谊作出贡献。
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南青年联盟在“反对殖民制度斗争日”分别致电世界民主青年联盟以及法国、法国各殖民地、高棉、寮国和东南亚其他国家的青年，表示敬意。
    越南青年联盟致世界民主青年联盟的电文说：越南青年热烈支持“反对殖民制度斗争日”，保证与世界青年一起进行反对殖民制度的斗争，要求停止侵略战争以及对各国人民的压制和奴役，并争取缓和国际紧张局势。
    越南青年联盟致法国青年的电文说：越南青年热烈欢呼法国青年和人民反对侵越战争的日益加强的斗争。我们对于亨利·马丁、雷蒙德·第安这样一些在这个斗争中涌现出的法国男女英雄表示深切的钦佩。法国朋友们对越南人民的支持，使我们深为感激。
    我们相信：法越两国的青年和人民只要本着“反对殖民制度斗争日”的精神，加强团结和加紧斗争，就会击退好战的法国殖民者和美国干涉者，重建越南的和平，保障法国和越南两国人民的完全的和真正的独立，保卫青年的生命和正当权利，并促进缓和国际紧张局势。
    越南青年联盟在给仍在法国殖民者统治下的国家的青年的电文说：我们在对一个共同的敌人——法国殖民者进行斗争。越南青年对于法国殖民者在你们国家进行的残酷剥削、压迫和恐怖活动深为愤慨。我们对你们斗争的成就感到欢欣鼓舞。我们并为你们反对侵越战争的斗争欢呼。
    在给寮国青年的电文中，越南青年联盟热情地欢呼寮国人民解放军最近取得的巨大胜利，并盛赞寮国军民的英雄的作战精神。
    越南青年联盟在给高棉青年的电文中保证要与高棉青年团结得更紧，并且相信越南、高棉和寮国三国人民的斗争将取得彻底的胜利。
