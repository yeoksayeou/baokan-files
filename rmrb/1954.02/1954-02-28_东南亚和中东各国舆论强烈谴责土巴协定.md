Xinhua News Agency, February 27th—Public opinion in Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern countries strongly condemns the Turkish-Pakistani Pact.

    The Pakistani newspaper "Today's News" published an editorial on the 24th entitled "Who is Behind This Pact?" stating: "This pact was signed according to the intentions of American foreign policy, and American leaders and the press have not concealed this." The editorial disagreed with Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali's statement when announcing the Turkish-Pakistani pact that the agreement would strengthen the Islamic world. The editorial said: "Since Turkey has become a follower of the American policy of aggression, an agreement signed with Turkey is, in a sense, an agreement signed with the American aggressors. This will definitely not lead to peace, but will lead to the road of war and destruction."
    The "Pakistan Times" said in an editorial: "It is clear that it (the Turkish-Pakistani pact) is a conspiracy planned by the United States, aimed at paving the way for American military aid to Pakistan and the establishment of a military bloc in the Middle East." The newspaper said: "This set of military agreements will open the door to foreign rulers and create the danger of Pakistan being dragged into war," and "even cede part of Pakistan's sovereignty."
    The "Indian Times" pointed out in an editorial: "Properly speaking, the aid given under the Common Security Act will, in any case, make Pakistan's foreign policy subordinate to American foreign policy, and establish a new cold war zone in the area between the Middle East and South Asia."
    The "Indian Express" said: The purpose of this agreement "is to revive the Middle East defense organization plan that Arab countries have resolutely rejected." The newspaper said: "Since Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this makes Pakistan a small partner in many Western military alliances."
    The Iranian newspaper "Ajing Daily" said in an editorial: "There is no doubt that Pakistan has joined the Western military bloc." The newspaper pointed out that Middle Eastern countries participating in any military bloc "will only bring poverty, disaster and greater dependence to these countries." The newspaper said: "We have the right to warn other neighboring countries not to follow the path Pakistan has taken."
    The Egyptian newspaper "Republic Daily" reminded Arab countries in an editorial that Western countries "are hostile to Arabs, occupy Arab territories, and trample on the rights of the Arab people." The newspaper said that British and American imperialism are trying to "pull the countries of the Middle East to their side one by one." The newspaper said that Arab countries must rise up to defend their independence.

    东南亚和中东各国舆论强烈谴责土巴协定
    【新华社二十七日讯】东南亚和中东各国舆论强烈谴责土巴协定。
    巴基斯坦“今天报”二十四日以“是谁在策动这协定”为题发表社论说：“这协定是根据美国外交政策的意图而签订的，而美国的首脑们和报界对此也未加隐饰。”社论不同意巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里在宣布土巴协定时所说该协定将加强回教世界的说法。社论说：“由于土耳其已变为美国侵略政策的追随者，因而和土耳其签订的协定在一定意义上也就是和美国侵略者签订的协定。这就决不会是导向和平，而将是导向战争和破坏的道路。”
    “巴基斯坦时报”在社论中说：“很明显地，它（土巴协定）是美国策划下的一个阴谋，旨在为美国对巴基斯坦进行军事援助以及在中东建立军事集团开辟道路。”该报说：“这一套军事协定将为外国的统治者打开大门，并将造成巴基斯坦卷入战争的危险”，“甚至还要出让巴基斯坦的一部分主权”。
    “印度时报”在社论中指出：“恰当的说，将依共同安全法给予的援助，在任何情况下，都会使巴基斯坦的外交政策从属于美国的外交政策，并在中东和南亚之间的地带建立新的冷战地区。”
    “印度快报”说：这一协定的“目的在于使得阿拉伯国家已断然拒绝的中东防御组织计划复活”。该报说：“由于土耳其是北大西洋公约组织的成员，这就使得巴基斯坦也成了西方许多军事联盟的小伙计。”
    伊朗“阿杰灵报”在社论中说：“巴基斯坦已加入西方军事集团，这一点再也不容怀疑了。”该报指出：中东国家参加任何军事集团“只会给这些国家带来贫穷、灾害和更大的依赖性”。该报说：“我们有权警告其他邻国不要走巴基斯坦所走的道路。”
    埃及“共和国报”在社论中提醒阿拉伯国家说：西方国家“敌视阿拉伯人，占领着阿拉伯国家的领土，蹂躏着阿拉伯人民的权利”。该报说：英美帝国主义企图“把中东的国家一个一个地拉到自己那边去”。该报说，阿拉伯国家必须起来保卫自己的独立。
