    Cultivating Cadres from Among the People of All Nationalities in Yunnan
    —A Report on the Yunnan Nationalities Institute
    Nong Bo
    Kunming is a beautiful city in the Southwest, with a climate like spring all year round. In its northern suburbs lies a stretch of verdant holly trees. Ascending a small hill beside the scenic Lotus Pond, one can see, through the lush woods, newly built buildings rich in ethnic characteristics. This is the Yunnan Nationalities Institute.

    This institution of higher learning, belonging to the people of all nationalities in Yunnan, was established on August 1, 1951. Over the past two years, it has trained more than 1,400 ethnic cadres, and a third class of 875 young men and women from various nationalities are currently studying here. When the Yunnan Nationalities Institute was first established, there were only over 50 cadres, mostly Han Chinese. Now, there are 97 cadres from 19 nationalities, including Han, Dai, Yi, Tibetan, Lahu, Lisu, Miao, and others. The school's facilities have also been improving day by day, with annual increases in school buildings. In the first half of last year, classrooms with an area of 1,500 square meters were added; at the end of the year, the construction of dormitories with an area of more than 1,900 square meters was started. Representatives of various nationalities who come to Kunming from all over always want to visit the Yunnan Nationalities Institute. They see with their own eyes that their children are living and studying happily in a place with spacious and bright classrooms, dormitories, libraries, reading rooms, and clubs, as well as gardens shaded by green trees, quiet and elegant clinics, barber shops, and bath rooms. They are often moved to encourage their children in a kind tone: "Chairman Mao established this school for us, you must study hard!"

    The Yunnan Nationalities Institute is a melting pot, training cadres from among the people of all nationalities in Yunnan. Studying here are outstanding sons and daughters of many nationalities, including Han, Tibetan, Miao, Yi, Lisu, Va, Dai, Bai, and Lisu. In the old society, the vast majority of them had no opportunity to receive education. However, over the past two years, more than a thousand people have completed their studies here and have taken up their posts. All the graduates, except for a portion who were sent to the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Southwest Institute for Nationalities, or various specialized schools for further study, mostly returned to their own ethnic areas to assume certain responsibilities. Many have become leading backbone cadres. For example, Dao Youliang, Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Yu Song, Vice Chairman of the Consultative Committee, and more than a hundred other cadres are graduates of the first and second classes of the institute. They can all correctly implement the policies of the Party and the government in their work, and some have become model cadres in border areas. For example, Comrade Li Shuang (Yi nationality), a model worker for border ethnic work in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region, and Comrade Dao Zhixiu (Dai nationality), who works in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, are both graduates of the first class. Seeing their own children grow up under the education of the Communist Party, the people of all nationalities in Yunnan are very happy and express: We must work hard to produce and unite to build the border areas.

    The school is filled with the warmth of an ethnic family. "Unity, mutual assistance, and friendship" have become a common fashion among young people of all nationalities. From both sides of the turbulent Nujiang and Lancang rivers, from the snow-capped Yulong Mountain and the Biluo Mountain, young men and women of all nationalities climb mountains and wade through rivers to throw themselves into its embrace. As soon as they enter the school, they sing and dance, expressing the joy in their hearts. They receive cordial care in all aspects, and can receive brand-new clothes, quilts, cotton pads, snow-white sheets, and various daily necessities; if they get sick, they can receive timely treatment and receive care from leaders and classmates. Student Rong Guangzu said with emotion: "Here, my classmates are even closer to me than my own siblings!" Whenever there is a happy event for any nationality, everyone congratulates each other. For example, when the news of the establishment of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region and the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region spread here, students from various nationalities went in groups of three or five to congratulate the students from the two regions.

    Here, the customs and religious beliefs of all nationalities are also respected. Every time there is a festival of their own nationality, a gathering is held in the institute, and the festival is celebrated to the fullest extent in the form that the nationality loves. For example, Hui students can go to mosques to worship and "fast" during Ramadan. In addition, during the Dai's Water-Sprinkling Festival, the Tibetan's Niba Guri Festival, and the Torch Festival, which is more common among the people of all nationalities, students of all nationalities have a happy time. The leadership is also very concerned about the lives of the students, and has set up canteens for Hui and Tibetan students respectively. If Tibetan students do not want to eat rice, they can eat ghee and zanba that they like in the canteen.

    After class, the students enjoy playing various games. Every time the sun sets, in the square, under the green trees, or in the club, everywhere you can hear the sounds of the Miao students' sanxian and suona, and lusheng; Jingpo and Dai students dance various dances, such as elephant foot drum dance, lion dance, trident dance, spinning dance, and peacock dance; Yi students are wrestling, and Tibetan students are jumping rope and archery; Hani students are playing single-legged swings. Many students use ethnic languages to write songs, praising Chairman Mao and the capital of the motherland, Beijing.

    In such a good learning environment, the students are making rapid progress. Among the third class of students, many people did not know a single word in the past. After a period of study, they can now read popular books and newspapers, and write letters to the volunteers; many people have become learning models. Now, in the third class of students, almost everyone is literate. Many people are absorbed in reading books such as "How to Be a Communist Party Member." Hundreds of books are borrowed from the library every day. The reading room is also always full.

    Because the school often conducts current affairs, policy, and patriotic education for the students, and organizes them to visit nearby factories, the students' political awareness has generally improved, and they have recognized the greatness of the motherland. They are particularly concerned about the construction of the motherland, and the establishment of every factory and school, even the creation of a new record, and the birth of a production cooperative... will greatly inspire the students.

    After studying the general line, the students' socialist consciousness has been raised, and their studies have become more vigorous. They all expressed: We must learn our skills well and strive to build the border areas and build a better socialist society! (Attached pictures)

    为云南各族人民培养自己的干部
    ——记云南民族学院
    侬博
    昆明是西南区的一座美丽的城市，天气四季如春。它的北郊，是一片翠绿的冬青树；走上风景幽美的莲花池畔的一个小山岗，透过葱郁的林木，人们可看到新建的富有民族色彩的大厦。这就是云南民族学院。
    这所云南各族人民自己的学府，是在一九五一年八月一日成立的。两年多来，它培养了一千四百多名民族干部，第三期八百七十五名各族青年男女正在这里学习着。在民族学院初成立时，只有干部五十多人，其中大部是汉族，现在已有包括汉、傣、彝、藏、拉祜、?颇、苗等十九个民族的干部九十七人。学校的设备也已日趋完善，校舍年有增加。去年上半年增盖了面积达一千五百平方公尺的教室；年底又着手添盖面积达一千九百多平方公尺的宿舍。从各地到昆明来参观的各民族代表，总要到云南民族学院看看。他们亲眼看到在自己的子女愉快地生活和学习着的地方，有着宽敞明亮的教室、宿舍、图书室、阅览室和俱乐部，还有绿树成荫的花园，有幽静洁雅的卫生所以及理发室、洗澡间。他们常常感动地用亲切的口吻鼓励自己的子女们：“毛主席为我们办了这个学校，你们要好好地学习呀！”
    云南民族学院是一座熔炉，它锻炼着云南各族人民自己的干部。在这儿学习的有汉、藏、苗、彝、沙、佧佤、傣、民家、?颇等许多个民族的优秀儿女。在旧社会里，他们绝大多数是没有机会受到教育的。可是，两年多来，已经有上千的人在这里完成了学习，走上了工作岗位。所有毕业的学员，除一部分被送到中央民族学院、西南民族学院或各个专科学校去学习外，大多回到本民族地区担负一定的工作。有很多人已成为领导骨干。如西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府副主席刀有良、协商委员会副主席余松，以及其他一百多个干部，都是该院第一、二期的毕业学员。他们在工作中都能正确地执行党和政府的政策，有些已成为边疆工作的模范干部。如现在德宏傣族、?颇族自治区的边疆民族工作模范李双同志（彝族）和西双版纳傣族自治区里工作的刀芝秀同志（傣族）等都是第一期毕业学员。云南各族人民看到自己的子弟在共产党的教育下成长起来，都非常高兴，并表示：我们一定努力生产，团结起来建设边疆。
    学校里充满着民族大家庭的温暖。“团结、互助、友爱”，在各族青年中已成为普遍风尚。从波涛汹涌的怒江和澜沧江两岸，从白雪皑皑的玉龙山和碧萝山麓，各族男女青年爬山涉水投到它的怀里。一进学校，他们就载歌载舞，唱出了内心的喜悦。他们在各方面得到亲切的照顾，可以领到崭新的衣服、棉被、棉垫、雪白的垫单和各种日用品；生了病，都能及时得到治疗，并受到领导方面和同学们的关怀。学员荣光祖感动地说：“在这里，同学对我比我的亲兄妹还亲啊！”每逢各民族有什么喜事，大家相互祝贺。如德宏傣族、?颇族自治区和西双版纳傣族自治区成立的消息一传到这里，各族同学就纷纷三五成群地向该两区的同学道喜。
    在这里，各民族的风俗习惯和宗教信仰也受到了尊重。每逢各民族自己的节日，就在学院里举行聚餐，按照本民族喜爱的形式尽情地欢度节日。例如，回族同学可以到清真寺去做礼拜，在斋期内“把斋”。此外，在傣族的泼水节，藏族的尼巴古日节和各族人民中较为普遍的火把节等节日里，各族同学都过得欢欢喜喜。对同学的生活，领导方面也很关心，给回族和藏族同学分别设立了食堂。如果藏族同学不愿吃大米饭，可以在食堂里吃到他们所喜爱的酥油、?粑。
    课余，同学们尽情地玩着各种游戏。每当夕阳西下，在广场上，在绿荫树下，或在俱乐部里，到处都可以听到苗族同学的三弦琴声和唢呐、芦笙声；?颇族和傣族同学，则跳着各种舞蹈，如象脚鼓舞、狮子舞、三叉舞、纺线舞、孔雀舞；彝族同学在摔交，藏族同学在跳绳、射箭；哈尼族同学玩着独脚秋千。许多同学用民族语言编写歌曲，歌颂毛主席，歌颂祖国的首都北京。
    在这样好的学习环境里，同学们的进步是很快的。第三期学员中，有许多人过去连一个字也不识，经过一个时期的学习，已能看通俗书报，给志愿军写信了；不少人成了学习模范。现在，在第三期学员中，差不多个个已识字。许多人手不释卷，读着“怎样做一个共产党员”等书。图书馆里每天有上百册的书出借。阅览室里也总是坐得满满的。
    由于学校方面对同学经常进行时事政策和爱国主义教育，并组织他们到附近各工厂参观，同学的政治觉悟普遍有了提高，认识了祖国的伟大。他们特别关心祖国的建设，每一个工厂学校的建立，甚至一个新纪录的创造，一个生产合作社的诞生……都会使学员们受到很大鼓舞。
    学习总路线以后，同学们的社会主义觉悟提高了，学习也更起劲了。他们都表示：学好本领，为建设边疆、建设美好的社会主义社会而奋斗！（附图片）
