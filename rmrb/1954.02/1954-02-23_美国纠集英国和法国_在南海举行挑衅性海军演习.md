Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: The United States, colluding with Britain and France, has been conducting large-scale provocative joint naval exercises in the South China Sea off the coast of Indochina and the southern coast of China since February 14th, lasting for ten days. Participating in this exercise are 30 warships, a large number of aircraft, merchant ships, and 10,000 officers and soldiers from the United States, Britain, and France dispatched from Manila, Singapore, and Saigon. According to American news agencies, the sea area where the exercises are being held is the sea lane through which the United States is "transporting an increasing amount of military supplies to Indochina." In this exercise, the United States will "test" its plan to protect the main supply line for French troops fighting in Indochina and prepare to "formulate methods to keep this supply line open in the event of war." This provocative action by the United States is a new step in its consistent policy of creating tension in the Far East, with the aim of creating an atmosphere and conditions for its further participation in the Indochina War.

    美国纠集英国和法国
    在南海举行挑衅性海军演习
    【新华社二十日讯】美国纠集英国和法国自二月十四日起在印度支那海岸及中国南部海岸附近的南海海面大规模地举行历时十天的挑衅性的联合海军演习。参加这次演习的有从马尼剌、新加坡和西贡等地出动的美、英、法三国的三十艘军舰、大批飞机、商船和一万名官兵。据美国通讯社报道，举行演习的海面是美国往印度支那“运送不断增加的军需品的供应线所经过的海面”。在这次演习中，美国将“考验”它的保护对在印度支那作战的法国军队的主要供应线的计划，并且准备“拟订出在战事一旦发生时”使这条供应线仍然可以通行的办法。美国这个挑衅性行动是它在远东制造紧张局势的一贯政策的新的步骤，其目的是为它进一步参加印度支那战争创造气氛和条件。
