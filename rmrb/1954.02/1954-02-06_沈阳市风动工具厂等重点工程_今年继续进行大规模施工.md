Shenyang's key projects, including the expansion projects of the Wind Power Tool Factory, the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, and the Wire Factory, will continue large-scale construction this year on the basis of successfully completing last year's construction tasks. Several brand-new equipment workshops will be put into production successively after the second quarter.

By the end of December last year, the 1953 projects of these units had been completed according to plan, and some had even overfulfilled their tasks. With the progress of national construction, the capital construction tasks of each factory are even heavier this year. The No. 1 Machine Tool Factory has determined that there are 32 construction projects this year in terms of construction alone, and construction will begin successively from February. This year, the Wind Power Tool Factory plans to build a woodworking workshop, calcium carbide warehouse, timber warehouse, waste product warehouse, fire equipment warehouse, coal warehouse, and underground oil depot, as well as several thousand square meters of dormitories and welfare facilities. The original copper melting workshop and the rolling workshop, wire drawing workshop, stranding workshop, and rubber insulated wire workshop in the main workshop of the Wire Factory will all be renovated this year; auxiliary departments supporting production such as the machine repair and electrical repair workshops will also be renovated at the same time; in addition, new boiler rooms with several floors, gas generating stations, and four substations belonging to the power system will be built, as well as various pipelines; there are as many as nine types of electricity, lighting, air, steam, gas, water supply and drainage, and oil pipes.

In terms of machine installation, the Wire Factory will install more than 2,500 tons of equipment this year, most of which are various automated and mechanized machines supplied by the Soviet Union. A large copper melting furnace will be installed in the renovated copper melting workshop, which can produce 40 tons of molten copper at a time; a rolling mill weighing 1,200 tons in the rolling workshop can simultaneously roll out two copper rods; three high-pressure boilers will be installed in the tall boiler room, each capable of supplying at least 10 tons of steam per hour. Installation can begin after the completion of the construction project in the third quarter. The newly built or renovated workshops of the Wind Power Tool Factory have installed some equipment last year, and hundreds of new machines from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries will continue to be installed this year. The main workshop of the factory—the cutting and forging workshop—will install more than 50 large steam hammers weighing two to three tons, air hammers, presses weighing more than 300 tons, and various cutting machines this year. The central laboratory will also install 15 precision instruments. Dozens of machines have been installed in the tool workshop last year, and it is planned to install more than 20 machine tools this year. While the installation is in progress, another part of the machines will be put into production. The machine installation task of the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory this year has increased five and a half times compared with last year, including cutting equipment, forging equipment, casting equipment, transportation and power equipment, etc., and the equipment and installation costs alone account for more than 60% of the total investment for the year.

In order to enable these new equipment to be put into production and exert their effectiveness as soon as possible, the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory began to install the last dozens of machines in the first workshop and the tool workshop in January, in order to strive to start producing the tools and high-speed and precise Soviet-style 1A62 medium-sized lathes required by the whole factory after the second quarter of this year. The machining and tool workshops of the Wind Power Tool Factory can complete the installation of all equipment in the first and second quarters, and put it into production at the end of the second quarter. The equipment in the cutting and forging workshop of the factory is installed and put into production at the same time. The expansion project of the factory can be basically completed this year, and the productivity can be increased by six or seven times compared with before the expansion. Tens of thousands of new types of wind power tools can be produced every year to meet the needs of national capital construction and industrial production.

    沈阳市风动工具厂等重点工程
    今年继续进行大规模施工
    沈阳市重点工程风动工具厂、第一机床厂、电线厂等扩建工程在胜利完成去年施工任务的基础上，今年将继续进行大规模施工，第二季度后将有数个崭新设备的场房陆续投入生产。
    到去年十二月底，这些单位的一九五三年度的工程均已先后按计划完工，有的并超额完成了任务。随着国家建设的进展，今年各厂的基本建设任务更加繁重。第一机床厂确定今年施工的工程项目仅建筑方面就有三十二项，从二月份开始，即将陆续进行施工。风动工具厂今年计划修建木工车间、电石库、木材仓库、废品库、消防器材库、煤库以及地下油库，并要修建数千平方公尺宿舍及福利设施。电线厂原有熔铜车间和主场房中的压延车间、拉线车间、绞线车间及橡皮绝缘线车间今年都将进行改建；配合生产的辅助部门如机修、电修车间也要同时进行改建；另外并要新建属于动力系统的有数层楼高的锅炉房及瓦斯发生站、四个变电所，以及各种管道；电力、照明、空气、蒸气、瓦斯、上下水道与油管等，共达九种之多。
    在机器安装方面，电线厂今年设备安装量将达两千五百多吨，大部分都是苏联供给我们的各种自动化、机械化机器。在改建后的熔铜车间里将安装一座大熔铜炉，每次可出四十吨铜水；压延车间里重达一千二百吨的一套压延机，可同时压出两根铜杆；在高大的锅炉房里将安装三台高压锅炉，每台每小时最少可供十吨蒸气。从第三季度建筑工程完工后，即可开始安装。风动工具厂各新建或改建的车间，去年已安好一部分设备，今年继续安装数百台来自苏联和各人民民主国家的各种新式机器。该厂的主要车间——切料锻压车间今年要安装两吨到三吨重的大蒸气锤、空气锤、三百多吨重的压力机和各种切料机等五十余台。中央实验室还要安十五台精密仪器。工具车间在去年已安装好数十台机器，今年计划再安装二十多台机床，在安装同时另一部分机器就开始投入生产。第一机床厂今年的机器安装任务比去年增大了五倍半，其中包括切削设备、锻压设备、铸造设备、运输及动力设备等，仅设备及安装费用即占全年总投资额百分之六十以上。
    为使这些新式设备能够早日投入生产发挥效能，第一机床厂在一月间就开始安装第一车间和工具车间最后数十台机器，以争取今年第二季度后开始生产全厂需用的工卡具和高速而精密的苏式一A六二中型车床。风动工具厂的机械加工和工具车间在第一、二季度内即可将全部设备安完，第二季度末投入生产，该厂的切料锻压车间的设备是边安装边投入生产。该厂扩建工程今年可以基本完成，较扩建前生产力可提高六、七倍，每年可产各种新式风动工具数万台，供应国家基本建设和工业生产的需要。
