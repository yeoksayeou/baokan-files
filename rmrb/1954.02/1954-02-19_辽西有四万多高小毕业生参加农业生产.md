In 1953, Western Liaoning Province organized more than 49,000 senior elementary school graduates to participate in agricultural production. Now, this group of graduates has become an important force on the agricultural production front in the province. Last year, Western Liaoning Province adopted measures such as expanding junior high school enrollment, running tutoring classes, and absorbing some senior elementary school graduates back to school for remedial studies, solving the learning problems of more than 48,000 senior elementary school graduates, accounting for 44.9% of all senior elementary school graduates. The remaining more than 49,000 senior elementary school graduates who did not continue their studies participated in agricultural production and other work. The graduates worked actively in labor production and spread new knowledge, playing a certain role in improving production technology. Wang Kaida, a senior elementary school graduate from Hongqi Village in Shuangliao County, worked hard in the fields last autumn and also led his mutual aid team to engage in sideline production after the autumn harvest. Zhang Fengshan, a senior elementary school graduate from Haba Village in Panshan County, read newspapers to farmers during production breaks and also helped farmers learn advanced agricultural techniques and improve farming methods. Many senior elementary school graduates who participated in agricultural production actively persuaded their parents to join mutual aid teams or agricultural producers' cooperatives. Because of their hard work in production and active participation in social activities, many of these senior elementary school graduates have been elected as people's representatives and village cadres.

Last year, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Western Liaoning Provincial Committee at all levels strengthened its leadership over organizing senior elementary school graduates to participate in agricultural production. The CPC Western Liaoning Provincial Committee instructed the municipal and county Party committees to hold special meetings to study this work. The municipal and county Party committees also combined other work to arrange for solving the employment and further education problems of senior elementary school graduates, paying attention to publicizing the reason that the state cannot meet the further education requirements of all senior elementary school graduates at present, as well as the bright future of senior elementary school graduates participating in agricultural production. Many village cadres also first educated their children who failed to enter middle school to take the lead in participating in agricultural production. The educational administrative departments at all levels in the province planned meticulously in handling this work and carried out in-depth publicity and mobilization work. After senior elementary school graduates participated in agricultural production, the relevant departments continued to care for them and constantly gave them encouragement and praise. Many primary school teachers also continued to help them solve difficulties in their work and study.

    辽西有四万多高小毕业生参加农业生产
    辽西省一九五三年组织了四万九千多名高小毕业生参加农业生产，现在这批高小毕业生已成为该省农业生产战线上的一支重要力量。辽西省去年采取扩大初中招生名额，开办补习班和吸收一部分高小毕业生回校补习等办法，解决了四万八千多名高小毕业生的学习问题，占全体高小毕业生的百分之四十四点九，其余没有升学的四万九千多名高小毕业生都参加了农业生产和其他工作。毕业生们在劳动生产中工作积极，并传播了新知识，对改进生产技术起了一定的作用。双辽县红旗村高小毕业生王开达在去年秋季下地努力干活，秋后还带动他们的互助组从事副业生产。盘山县哈吧村高小毕业生张凤山利用生产休息时间给农民读报，还帮助农民学习先进农业技术，改进耕作方法。很多参加农业生产的高小毕业生都积极说服家长参加互助组或农业生产合作社。这些高小毕业生由于努力生产积极参加社会活动，不少人被选为人民代表和村干部。
    中共辽西省各级党委去年加强了对组织高小毕业生参加农业生产工作的领导。中共辽西省委曾指示各市、县委专门开会研究这项工作，各市、县委并结合其他工作布置了解决高小毕业生就业升学问题，工作中并注意宣传目前国家还不能满足全部高小毕业生升学要求的道理和高小毕业生参加农业生产的光明前途。很多村干部也首先教育自己未考上中学的子女带头参加农业生产。该省各级教育行政部门在处理这一工作中计划周密，并进行了深入的宣传动员工作。高小毕业生在参加农业生产以后，各有关部门继续关心他们，不断地给他们以鼓励和表扬。不少小学教师还继续帮助他们解决工作和学习中的困难。
