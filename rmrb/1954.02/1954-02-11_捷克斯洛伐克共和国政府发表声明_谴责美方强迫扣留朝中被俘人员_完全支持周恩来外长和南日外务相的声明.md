Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th – The Czechoslovak News Agency reported on the 8th that the Czechoslovak government issued the following statement regarding the US’s forcible detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war:

　　I. According to the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) has the task of "ensuring that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice."

　　In the spirit of a consistent policy of peace, and in order to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, thereby easing international tensions, the Czechoslovak government agreed to serve as a member of the Korean NNRC and sent representatives to participate in the commission.

　　II. The primary task of the NNRC is to ensure that the detaining side has the opportunity to conduct ninety days of explanations to the prisoners of war without interference, explaining their rights to them, especially informing them of all matters related to their exercise of their right to be repatriated and to return to their country to live peacefully. At the same time, the terms of reference of the NNRC stipulate that prisoners of war should not be subject to any control or influence from the original detaining side after being transferred to the custody of the NNRC.

　　However, it is now a confirmed fact that the NNRC cannot complete its task due to the serious obstacles and chaos created by the US.

　　When the prisoners of war were still in South Korea, with the permission and direct participation of the US, special agent terror organizations were established among the prisoners of war, and these organizations were tasked with disrupting the explanation work and causing the failure of the NNRC's work.

　　After the Indian Custodial Forces took over the prisoners of war, these organizations were not eliminated. On the contrary, the original detaining side, the US, maintained contact with the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's agent terror organizations until the very last day and directed their activities. These agents absolutely controlled the camps, establishing a reign of terror and violence in the camps, preventing prisoners of war from freely exercising their right to be repatriated. Prisoners of war who requested repatriation were subjected to various forms of physical and psychological persecution, and even murder. There were many cases of agents murdering prisoners of war.

　　Based on the numerous documents written by agents in the prisoner of war camps intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces attached to the NNRC's preliminary report, as well as the report itself submitted to the Korean side commanders on December 28, 1953, it is clear that the US, as the original detaining side, continued to exert illegal pressure on the prisoners of war through the agent organizations of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee after transferring the prisoners of war to the custody of the NNRC, while directing the agents to carry out activities to prevent the prisoners of war from exercising their right to be repatriated.

　　These agents prevented the vast majority of prisoners of war from listening to the explanations. The planned ninety days of explanation work was only carried out for ten days, and only 15% of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war had listened to the explanations.

　　III. During the discussions of the NNRC, the Czechoslovak representative put forward a series of specific proposals aimed at breaking the reign of terror and violence in the prisoner of war camps, eliminating the terror organizations of agents, and thereby creating conditions for the prisoners of war to freely exercise their right to be repatriated.

　　The situation in the prisoner of war camps developed to such an intolerable point that the methods of explanation, and even the question of whether to conduct explanations, were not decided by the NNRC, but by the terror organizations of agents of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee in the prisoner of war camps, directed by the US and the South Korean authorities.

　　IV. Without a doubt, the NNRC should have consistently demanded that the explanation work be carried out for the full ninety days, in accordance with the provisions of its terms of reference. Then it should have submitted the issue of those prisoners of war who had not yet exercised their right to be repatriated by that time to the Korean political conference. The provisions of the NNRC's terms of reference are very clear in this regard and do not allow for any other interpretation.

　　V. However, in violation of the Armistice Agreement and the letter and spirit of the NNRC's terms of reference, and despite the protests of the Czechoslovak and Polish representatives, the prisoners of war were handed over to the US.

　　Then, disregarding the warnings of the NNRC, the US handed over the Chinese and Korean prisoners of war to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee.

　　This action by the US violated the NNRC's terms of reference and the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who had been forcibly prevented from exercising their inalienable right to be repatriated are now being forced to join the mercenary armies of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee by means of terror. This is completely contrary to the Geneva Conventions.

　　The US is therefore creating new complications on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and consolidating peace in the Far East.

　　VI. In this situation, the Czechoslovak government, like many other members of the United Nations, agreed to convene the UN General Assembly to discuss the Korean situation. Due to the obstructionist tactics of the US, negotiations on convening a political conference have been interrupted and remain deadlocked, which has made the Korean situation even more serious.

　　Therefore, the Czechoslovak government fully supports the demands made by the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the statements issued by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China on January 29, 1954, and Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on January 30, 1954, respectively: that the UN General Assembly should reconvene as soon as possible to discuss the dangerous situation in Korea, and that representatives of the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China should participate in the discussion of the Korean issue; and that negotiations on convening a political conference on the Korean issue should be resumed. The people of all countries in the world, especially the people of Asian countries, are watching these developments in Korea with concern. They are all convinced that convening a five-power conference will help to finally resolve the Korean issue peacefully and to resolve major issues in Asia and internationally, and will help to ease international tensions.

　　In view of this, the Czechoslovak government fully supports the proposal made by Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov at the Berlin Conference on January 26, 1954, regarding "measures to ease international tensions and convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China."

### 捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府发表声明  谴责美方强迫扣留朝中被俘人员  完全支持周恩来外长和南日外务相的声明

    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府发表声明
    谴责美方强迫扣留朝中被俘人员
    完全支持周恩来外长和南日外务相的声明
    【新华社布拉格十日电】捷克斯洛伐克通讯社八日报道，捷克斯洛伐克政府就美方强迫扣留朝中战俘发表声明如下：
      一、按照朝鲜停战协定的规定，中立国遣返委员会有任务“保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利”。
    根据一贯的和平政策的精神，并为了对和平解决朝鲜问题有所贡献，从而缓和国际紧张局势，捷克斯洛伐克政府同意担任朝鲜中立国遣返委员会委员，并派遣代表参加了这个委员会。
    二、中立国遣返委员会的主要任务是保证战俘所属方面有机会不受干扰地对战俘进行九十天的解释工作，向他们解释他们的权利，特别是向他们说明一切有关他们行使其被遣返权利、回到他们的国家去过和平生活的问题。同时，中立国遣返委员会的职权范围规定：战俘在移交给中立国遣返委员会看管之后，不应再受到原拘留方面的任何控制或影响。
    但是现在，一个确定的事实是：由于美方所制造的严重障碍与混乱，中立国遣返委员会不能完成它的任务。
    当战俘还在南朝鲜的时候，就在美方的允许与直接参与下，在战俘中间建立了特务恐怖组织，交给这些组织的任务是破坏解释工作，使中立国遣返委员会的工作失败。
    在印度看管部队接管战俘以后，这些组织并没有被清除，相反的，原拘留方，就是美方一直到最后一天还与蒋介石与李承晚的特务恐怖组织保持着联系，并指挥他们进行活动。这些特务绝对地控制了营场，在营场中建立了恐怖与暴力的统治，阻挠战俘自由行使他们的被遣返权利。要求遣返的战俘遭到各种形式的肉体迫害和心理压力，甚至还遭到杀害，特务谋杀战俘案件就发生过许多起。
    根据附在中立国遣返委员会的初步报告中的印度看管部队所截获的战俘营中特务写的许多文件以及一九五三年十二月二十八日提交给朝鲜双方司令部的这个报告本身，可以清楚地看出，美方作为原拘留方，在把战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管之后，继续通过蒋介石和李承晚的特务组织，非法地对战俘施行压力，同时指挥特务进行活动，阻止战俘行使其被遣返权利。
    这些特务使绝大多数战俘不能听取解释，原定进行九十天的解释工作只进行了十天，只有百分之十五的朝中战俘听取过解释。
    三、捷克斯洛伐克代表在中立国遣返委员会的讨论过程中，曾提出了一连串具体的建议，这些建议的目的在打破战俘营里的恐怖和暴力统治，肃清特务的恐怖组织，并由此而创造条件，使战俘们能自由地行使其被遣返权利。
    战俘营里的情况发展到这种无法容忍的地步：关于解释的方法，甚至是否要进行解释的问题，不是由中立国遣返委员会来决定，而是由美方和南朝鲜当局所指挥的那些战俘营里的蒋介石和李承晚的特务恐怖组织来决定。
    四、毫无疑问，中立国遣返委员会本应当根据其职权范围的规定始终不渝地要求解释工作进行满九十天。然后它应当把那些到那时为止还未行使其被遣返权利的战俘的问题提交朝鲜政治会议。中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的规定在这方面是十分明确的，绝不允许作任何其他的解释。
    五、但是，违反停战协定和中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的文字和精神，不顾捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表提出的抗议，战俘被移交给美方了。
    接着，美方不顾中立国遣返委员会提出的警告，把中国和朝鲜战俘交给了蒋介石和李承晚。
    美方这种行动，违反了中立国遣返委员会的职权范围与停战协定的规定。朝中战俘曾被用武力阻止他们行使其不容剥夺的被遣返权利，现在他们被用恐怖手段强迫加入蒋介石与李承晚的雇佣军。这是与日内瓦公约完全相抵触的。
    美国方面因而在和平解决朝鲜问题及巩固远东和平的道路上制造了新的复杂局面。
    六、在这种情况下，捷克斯洛伐克政府像许多其他联合国会员国一样，同意召开联合国大会来讨论朝鲜局势。由于美方的阻挠策略，关于召开政治会议的谈判中断了，而且现在仍然是陷于僵局中，这使得朝鲜局势变得更加严重。
    因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府完全支持中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来在一九五四年一月二十九日以及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在一九五四年一月三十日分别发表的声明中所提出的中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的要求：联合国大会应该尽快地复会以讨论朝鲜危险的局势问题，在讨论朝鲜问题时应有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国政府的代表参加；同时应该恢复关于召开朝鲜问题政治会议的谈判。世界各国人民，特别是亚洲各国人民都以关切的心情注视着在朝鲜的这些发展。他们都深信，召开五大国会议将有助于最后和平解决朝鲜问题和解决亚洲与国际上的重大问题，有助于缓和国际紧张局势。
    有鉴于此，捷克斯洛伐克政府完全支持苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫一九五四年一月二十六日在柏林会议上所提出的“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”的建议。
