The workers and technicians of the joint state-private Tianfu Coal Mine Electromechanical Department, after studying the general line for the transition period, realized that improving technology and cultivating technical personnel is of great significance for the country's realization of socialist industrialization, and they are all eager to improve their skills. Now, the Electromechanical Department has launched a wave of learning and delving into technology, and various amateur training classes, training sessions, and technical research associations have been organized successively, and 300 pairs of apprenticeship contracts have been signed. Mutual assistance contracts between technicians and skilled workers, and between skilled workers, are also beginning to be signed.

In 1953, many electromechanical accidents occurred in the Tianfu Coal Mine, most of which were caused by workers' unfamiliarity with operations. This time, an amateur rotation training class in mining electromechanical technology operations was set up to absorb workers from areas such as air compressors, winches, water pumps, fans, and electric screens in stages, to conduct technical operation training. Technicians explain the basic principles of operation and methods for preventing and handling accidents to gradually improve workers' operating skills. One of the main reasons for the low quality of products made by the machine factory in the past was that some technicians and apprentices could not understand drawings. This time, a crash course in blueprint reading was set up. The technicians in the drawing room also felt that they did not understand applied mechanics in the past and could not see problems with many design drawings. This time, they organized an applied mechanics study group. Some technical cadres promoted from workers in the machine factory organized study groups for elementary algebra and advanced algebra according to their level. Technical personnel with general scientific and technological theoretical knowledge also organized technical research groups to exchange technical experience.

    天府煤矿机电科组织各种业余技术学习班
    公私合营天府煤矿机电科的工人和技术人员们，学习了国家过渡时期总路线以后，认识到提高技术、培养技术人材对国家实现社会主义工业化有着重要的意义，都迫切地要求提高技术。现在机电科已掀起了学习技术、钻研技术的热潮，各种业余学习班、训练班、技术研究会已先后组织起来，并已订立了三百对师徒合同。技术人员与技术工人之间、技术工人与技术工人之间的互助合同也已开始在订立中。
    在一九五三年中，天府煤矿井下曾发生了许多机电事故，其中大部分是因为工人不熟悉操作所引起的。这次办了一个业余的矿山机电技术操作轮训班，分期吸收压风机、绞车、水泵、风扇、电筛等方面的工人，进行技术操作的训练，由技术员们讲解操作的基本原理和防止事故以及处理事故的办法，逐步提高工人的操作技术。过去机厂制件质量不高的主要原因之一，是因为部分技工及学徒们看不懂图样，这次就办了个识图速成教学班。绘图室的技术人员们也感到过去不懂应用力学，对许多设计图样看不出问题，这次就组织了应用力学学习小组，机厂有些由工人提拔起来的技术干部按程度不同组织了初等代数和高等代数的学习小组，一般有科学技术理论知识的技术人员，也组织了技术研究小组，交流技术经验。
