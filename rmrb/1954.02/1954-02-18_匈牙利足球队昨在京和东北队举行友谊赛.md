    Hungarian Football Team Holds Friendly Match with Northeast Team in Beijing Yesterday

    On February 17th, the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team and the Chinese Northeast Football Team held a friendly match at the Xiannongtan Stadium in the capital. The Hungarian team won its third victory in a Beijing exhibition match with a score of three to one.

    The Northeast Team was the third-place winner in the 1953 National Football Competition. The players' abundant physical strength and vigorous offensive spirit left a deep impression on the audience in the capital. The players also learned and absorbed a lot of techniques and experience from the Hungarian team's excellent performances in the past two games.

    That day, the wind was strong. After the start of the match, the Northeast team launched a rapid and brave attack against the wind. Within the first three minutes, they shot at the goal twice. At this time, the Northeast team's forwards formed a siege against the Hungarian team's goal. In the fifth minute, Jin Chengnan, the right inside forward of the Northeast team, got a chance to shoot within twelve yards in front of the opponent's goal. The ball was swift and powerful, breaking through the goal. The Northeast team made the first score. The audience cheered. After losing this goal, the Hungarian team immediately launched a counterattack from both wings with quick short passes. The Northeast team's defenders defended tightly, intercepting the opponent's passes many times. In the sixteenth minute, the Hungarian team's right inside forward, Kish, cleverly dodged the Northeast team's center back's interception and shot quickly from about twenty yards. The Northeast team's goalkeeper jumped to save but was unable to reach it, and the ball went into the net from the upper left corner. The audience responded with warm applause for this wonderful long shot. At this time, the score on the field was one to one. Both teams strived for opportunities to attack the ball. The two sides attacked and shot at each other. The Northeast team's goalkeeper saved dangerous shots twice. In the twenty-fourth minute, a tense scramble occurred in the Northeast team's center back area. The Hungarian team's left inside forward, Bara, intercepted the ball at eighteen yards and shot a goal. In the subsequent rapid counterattack, the Northeast team had several shots, but none were successful. In the thirtieth minute, the Hungarian team's forwards and center backs launched a full-scale attack on the Northeast team with quick short passes and dribbling. The Hungarian team's three backs also crossed the midline and set up a formation. The Northeast team used excellent interception moves to prevent the opponent from getting accurate shooting opportunities. Two minutes before the end of the first half, the Northeast team approached the opponent's goal. Han Wensong, on the left wing, dribbled the ball to the end line next to the goal and shot back, but the ball was too weak and was saved by the opponent's goalkeeper. The Hungarian team took the lead with two to one in the first half.

    After the start of the second half, the Northeast team had a downwind position, and the offensive was even fiercer. They launched two attacks in the first three minutes, both of which were forced into corner kicks by the opponent. After intercepting the ball, the Hungarian team passed and dribbled the ball to the Northeast team's center back area with cross passes. In the fifth minute, the Hungarian team's center forward, Vas, took a long shot, hitting the right corner of the goal. After that, the Northeast team used the downwind to launch many long shots, but most of them flew out of bounds beyond the goal. In resisting the Hungarian team's short pass attack, the Northeast team adopted a close-following and tight-marking tactic, and the interception of the opponent's passes was very successful. Shortly before the end of the game, the Hungarian team repeatedly approached the Northeast team's back area with skillful passing, but it did not result in anything because they did not get a favorable shooting opportunity. The second half ended in fierce competition. The final score of the match was three to one.

    Throughout the ninety-minute match, the 20,000 spectators in the audience were fully focused from beginning to end. When the final whistle blew, the audience breathed a sigh of relief and applauded enthusiastically to thank the players of both teams with excited and satisfied hearts.

    In this match, both sides adopted an offensive posture, trying to strive for shooting opportunities as much as possible. Throughout the entire process, the Hungarian team once again won the praise of the audience in the capital with accurate short passes, skilled dribbling techniques, and excellent teamwork. The Northeast team players had abundant physical strength and maintained a vigorous offensive spirit throughout the game, running fast,抢得紧 (translator's note: no perfect translation here, closest is) fighting hard, and not letting go of any chance to grab the ball. The audience was very satisfied with the Northeast team's performance. Jin Chengnan, a member of the Northeast team who scored a goal against the opponent in this match, had participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and had been awarded one major and one minor meritorious service.

    This match was carried out from beginning to end in a tense, warm and friendly atmosphere. (Xinhua News Agency)

    匈牙利足球队昨在京和东北队举行友谊赛
    二月十七日，匈牙利国家足球混合队和中国东北足球代表队，在首都先农坛体育场举行了友谊比赛。匈牙利队以三比一取得了在北京表演赛的第三次胜利。
    东北队是一九五三年全国足球比赛的第三名。队员们充沛的体力和旺盛的进攻精神，曾经给首都观众留下深刻印象。队员们还从匈牙利队过去两场的卓越表演中，学习和吸取了不少技术和经验。
    这一天，风很大。比赛开始后，东北队在逆风中发动迅速勇猛的进攻。在头三分钟内曾两次攻门。这时东北队前锋对匈牙利队球门形成围打形势。第五分钟时，东北队右内锋金成男在对方球门前十二码内获得射球机会，球势劲疾，破门而入。东北队首创纪录。全场观众欢声雷动。匈牙利队失去这一球后，立即以迅速短传从两翼发动反攻。东北队后卫防守严密，多次截住对方传球。第十六分钟时，匈牙利队右内锋基什以巧妙动作闪过东北队中卫拦截，在约二十码处举足疾射，东北队守门员跃救不及，球从左上角穿入网中。观众对这一美妙远射报以热烈掌声。此时场上记录为一比一。两队队员都力争攻球机会。双方互有攻射。东北队守门员曾两次救出险球。第二十四分钟时，两队在东北队中卫区发生紧张的争夺。匈牙利队左内锋巴拉在十八码处截得球后，射入一球。东北队在此后的快速反攻中，曾有数次射门，都没有成功。第三十分钟时，匈牙利队前锋和中卫，以迅速短传和带球向东北队发动全力进攻，匈牙利队三后卫也越过了中线摆开阵势。东北队以卓越的截球动作，使对方无法获得准确射门机会。在上半时终场前两分钟，东北队逼近对方球门，左翼韩文松带球到球门边端线边时，回身攻射，但球势稍轻，为对方守门员救出。上半时匈牙利队以二比一占先。
    下半时开始后，东北队占顺风地位，攻势更为猛锐，在开始的三分钟内发动了两次进攻，都被对方逼成角球。匈牙利队在截获球后，以交叉传递，将球传带到东北队中卫区。第五分钟时，匈牙利队中锋瓦斯起足远射，从球门右角穿射命中。此后，东北队利用顺风之势，发动多次远射，但大都超越球门飞出界外。东北队在抵挡匈牙利队短传进攻中，采取紧跟、紧盯战术，截挡对方传球很成功。在终场前不久，匈牙利队曾多次以巧妙的盘传，逼近东北队后卫区，但因未获得有利的射门机会而无结果。下半场在激烈的争夺中结束。全场比赛结果为三比一。
    全场二万观众在这九十分钟比赛过程中，自始至终全神贯注。终场笛鸣时，观众们才舒了一口气，并以兴奋满意的心情，热烈向两队队员鼓掌致谢。
    这一场比赛，双方都采取攻势，尽量争取射门机会。匈牙利队在整个过程中再一次以准确的短传、熟练的盘带技术和出色的集体合作赢得首都观众的赞美。东北队队员具有充沛的体力，全场都保持了旺盛的进攻精神，跑得快、抢得紧，不放松任何抢球机会。观众们对东北队的表演很满意。在这一场比赛中，攻入对方一球的东北队队员金成男，曾经参加过抗美援朝战争，立过一大功和一小功。
    这一场比赛自始至终是在紧张、热烈而充满友爱的气氛中进行的。（新华社）
