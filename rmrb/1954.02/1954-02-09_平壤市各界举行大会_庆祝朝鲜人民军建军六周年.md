    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 8th: Pyongyang held a grand rally attended by over 1,000 people from all walks of life on the evening of the 7th to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

    Present at the rally were leading figures from the Korean Party and government organs headed by Kim Tu-bong, responsible persons from various democratic parties and mass organizations, senior generals of the Korean People's Army, Heroes of the Republic, and representatives from all circles in Pyongyang.

    A delegation from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, led by General Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, was invited to attend the rally.

    Also invited to the rally were diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries stationed in Korea. Gan Yetao, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Korea, attended the rally.

    The assembly unanimously elected Marshal Kim Il-sung, Chairman Malenkov, and Chairman Mao Zedong as the honorary presidium of the assembly.

    General Kim Kwang-hyop, Chief of General Staff of the Korean People's Army, delivered a report at the meeting. He said: The six-year history of the Korean People's Army is a glorious history of victory and growth. Especially during the three-year Fatherland Liberation War, under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Workers' Party, the People's Army not only achieved brilliant victories shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, but also grew into a modern army with rich combat experience. He emphasized: Now, the enemy has not abandoned its aggressive plans and is still attempting to maintain international tensions. All officers and men of our People's Army must be vigilant, monitor every move of the enemy, prepare ourselves, and strike at any enemy who dares to invade; and we must actively participate in the reconstruction of the motherland.

    Subsequently, Liu Young-joon, representative of the Korean Democratic United Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting.

    General Zhang Nansheng also delivered a congratulatory speech amidst warm applause. He said: The great victory of the Korean People's Army in winning the Korean armistice proves that the Korean nation is worthy of being a heroic nation, and the Korean People's Army is worthy of being a heroic army. We, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, feel supreme honor and pride in having such a neighboring country and comrade-in-arms. He also said: At present, the US imperialists are doing their best to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice. Let us unite more closely, be a hundred times more vigilant, maintain a high degree of vigilance, hold our positions, and work together to defend the fruits of the armistice, to prevent and thwart all the enemy's conspiracies and provocations to undermine the armistice, to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world!

    General Zhang Nansheng, on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, presented a huge silk banner to the Korean People's Army, embroidered with "Glory and Victory Belong to the Heroic Korean People and the Korean People's Army."

    The assembly finally passed a letter of respect to Marshal Kim Il-sung. After the meeting, the Korean People's Army Concert Troupe performed celebratory programs.

    The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army also held a gathering on the evening of the 7th to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Army.
