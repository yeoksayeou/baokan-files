Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 4th – The Soviet, French, British, and American foreign ministers held their eighth meeting on the 2nd, continuing to discuss item two on the agenda: "The German Question and the Task of Guaranteeing European Security." Dulles served as chairman.

Dulles spoke first. He complained about Molotov's accusation on the 1st that the U.S., Britain, and France were attempting to piece together a military bloc aimed at the Soviet Union, saying that such accusations were groundless. Unable to justify himself, Dulles fabricated historical facts about the beginning of World War II, attempting to distort the truth about Soviet-German relations in 1939. As everyone knows, because Western countries attempted to instigate Hitler's Germany to attack the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union was faced with two choices at the time: either to accept the proposal of a non-aggression treaty put forward by Germany at that time for self-defense, thereby gaining time to strengthen its national defense; or to reject Germany's proposal, thereby allowing Western countries to immediately bring about an armed conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany, creating an unfavorable situation for the Soviet Union and completely isolating it.

Dulles verbally agreed with Molotov's opinion that the German question was primarily a matter for the Germans themselves, and therefore German representatives should broadly participate in all stages of the treaty preparation work. However, he vehemently attacked the government of the German Democratic Republic, which is supported by the vast majority of East German residents, denying this government the right to represent the residents of East Germany during the preparation of the treaty, while insisting that the Bonn regime has the right to represent the residents of West Germany.

Dulles insisted that the United States' enactment of a law appropriating $100 million to carry out sabotage activities in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies was out of humanitarian considerations; that the North Atlantic aggressive bloc was a peaceful defensive group that complied with the United Nations Charter; and that the United States' military measures against the Soviet Union were justified.

Bidault then spoke. He agreed with Molotov's opinion that a peace treaty with Germany could only be signed by an all-German government, which is produced by a parliament elected on the basis of free elections. However, he attempted to prove that the preparation work for the peace treaty should not begin before the all-German government is established. He defended the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, attempting to deny that these two treaties would turn West Germany into a major bridgehead for preparing for another war in Europe, and attempting to deny that these two treaties are an obstacle to German reunification. He said that there are now only two paths: either to implement "compulsory control" over Germany, or to adopt the so-called "joint formula," which is to establish a Western European army and incorporate the armed forces of German revanchism into it. He also opposed the Soviet delegation's proposal, which advocated that the four foreign ministers' assistants be tasked with preparing a draft peace treaty with Germany within three months, allowing countries that participated in the war against Germany to have the opportunity to express their views on the peace treaty issue, and stipulating that German representatives should participate in all stages of the preparation of the treaty.

Eden then spoke. He first acknowledged that because of the division of Germany, there could be no real stability in Europe, so the task of the conference was to immediately begin establishing a unified Germany. However, Eden contradicted himself, saying that he was "greatly disappointed" by Molotov's speech the previous day, even though Molotov had put forward some practical and concrete methods in his speech for restoring Germany's unity on a peaceful and democratic basis and for quickly preparing a peace treaty with Germany. Eden still insisted on his plan, which is based on the premise that the preparation of the peace treaty should not begin until so-called all-German free elections are held. He insisted that the discussion of the German question should be based on his plan.

Molotov spoke before the meeting adjourned. He said that the Soviet delegation had some comments on the speeches of Dulles, Bidault, and Eden. But because it was late, the Soviet delegation would speak tomorrow and would put forward suggestions regarding all-German elections.

The meeting adjourned at this point.

    四国外长会议继续讨论德国问题
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：苏、法、英、美四国外长会议在二日举行第八次会议，继续讨论议程第二项：“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”。杜勒斯任主席。
    杜勒斯首先发言。他抱怨莫洛托夫在一日指责美、英、法三国企图拼凑一个针对苏联的军事集团，说这种指责是没有理由的。杜勒斯由于不能自圆其说，竟捏造关于第二次世界大战的开端的历史事实，企图歪曲一九三九年苏德关系的真相。大家知道，由于西方国家企图唆使希特勒德国进攻苏联，当时苏联面临着两个抉择：要就是为了自卫而接受当时德国提出的缔结互不侵犯条约的建议，从而赢得时间来加强自己的国防；要就是拒绝德国的建议，从而使西方国家得以立即促成苏联和德国的武装冲突，造成对苏联不利的局面，使苏联完全孤立。
    杜勒斯在口头上同意莫洛托夫的意见，即德国问题首先是德国人自己的事，因此德国的代表应该广泛地参加准备和约的各个阶段的工作。可是他又对受到东德绝大多数居民拥护的德意志民主共和国政府大肆攻击，否认这个政府在准备和约期间有权代表东德居民，同时却硬说波恩政权有权代表西德居民。
    杜勒斯硬说，美国颁布拨款一亿美元来在苏联及人民民主国家进行破坏活动的法律，是出于人道的考虑；北大西洋侵略集团是符合于联合国宪章的和平的防御集团；美国那些针对苏联的军事措施是正当的措施。
    皮杜尔接着发言。他同意莫洛托夫的意见，即对德和约只能由全德政府来签订，这个政府是由在自由选举的基础上选出来的议会产生的。但是，他又企图证明：在全德政府还没有成立以前，不应该开始和约的准备工作。他为波恩条约和巴黎条约辩解，企图否认这两个条约要把西德变成准备欧洲另一次战争的主要桥头堡，企图否认这两个条约是德国统一的障碍。他说，现在只有两条路：或者对德国实行“强迫性管制”，或者是采取所谓“联合的公式”，就是建立一支西欧军，把德国复仇主义的武装部队并入其中。他还反对苏联代表团的建议，这个建议主张责成四国外长助理在三个月内准备好对德和约草案，让参加过对德作战的国家有机会表明它们对和约问题的态度，并且规定德国代表应参加准备和约的各个阶段的工作。
    艾登接着发言。他首先承认，由于德国的分裂，欧洲就不可能有真正的稳定，所以会议的任务就是立即着手建立一个统一的德国。但是艾登又自相矛盾，说他对莫洛托夫前一天的发言“大为失望”，虽然莫洛托夫在发言中为在和平民主的基础上恢复德国的统一以及迅速准备对德和约提出了一些切实可行的具体方法。艾登仍然坚持自己的计划，这个计划的出发点是：在所谓全德自由选举没有举行以前，不应着手准备和约。他坚持以他的计划为基础来讨论德国问题。
    莫洛托夫在会议休会前发言。他说，苏联代表团对杜勒斯、皮杜尔和艾登的发言有些意见。但是因为时间已晚，苏联代表团将于明天发言，并将提出关于全德选举的建议。
    会议至此休会。
