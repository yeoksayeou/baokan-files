    The Ordinary and the Great
    Xie Juezai
    After reading the news report "An Ordinary Affair," I was reminded of an event I heard about in Lanzhou in 1938. At that time, many of the supplies that the Soviet Union provided to China to resist Japan passed through here. A translator told me:
      "One night, a batch of planes was preparing to take off early in the morning. The inspection of the planes went on until late at night. The Kuomintang employees became impatient and wanted to go back to eat. The Soviet comrades said: What if something goes wrong during the flight if it isn't checked properly? Please be patient! You haven't eaten, and neither have we."
      "The Kuomintang employees at the airfield are often late and leave early," a Soviet comrade said: "It's strange! Why aren't they more enthusiastic about defending their own country?" The Soviet team leader said:
  "Let's not argue with them; they are unenlightened people."
      "Inspecting planes" and "arriving early and leaving late" seemed ordinary to the Soviets, something everyone could do and should do, both in their own country and even more so when helping a country being invaded. But to the Kuomintang people at that time, it was too extraordinary and difficult to achieve.
    One night, Japanese planes launched a surprise attack on Lanzhou Airport. Soviet comrades flew their planes and fought fiercely with the enemy planes, shooting down and damaging more than ten enemy aircraft. Naturally, some Soviet comrades were also injured. But the Soviet comrades did not boast about their achievements to the Kuomintang government at the time. They simply thought they had done an ordinary thing. However, these were great deeds unprecedented in human history.
    The excellent qualities of humanity were suppressed in the old society. The so-called "greatness" of the old society was indeed not something ordinary people could achieve. For example, people who had made their moneybags bulge through exploitation and plunder would take out some money to do so-called charitable work. Naturally, those who had never robbed or exploited others did not have the money to do these things.
    The era of suppressing the excellent qualities of humanity—the era centered on individual egoism—is declining, and the era of the people—equality, freedom, the transition from human exploitation of human and national oppression of national to mutual assistance and friendship—is rising vigorously. In liberated China, heroic acts like those of Luo Shengjiao and Gao Zesheng are no longer isolated but quite common. For example, Gao Zesheng not only didn't report to the squad leader, but his cotton coat wasn't sent to Grandma Zhao for washing. When they were doing it, they not only didn't think about the possible danger but also didn't think about fame or reward, only that it was an ordinary thing that should be done.
    The ordinary and the great are connected. What everyone can do and should do is ordinary; what everyone can do and should do, and actually does and does extensively, is great. Stripping away the material and spiritual constraints imposed on humanity by the old society and nakedly displaying the sincere, friendly, and helpful relations between human beings—that is ordinary, and that is also great. We learn from and praise this kind of ordinariness, and we also learn from and praise this kind of greatness.

    平凡与伟大
    谢觉哉
    看了“一件平常的事”这篇通讯，我想起一九三八年在兰州听说的一件事。当时苏联援助我国抗日的物资有不少都经过这里。一位翻译告诉我：
      “某晚，有一批飞机准备清晨起飞，检修飞机到深夜，国民党的员工不耐烦了，要回去吃饭，苏联同志说：不检查好，飞行时出毛病怎办？忍耐点罢！你们没吃饭，我们也没吃饭。”
      “飞行场里的国民党员工，常常迟到早退，”一位苏联同志说：“真怪！为什么他们保卫自己的祖国还这样不热心？”苏联领队的同志说：
  “我们不要同他们计较，他们是未觉悟的人。”
      “检修飞机”、“早到迟退”，苏联人看来是平凡的，人人能做到也应做到的事，在本国如此，在帮助被侵略国家更应如此。而在那时的国民党人看来，则是太不平凡，不易做到。
    一夜，日寇飞机偷袭兰州机场，苏联同志驾机与寇机恶战，击落击伤寇机十余架，自然苏联同志也有受伤的。但苏联同志并没有向当时的国民党政府夸功，他们不过以为做了一件平凡的事，然而这些，正是人类历史上未曾有过的伟大。
    人类的优良品质在旧社会里是被扼杀的。旧社会的所谓“伟大”，确不是平凡人所能做到的。比如由剥削搜括胀破了钱袋的人，拿出些钱做所谓慈善事业，那没有抢过人剥削过人的人，自然没有钱来做这些事。
    扼杀人类优良品质的时代—以个人利己主义为中心的时代在没落了，人民的时代—平等，自由，由人剥削人、民族压迫民族转为互助友好的时代勃兴了。在解放了的中国，像罗盛教、高泽生这样的英雄行为，也已不是个别的而是相当普遍的了。如高泽生不仅没向班长汇报，他的棉衣也并没送给赵大娘拆洗。他们在做的时候，非但没想到可能发生危险，同时也没想到名誉与报酬，只是认为这是应该做的平凡的事而已。
    平凡与伟大是联系着的。人人能做又应该做，是平凡；人人能做又应该做，确实做了并扩大地做了，那就是伟大。剥去了旧社会所加于人类物质与精神上的束缚，赤裸裸地显示出人类相互间真诚、友爱、互助的关系，那便是平凡，也便是伟大。我们学习与歌颂这种平凡，也学习与歌颂这种伟大。
