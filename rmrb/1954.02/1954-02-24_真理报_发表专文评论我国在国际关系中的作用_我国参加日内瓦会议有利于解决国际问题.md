Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 22nd: The "Pravda" published an article by Astafyev, commenting on the participation of People's China in solving international problems.

The author wrote: For many centuries, China has played an extremely important role in world politics. Now, the great People's Republic of China has become an important factor in developing international political and economic relations and ensuring peace and international security. The achievements of New China have given China the status of a major power with a huge influence on the development of Asian and world affairs.

The author continued: The most important requirement in current world politics is to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The entire peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, unswervingly safeguards the legitimate rights of the great people's country – China. Representatives of Asian countries advocate fulfilling this requirement. British business people, many officials from Britain, France, and other Western European countries have also expressed the same view. An important feature of the current political situation is that the People's Republic of China has established genuinely friendly and peaceful relations with all its neighbors. This has changed international relations in Asia. The relations between People's China and other countries in Asia and Europe are constantly consolidating and developing smoothly. The People's Republic of China has now established diplomatic relations with many countries, large and small.

The author went on to say that due to the deterioration of world trade conditions and the increasing fierce competition in the world market, business circles in Asian countries, despite the embargo on China, are increasingly stubbornly striving to find ways to restore and consolidate trade relations with China. The People's Republic of China welcomes trade with these countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The development of trade and cultural ties between the People's Republic of China and Western European and Asian countries is conducive to mutual understanding and improving international relations. This clearly shows the bankruptcy of the policy of isolation, embargo and non-recognition. This fact once again proves that the People's Republic of China has not only gained great political prestige on the international stage, but also has a pivotal influence on economic and cultural relations among all countries.

Astafyev pointed out: At present, without China's participation, it is impossible to successfully solve any major international issues, and it is even more impossible to ease international tensions. The foreign ministers of France, Britain, and the United States have had to indirectly acknowledge this. After a long discussion, they had to agree to hold a conference in Geneva with the participation of the People's Republic of China.

Astafyev concluded: There is no doubt that convening this conference will help ease international tensions and help eliminate the difficulties in resolving the Korean issue and restoring peace in Indochina. Convening this conference is beneficial to peace and international security.

    “真理报”发表专文评论我国在国际关系中的作用
    我国参加日内瓦会议有利于解决国际问题
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：“真理报”刊载了阿斯塔费耶夫的一篇文章，评论人民中国参加解决国际问题。
    作者写道：过去许多世纪以来中国在世界政治中就起过极其重要的作用，现在伟大的中华人民共和国更成为发展国际政治及经济关系方面和保障和平与国际安全方面的一个重要因素了。新中国的成就，使中国获得了对亚洲和世界事务的发展具有巨大影响的大国的地位。
    作者接着说：当前世界政治中最重要的要求，就是要恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利。以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营，不屈不挠地维护伟大的人民国家——中国的合法权利。亚洲国家的代表主张满足这种要求。英国的商界人士，英国、法国及其他西欧国家的许多官方人士，也表示了同样的主张。目前政治局势的重要特点是：中华人民共和国已和所有的邻国建立了真正友好和平的关系。这就改变了亚洲的国际关系。人民中国和亚洲、欧洲其他国家的关系正在不断巩固并顺利发展中。中华人民共和国现在已和许多大大小小的国家建立了外交关系。
    作者接着说，由于世界贸易条件的恶化和世界市场上的竞争日益剧烈，亚洲国家的工商界，不顾对中国的禁运，越来越顽强地努力寻找和中国恢复并巩固贸易关系的道路。中华人民共和国欢迎与这些国家在平等、互利的基础上进行贸易。中华人民共和国与西欧及亚洲国家之间的贸易、文化联系的发展，是有助于相互谅解和改善国际关系的。这就鲜明地表明孤立、禁运和不承认的政策破产了。这个事实再一次证明：中华人民共和国不仅在国际舞台上获得了巨大的政治威望，而且在各国人民间经济及文化关系方面也有举足轻重的影响。
    阿斯塔费耶夫指出：目前，没有中国的参与，就不可能顺利地解决任何重大国际问题，当然更不可能缓和国际紧张局势了。法、英、美三国外交部长也不得不间接承认这一点。经过长期讨论后，他们不得不同意在日内瓦召开有中华人民共和国参加的会议。
    阿斯塔费耶夫最后写道：毫无疑问，召开这个会议会有助于缓和国际紧张局势，有助于消除在解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题方面的困难。召开这个会议是有利于和平及国际安全的。
