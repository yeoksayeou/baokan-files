    Worker Elder Brother Brings Me New Strength
    Han En, Director of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province
    We heard the news on the 15th that the Anshan worker rural visit delegation, led by Elder Brother Meng Tai, would set off on January 19th to visit us. The cooperative members were both happy and felt bad. They were happy that the worker elder brothers cared so much about us farmers; they felt bad that we hadn't gone to see the worker elder brothers, but instead had the elder brothers come to see us, traveling such a long distance, and in such cold weather in the depths of winter.
    
    After the members' meeting that day, I tossed and turned in bed at night, thinking about what kind of life we used to have, and what kind of life we have now, all of which came about through the leadership of the Communist Party and listening to Chairman Mao's words. At the same time, this is also inseparable from the worker elder brothers manufacturing many new-style horse-drawn farm implements and pesticides for us.
    
    In 1952, we suffered a hailstorm, and more than 100 jin of Cui Yutang's family's pigs were killed. At that time, if it hadn't been for the Party's clear instructions, if we hadn't been organized, and if we hadn't relied on the worker elder brothers to manufacture fertilizer powder for us, how could we have rescued the corn with broken stalks? Precisely because of this, the high-yield land suffered a hailstorm, and still yielded more than 10,000 jin per hectare.
    
    Listening to Elder Brother Meng Tai's report, I thought, Elder Brother Meng Tai created a large amount of wealth for the country in a year, what about us farmers? In 1952, we increased production a little, and we wanted to enjoy it first! Each member of the cooperative ate more than 60 percent rice, and I myself ate 80 percent refined grains. After receiving the education of the Party's General Line last year, most of the surplus grain was sold to the state; originally, each member of the cooperative was going to slaughter a pig for the New Year, but the result was that three households slaughtered one pig, and the whole cooperative sold 5,000 jin of meat to supply the convalescing soldiers. But compared to the production value of the worker elder brothers, what does this count for?
    
    Elder Brother Meng Tai picked out the damaged factory parts from the scrap heap, matched them, and established the Meng Tai Warehouse for the factory to use. What about us? The complete set of horse-drawn farm implements given to us by the state has not been well kept, piled under the shed, with chicken droppings scattered everywhere.
    
    Elder Brother Meng Tai always mentions, "My blast furnace! My blast furnace!" What about myself? In 1952, I always thought about going to the Party school to study, but I didn't think about what would happen to the agricultural production cooperative if I went to study?
    
    As soon as I heard this, I couldn't sleep lying on the kang at night. The working class truly deserves to be the leading class.
    
    Last night, my brother and I slept on the same kang. Elder Brother Meng Tai said, "Old Han! You need to train more Party members, Youth League members, and activists. One person can't handle everything, don't overwork yourself!"
    
    I didn't sleep well half the night. I thought about how I could do a little more work for the Party. I visited Khrushchev's collective farm in the Soviet Union. The agricultural technical personnel trained by that farm were sent to other farms to be accountants, technicians, and chairmen. Our cooperative has many students who are studying, and I want to train them well and purposefully. This year, I plan to send a young person to the county to learn accounting. With more trained agricultural technical personnel, we can also help the surrounding agricultural production cooperatives.
    
    In addition, I think our cooperative should also formulate family sideline production plans for each member in addition to the cooperative's overall production plan. Mobilize each member's family to raise more pigs and chickens. If each household can have two pigs a year and sell 500 jin of pork to the state, then the entire cooperative, with 114 households, can supply the worker elder brothers with more than 50,000 jin of meat. If each household saves 500 eggs, they can supply the convalescing soldiers with 50,000 eggs. The cooperative also plans to build fish ponds and open up new rice paddies, to increase the production of rice and wheat, to supply the worker elder brothers, so that they are healthy, strong, and have more strength to create more wealth for the country. If our workers and farmers work together, socialism can be realized sooner!
    
    May all our farmer brothers in the Northeast, all our farmer brothers in China, under the leadership of the working class, improve agricultural technology and increase yields per unit area, learn from Elder Brother Meng Tai, and increase wealth for the country! (Xinhua News Agency)

    工人老大哥给我带来了新的力量
    吉林省蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社主任  韩恩
    以孟泰老大哥为首的鞍山工人农村参观访问代表团一月十九日动身，要到我们这里来参观访问，咱们十五日就听到消息了。社员们又是高兴，又是觉得不过意。高兴的是工人老大哥这样关心咱们农民；不过意的是咱们没有去看工人老大哥，倒叫老大哥看咱们，路这么远，数九寒天又这样冷。
    当天开过社员大会，夜晚，我翻来复去睡不着，想到过去咱们是什么生活，现在又是什么生活，这全是依靠共产党的领导，听毛主席的话得来的。同时，这也是和工人老大哥给咱们制造了很多新式马拉农具、农药分不开的。
    一九五二年咱们受了雹灾，崔玉堂家一百多斤的猪都打死了。当时若不是党的明确指示，若不是组织起来，若不是依靠工人老大哥给我们制造肥田粉，怎么能把打断秸的苞米抢救过来？正因为这样，丰产地受了雹灾，一垧地还打了一万斤以上。
    咱们听到孟泰老大哥的报告，想一想，孟泰老大哥一年给国家创造了大批的财富，咱们农民呢？一九五二年提高了一点产量，自己就想先享受点！每户社员都吃百分之六十以上的大米，我自己吃百分之八十的细粮。去年受了党的总路线的教育后，把余粮大部分卖给国家了；本来每户社员过年要杀一口猪，结果是三户杀一口猪，全社卖出了五千斤肉供给部队的休养员。但比起工人老大哥的生产价值，这又算得什么呢？
    孟泰老大哥把被破坏的工厂零件，都从破烂堆里捡出来，配好，成立了孟泰仓库，供给工厂用。咱们呢？国家赠给的全套马拉农具，还没有很好地保管，堆在棚子底下，鸡粪撒的到处都是。
    孟泰老大哥总是口口声声叨念着：我的高炉！我的高炉！我自己呢？一九五二年老想到党校里去学习，可没有想我去学习，生产合作社怎么办呢？
    咱一听，夜里躺在炕上睡不着，工人阶级真是不愧为领导阶级。
    昨天晚上，我们哥儿俩睡在一个炕上，孟泰老大哥说：“老韩呀！你还要多培养一些党员、团员和积极分子，一个人总忙不过，别太累了！”
    我半夜都没有睡好觉。我想怎么样还能给党多做一点工作呢？我到苏联参观过赫鲁晓夫集体农庄，那个农庄培养出来的农业技术人材，都派到别的农庄去当会计，当技师，当主席。咱们社有许多正在读书的学生，我要好好地有目的地培养他们。今年就准备派一个青年去县里学会计。培养的农业技术人材多了，还可以帮助周围的农业生产合作社。
    另外，我想，咱们社还要在社的总生产计划之外，订各社员的家庭副业生产计划。发动各社员家庭多养猪，多养鸡。每户要是一年能有两口猪，卖给国家五百斤猪肉，全社一百一十四户，就能供给工人老大哥五万斤以上的肉。每户攒五百个鸡蛋，就能供给部队休养员五万个蛋。社里还计划建设养鱼池，开辟新稻田，多增产大米和小麦，供给工人老大哥，让他们身体好，身体结实，使工人老大哥更有力量来为国家创造更多的财富。我们工人农民共同努力，社会主义就能早一天实现了！
    愿我们全东北的农民弟兄们，全中国的农民弟兄们在工人阶级的领导下，一齐提高农业技术，提高单位面积产量，向孟泰老大哥学习，给国家多多增加财富。　（新华社）
