The CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee convened a work conference on base-level townships from January 20th to 23rd to summarize the experience of promptly transitioning to leading agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation after completing the grain procurement task.

After the propaganda of the General Line and the grain procurement work, profound changes have taken place in the rural areas of Zhejiang Province. The socialist awareness of the broad masses of peasants has been significantly enhanced, and they have enthusiastically sold surplus grain to the state. The majority of peasants have shown high enthusiasm for production and mutual aid and cooperation. This is the main gain and the basic aspect. However, some new problems still exist: (1) In some areas, due to insufficient and comprehensive propaganda of the General Line and grain procurement policies, some people have unclear policy and ideological boundaries. For example, the distinction between hoarding grain for speculation and industrious production with surplus grain; between capitalist exploitation and legitimate activities of peasants to develop production and improve their lives; between usurious exploitation and general borrowing and lending; and between speculative merchants and general private merchants are still not clearly defined. As a result, a few peasants, especially some middle peasants, have developed the ideological concerns of "fear of revealing wealth" and the misconception of "poverty is glorious," thus affecting their production enthusiasm. In addition, some households in difficulty lack food and funds for reproduction. Some cadres have underestimated these situations and do not recognize the importance and urgency of leading production, resulting in complacency, paralysis, and relaxation after the end of grain procurement. (2) The struggle between the two roads in the countryside will remain complex and sharp in the future. It will require an arduous, complex, and long-term process of persuasion and education to make all peasants accept socialist ideas. Some cadres do not recognize this sufficiently and are satisfied with short-term propaganda and education work. (3) The supply of industrial products, especially handicrafts, cannot meet the needs of the masses for developing production. At present, the political leadership of county and district party committees over these economic departments is also relatively weak. (4) The leadership level of county and district party committees, especially grassroots party organizations, cannot keep up with the requirements of the development of the objective situation.

Based on the above situation, the conference put forward the guidelines and tasks for the next step of work after the completion of the grain procurement task, and proposed several links that the leadership must grasp: (1) Continue to deeply carry out the propaganda and education of the General Line, consolidate the awareness and enthusiasm of the peasants in learning the General Line and selling grain by summarizing the work, affirming achievements, and commending good people and deeds, and guide this enthusiasm to the development of agricultural production and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. For the ideological concerns and misconceptions of some peasants, the "make-up" education of the General Line can be carried out through summarizing the work, dealing with outstanding issues, and appropriately self-criticizing the shortcomings of leading cadres to solve them. On this basis, according to the specific ideological situation of the peasants, put forward a general plan for developing production and mutual aid and cooperation, so that the peasants not only clearly understand the road forward, but also understand the specific steps forward. All localities should consciously integrate the propaganda and education of the General Line into various specific tasks, so that the propaganda and education of the General Line can be regularized. (2) Strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of agricultural products this year, with a 10% increase in grain production. All localities must focus on this center, study and formulate annual production increase plans and plans for developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations for each township, determine annual work indicators, identify the key to increasing production, effectively solve specific problems in production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and combine this with doing a good job in general elections and party rectification and building. (3) It is necessary to conscientiously implement the current series of policies of the Party in the countryside regarding relying on the poor peasants and the solid alliance of the middle peasants, developing mutual aid and cooperation, and restricting the exploitation of rich peasants, and conscientiously implement the various policies of the Party in the countryside. Only in this way can we effectively prevent the development of spontaneous capitalist tendencies in the countryside, prevent the occurrence of phenomena such as infringing on the interests of middle peasants and excluding poor peasants, and ensure the smooth development of the movement to increase production and practice economy and mutual aid and cooperation.

The conference also studied the steps to carry out the above work, and at the same time required all localities to attach importance to relying on the Party organization when carrying out the above work, first improving the awareness of Party members, overcoming confused thinking within the Party, in order to improve the leadership level of grassroots Party organizations.

    中共浙江省委召开基点乡工作会议
    总结结束购粮转入生产的经验
    中共浙江省委会于一月二十日到二十三日召开基点乡工作会议，总结完成购粮任务后及时转入领导农业生产和互助合作等工作的经验。
    经过总路线的宣传和购粮工作以后，浙江省农村情况起了深刻的变化，广大农民社会主义觉悟显著提高，踊跃把余粮卖给国家，大多数农民的生产积极性和互助合作积极性高涨，这是主要的收获和基本的方面。但是目前还存在着一些新的问题：（一）有些地区由于对总路线和购粮政策宣传得不够全面，部分群众对一些政策和思想界限划分不清。如对囤粮投机和勤劳生产有余粮；对资本主义剥削行为和农民发展生产改善生活的正当行为；对高利贷剥削和一般借贷以及对投机奸商和一般私商等还划不清界限。结果少数农民，特别是部分中农，产生了“怕露富”的思想顾虑和“穷光荣”的错觉，因而影响了生产情绪。另外还有一部分困难户缺乏口粮和再生产的资金。对于这些情况，有些干部还估计不足，他们对领导生产的重要性和紧迫性认识不够，因而在购粮结束后产生了自满麻痹和松弛情绪。（二）农村中两条道路的斗争，在今后仍然是复杂的和尖锐的。要使全体农民都接受社会主义思想，还需要一个艰苦的、复杂的、长期的说服教育过程。有的干部对这一点还认识不足，而是满足于短时期的宣传教育工作。（三）工业品，特别是手工业品的供应不能满足群众发展生产的需要。目前县、区党委对这些经济部门的政治领导也比较薄弱。（四）县、区党委特别是基层党组织的领导水平还跟不上客观形势发展的要求。
    根据上述情况，会议提出了购粮任务完成后下一步工作的方针和任务，并提出了领导方面必须掌握的几个环节：（一）继续深入进行总路线宣传教育，把农民在学习总路线及售粮过程中的觉悟和热情，通过总结工作，肯定成绩，表扬好人好事，巩固下来，并把这种积极性引导到发展农业生产和开展互助合作运动中去。对于部分农民的思想顾虑和错觉，可通过总结工作，进行总路线“补课”教育，处理遗留问题，对领导干部的缺点应进行适当的自我批评来加以解决。在此基础上，根据农民具体的思想情况，提出发展生产和互助合作的大体计划，使农民不仅明确认识前进的道路，并且懂得前进的具体步骤。各地并应有意识地将总路线宣传教育贯彻到各种具体工作中去，使总路线宣传教育经常化。（二）争取今年农业生产品全面丰收，粮食增产一成。各地必须围绕这个中心，研究与制订各乡全年增产计划和发展互助合作组织的计划，确定全年工作指标，找出增产的关键，切实解决生产和互助合作运动中的具体问题，并结合做好普选和整党建党工作。（三）必须认真贯彻目前党在农村中关于依靠贫农和中农的巩固联盟，发展互助合作，限制富农剥削等这一系列的政策，认真贯彻党在农村中的各项政策。这样才能有效地防止农村中资本主义自发趋势的发展，防止侵犯中农利益、排斥贫困农民等现象的发生，才能使增产节约和互助合作运动顺利开展。
    会议上并研究了进行以上工作的步骤，同时要求各地进行上述工作时，必须重视依靠党的组织，首先提高党员的觉悟，克服党内的混乱思想，以提高基层党组织的领导水平。
