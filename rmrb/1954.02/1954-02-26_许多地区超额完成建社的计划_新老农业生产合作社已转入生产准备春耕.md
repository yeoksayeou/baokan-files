Xinhua News Agency, February 25th—Across the country, agricultural production cooperatives planned to be established before spring plowing have mostly been completed, exceeding planned targets. In the North China region, Hebei and Shanxi provinces had newly established over 14,600 agricultural production cooperatives by mid-February. Combined with the old cooperatives, this exceeds 20,000. In the Northeast region, Heilongjiang and Rehe provinces alone originally had 1,290 agricultural production cooperatives. Before spring plowing, the number of new cooperatives in these two provinces will grow to two and a half times the number of old ones. In the East China region, Shandong Province already has over 9,000 new and old cooperatives combined, approaching three times the number of agricultural production cooperatives originally in the entire East China region. Agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangsu Province will increase from over 260 this year to over 3,200. In the Central South region, according to incomplete statistics from Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong provinces, over 2,200 new cooperatives have been established. It is estimated that by the end of March, the entire region will have 5,470 new cooperatives established. In the Southwest region, Guizhou Province had established 206 agricultural production cooperatives by February 10th, and it is expected to increase to over 400 before spring plowing. In Sichuan Province, in addition to the original 46 agricultural production cooperatives, the five special districts of Suining, Mianyang, Leshan, Nanchong, and Luzhou alone have newly established 191 agricultural production cooperatives. In the Northwest region, Shaanxi Province will complete the establishment of 247 agricultural production cooperatives before spring plowing and rectify over 100 agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously established by farmers last year. The preliminary plan for the entire region is to establish over 530 cooperatives this spring.

Currently, new and old agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have shifted to production and are driving surrounding farmers to prepare for spring plowing. In Hebei Province, the newly organized 7,600 agricultural production cooperatives and the original 3,600 agricultural production cooperatives have already投入入 production. After winter, 300 new and old agricultural production cooperatives in Daming County have been hauling soil and accumulating manure, driving over 300 villages to launch a manure accumulation campaign. After 600 agricultural production cooperatives in the waterlogged areas of Cangxian Special District last year launched various sideline occupations such as saltpeter boiling and textile weaving, they drove over 800,000 farmers in the entire district to carry out diverse sideline production, increasing funds for this year's agricultural production. The 749 agricultural production cooperatives newly established in Henan Province before the Spring Festival have already begun production. The 289 agricultural production cooperatives newly established in Hunan Province recently have mostly formulated plans to increase grain and cotton production and are carrying out spring plowing production preparations. Due to the implementation of collective labor and collective management, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions will be able to further solve difficult problems that could not be solved in the past during the mutual aid team and individual household periods, demonstrating its superiority in production.

    许多地区超额完成建社的计划
    新老农业生产合作社已转入生产准备春耕
    【新华社二十五日讯】全国各地计划在春耕前建立的农业生产合作社，多已超计划陆续建成。华北区的河北省和山西省，到二月中旬为止，共已新建农业生产合作社一万四千六百多个，和老社合计，已超过两万个。东北区，仅黑龙江、热河两省原来就有农业生产合作社一千二百九十个，这两省在春耕前，新社将发展到老社的两倍半。华东区的山东省，新建社和老社共计已有九千多个，已接近于华东全区原有农业生产合作社的三倍。江苏省的农业生产合作社，今年将由二百六十多个发展到三千二百个以上。中南区，据河南、湖北、湖南、广东等四省的不完全统计，共已建新社二千二百多个，预计到三月底以前，全区将有五千四百七十个新社建立起来。西南区，贵州省到二月十日为止，已建成二百零六个农业生产合作社，预计春耕前将增加到四百个以上；四川省除原有四十六个农业生产合作社外，目前仅遂宁、绵阳、乐山、南充、泸州等五个专区，就已新建一百九十一个农业生产合作社。西北区的陕西省将在春耕前完成二百四十七个农业生产合作社的建社工作，并整顿一百多个去年由各地农民自发建立的农业生产合作社。全区初步计划在今春建立五百三十多个社。
    目前，各地新老农业生产合作社都已转入生产，并带动着周围农民准备春耕。河北省新组织的七千六百多个农业生产合作社和原有的三千六百多个农业生产合作社，已经投入生产。该省大名县三百个新老农业生产合作社入冬后便拉土积肥，带动三百多个村庄开展起积肥运动；沧县专区去年受涝地区六百多个农业生产合作社开展起熬硝、纺织等各种副业后，带动全区八十多万农民开展起多种多样的副业生产，增加了今年的农业生产资金。河南省在春节前新建的七百四十九个农业生产合作社，已开始进行生产。湖南省最近新建的二百八十九个农业生产合作社，多已订出增产粮食和棉花的计划，并正进行春耕生产准备。各地农业生产合作社由于实行集体劳动和集体经营，对过去在互助组和单干户时期所解决不了的困难问题，将能得到进一步的解决，在生产中表现出它的优越性。
