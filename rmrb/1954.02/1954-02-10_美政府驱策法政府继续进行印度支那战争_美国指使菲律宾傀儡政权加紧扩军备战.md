Xinhua News Agency, February 9th: TASS, Paris, February 7th: French newspapers are reporting with anxiety the continued deterioration of the military situation of the French expeditionary force engaged in the war against the Vietnamese people. However, it has become clear that certain individuals remain unwilling to seek a cessation of the war through negotiations. Washington, which is deliberately prolonging this war, is bringing brutal pressure to bear on the French government in this matter. Parisian newspapers have cited new facts confirming this American stance. "Libération" stated that the US government has decided to send a large number of aviation technicians to Vietnam to service American aircraft participating in the war. "Le Figaro's" Washington correspondent, Chatelaine, reported that the US Senate Armed Services Committee held a secret meeting at which the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, "raised the alarm regarding the situation in Indochina."

Chatelaine conceded that the French army and the Bảo Đại army have been defeated, and he wrote, "Certain individuals in Washington believe that the French military command is responsible for this defeat." Chatelaine pointed out that the US military command, disregarding the French authorities, is attempting to act arbitrarily in Vietnam. The American aviation experts sent to Vietnam will "not only be responsible for the care of American aircraft but will also train air force personnel in the use of modern technical equipment."

Xinhua News Agency, February 9th: Manila dispatch: The United States is preparing to expand its military bases in the Philippines and is directing the Philippine puppet government to step up arms expansion and war preparations.

According to International News Service, the aggressive US military deployment in the Philippines is part of the so-called "new look" policy of the United States in the Pacific, involving the expansion of cannon fodder forces and military bases. US Secretary of the Army Stevens and Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Command Hull traveled to the Philippines at the end of January to make specific arrangements to implement this plot. According to the Associated Press, Stevens and Hull instructed the new Philippine President Magsaysay and Vice President and Foreign Minister Garcia at a meeting on February 1 on "the development and consolidation of US bases in the Philippines" and "US military assistance" aimed at expanding the Philippine cannon fodder forces.

After Stevens and Hull left the Philippines, the Philippine Foreign Ministry revealed on the 5th that a delegation led by Garcia would negotiate a new military base agreement with a special delegation led by US Ambassador to the Philippines Spruance. At the same time, US Air Force officer O'Hara began on the 5th to lead a group of US officials on a widespread inspection of US military bases in the Philippines and the equipment of the Philippine puppet air force. According to Philippine Air Force authorities, the US delegation led by O'Hara will discuss with the Philippine Air Force authorities plans to strengthen the Philippine Air Force's cannon fodder forces, including the supply of jet aircraft.

Prior to this, Magsaysay convened a high-level military conference in Baguio on January 29, making decisions to expand troop training and increase military budgets to adapt to the aggressive US policy. According to reports, the Philippine government plans to increase the number of people receiving military training in 1954 from 3,000 to 5,000, and then to 10,000 in 1955.

The conference also decided to increase military appropriations from 155.5 million pesos (two pesos equal one US dollar) to 172.2 million pesos. The Philippine government also intends to increase the budget of the Ministry of National Defense to 25 million pesos, so that the total military budget will increase to nearly 200 million pesos. Magsaysay admitted on January 25 that the Philippine fiscal deficit had already exceeded 240 million pesos and that the country was more than 1 billion pesos in debt.

    美政府驱策法政府继续进行印度支那战争
    美国指使菲律宾傀儡政权加紧扩军备战
   【新华社九日讯】塔斯社巴黎七日讯：法国报纸惊恐不安地报道了在进行反对越南人民的战争的法国远征军军事形势继续恶化的消息。然而，事实证明，某些人士仍然不愿设法通过谈判停止战争。蓄意拖延这个战争的华盛顿在这个问题上对法国政府施加蛮横的压力。巴黎报纸列举了新的事实，证实美国的这种立场。“解放报”说，美国政府决定派遣大批航空技术人员到越南去为参加战争的美国飞机服务。“费加罗报”驻华盛顿记者夏特伦报道，美国参议院军事委员会曾举行秘密会议，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福曾在会上“就印度支那的局势发出了警报”。
    夏特伦承认法国军队和保大军队已经失败，他写道，“华盛顿某些人士认为这种失败应由法军司令部负责”。夏特伦指出，美军司令部无视法国当局，企图在越南独断专行。派往越南的美国航空专家将“不仅注意照护美国飞机，而且将训练空军人员使用现代技术装备”。
    【新华社九日讯】马尼拉消息：美国准备在菲律宾扩充军事基地，并指使菲律宾傀儡政府加紧扩军备战。
    据国际新闻社透露：美国在菲律宾的侵略性军事部署，是扩建炮灰部队和军事基地的所谓美国在太平洋的“新面貌”政策的一部分。美国陆军部部长斯蒂文斯和远东美军总司令赫尔为了实现这一阴谋，在一月底前往菲律宾作了具体的布置。据美联社透露：斯蒂文斯和赫尔二月一日在一个会议上向菲律宾新任总统麦格赛赛和副总统兼外交部长加西亚就“发展和巩固美国在菲律宾的基地问题”以及目的在扩充菲律宾炮灰部队的“美国军事援助问题”，作了指示。
    在斯蒂文斯和赫尔离开菲律宾以后，菲律宾外交部五日透露：以加西亚为首的代表团将和以美国驻菲大使斯普鲁恩斯为首的特别代表团谈判签订新的军事基地协定。同时，美国空军官员奥哈拉于五日开始率领一批美国官员广泛视察美国在菲律宾的军事基地和菲律宾傀儡空军的设备。据菲律宾空军当局透露，以奥哈拉为首的美国代表团将和菲律宾空军当局商订加强菲律宾空军炮灰部队的计划，包括供应喷气式飞机问题在内。
    在此之前，麦格赛赛一月二十九日在碧瑶召开了高级军事会议，为适应美国的侵略性政策作出了扩大训练军队和增加军事预算的决定。据消息说，菲律宾政府预定把一九五四年受军训人数从三千人增加到五千人，一九五五年再增加到一万人。
    会议还决定把军事拨款从菲币一亿五千五百万比索（二比索合一美元）增加到一亿七千二百万比索。菲律宾政府还打算把国防部的预算增加到二千五百万比索，这样全部军事预算将增加到接近二亿比索。而麦格赛赛在一月二十五日曾承认，菲律宾财政赤字已经超过二亿四千万比索，并且负了十亿多比索的债。
