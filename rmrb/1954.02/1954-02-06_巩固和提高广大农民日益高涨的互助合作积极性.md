The enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for mutual aid and cooperation is rapidly and vigorously rising after extensive publicity and education on the General Line. The duty before our rural work cadres is to protect this enthusiasm and promote its further normal development, and we must not allow it to be frustrated or dampened in any way.

Currently, many of the better mutual aid teams are requesting to establish agricultural production cooperatives. In Heshi Township, Dazhou County alone, seventeen teams are requesting to establish cooperatives. They feel that unified management by agricultural production cooperatives can overcome many difficulties that cannot be overcome within mutual aid teams and can produce more grain. Mutual aid teams that had collapsed are also actively restoring or preparing to restore, and teams that were on the verge of collapse are generally requesting to be consolidated. The number of individual farmers requesting to join mutual aid teams is also increasing daily.

However, our work in rural areas is not keeping up with the demands of the developing objective situation. The publicity work on the General Line is not yet thorough enough. According to our investigation in Beiwai Township, Dazhou County, among the thirty-one members of two mutual aid teams, seven "know the general outline," mostly core members within the mutual aid teams; thirteen have some understanding, mostly the "heads of households" who attend meetings more often; and the rest simply do not know. The publicity of the General Line is also not comprehensive. It talks more about the disadvantages of taking the capitalist road and less about the advantages of taking the socialist road and how to take the socialist road. As a result, the masses feel that "the old road is impassable, and the new road is unknown," and they do not know how to take the socialist road. There are still many doubts and misunderstandings among the masses about the socialist road. Some peasants believe that "the land of the agricultural production cooperative is collective, not yours or mine, everyone works together and uses it together, and grain is distributed according to population"; some believe that "socialism only cares about the public and does not care about the individual"; in particular, the boundary between capitalism is not clear, confusing sideline occupations with commerce, and confusing the exchange of goods between farmers with usury, causing ideological confusion. Because some peasants do not have a correct understanding of the General Line, the motives of some people who want to join the teams are not clear, such as joining in the fun and following the trend; some regard joining the mutual aid team as a political privilege; and others join the mutual aid team for loans and to buy fertilizer from the cooperative. At the same time, two abnormal emotions are revealed among some activists: one is a sense of impatience, and the other is a "closed-door" mentality. The former casually breaks up the original team and casually replaces the team leader; or advocates "starting as soon as it is said, taking a single step, collective land, one point of labor for one point of value." Some people in Xinhong Township, Xuanhan County, have started "collective farms." The latter refuses to absorb individual farmers to participate in the mutual aid team; some district and township cadres advocate "reviewing the motives of individual households to join the team to prevent trouble after joining in the future." Obviously, this is pouring cold water on the enthusiasm of the masses for mutual aid and cooperation, which will shut out some people who voluntarily want to join. All of the above requires us to further strengthen the publicity and education of the General Line, raise the socialist consciousness of the peasants, and clarify various confused thoughts in order to promote the healthy development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. However, at present, some cadres, especially grassroots cadres, have a sense of slackness, thinking that "the grain purchase work is over, why publicize the General Line," "mutual aid and cooperation is a long-term work, there is no need to rush," and they take a negative attitude towards mutual aid and cooperation. This is a problem that deserves serious attention.

In order to prevent the enthusiasm of the masses for mutual aid and cooperation from being frustrated, to promote the consolidation, improvement and continuous development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and thus gradually promote agricultural collectivization, there is no reason to relax the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and we must earnestly implement the policy of "active leadership, steady progress," and actively and enthusiastically run agricultural production cooperatives well to drive the great development of mutual aid teams.

According to needs and possibilities, focusing on establishing and expanding agricultural production cooperatives is a basic link in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the future. From the perspective of the farmers' own interests and the interests of national industrialization, we need to actively and enthusiastically develop agricultural production cooperatives. From the perspective of the mass base and the conditions of the cadres, we are also fully capable of developing agricultural production cooperatives in a planned and step-by-step manner. If we run the agricultural production cooperatives well, it will inevitably greatly promote the development of mutual aid teams. Many facts have proved this. For example, after Chengdong Township in Dazhu, Jiangbei Township in Bazhong, and Heshi Township in Dazhou established agricultural production cooperatives last year, the masses saw that the cooperatives were powerful, had high yields, and had high incomes, and they actively consolidated and improved the mutual aid teams, wanting to "move towards the cooperative." Therefore, running agricultural production cooperatives well is an important link in our leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement to continue to move forward.

The key to the success or failure of the establishment of a cooperative lies in the quality of the publicity and mobilization work. Since the cooperative is based on land shares and collective management, which is a huge change in the mode of production, farmers are concerned about their personal interests, worry about gains and losses, and there are various concerns, and the struggle between old and new ideas is quite fierce. The stage of publicity and deliberation on the establishment of a cooperative is a complex process of ideological education and is the lifeline of all the work of establishing a cooperative. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct education on the General Line in a specific and repeated manner through various methods (such as seminars and individual talks), publicize the nature of the cooperative and its superiority, explain in detail the specific policies related to the cooperative, raise the ideological awareness of the masses, and clear ideological obstacles. At the same time, we should pay attention to educating and training core members from the beginning and gradually establish the concept of collective labor, caring for public property, and determination to run the cooperative well among the peasants.

While striving to run the cooperative well, we must also pay great attention to improving and developing mutual aid teams. This is very important. After the mutual aid teams in Dazhou Prefecture underwent a general rectification last spring, some new situations and characteristics have emerged. According to a survey of five villages in Beiwai Township, Dazhou County: the organizational form has changed from large to small, and then gradually from small to large; the scope of mutual aid has changed from large to small, and then gradually from small to large; and various systems have gradually changed from "formal" to practical and in line with production needs. In overcoming difficulties, overcoming disasters, and promoting advanced experience, mutual aid teams have shown their superiority, so they have increased production more than individual farmers, and the increase in production in 1953 was even greater than in 1952. However, due to the relaxation of leadership over mutual aid teams last year, there are still many shortcomings and problems in mutual aid teams. First of all, the leadership has long neglected socialist ideological education within the mutual aid teams, so some teams have revealed seedlings of spontaneous capitalist forces, such as hiring workers to do business. Secondly, there are many unfair and unreasonable phenomena in work arrangement and scoring. The small number and weakness of core members is also a major problem. Therefore, repeated and in-depth education on the General Line has become the basic content and driving force for improving and developing mutual aid teams. When conducting education on the General Line, it is necessary to combine it with the production and ideological situation of each mutual aid team, and raise every idea and every activity within the team to the spirit of the General Line to understand and analyze, to see what is in line with the General Line and what is not. The superiority and achievements of organization should be specifically summarized and affirmed, the exemplary role and patriotic behavior of team members should be actively encouraged, necessary support should be given to legitimate requirements and actions, shortcomings should be checked and corrected, and ideas and behaviors that violate the spirit of the General Line should be educated and criticized. At the same time, it is also necessary to revise systems, improve organizations, and implement the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit according to the characteristics of winter production and the different situations of each team.

At present, some mutual aid teams, especially some perennial mutual aid teams, have begun to grow "production to the top" and "mutual aid to the top" emotions due to years of increased production, relatively complete systems, and a certain amount of surplus funds and labor. This emotion is harmful and must be appropriately criticized and educated. At the same time, we must point out the direction of effort to them and educate them to increase production from aspects such as land processing, water conservancy construction, technology improvement, and agricultural tool improvement. At the same time, we can develop family sideline occupations and personal sideline occupations. In order to adapt to the development of mutual aid teams, and in order to prepare conditions for the establishment of cooperatives after autumn, we can consciously select mutual aid teams with good conditions, and on the basis of the team members' complete voluntariness and collective labor production, appropriately accumulate public property, so that socialist factors continue to grow. The form of "joint team mutual aid" is also worth promoting. There are two ways to do this: one is for the needs of certain temporary, single, or rush production activities (such as repairing water conservancy and harvesting grain); the other is that a better perennial team and one or two surrounding teams implement relatively fixed joint team mutual aid. In this way, it can solve some difficulties and problems that a single team cannot solve, and can also exchange experience and prepare conditions for the establishment of cooperatives in the future.

Some cadres feel annoyed when they mention mutual aid teams. They think that "mutual aid teams are old problems" and feel that it is "not new" and "not enjoyable" to engage in them; more cadres feel that the problems of mutual aid teams are complex and difficult to handle. To investigate the root cause of this emotion, it is because the nature of mutual aid and cooperation is not clearly understood, and the complexity and long-term nature of the struggle between individuals and collectives within the mutual aid team is not understood. Therefore, they neglect to regularly conduct political and ideological education within the team, enlighten team members to consciously subordinate their personal interests to the collective interests, but treat the symptoms rather than the root cause. Many facts show that long-term and arduous political and ideological education is the basic link in the work. Without it, the mutual aid policy is difficult to implement, the problem cannot be solved, and it will become more and more. Naturally, it is also necessary to study many practical and necessary methods.

Consolidating, improving, and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations must also be closely integrated with current production. It is very obvious that if the organization of labor production wants to be consolidated, improved, and developed without being separated from specific production activities, it will inevitably become formalism and will not achieve practical results. In the past, because winter production was not well carried out, mutual aid teams rarely carried out mutual aid in winter, so the masses circulated the saying that "mutual aid teams cannot survive the winter." We must lead the mutual aid teams to enrich the content of mutual aid, let the mutual aid teams "survive the winter," and consolidate and improve them from this. In fact, the content of mutual aid in winter is also rich.

Strengthening the education and training of mutual aid and cooperation backbones is an important task in promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Experience has proved that without a group of backbone members who are highly enthusiastic and can implement policies, the mutual aid and cooperation movement is difficult to carry out. So, what is the situation of the existing backbone members? We learned from five villages in Beiwai Township, Dazhou County, that among the sixteen mutual aid team leaders, three are active, capable, and fair, three are active and fair but not capable, four are active and capable but not fair, four are not active and not capable, and two are not active and not fair. In addition to the team leader, four teams have no backbone members, and seven teams have one backbone member each. This situation of small quantity and weak quality of backbone members is not commensurate with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, we must pay attention to the work of training backbone members. Winter is a good time to train backbone members, and it should be fully utilized so that all backbone members can receive a relatively systematic and profound education before spring plowing. In the future, meetings related to publicizing the General Line and deploying production should absorb a certain number of mutual aid team leaders as much as possible, and conduct in-depth education for them to improve their ideological awareness, policy level, and work ability. Townships and villages should hold regular mutual aid team leader representative meetings and joint meetings more frequently to check and deploy production and summarize and exchange experience in leading mutual aid teams. In areas with a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation, when carrying out certain rural work, such as issuing agricultural loans and organizing credit cooperatives, we can absorb individual farmers to participate on the basis of mutual aid teams to strengthen the connection between inside and outside the team and improve the prestige of the mutual aid team. At the same time, county and district leaders should frequently contact mutual aid teams through holding symposiums with mutual aid team leaders and writing letters to understand ideological and production conditions and provide learning and publicity materials; for better mutual aid teams, they should also designate special personnel to be responsible for training. In addition, it is also necessary to re-elect individual team leaders who are really incompetent through team member discussions, but it is necessary to prevent large-scale replacement, and the re-election work should be carried out on the condition that new backbone members have been trained.

Finally, in the leadership work, we must accurately implement the policy of "active leadership, steady progress," and we must not fall behind the masses, nor can we run too far ahead. Impatience and recklessness, and laissez-faire, are all deviations, and they must be opposed. For the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, we must be active and enthusiastic, but we must also act according to needs and possibilities; we must "actively lead" and "steadily advance." The work of establishing cooperatives must be carried out with leadership and in a planned manner, and it is only allowed to be done well, not badly. In consolidating, improving, and developing mutual aid teams, we must prevent and correct the phenomenon of closing the door to individual farmers and the impatience of a few activists, and we must prevent harmful practices such as blindly expanding organizations, disguised coercion and command, and formalistic system making that may occur. In the work, we must pay attention to combining leading the establishment of cooperatives with consolidating, improving, and developing mutual aid teams, and we cannot close the door to isolate the establishment of cooperatives. In the work, we must also combine leading mutual aid teams with current production, promote winter production through mutual aid and cooperation, and promote mutual aid and cooperation through winter production.

Rural work is arduous, but it is also glorious. Every rural work cadre, every rural Communist Party member, must be loyal to the socialist cause, lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement with full enthusiasm, guide the rising enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation among the masses to develop forward on a solid foundation, and train themselves from their work to become outstanding workers for implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture!

### 巩固和提高广大农民日益高涨的互助合作积极性

    巩固和提高广大农民日益高涨的互助合作积极性
    中共四川省达县地委书记　丁耿林
    经过广泛的总路线宣传教育之后，广大农民群众的互助合作积极性正在迅速地蓬勃地高涨起来。摆在我们农村工作干部面前的职责，就在于保护这种积极性，使之进一步地正常发展，决不能让它受到任何挫折而消沉下去。
    现在，很多较好的互助组都要求办农业生产合作社，单是达县河市乡就有十七个组要求办社，他们觉得农业生产合作社统一经营，可以克服互助组内不能克服的许多困难，可以打更多的粮食。已垮台的互助组，也纷纷恢复起来或积极准备恢复，原先快要垮的组，也普遍要求巩固下来。单干农民要求参加互助组的也日渐增多。
    但是，我们在农村中的工作还赶不上客观形势发展的要求。总路线宣传工作还不深入。根据我们在达县北外乡的调查，两个互助组的三十一个组员中，“晓得个大框框”的有七人，多半是互助组内的骨干分子；认识一点的有十三人，多半是每家中开会较多的“当家人”；其余的就根本不知道。总路线的宣传也不全面，对走资本主义道路的坏处讲得多，对走社会主义道路的好处和如何走社会主义道路讲得少，因此群众感到“老路走不得，新路不会走”，不知究竟如何走社会主义道路。群众对社会主义道路的怀疑和误解也还不少，有些农民认为“农业生产合作社的土地是集体的，不分你的我的，大家做来大家用，照人口发粮”；有些人认为“社会主义是只顾公家，不管私人”；特别是划不清资本主义界限，把副业和商业混淆起来，把农民之间互通有无与高利贷混淆起来，引起思想混乱。由于部分农民对总路线还没有正确认识，以致有一部分人要求入组的动机是不明确的，如有凑热闹，赶浪头的；有把参加互助组当成政治待遇的；还有为了贷款、为了向合作社买肥料而参加互助组的。同时，在部分积极分子中又流露出两种不正常的情绪：一种是急躁情绪，一种是“关门”情绪。前者随便打散原组，随便撤换组长；或者主张“说搞就搞，一步跨拢，土地集体，一分劳力一分代价”。宣汉县新洪乡有些人就搞起“集体农庄”来了。后者，拒绝吸收单干农民参加互助组；有些区乡干部主张“审查单干户的入组动机，以防将来参加后讨麻烦”。显然这是对群众互助合作热情泼冷水，这样会把某些自愿入组的人拒于大门之外。上述种种，都要求我们必须进一步加强总路线的宣传教育，提高农民的社会主义觉悟，澄清各种混乱思想，以推动互助合作运动健康地发展。但是，目前部分干部特别是基层干部，却产生了松劲情绪，认为“购粮工作结束了，还宣传总路线干啥”，“互助合作是长期的工作，用不着忙”，对互助合作抱消极态度。这是一个值得严重注意的问题。
    为了使群众高涨起来的互助合作积极性不受到挫折，推动互助合作组织的巩固提高和不断发展，从而逐步促进农业合作化，就没有任何理由放松对互助合作运动的领导，必须切实执行“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，积极热心地办好农业生产合作社，带动互助组大发展。
    根据需要与可能，重点建立与扩大农业生产合作社，是今后领导互助合作运动的基本一环。从农民自身的利益着想，从国家工业化的利益着想，我们需要积极热心地发展农业生产合作社。从群众基础来看，从干部条件来看，我们也完全可能有计划有步骤地发展农业生产合作社。如果把农业生产合作社办好了，就必然会大大推动互助组的发展，许多事实都证明了这一点。如大竹城东乡、巴中江北乡、达县河市乡等地，去年办了农业生产合作社后，群众看到合作社的力量大、产量高、收入多，都积极巩固提高互助组，要“朝着合作社奔”。因此办好农业生产合作社是我们领导互助合作运动继续前进的重要环节。
    建社工作成败的关键，在于宣传动员工作作得好坏。由于合作社是土地入股、集体经营，这是生产方式上的一个巨大变化，农民计较个人利益，患得患失，有各种各样的顾虑，新旧思想的斗争相当激烈。宣传酝酿建社阶段是个复杂的思想教育过程，是全部建社工作中的命脉。因此必须通过各种方式（座谈、个别谈话等），具体地反复地进行总路线教育，宣传合作社的性质和它的优越性，详细地交代有关合作社的各项具体政策，提高群众思想觉悟，扫清思想上的障碍。同时一开始就应注意教育培养骨干分子，逐步在农民中树立集体劳动、爱护公共财产、决心办好合作社的观念。
    与努力办好合作社的同时，还必须十分注意提高和发展互助组。这一点很重要。达县专区的互助组经过去年春天普遍整顿后，已出现了若干新的情况和特点。据达县北外乡五村调查：组织形式是由大到小，又逐步由小到大；互助范围是由大到小，又逐步由小到大，各种制度由“形式”逐步到切合实际情况与合乎生产的需要。在克服困难、战胜灾害、推广先进经验等方面，互助组都显示出了它的优越性，因而较单干农民增产多，一九五三年比一九五二年增产更多。但是，由于去年曾一度放松对互助组的领导，所以互助组还存在不少缺点与问题。首先是领导上长期忽视了互助组内的社会主义思想教育，因而部分组内露出资本主义自发势力的苗头，有人雇工营商等等。其次在排工、评分等方面也有很多不公平不合理的现象。骨干分子少而弱也是个较大的问题。因此，反复、深入地进行总路线教育，就成为提高和发展互助组的基本内容和动力。在进行总路线教育时，要与各互助组的生产情况和思想情况结合起来，把组内每一种思想、每一个活动都提高到总路线的精神上来认识，来分析，看看什么是符合总路线的，什么是不符合的。对组织起来的优越性和成绩要具体地加以总结肯定，对组员的模范作用与爱国行为要积极鼓励，对正当的要求与行动要予以必要的支持，对缺点要检查纠正，对违背总路线精神的思想和行为要教育批判。同时还要根据冬季生产的特点，根据各组的不同情况，修订制度，健全组织，贯彻自愿和互利的原则。
    目前，有些互助组，特别是有些常年互助组，因连年增产较多，制度比较完备，有了一部分剩余资金和劳动力，于是开始滋长着“增产到顶”、
  “互助到顶”的情绪。这种情绪是有害的，必须适当批判和教育，同时，要向他们指出努力的方向，教育他们从土地加工、兴修水利、提高技术、改良农具等方面来增加产量。同时可发展家庭副业和个人副业。为了适应互助组的发展，为了给秋后建社准备条件，可有意识地选择条件好的互助组，在组员完全自愿原则下，在集体劳动生产的基础上，适当积累公共财产，使社会主义因素不断增长。“联组互助”的形式也值得推行，这有两种办法：一种是为了适应某些临时的、单一的或突击的生产活动（如修水利、打谷等）的需要而联组；另一种是一个较好的常年组与周围一两个组实行比较固定的联组互助。这样，既可以解决一个组所不能解决的一些困难和问题，又可以交流经验，给将来建社准备条件。
    有些干部，一提起互助组就感到厌烦。他们认为“互助组是老问题”，觉得搞起来“不新鲜”，“不过瘾”；更多的干部是感到互助组的问题复杂不好搞。追究产生这种情绪的根源，是对互助合作的性质认识不明确，不了解互助组内个体与集体之间斗争的复杂性和长期性。因而忽略了在组内经常进行政治思想教育，启发组员自觉地将个人利益服从集体利益，而是头痛医头、脚痛医脚。许多事实表明，长期艰苦地进行政治思想教育，是工作中的基本链条，离开了它，互助政策就难以贯彻，问题就不能解决，而且会越来越多。自然，研究出许多切合实际需要的办法也是必要的。
    巩固提高和发展互助合作组织，还必须与当前生产紧密结合。非常明显，劳动生产的组织要想脱离具体生产活动来巩固提高和发展，势必成为形式主义，得不到实际效果。过去因为没有很好展开冬季生产，互助组冬季就很少进行互助，所以群众中流传着“互助组过不得冬”的说法。我们要领导互助组充实互助内容，让互助组“过冬”，并从中巩固提高。事实上冬季的互助内容同样是丰富的。
    加强教育培养互助合作骨干，是推进互助合作运动中的一件重要事情。经验证明：没有一批富有高度热情而又能执行政策的骨干分子，互助合作运动是难以展开的。那么，现有骨干情况怎样呢？我们在达县北外乡五村了解，十六个互助组长中，有三个是积极、能干、公道的，有三个是积极、公道但不能干的，有四个是积极能干但不公道的，有四个是不积极又不能干的，有两个是不积极又不公道的。除了组长之外，有四个组内再没有一个骨干分子，七个组各有一个骨干分子。这种骨干分子量少质弱的状况，是与互助合作运动的发展不相称的。因此，必须注意培养锻炼骨干分子的工作。冬天是训练骨干的好时机，应充分的利用，使所有骨干分子在春耕前能受到一次比较系统、深刻的教育。今后有关宣传总路线、布置生产等工作的会议，应尽可能吸收一定数量的互助组长参加，向他们深入地进行教育，提高思想觉悟、政策水平与工作能力。乡村应比较经常地召开定期的互助组长代表会、联席会，检查布置生产，总结交流领导互助组的经验。在互助合作基础较好的地区，在进行某些农村工作时，如发放农贷、组织信贷小组等，可以互助组为基础吸收单干农民参加，以密切组内外联系和提高互助组的威信。同时，县区领导上应通过召开互助组长座谈会和写信等方式，与互助组经常取得联系，了解思想情况和生产情况，供给学习和宣传资料；对较好的互助组还应指定专人负责培养。另外，对个别实在不称职的组长，通过组员讨论，进行改选也是必要的，但要防止大换班，改选工作并应在培养出新骨干的情况下进行。
    最后，在领导工作中必须确切贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，不可落在群众后面，也不可跑得太前。急躁冒进、放任自流，都是偏向，都要反对。对建立农业生产合作社，既要积极热心，又要根据需要与可能办事；既要“积极领导”，又要“稳步前进”。建社工作必须有领导有步骤地进行，只许办好，不许办坏。在巩固提高和发展互助组中，要防止与纠正少数积极分子对单干农民的关门现象与急躁情绪，要预防可能发生的盲目扩大组织、变相强迫命令及形式主义的订制度等有害作法。在工作中，必须注意把领导建社与巩固提高和发展互助组结合起来，不能关起门孤立建社。在工作中，还必须把领导互助组与当前生产结合起来，通过互助合作来推动冬季生产，又通过冬季生产来推动互助合作。
    农村工作是艰巨的，也是光荣的。每一个农村工作干部，每一个农村共产党员，要忠实于社会主义事业，满腔热忱地领导互助合作运动，引导群众中高涨起来的互助合作热情在巩固的基础上向前发展，并从工作中把自己锻炼成为实行农业社会主义改造的优秀的工作人员！　　　（原载四川日报）
