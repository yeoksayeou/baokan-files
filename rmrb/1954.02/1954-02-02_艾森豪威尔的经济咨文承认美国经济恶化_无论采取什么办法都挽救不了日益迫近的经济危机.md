Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 30th: US President Eisenhower submitted his annual economic message to Congress on the 28th. In this message, the US President formally admitted that the US economy is currently in a state of "contraction." He also used considerable space to call for action to deal with the approaching crisis.

In his message, Eisenhower mentioned the "contraction of economic activity in the past six months" and said that the economic downturn has "caused anxiety for stores and families." Although he said a lot of reassuring words, trying to portray the shrinking of the US economy as merely the result of merchants reducing inventory spending, he had to admit: "There is no guarantee that this decline will not extend to other spending." He further said: "These things are not certain." Therefore, he warned: "The situation must not be taken lightly."

In his message, Eisenhower acknowledged that the fundamental reason for the deterioration of the US economic situation is the contradiction between production and social consumption in the capitalist system. The message said that after mid-1952, the US economy had experienced a "boom." However, it was short-lived, and "in the first few months of 1953, the balance between production and sales gradually disappeared," resulting in "inventories accumulating rapidly in every aspect. … By mid-1953, manufacturers in many industries began to cut production to make it more adapted to orders and sales. Overtime work was first reduced or cancelled, followed by the dismissal of some workers." The message avoided talking about the specific state of the US economic deterioration, vaguely saying the production decline was "moderate," but US official materials show that at the end of 1953, the annual rate of the US national gross product had decreased by about 10 billion US dollars compared to the middle of the year. Industrial production in December had fallen by 7% compared to the spring of last year. Steel production at the beginning of this year was almost a quarter lower than at the beginning of last year. From November to January, the government surveyed major labor market areas, and nine out of ten regions saw a significant increase in unemployed workers.

Eisenhower also mentioned the depression in agriculture in his message. He admitted that monopoly prices and foreign competition have shrunk the market for major US agricultural products such as cotton and wheat. "The result is a large surplus."

In order to reassure people, Eisenhower boasted about a series of so-called "weapons under the control of the US government that can be used to maintain economic stability" and promised to use them all when "the situation may require it." These "weapons" include government military spending, credit and debt controls, the President's power to change federal insurance mortgage conditions, the government's flexibility in handling budgets, agricultural support programs, revisions to the tax system, and public works programs, etc. But Eisenhower hurriedly added that generations of accumulated experience have proven that "no government can create genuine and lasting prosperity on its own." He thus admitted that no matter what measures the US capitalist government takes, it cannot save the looming crisis caused by the intensification of the inherent fundamental contradictions of the capitalist economy.

    艾森豪威尔的经济咨文承认美国经济恶化
    无论采取什么办法都挽救不了日益迫近的经济危机
    【新华社三十日讯】华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔二十八日向国会提出一年一度的经济咨文。在这个咨文里，美国总统正式承认美国经济目前已处于“收缩”状态。他并且用了极大的篇幅呼吁采取行动，以应付逼近中的危机。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中提到“过去六个月中经济活动的收缩”，并说经济的萎缩已“引起店家和家庭的忧虑”。他虽然说了一大堆安定人心的话，想把美国经济的萎缩说成只是商人们减少囤货的开支的结果，但却不得不承认：“不能保险这种下降不会扩及其他开支。”他进一步说：“这些事情是不能一定的。”所以他警告说：“情况切不可等闲视之。”
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中承认，美国经济形势恶化的根本原因就是资本主义制度中生产与社会消费之间的矛盾。咨文说，在一九五二年年中以后，美国经济曾经出现过“繁荣”。但是，为时不久，“在一九五三年最初几个月，生产与销售之间已经逐渐失去平衡”，结果“在每一个方面，存货都迅速堆积起来。……到了一九五三年年中，许多工业的制造商就开始削减生产，以使生产较为适应订货和销售的情况。加班工作首先被减少或者被取消，接着就是一些工人被解雇。”咨文避而不谈美国经济恶化的具体状况，而含糊其辞地说生产“温和的”下降，但是美国官方材料表明，在一九五三年年底，美国全国国民生产总值的年率已经比年中时减少了约一百亿美元，工业生产在去年十二月时已比去年春季下降了百分之七，钢铁的生产在今年初比去年初降低了差不多四分之一。从去年十一月到今年一月之间，政府调查的大劳工市场地区，每十个当中就有九个地区的失业工人大大增加。
    艾森豪威尔在咨文中也提到了农业的萧条情况。他承认，垄断价格和外国的竞争缩小了美国主要农产品如棉花与小麦的市场。“结果是造成了大量的剩余。”
    为了安定人心，艾森豪威尔吹嘘了一系列所谓“在美国政府掌握下可以用来维持经济稳定的武器”，并且保证在“情况可能需要时”全部使用。这些“武器”包括政府的军事开支，信用和债务管制，总统改变联邦保险抵押条件的权力，政府处理预算的伸缩性，农业支持计划，修改税收制度以及公共工程计划等等。但是艾森豪威尔慌忙又说，世代积累的经验证明，“没有一个政府能够靠它自己创造真正和持久的繁荣”。他这样就承认了，无论美国的资本家政府采取什么办法，都挽救不了由于资本主义经济内在的根本矛盾的激化而日益迫近了的危机。
