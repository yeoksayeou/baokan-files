State Farms Show Farmers the Road to Increased Production
Promoting Production Throughout the County
    In 1953, the state farm in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, achieved an average grain yield of 651 jin per mu, which was more than 300 jin higher than the average yield of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county, more than 400 jin higher than the average yield of mutual aid teams, and more than 452 jin higher than the average yield of individual farmers. The state farm also had very low costs, with an annual surplus of about half of the total income. Farmers in the county recently did some calculations: the current average yield of farmland in the county is 236 jin and 11 liang per mu. If the total output is averaged across the entire county's population, each person would only receive 500 jin. If, through hard work, the county's yield could be raised to the state farm's average of more than 600 jin per mu, each person in the county could receive 1,500 jin of grain per year. The increased production of the Pingshun County Farm is mainly due to unified land management, emphasizing planting according to local conditions, rational fertilization, deep plowing and close planting, and selecting superior varieties. It also overcame drought and wind disasters in a timely manner, implementing flood irrigation, and transplanting and supporting seedlings to prevent missing seedlings. Under the influence of the farm's farming methods, the yields of the surrounding masses also increased. In addition to posting signs at the edge of the fields, stating farming techniques to guide farmers in learning, the farm also conducted ten small farm experiments in the county, and exchanged improved seeds with agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, promoting production throughout the county. (Fan Yongming, Chen Chuangji)

Arousing Farmers' Interest in Improving Varieties
    In 1953, Songjiang Province massively propagated superior wheat demonstration varieties in demonstration breeding farms in twenty-six counties. The average yield per hectare was 2,685 jin, exceeding the province's total average wheat yield by 78 percent. The variety propagation work of the demonstration breeding farms aroused the interest of the broad masses of farmers in improving varieties. In Shuangcheng County, the wheat was hit by heavy rain during ripening in 1953. The grains were insufficient and the quality was poor, while the "Ha Department 2602" wheat variety of the demonstration farm not only avoided the rainy season because it matured early, but also had full grains and a high yield. Wu Defu, the director of an agricultural producers' cooperative, and Kang Qinglin, a model worker, and others saw this situation and asked to exchange seeds with the farm, preparing to use them for planting in 1954. A farmer near the demonstration farm in Dongning County saw the characteristics of the "No. 96" variety, such as its strong resistance to rust and non-lodging, and specially went to the farm to ask for wheat ears, preparing to plant a single row for seed in 1954. The superior varieties propagated by demonstration farms in Hulin, Wuchang, and Jixian counties were also welcomed by the broad masses, and the connection between the farms and the farmers was greatly strengthened through this work. The Party and government leading organs of Songjiang Province have decided to continue to expand propagation in demonstration farms throughout the province in 1954, and allocate some seeds to agricultural cooperatives in various counties for trial planting, in order to further test the adaptability of the propagated varieties under the farming conditions of the masses. According to the situation of propagating superior wheat varieties in Songjiang Province, it is estimated that by 1957, these varieties can be popularized and planted throughout the province. (Agricultural Department of Songjiang Province)

Preparing to Plant Crops According to the Farm's Methods
    In the past, the Luzhou City Farm in Sichuan Province produced "behind closed doors." Although the yield was high, the farmers were not convinced. They believed that "the farm's high yield is piled up with fertilizer," "the farm has thick capital and good technology, but we can't learn it," and "learning from the farm means we won't be able to afford food." In 1953, the farm changed the phenomenon of "closed-door" production and vigorously helped farmers with production technology, making everyone love the farm. During the spring plowing and production in 1953, farmers in eight mutual aid teams in Nancheng Township lacked water for irrigating their fields. The farm released the water from its own fields to the farmers for irrigation, enabling the timely planting of one hundred dan of land and guaranteeing a bumper harvest. The farm focused on cultivating the mutual aid teams of Zuo Changfa in Nancheng Township and Long Huibo in Linyu Township to implement mud-water seed selection, close planting, etc., which prompted many farmers to follow suit, and as a result, production increased by 20%. The farm implemented the method of collecting materials locally and promoting them locally, summarizing the experience of Nancheng Township farmer Fang Ziqing in close planting of rice. Because the farmers knew that Fang Ziqing harvested more grain every year, they were willing to accept his method and universally implemented the method of fewer seedlings and close planting. The farm also summarized Ma Haihe's experience in planting sweet potatoes in Zhongyi Township, and promoted the local farmers to use Nanrui sweet potatoes as seedlings. The farmers who adopted these technologies all increased production in 1953. Some farmers in Linyu Township held ears of grain that were large and full during the autumn harvest and said to the farm cadres, "This is because of your help." Now many farmers are going to the farm to exchange improved varieties of rice, sweet potatoes, etc., preparing to plant crops according to the farm's methods this year. (Zou Zhengtao)

Striving to Improve Local Major Crops
    Seventeen local state farms in Zhangjiakou Prefecture, Hebei Province, have used 220 mu of experimental land since 1952 to conduct experiments on varieties, close planting comparisons, and artificial pollination of corn, using the major crops grown by local farmers. For example, in Shangdu and other counties, the climate on the dam is cold, and spring and autumn are often threatened by frost. The farm selects local major crops such as naked oats, wheat, flax, and potatoes for experiments to explore the appropriate sowing period. Zhangbei and other counties also identify wheat varieties. Because the experimental purpose is clear, timely observation and recording are achieved, and most of them have found the growth patterns and ways to increase production of local crops. In 1953, the grain crops managed by the farm averaged 352 jin per mu because they mastered these laws, exceeding the local average yield per mu (105 jin) by 235.2%. The millet close planting experiment of the Wei County Farm, with 20,000 plants per mu, increased the yield by 51.48% compared with the local people's habit of 6,000 plants per mu. The farms in various counties also focused on establishing technical guidance relationships with fourteen agricultural producers' cooperatives and sixteen mutual aid teams, which also improved the production of these cooperatives and teams. The Xinghuo Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, guided by the Zhangbei County Farm, achieved an average yield of 60 mu of naked oats that was one and a half times higher than the local people's yield. The excellent growth of the farm's crops attracted the attention of the masses. In 1953, more than 6,000 directors of agricultural producers' cooperatives, leaders of mutual aid teams, and activists in production visited the farms to learn, and the farms prepared a large number of seeds to exchange with various teams and cooperatives. The farmers near the farms all learned the farming techniques of the farms, so their crops also grew very well. Farmers from afar often said when they saw these crops near the farm, "No wonder the crops here are good, it turns out they are next to good neighbors!" (Zhao Youjin, Shen Fu)

One Farm Equals a Hundred Villages
    The Panshan Paddy Field Farm, a local state-owned farm in Liaoxi Province, delivered 45 million jin of grain to the state in 1953, accounting for more than 87% of the farm's total rice production, which is equivalent to the grain purchased by the state in one hundred villages in the province. Before 1952, the Panshan Farm relied on manpower and animal power for production. It cultivated a lot of land, but the labor efficiency was low, and the operation quality was not good. After the paddy fields were watered, they were often overgrown with weeds, and weeding work could not keep up, leaving hundreds of qing of rice fields barren. Also, because of the lack of draft animals, sowing could not be done on time every year, and the sowing plan could not be completed. During the autumn harvest, the late maturity of autumn crops often suffered frost damage and reduced production. In 1953, the state supplied the Panshan Farm with 34 large and medium-sized tractors and several threshing machines, weeders, and seeders, starting partial mechanized operations. In this way, the machine plowed the land deeply and finished early, advancing the sowing period by 20 days and the autumn harvest by 30 days, avoiding insect pests and frost damage, and reducing weeds, ensuring a yield of 7,000 jin per hectare, exceeding the original plan by 376 jin, and increasing by 39.9% compared to the actual yield in 1952. Because the Panshan Farm used modern mechanical equipment and improved farming techniques, it changed the situation of being unprofitable or having little profit in the past. It not only supplied the state with a large amount of commercial grain, but also profited 5 billion yuan in production. (Wang Mingyi, Sun Yuqin)

    国营农场指给了农民增产的道路
    推动了全县的生产
    山西平顺县国营农场一九五三年的粮食产量是每亩平均六百五十一斤，比全县农业生产合作社的平均产量多了三百多斤，比互助组的平均产量多了四百多斤，比单干农民的平均产量多了四百五十二斤。国营农场的成本也很低，一年盈余约为总收入的一半。该县农民在最近算了一笔账：现在全县农田的平均产量是二百三十六斤十一两，以全县人口来平均总产量，每人只可以分到五百斤；如果经过努力，把全县产量都能提高到像国营农场的平均产量六百多斤，全县人口每人每年就可以分到一千五百斤粮食。平顺县农场生产的提高，主要是因为土地统一经营管理，讲求了因地种植，合理施肥，深耕密植，选种优良品种等先进技术，又及时战胜旱灾和风灾的袭击，实行洪浇，进行移苗扶苗，不使缺苗等。在农场的耕作方法影响下，周围群众的产量也提高了。农场除了在地头上插牌子，写明耕作技术，引导农民学习外，还在全县作了十一个小农场试验，并和农业生产合作社、互助组交换良种，推动了全县生产。　　　　（范永明　陈创基）
    引起农民改进品种的兴趣
    松江省一九五三年在二十六个县的示范繁殖场，大批繁殖了优良小麦示范品种，每垧平均产量是二千六百八十五斤，超过全省小麦总平均产量百分之七十八。示范繁殖场的品种繁殖工作，引起了广大农民改进品种的兴趣。在双城县，一九五三年小麦黄熟时遭受了大雨，籽实上不足，质量也差，而示范场的“哈系二六○二”种小麦，不但因为成熟早，躲过了雨季，而且籽实饱满，产量很高。农业生产合作社社长吴德富和劳动模范康庆林等看到了这种情况，都要求和场里串换种子，准备在一九五四年种植时用。东宁县示范场附近有一个农民，看到了“九六号”品种抗疸力强、不倒伏等特点后，特意到场里要麦穗，准备一九五四年单种一条作种子用。虎林、五常、集贤等县的示范场所繁殖的优良品种也受到广大群众的欢迎，并从这件工作上把农场和农民的联系大大加强起来了。松江省党政领导机关已决定一九五四年在全省示范场继续扩大繁殖，并拨给各县农业合作社一部种子试种，以便进一步在群众的耕作条件下，考验所繁殖的品种的适应性。按松江省繁殖小麦优良品种的情况，预计到一九五七年，就可把这些品种普及全省种植了。

      准备按照农场的办法种庄稼
    四川泸州市农场过去“关门”生产，产量虽然高，可是农民就不服气。他们认为“农场产量高是肥料堆出来的”“农场本钱厚技术好，可是我们学不了”“向农场学习就要吃不起饭”。一九五三年农场改变了“关门”生产的现象，在生产技术上大力帮助农民，使人人都变得热爱农场了。一九五三年春耕生产时，南城乡八个互助组的农民缺水浇田，农场就把自己田里的水放给农民浇，使农民一百石的田得以及时栽种，保证了丰收。农场重点培养南城乡左长发、邻玉乡龙惠波互助组实行泥水选种，密植等，推动许多农民都照着做了，结果都增产了二成。农场实行就地取材就地推广的方法，把南城乡农民方子清水稻密植的经验作了总结。因为农民都知道方子清年年收的粮食多，就都愿意接受他的方法，普遍实行了少秧密植法。农场又在忠义乡总结了马海和种红苕的经验，推动了当地农民都用南瑞苕作秧子。采用这些技术的农民，一九五三年都增产了。邻玉乡有些农民在秋收时拿着穗大粒饱的谷子对农场干部说：“这是因为你们帮助才收到的。”现在很多农民都到农场里调换水稻、红苕等良种，准备今年按照农场的办法种庄稼。

    努力改进当地主要作物
    河北省张家口专区十七个地方国营农场，从一九五二年起，就用了二百二十亩试验地，用当地农民种植的主要作物，进行品种、密植比较以及玉米人工授精等的试验。如商都等县坝上的气候寒冷，春秋常受霜灾威胁，农场就选择莜麦、小麦、胡麻、山药蛋等当地的主要作物试验，摸索适时的播种期，张北等县也对小麦品种进行鉴定。因为试验目的明确，做到了及时观察和记载，大部都找出了当地作物的生长规律和增产的门路。一九五三年农场经营的粮食作物，因为掌握了这些规律，每亩平均产了三百五十二斤，超出当地每亩平均产量（一百零五斤）百分之二百三十五点二。蔚县农场的谷子密植试验，每亩两万株，比当地群众习惯每亩六千株的产量增加了百分之五十一点四八。各县农场还有重点地和十四个农业生产合作社及十六个互助组建立了技术指导关系，使这些社、组的产量也都提高了。张北县农场指导的星火农业生产合作社，六十亩莜麦每亩平均产量超出当地群众产量一倍半。农场的庄稼长得出色，引起了群众的注意。一九五三年有六千多个农业生产合作社的社长、互助组长和生产中的积极分子到各场参观学习，各农场并准备了大量种子，和各组、社串换。各农场附近的农民都学习农场的耕作技术，所以他们的庄稼也长得十分好，从远地来的农民在农场附近看到这些庄稼时，常说：“怪不得这里庄稼好，原来是守着好地邻哩！”（赵有金　申夫）
      一个农场顶了百个村庄
    辽西省地方国营盘山水田农场，一九五三年缴给国家的粮食有四千五百万斤，占全场水稻总产量的百分之八十七强，相等于国家在该省一百个村庄购买的粮食。盘山农场在一九五二年以前还是依靠人力和畜力生产，种的地多，而劳动效率却低，作业质量也不好，水田上水后，常因杂草丛生，锄草工作跟不上，撩荒数百垧稻田。又因为耕畜不足，每年都不能按时播种，完不成播种计划，秋收时也常因秋庄稼成熟晚，遭受霜害而减产。一九五三年国家供给了盘山农场大、中型拖拉机三十四台及脱谷机、除草机、播种机等各数台，开始了部分的机械作业。这样，机器翻地翻得深，又完成得早，使播种期提前二十天，秋收工作提前三十天，避免了虫害、霜害，并减少了杂草，保证每垧产量达到了七千斤，超过原计划三百七十六斤，比一九五二年实际产量增加百分之三十九点九。盘山农场因为用上了现代化的机械装备，改进了耕作技术，就把一向无利或少利的局面改变了，不但供给了国家大量商品粮，而且在生产上获利达五十亿元。　　　　（王明义　孙毓勤）
