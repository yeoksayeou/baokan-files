    Beijing's Public Bond Promotion Work Successfully Concluded
    Citizens' Subscription Exceeds Target by 52 Percent
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since Beijing began promoting the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds on January 13th, the work has now successfully concluded due to the enthusiastic subscription of people from all walks of life. As of February 20th, the city's residents had subscribed to a total of 259.751 billion yuan in bonds, exceeding the planned figure by 52.8 percent. Among them, workers and public employees subscribed to 113.641 billion yuan (workers subscribed to 44.954 billion yuan, government employees subscribed to 52.527 billion yuan, the cultural and educational sector subscribed to 12.121 billion yuan, and the medical sector subscribed to 4.038 billion yuan), exceeding the planned figure by 145.45 percent; suburban farmers subscribed to 3.997 billion yuan, exceeding the planned figure by 135.13 percent; the industrial and commercial sector subscribed to 135.851 billion yuan, exceeding the planned figure by 12.65 percent; and urban residents subscribed to 6.261 billion yuan, exceeding the planned figure by 347.25 percent.
    Before the bond subscription began, the Beijing Public Bond Promotion Committee selected and trained a large number of reporters and propagandists, carrying out extensive publicity throughout the city, basically achieving "household awareness." For example, Xuanwu District held 196 mobilization report meetings, with over 62,000 citizens hearing the reports; in Dongsi District, 91 percent of state-owned enterprise employees heard the reports, and 70 to 80 percent of private sector employees heard them. The industrial and commercial sector also combined the study of the general line to conduct a relatively in-depth study and discussion on the issuance of national economic construction bonds. Through such widespread and in-depth publicity and education, the patriotic consciousness of people from all walks of life was further enhanced, and their enthusiasm for actively subscribing to bonds to support national economic construction was boosted. On January 13th, the subscription campaign was launched throughout the city, with the broad masses of workers and public employees taking the lead in subscribing. Many government agencies, factories, and schools completed their subscriptions in one or two days or even a few hours, and many people took out their savings from many years to buy bonds. Farmers in the suburbs also subscribed enthusiastically, with farmers participating in mutual aid groups and production cooperatives being particularly enthusiastic. Members of the 22 agricultural production cooperatives in Fengtai District subscribed to more than double the amount of bonds per household compared to ordinary farmers. Through their personal experience over the past few years since liberation, industrialists and businessmen deeply felt that the development of private industry and commerce and the ability to obtain reasonable profits were due to the correct leadership and support of the government. Especially after studying the general line for the transition period, industrialists and businessmen further realized the importance of national socialist industrialization and the bright future of private industrialists and businessmen, and everyone actively subscribed to bonds. Industrial and commercial households in Qianmen District subscribed to more than 30 billion yuan in just a few days, exceeding the planned figure, and 96 percent of industrial and commercial households in Xidan District subscribed to bonds. Urban residents also subscribed very enthusiastically.
    In the process of promoting public bonds, the Beijing Public Bond Promotion Committee consistently implemented the principles of "active subscription" and "voluntary capacity," preventing phenomena such as forced quotas, challenges, and competitions. For those who subscribed too much, they were persuaded to reduce their subscriptions; for families of workers, public employees, industrialists, and businessmen without income, as well as students studying at schools, only publicity about the significance of issuing bonds was conducted, and they were not made targets for promotion. Beijing also stipulated the principle that each person should only subscribe to bonds in one place.
    People from all walks of life in Beijing have now begun to actively pay the bond money. According to statistics from the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, 50.4 billion yuan in bond money had been received as of February 20th.

    北京市公债推销工作胜利结束
    全市人民认购数字超过预计百分之五十二
    【本报讯】北京市从一月十三日开始推销一九五四年国家经济建设公债以来，由于各界人民踊跃认购，现已胜利结束。到二月二十日止，全市人民共认购了公债二千五百九十七亿五千一百多万元，超过预计数字百分之五十二点八。其中职工和公教人员认购公债一千一百三十六亿四千一百多万元
  （职工认购四百四十九亿五千四百多万元，机关工作人员认购五百二十五亿二千七百多万元，文教界认购一百二十一亿二千一百多万元，医务界认购四十亿三千八百多万元），超过预计数字百分之一百四十五点四五；郊区农民认购公债三十九亿九千七百多万元，超过预计数字百分之一百三十五点一三；工商界认购公债一千三百五十八亿五千一百多万元，超过预计数字百分之十二点六五；城市居民认购公债六十二亿六千一百多万元，超过预计数字百分之三百四十七点二五。
    在认购公债开始前，北京市公债推销委员会选调并训练了大批报告员和宣传员，在全市展开了广泛的宣传，基本上做到了“家喻户晓”。如宣武区前后召开了一百九十六个动员报告会，听到报告的市民有六万二千多人；东四区国营企业职工听到报告的占百分之九十一，私营行业职工占百分之七十到八十。工商界还结合学习总路线，进行了比较深入的关于发行国家经济建设公债的学习和讨论。经过这样普遍、深入的宣传教育，进一步提高了各界人民的爱国主义觉悟，鼓舞了他们踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设的热情。一月十三日，认购活动在全市范围内展开，广大职工和公教人员带头认购。许多机关、工厂、学校在一两天甚至几小时内就认购完毕，许多人把多年的积蓄拿出来买了公债。郊区农民认购情况也很热烈，参加互助组和生产合作社的农民情绪特别高。丰台区二十二个农业生产合作社的社员，平均每户认购公债数比一般农民每户认购数高出一倍以上。工商业者经过解放后几年来的切身体会，深深感到私营工商业得到发展并能获得合理的利润，是由于政府的正确领导与扶植。特别是经过学习国家过渡时期的总路线，工商业者进一步认识到国家社会主义工业化的重要性和私营工商业者的光明前途，大家踊跃认购公债。前门区工商户几天内就认购了三百多亿元，超过了预计数字，西单区百分之九十六的工商户都认购了公债。城市居民认购情况也十分热烈。
    北京市公债推销委员会在推销工作过程中，始终贯彻了“积极认购”、“自愿量力”的原则，防止了强迫摊派、挑战、竞赛等现象发生。对于认购过多的，都劝说他们减少；对于没有收入的职工、公教人员、工商业者等的家属以及在学校学习的学生，就只进行关于发行公债意义的宣传，不作为推销的对象。北京市还规定了一人只在一处认购公债的原则。
    北京市各界人民现已开始积极缴款，据人民银行北京分行统计，到二月二十日止已收到公债款五百零四亿元。
