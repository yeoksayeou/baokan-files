Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. General Li Xiangchao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, in a letter to US Chief Commissioner Lacey on the 6th, firmly insisted that both sides' staff officers should continue to negotiate on the definition of "parts" in order to achieve a reasonable solution to this issue as soon as possible. In a letter on the 2nd, Lacey claimed that the US side would unilaterally suspend the bilateral staff meetings on the issue of parts, attempting to violate the Armistice Agreement and freely transport reinforcements of war materials into South Korea under the guise of "parts" and "disassembled components." General Li Xiangchao pointed out in the letter: "Your side's attempt to unilaterally suspend seeking a solution to this issue is not only inconsistent with the Armistice Agreement but also violates bilateral agreements."

General Li Xiangchao pointed out: "In order to ensure the cessation of the entry of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition from outside Korea, and to ensure that the replacement of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition is indeed carried out on a one-for-one basis with the same performance and the same type, the issue raised by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on September 10, 1953, is an important issue in the implementation of the Armistice Agreement. Both parties to the Armistice Agreement must take a responsible attitude to resolve it as soon as possible."

General Li Xiangchao emphasized that this issue is of even greater practical importance because the US side is transporting reinforcements of war materials into South Korea under the guise of "parts." General Li Xiangchao pointed out: "Since the armistice, based solely on the incomplete reports of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission up to the end of 1953, your side has transported more than 60 105mm and 155mm howitzer barrels and more than 460,000 pounds of combat aircraft parts. It should be particularly mentioned that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission pointed out in its rotation replacement analysis report for July-September 1953 that your side had shipped in 106 4.2-inch mortars disassembled and boxed, disguised as parts."

In the letter, General Li Xiangchao also exposed the US side's delay and attempt to unilaterally suspend the bilateral staff meetings on the parts issue in order to evade the obligations stipulated in the Armistice Agreement. General Li Xiangchao said: "The records of the six meetings of the bilateral staff meetings on this issue show that, despite our continuous efforts, your side has consistently been unwilling to positively discuss and resolve this issue in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. Recently, your side has refused both of our suggestions to convene staff meetings with excuses. The responsibility for the delay in resolving this originally simple and easily resolved issue lies entirely with your side."

    李相朝将军函复美方首席委员拉西
    坚决主张双方继续商谈解决关于零件问题
    【新华社开城七日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在六日函复美方首席委员拉西，坚决主张双方参谋人员应该就零件的定义问题继续进行商谈，以便使这一问题早日获得合理解决。拉西在二日的来信中声称，美方将片面中止关于零件问题的双方参谋会议，企图违反停战协定，以零件和拆散件为名把增援性作战物资自由地运入南朝鲜。李相朝将军在信中指出：“你方企图片面中止就这一问题寻求解决，不仅是不符合停战协定而且也是违反双方协议的。”
    李相朝将军指出：“为了保证停止自朝鲜境外进入增援性的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，以及作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药确在同样性能、同样类型的一件换一件的基础上进行替换，中立国监察委员会在一九五三年九月十日所提出的这一问题是实施停战协定中的一个重要问题。停战协定缔约双方必须采取负责的态度早日予以解决。”
    李相朝将军强调由于美方正在以零件为名把增援性作战物资运入南朝鲜，因此这一问题更具有实际的重要性。李相朝将军指出：“自停战以来，仅根据截至一九五三年底止的中立国监察委员会的不完全的报告数字，你方就曾运进一零五糎口径和一五五糎口径的榴弹炮筒六十件以上，作战飞机零件四十六万磅以上。特别应当提起的是中立国监察委员会在其一九五三年七至九月份轮换替换分析报告中指出，你方曾以一百零六门四点二英寸的迫击炮拆散装箱，冒充零件运进朝鲜。”
    李相朝将军在信中并揭露美方拖延和企图片面中止关于零件问题的双方参谋会议，就是为了要回避停战协定所规定的义务。李相朝将军说：“关于这一问题的双方参谋会议的六次会议记录说明，虽经我方不断努力，你方在会上始终不愿依照停战协定的规定来正面讨论和解决这个问题。最近我方两次建议召开参谋会议，你方都托词拒绝。这个本来是简单而容易解决的问题拖延至今未得解决，其责任全在你方。”
