    Welcoming the Relatives
    Soldier Zhang Zhipeng, of a certain Air Force unit
    Why is the blue sky so bright?
    Why is the sun so red?
    Gongs, drums, and songs never cease,
    Joyfully welcoming the relatives.
    Crossing thousands of mountains and traversing tens of thousands of rivers,
    Bringing the people's heartfelt feelings,
    With the Motherland, we have strength,
    With us, the Motherland has peace.
    Thousands of rivers and hundreds of streams flow into the sea,
    Hundreds of millions of hearts turn towards Beijing,
    Resolutely defend the Motherland's garden,
    Let the socialist flowers bloom red early.

    迎亲人
    空军某部战士　张志鹏
    为何蓝天格外明？
    为何太阳格外红？
    锣声鼓声歌不断，
    欢天喜地迎亲人。
    翻千山来越万水，
    带来了人民一片心，
    有祖国我们就有力量，
    有我们祖国就有和平。
    千江百水归大海，
    万众一心向北京，
    坚决把祖国花园守卫住，
    让社会主义鲜花早日红。
