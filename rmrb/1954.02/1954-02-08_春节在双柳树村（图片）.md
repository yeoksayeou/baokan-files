Spring Festival in Shuangliushu Village

After studying the general line of the state's transition period, the villagers enthusiastically sold more than 170,000 jin of surplus grain, earning the honorary title of "Patriotic Grain Selling Model Village." Zhang Tuofu (right), captain of Fangshan County, presents the red flag to the village.

The village established the "Patriotic Inspection Day" system in 1951. Meetings are held on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month to arrange and summarize the central work and solve the problems of the village. This meeting system promotes the unity and mutual assistance of the whole village and maintains the honor of the model village.

A few days before the Spring Festival, the members of the Li Chunchang Agricultural Production Cooperative are scattering and drying seeds, and repairing farm tools, preparing to start spring plowing after the thaw.

The mutual aid group led by Wang Fusuo, the secretary of the Party branch, has developed into an agricultural production cooperative. The members are checking each other's land certificates, preparing to measure the land and compare yields.

The composition topic for the last Chinese class of the fourth grade in the first semester of elementary school is: "Why should we join the agricultural production cooperative?" The elementary school students took this topic to test an old farmer.

At the "Worker-Peasant Alliance Symposium" in the village, Wang Baokun, a worker from the Fengtai Engineering Section of the Beijing Railway Bureau who gloriously returned from the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, introduced the construction of the motherland's railways.

Shuangliushu Village, Xiacun Township, Fangshan County, Hebei Province, has won eleven red flags in production, literacy campaigns, running people's schools, organizing propaganda networks, and patriotic health campaigns. It is a model village of the district, county, special district, and province. On the day of the Spring Festival, the village received the good news that Li Zhendong, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, had made meritorious service in Korea. Village cadres led the villagers to send plaques to congratulate Li Fengxiang, the uncle of the military family.

On the eve of the Spring Festival, the Youth League members reviewed their study situation in the past year. They said that they would study the book "How to be a Communist Party Member" carefully and actively prepare for the conditions for joining the Party.

At the Spring Festival get-together, the crosstalk "Family Meeting" was performed.

The Spring Festival group visit replaces the custom of kowtowing and paying New Year's greetings. The elderly praised it as being both convenient and lively.
