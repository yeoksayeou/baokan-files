    Closely Linking Ideological Work with Actual Life
    --Meeting of Ministers of Propaganda and Agitation Departments and Scientific and Cultural Departments of the Soviet Communist Party's State Committees, Regional Committees, and Republic Central Committees
    A meeting convened by the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee of ministers of propaganda and agitation departments and scientific and cultural departments of the Soviet Communist Party's state committees, regional committees, and republic central committees was recently held in Moscow.

    Comrades M.A. Suslov and P.N. Pospelov, Secretaries of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, and P.K. Ponomarenko, Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, attended the meeting.

    The participants listened to and discussed the following reports: "The Tasks of Party Organizations in Ideological Work" by V.S. Kruzhkov, Minister of Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee; "The Tasks of Local Party Organizations' Scientific and Cultural Departments in Implementing the Resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee" by Rumyantsev, Minister of Scientific and Cultural Department of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee; "Measures to Further Develop Agriculture in Implementing the Resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee" by Mazkevich, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Soviet Union; "The Current Stage of Soviet Literature" by Surkov, First Secretary of the Soviet Writers Association; and "The Current Situation of Soviet Trade and the Tasks for Further Development" by Kruchkov, Deputy Minister of Trade of the Soviet Union.

    The participants also listened to the following speeches: "The Role of Soviet Science in Communist Construction" by Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; "The Achievements of Soviet Science and the Advanced Experience of High Grain Yields" by Academician Tsitsin; and "The International Situation and the Struggle of the Peoples of All Countries to Defend Peace" by Korionov.

    The meeting discussed in detail the most important issues in the ideological work of the Party raised by the resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, and the subsequent resolutions of the Party and the government. The reports and speeches of the participants unanimously pointed out that in order to smoothly realize the huge tasks set by the Party and the government, Party organizations are required to make every effort to strengthen ideological work, constantly care for the communist education of the Soviet people, and mobilize all the creativity of the working people to strive for the further upsurge of the motherland's economy and culture.

    Ideological work is a powerful weapon for our Party in its revolutionary and transformative activities. The strength of the ideological work of Party organizations lies in its reliance on a solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism and in its close connection with life.

    The meeting emphasized that Party organizations must ensure that mass political work, propaganda work, and all ideological work are carried out entirely in accordance with the scientific theory of communism and are characterized by strict Marxist-Leninist steadfastness. In every area of the ideological work front, the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory and its creative revolutionary nature must be strictly maintained.

    However, as the participants of the meeting pointed out, in some individual Party organizations, there are still facts of indifference towards establishing strict Marxist-Leninist steadfastness in mass political work and propaganda work.

    At present, whether in oral or written propaganda, there are still simplifications and vulgarizations of the Marxist-Leninist question of the role of the masses, the Party, and the individual in history. In some individual Party organizations, the instructions in the resolution issued by the Party Central Committee in light of the publication of the "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" are increasingly being forgotten. This instruction pointed out that the exposition of the history of the Party must not be carried out around individual figures and their biographies, but should be carried out on the basis of unfolding the basic ideas of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of historical facts. Some individual Party organizations also allow indifference towards the study of the Party's most important documents, such as the resolutions of congresses, conferences, and Central Committee plenary sessions, which reflect the Party's long-term domestic and foreign policies.

    There are also serious shortcomings in the propaganda of Lenin's principle of the worker-peasant alliance and in explaining the role and significance of this alliance in our country's cause of building communism. The propaganda work on the Leninist-Stalinist nationality policy and its political, cultural, and economic achievements is also not being carried out satisfactorily, and not enough attention has been paid to the work of educating the working people in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism, as well as the spirit of brotherly cooperation among the various nationalities of our country. The question of socialist countries being the main weapon in the hands of the Soviet working people in the struggle for the victory of communism has not been fully elucidated in either oral or written propaganda. The education of the Soviet people in loyalty to the Soviet state should be closely linked with the education of the people to have revolutionary vigilance, abide by labor discipline and state laws, and care for the publicly owned socialist property.

    The propaganda of natural science is a weak link in the ideological work of Party organizations.

    The meeting particularly sharply raised the issue of the necessity of the closest connection between ideological work and practical life, and with the current practical tasks of communist construction. The activities of propaganda work, political agitation work, scientific and cultural institutions must be shifted to clarifying the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the resolutions of the Party and the government to the working people. The issue must be raised in such a way that the ideological work of Party organizations inspires the Soviet people to exert creative labor, further develop the heavy industry which is the foundation of the socialist economy, practically realize the task of agricultural upsurge, develop light industry and food industry, and further improve the material and cultural living conditions of the working people which depend on this.

    The reports and speeches of the participants cited many facts showing that in many cases, our propagandists, lecturers, and agitators, when carrying out propaganda and agitation, are divorced from practical life and the urgent tasks of communist construction, have not linked propaganda activities with the specific tasks of each state, each district, each enterprise, each collective farm, each machine tractor station, each state farm, and the promotion of the experience of advanced industrial and agricultural producers is also weak. The task of Party organizations is to help propagandists and agitators study the basic issues in current agricultural production. Knowledge of these issues can help propaganda work be closer to the requirements of practical life.

    Cultural and educational institutions—cultural palaces, clubs, reading rooms, libraries—play an important role in elucidating the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and the resolutions of the Party and the government. At present, there are 108,000 national and collective farm cultural institutions, and hundreds of thousands of libraries in the countryside. However, many Party organizations underestimate the significance of cultural and educational work as one of the tools for the political education of the working people. Therefore, it is not accidental that most cultural palaces, clubs, and reading rooms weakly perform their tasks, and that the propaganda of the resolutions of the Party and the government remains at a very low ideological level, and is divorced from the specific affairs of the current collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms. Particularly serious shortcomings exist in the cultural and educational work of the Novosibirsk State, Smolensk State, Kursk State, and Lithuanian Republic.

    In some states, regions, and republics, primarily the Khabarovsk Region, Saratov State, Ryazan State, Tambov State, Tatar Autonomous Republic and Moldavian Autonomous Republic, Moldavian Republic, and Latvian Republic, the leadership of propaganda lectures, especially the propaganda of agricultural knowledge, is not good. The facts show that agricultural propaganda and the application of scientific achievements and advanced experience in production have still not become an integral part of the local Party organizations and Soviet organs' leadership of agricultural production.

    The participants pointed out that it is necessary to transform the work of scientific organs more rapidly in the direction of providing practical help to agriculture. There can be no rapid upsurge in agriculture without the wide application of scientific achievements, technology, and advanced experience in the practice of agricultural production. State scientific organs must turn their research work towards implementing the most important tasks stipulated by the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee.

    Raising the level of all ideological work—this means forever closely linking ideological work with practical life, with the practice of communist construction, and removing pedantry, dogmatism, and abstract concepts from our propaganda and agitation work. Dogmatism and pedantry are harmful to the training of cadres and hinder them from creatively understanding and smoothly implementing the Party's policies.

    The reports and speeches at the meeting emphasized that although the ideological and theoretical level of Party education has generally improved, up to now, whether in oral or written propaganda, the exposition of theoretical principles is often divorced from the specific historical environment, without profoundly elucidating the transformative role of the Communist Party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory in social development, and this exposition is divorced from the Party's main economic and political tasks.

    The improvement of the quality of the Party's propaganda work and the ideological training of our cadres and all Communist Party members are inseparable from adherence to the voluntary principle of participating in Party educational organizations. The meeting pointed out that many Party organizations have seriously violated the instructions of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee on strictly adhering to the voluntary principle of participating in Party educational organizations. Some people still pay attention to pursuing so-called "100% participation" and including all Party members in the Party education network. Study groups include Party members who have studied the same things many times in the past. They even force elderly and disabled Communist Party members and Communist Party mothers with many children to participate in study groups and political schools. Sometimes it is so nonsensical that Party education groups even include non-Party comrades against their own will.

    The meeting cited such an example. Comrade Shenqiugao'wa, a female Communist Party member living in the central urban area, graduated from the Marxist-Leninist Night University last year. In the autumn, she began studying tailoring and sewing at a club. Comrade Shenqiugao'wa had not yet begun to study tailoring and sewing when she was expelled for not listening to the current political situation course stipulated by the club. The leaders of the club also "explained" to her: "The current political situation course is a special course in the tailoring and sewing department. Female tailors who graduate from here should be politically mature." Comrade Shenqiugao'wa's reason was that she had just graduated from the Marxist-Leninist Night University. But this reason did not work. Enthusiastic administrative leaders even allowed her to continue studying tailoring and sewing outside the club in a "personal manner". It is obvious that such a "leader" of a cultural institution who exhibits such commandism, coercion, and arbitrary behavior can only occupy this position due to some misunderstanding.

    The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee received letters from some Party members in some Party organizations. In their letters, they described that after graduating from the Marxist-Leninist Night University and studying in the Soviet Communist Party history study group, they were forced to study in study groups and political schools, and were threatened with severe punishment for absenteeism. Last year, Comrade Songzov, a worker and Communist Party member at a machine-building factory, received a severe warning from the Buragoweisinski District Committee of the Bashkir Autonomous Republic for refusing to participate in group study. Comrade Songzov had studied in the group for many years and had been able to study on his own in his spare time, but the District Committee not only did not consider this a legitimate wish of a Communist Party member, but unjustly punished him. The District State Committee knew very well the instructions of the Party Central Committee on adhering to the voluntary principle in organizing Party education groups, but until now, the punishment of Comrade Songzov has not been revoked.

    For example, the summary report of the Soviet Communist Party Verikruk State Committee is proof of the formalistic and commanding attitude towards the education of Party members. The report stated that in this academic year, Party members "participating in all forms of study" accounted for 95.6% of all Party members, while last year it accounted for 92.3%. These two figures illustrate that the state has been trying to force more Communist Party members to participate in study groups and political schools in a formalistic way than last year.

    Party committees should resolutely fight against the facts of administrative orders in Party education, because administrative orders will stifle a strong interest in studying revolutionary doctrines.

    The meeting pointed out that the reason why some Party workers have absurd distrust of Party members being able to study and research Marxism-Leninism in their spare time lies in their wrong, formalistic-bureaucratic, and commanding attitude towards Party education. The responsibility of Party organizations is to make propaganda work interesting and fascinating.

    For this, it is necessary to improve the ideological and political level of propagandists and lecturers, and to select comrades who are truly talented and truly capable of doing propaganda and lecturing work, and who are constantly paying attention to improving their own business, to do this work.

    Efforts should be made to ensure that every Communist Party member has a small collection, even if it is not many, of books on the basics of Marxism-Leninism. It is necessary to cultivate in Communist Party members an interest in studying political books in their spare time. The meeting pointed out the need to organize the publication of small popular Marxist-Leninist books and to organize the publication of introductions to literary works and book reviews in newspapers.

    Propaganda lecturing is of great significance. But as the facts pointed out at the meeting show, many Party organizations do not pay attention to the quality and content of lecturing work. As a result, the reports given to listeners are often dry, superficial, and disorganized. A serious shortcoming in propaganda lectures is that they are divorced from the specific situation of the area and collective farm, and from life.

    The meeting cited such an example. Comrade Viprov, Secretary of the Kumansk District Party Committee of Kirov State, gave a report on the resolutions of the September Plenary Session of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee to the workers of the Laminsk Machine Tractor Station. The report did not mention a single word about the shortcomings in the work of this machine tractor station and the specific tasks of this machine tractor station and the farms it served. It is not surprising that after listening to such a superficial report, no one agreed with it, and no one asked the reporter any questions.

    Propagandists, agitators, and lecturers should constantly pay attention to, study specific issues in agriculture, and truly master agricultural knowledge.

    The meeting emphasized the need to improve the quality and ideological content of political agitation and to link it more with practical life and the propaganda of advanced experience.

    Our newspapers, literature, art, books, and radio should serve the implementation of the measures taken by the Party and the government to improve agriculture, promote scientific achievements, and the experience of advanced workers.

    This meeting emphasized the necessity of closely linking the propaganda and agitation work of Party organizations with the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    The meeting emphasized the special responsibility of all workers in the propaganda and agitation departments and scientific and cultural departments and all our propagandists, lecturers, and agitators to ensure a high level of political work by the Party. All ideological work of Party organizations should contribute to the victorious realization of the great plan of communist construction planned by our Party.

    把思想工作和实际生活密切地联系起来
    ——苏共州委会、边疆区委会和共和国中央的宣传鼓动部部长和科学文化部部长会议
    不久前，在莫斯科举行了苏共中央召集的苏共州委会、边疆区委会和共和国中央的宣传鼓动部部长和科学文化部部长的会议。
    苏共中央书记米·安·苏斯洛夫同志和彼·纳·波斯伯洛夫同志、苏联文化部部长潘·康·波诺马连科同志参加了会议。
    与会者听了并讨论了下列报告：苏共中央宣传鼓动部部长维·斯·克鲁热科夫同志所作“党组织在思想工作方面的任务”的报告，苏共中央科学文化部部长鲁缅切夫同志所作“地方党组织的科学文化部在贯彻苏共中央九月全会决议中的任务”的报告，苏联农业部副部长马兹凯维契同志所作“关于执行苏共中央九月全会决议在进一步发展农业方面的措施”的报告，苏联作家协会第一书记苏尔科夫同志所作“现阶段的苏维埃文学”的报告，苏联贸易部副部长克鲁奇科夫同志所作“苏联贸易的现状和进一步发展的任务”的报告。
    与会者并听了下列讲演：苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士所作“苏联科学在共产主义建设中的作用”的讲演，科学院院士齐金同志所作“苏联科学的成就和谷物高额收成的先进经验”的讲演，科里奥诺夫同志所作“国际形势及各国人民保卫和平的斗争”的讲演。
    会议详尽地讨论了由苏共十九次代表大会决议、苏共中央九月全会决议和以后的党和政府的决议所提出来的党组织思想工作中的最重要的问题。与会者的报告和发言中一致指出，为了顺利地实现党和政府所规定的巨大的任务，要求党组织尽一切力量加强思想工作，经常关怀苏联人民的共产主义教育，动员劳动人民的一切创造力为争取祖国经济和文化的进一步高涨而斗争。
    思想工作是我党在其革命的、改造的活动中的强有力的武器。党组织的思想工作的力量在于它依靠着牢固的马克思列宁主义的基础，在于紧密地联系生活。
    会议强调指出，党组织必须保证群众政治工作、宣传工作以及一切思想工作完全按照科学的共产主义的理论进行，并以严格的马克思列宁主义的坚韧性为其特征。在思想工作战线的每一地区必须严格保持马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性及其创造性的革命的性质。
    可是，正如会议参加者所指出的，在某些个别的党组织中，还有对群众政治工作和宣传工作中确立严格的马克思列宁主义的坚韧性采取漠不关心的态度的事实。
    目前，无论在口头宣传和文字宣传中，还有把马克思列宁主义关于人民群众、党和个人在历史中的作用的问题加以简单化和庸俗化的情况。在某些个别的党组织中，愈来愈把党中央鉴于“联共（布）党史简明教程”出版而颁布的决议中的指示置之脑后了，这个指示指出，党的历史的阐述必须不是围绕着个别人物及其传记来进行，而是应该在展开马克思列宁主义基本思想的基础上、在历史事实的基础上来进行。某些个别党组织还允许对党的最重要的文件，如代表大会、代表会议和中央全会决议的研究，采取漠不关心的态度，而这些决议反映了党所制订的长期的国内和对外的政策。
    在宣传列宁关于工农联盟的原则方面，在阐明这个联盟在我国建设共产主义事业中的作用和意义方面，也存在着严重的缺点。关于列宁斯大林的民族政策及其政治、文化和经济成果的宣传工作也进行得不能令人满意，对于用苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义精神以及我国各民族兄弟合作的精神教育劳动人民的工作，也未给予足够的注意。关于社会主义国家是苏联劳动人民手中争取共产主义胜利的主要武器的问题，无论在口头和文字宣传中，都没有给予充分的阐明。苏联人民忠于苏维埃国家的教育应与人民应具有革命警惕性、遵守劳动纪律和国家法律以及关心公有的社会主义财产的教育紧密联系起来。
    自然科学的宣传是党组织思想工作中的薄弱的一环。
    会议特别尖锐的提出了思想工作与实际生活，与目前共产主义建设的实践任务最紧密联系的必要性的问题。宣传工作、政治鼓动工作、科学和文化机构的活动必须转到向劳动人民阐明苏共中央九月全会决议和党和政府的决议方面去。必须这样提出问题，党组织的思想工作要鼓舞苏维埃人民发挥创造性的劳动，进一步发展社会主义经济之基础的重工业，实际上实现农业高涨的任务，发展轻工业和食品工业，而进一步改善劳动人民物质和文化生活条件就有赖于此。
    与会者的报告和发言引证许多事实说明，在许多场合，我们的宣传员、讲师和鼓动员在进行宣传和鼓动时脱离实际生活和共产主义建设的迫切任务，没有把宣传活动和每个州、每个区、每个企业、每个集体农庄、每个机器拖拉机站、每个国营农场的具体任务联系起来，对工农业先进生产者经验的推广也是软弱无力的。党组织的任务是帮助宣传员和鼓动员研究目前农业生产中的基本问题。关于这些问题的知识可以帮助宣传工作更接近实际生活的要求。
    文化教育机构——文化宫、俱乐部、读书室、图书馆，在阐明苏共中央九月全会决议以及党和政府的决议中起着重要的作用。目前在农村有十万零八千个国家和集体农庄的文化机构、数十万个图书馆。但有许多党组织对于作为劳动人民政治教育的工具之一的文化教育工作的意义是估计不足的。因此，大部分文化宫、俱乐部、读书室软弱无力地执行着自己的任务，对于党和政府决议的宣传停留在很低的思想水平上，以及和目前集体农庄、机器拖拉机站、国营农场的具体事物相脱离的现象，就不是偶然的。新西比尔斯克州、斯摩棱斯克州、库尔斯克州和立陶宛共和国文化教育机构工作中存在着特别严重的缺点。
    在一些州、边疆区和共和国，首先是哈巴洛夫斯克边疆区、萨拉托夫州、梁赞州、唐波夫州、鞑靼自治共和国和摩尔多瓦自治共和国、莫尔达维亚共和国和拉脱维亚共和国对于宣传讲授，尤其是农业知识的宣传，领导得不好。事实表明，农业宣传和在生产中运用科学成就和先进经验仍然没有成为地方党组织和苏维埃机关领导农业生产的不可分割的组成部分。
    与会者指出必须按照对农业有实际帮助的方向更迅速地改造科学机关的工作。在农业生产的实践中，不广泛运用科学成就、技术和先进经验，就不可能有农业的急剧的高涨。国家科学机关必须把研究工作转向贯彻苏共中央九月全会所规定的最重要的任务上去。
    提高一切思想工作的水平——这就意味着永远使思想工作紧密地联系实际生活、联系共产主义建设的实践，把书呆子习气、教条主义和抽象的概念从我们的宣传和鼓动工作中清除出去。教条主义和书呆子习气有害于干部的培养，阻碍他们创造性地理解和顺利地贯彻党的政策。
    会议的报告和发言中着重指出，虽然党教育的思想理论水平有了一般的提高，但是到目前为止，无论在口头宣传和文字宣传中，理论原理的讲述经常脱离具体的历史环境，没有深刻阐明以马克思列宁主义理论武装起来的共产党在社会发展中的改造作用，这种讲述并与党的主要的经济和政治任务相脱离。
    党的宣传工作的质量的提高以及我们的干部和所有共产党员的思想锻炼是和遵守参加党的教育组织的自愿原则分不开的。会议指出：有很多党组织严重地破坏了苏共中央关于严格遵守参加党的教育组织的自愿原则的指示。有人仍旧注意去追求所谓“百分之百地参加”，把全体党员包括在党教育网内。学习小组里包括在早年已学习过好几次的党员们。他们并强迫老年的和残废的共产党员以及多子女的女共产党员参加小组和政治学校学习。有时竟是这样没有常识，党的教育的小组里竟包括有违反他们自己意愿的非党同志。
    会上引证了这样一个例子。住在城中心区的女共产党员申丘高娃同志，她是去年从马克思列宁主义夜大学毕业的。秋天她又在俱乐部开始学习剪裁和缝纫。申丘高娃同志还没有来得及开始研究剪裁和缝纫，就因为没有听这个俱乐部所规定的目前政治形势的课程而被开除了。俱乐部的领导者还向她“说明”：“目前政治形势的课程是剪裁缝纫科里面的一项特别课程。从我们这里毕业出的女裁缝，应当在政治上是成熟的。”申丘高娃同志的理由是她刚刚从马克思列宁主义夜大学毕业。但是这个理由没有起什么作用。热心的行政领导者还让她以“个人的方式”继续在俱乐部外学习剪裁和缝纫。很显然，表现出这样命令压制、粗暴专横的文化机关的这样的“领导者”，只能是由于某种误解他才能占据着这个职位。
    苏共中央收到一些党组织的一些党员的信件。他们在信中叙述他们在马克思列宁主义夜大学和研究苏共党史小组结业之后，又被迫在学习小组和政治学校里学习，并受到如缺席即要受到严厉处分的威胁。去年，机器制造工厂工人、共产党员松佐夫同志因拒绝参加小组学习受到了巴什基里自治共和国布拉高魏新斯基区委会的严厉的警告。松佐夫同志曾在小组里学习过好几年，并已能业余自修，但是区委会不仅不认为这是一个共产党员的合法意愿，反而不公正地处分了他。区州委对党中央委员会关于参加党教育小组的组织要遵守自愿原则的指示是知道很清楚的，但是，直到现在，还没有取消对松佐夫同志的处分。
    例如，苏共维里克鲁克州委会的总结报告就是以形式主义和命令主义的态度对待党的党员教育工作的一个证明。报告中谈到在本学年，党组织中“参加一切学习形式”的党员占全体党员的百分之九十五点六，而在去年是占百分之九十二点三。这两个数字说明了在州里就是尽力设法把比去年更多的共产党员形式主义地强迫参加小组和政治学校。
    党委会应该向党的教育中的行政命令的事实进行坚决的斗争，因为行政命令会扼杀对研究革命学说的浓厚的兴趣。
    会议这样指出：一些党的工作者所以对党员能够在业余自修、阅读和研究马克思列宁主义产生了荒谬的不信任，根本在于他们是以错误的、形式主义—官僚主义的和命令主义的态度对待党的教育工作。党组织的责任就是要使宣传工作进行得有兴趣和引人入胜。
    为此需要提高宣传员和讲师的思想和政治水平，需要选择真正有才能和真正能胜任做宣传员和讲师工作的，并且无时不在注意提高自己业务的同志来做这项工作。
    应该尽力做到使每个共产党员都能有一部，纵然是不多的，关于马克思列宁主义基础书籍的小丛书。需要使共产党员培养起业余自修政治书籍的兴趣。会议指出了组织出版通俗的马克思列宁主义书籍小丛书以及组织在报纸上发表文学作品的介绍目录和书报评介的必要性。
    宣传讲授是有巨大意义的。但是正如同会议上所指出的事实一样，有不少党组织不去注意讲授工作的质量和内容。结果往往给听者以枯燥的、肤浅的和杂乱无章的报告。在讲授宣传中的严重缺点就是脱离该地区和集体农庄的具体情况，脱离生活。
    会上引证了这样一个例子。基洛夫州库曼斯克区党委书记维普洛夫同志向拉明斯克机器拖拉机站的工人们作了关于苏共中央九月全会决议的报告。报告对这个机器拖拉机站的工作中的缺点以及这个机器拖拉机站和他们所服务的农庄的具体任务连一个字都没有提到。不足为奇，在听了这样肤浅的报告之后，是没有人赞成，也没有人向报告者发出任何问题的。
    应该使宣传员、鼓动员和讲师经常地注意，研究农业方面的具体问题，真正掌握农业知识。
    会议强调指出了提高政治鼓动的质量和思想内容、并把它和实际生活与先进经验的宣传更多地联系起来的必要性。
    我们的报刊、文学、艺术、书籍、无线电应当为实现党和政府为提高农业、宣传科学成就和先进工作者的经验的措施服务。
    这次会议强调了对党组织的宣传鼓动工作与苏联最高苏维埃选举密切联系的必要性。
    会议强调了宣传鼓动部门、科学文化部门的一切工作者和我们所有的宣传员、讲师、鼓动员保证党的政治工作的高度水平的特殊责任。党组织的全部思想工作都应该有助于胜利实现我们党所规划的共产主义建设的巨大计划。
