Xinhua News Agency, Rome: Another Italian Christian Democrat, Scelba, has emerged to form a new cabinet. Scelba, colluding with the Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, submitted a list of government members to President Einaudi on the evening of the 10th. According to Reuters, Scelba's government includes fourteen Christian Democrats, four Social Democrats, and three Liberals.

    Scelba served as Minister of the Interior for many years in the Gasperi government preceding the Pella government, and is known for implementing anti-people police repression. After Scelba accepted the task of forming a cabinet, a series of short strikes broke out in major Italian industrial cities to protest.

    Scelba is the second Christian Democrat to be pulled out to try to form a new government after the fall of the Pella government on January 5th. Another Christian Democrat, Fanfani, put together a new government list on January 18th, but his proposed platform of supporting the "European Army" plan and firmly opposing communism failed to gain the support of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies on January 30th, and his government was forced to resign. Scelba is the author of the reactionary electoral law of the Italian general election last year, which stipulates that parties and party groups that receive more than half of the votes can get an additional fifteen percent of the seats. The reactionaries wanted to use this to restrict democratic forces. However, due to the strength of democratic forces in Italy, the ruling Christian Democratic Party exhausted all means but failed to get more than half of the votes, and this electoral law was shamefully bankrupt, and the Gasperi government collapsed.

    意大利天主教民主党人谢尔巴组成新的反动政府
    意各大工业城市举行一连串的抗议罢工
    【新华社讯】罗马消息：意大利又一个天主教民主党人谢尔巴出来组织新内阁。谢尔巴拉拢社会民主党和自由党，于十日晚把一张政府名单提交给总统伊诺第。据路透社消息说，谢尔巴政府中包括十四个天主教民主党人，四个社会民主党人和三个自由党人。
    谢尔巴曾在贝拉政府前任的加斯贝利政府中多年担任内政部长，以实行反人民的警察镇压出名。谢尔巴接受组阁任务后，在意大利各大工业城市即发生了一连串短暂罢工，表示抗议。
    谢尔巴是在上月五日贝拉政府倒台后，第二个被拉出来试组新政府的天主教民主党人。另一个天主教民主党人范范尼曾在上月十八日凑成一个新政府名单，但他提出的一个支持“欧洲军”计划和坚决反共的施政纲领，上月三十日在议会下院表决未能得到议会多数的支持，他的政府也被迫辞职。谢尔巴就是去年意大利大选的反动选举法的作者，这个选举法规定得到过半数选票的政党和政党集团，可以得到额外的百分之十五席位。反动派想借此限制民主力量。但是由于意大利民主力量强大，统治的天主教民主党用尽了各种手段也未能得到过半数选票，这个选举法因而遭到了可耻的破产，加斯贝利政府也就宣告垮台。
