Xinhua News Agency, February 16th dispatch: According to TASS, London, February 15th: February 14th marked the 24th anniversary of the founding of the British "Daily Worker." A commemorative rally was held in London, attended by nearly eight thousand people. Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Hewlett Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury, and J.R. Campbell, editor of "The Daily Worker," all delivered speeches at the meeting.

    All speakers emphasized the important role of "The Daily Worker" as the only newspaper reporting the truth about the world situation to the British people, especially the true situation in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.

Xinhua News Agency, February 16th dispatch: TASS, London, February 15th: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, speaking at a mass rally in London's Harringay Arena on February 14th to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of "The Daily Worker," called on the British people to fully support the peace proposals put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Berlin Conference.

    Pollitt said: The Soviet Union has put forward proposals at this week's Berlin Conference regarding ensuring European security, which is a great contribution to the cause of peace. If these proposals are implemented, it would be a major step forward towards ending the divided state of Europe. This will protect all European countries from any aggression, thus preventing the revival of German militarism and the threat of new Nazi armies.

    Pollitt said that the treaty proposed by Molotov could guarantee the protection of all European countries against aggressors. He pointed out: "Some people insist that there is a danger of Soviet aggression. The Soviet proposals should clearly eliminate this argument. Dulles and the Americans are unwilling to sign such a treaty because it would disrupt their entire plan to invade and advance into progressive European countries."

    Pollitt said that Molotov's proposals for resolving the German question are in the interests of Britain, and therefore the British people should welcome such proposals. "Only those who are aggressive by nature, determined to maintain the divided state of Germany, and to rearm West Germany as part of an aggressive bloc against the Soviet Union, would oppose these proposals."

    Pollitt called on the British people to reaffirm their national independence and liberate themselves from American control.

    Pollitt pointed out that the United States is suffering from the threat of economic decline, while in the Soviet Union, the standard of living has been rising. The proposal by Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Kabanov for the exchange of goods worth 400 million pounds between Britain and the Soviet Union has opened up broad prospects for Britain. All restrictions on British-Soviet trade must be lifted.

    Speaking of the large number of American troops stationed on British territory, Pollitt said that they threatened Britain's security. He demanded that they be sent back home.

Xinhua News Agency, February 16th dispatch: TASS, Paris, February 15th: Provincial farmers' representative conferences were held in many French cities on February 13th and 14th. According to "L'Humanité," at the farmers' representative conference in Brévands, Loir-et-Cher, presided over by the socialist and provincial council member Cottambert, all five hundred representatives jointly wrote a petition to French Foreign Minister Bidault.

    The petition stated: "At the Berlin Conference, proposals have been put forward that may democratically resolve the German question and eliminate the possibility of the revival of German militarism. In order to ease international tensions and establish international friendship – which is a necessary condition for the prosperity of our agriculture – we ask you to support the proposal to conclude a ‘pan-European treaty guaranteeing collective European security.’"

    Similar petitions were also passed at the farmers' representative conferences held in Tours, Indre-et-Loire, and Tarbes, Hautes-Pyrénées.

    All farmers' representative conferences firmly opposed the establishment of the so-called "European Defence Community."

    伦敦举行集会纪念“工人日报”创刊二十四周年

    法国农民要求法政府支持苏联关于保障欧洲安全的建议
    【新华社十六日讯】　据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：二月十四日是英国“工人日报”创刊二十四周年，伦敦举行了纪念大会，参加大会的将近八千人。英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特、坎特伯雷教长休勒特·约翰逊和“工人日报”编辑杰·坎贝尔都在会上发表了演说。
    所有发言的人都强调指出“工人日报”作为向英国人民报道世界局势的真相，特别是关于苏联和人民民主国家的真情实况的唯一报纸的重要作用。
    【新华社十六日讯】　塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：英国共产党总书记哈里·波立特二月十四日在伦敦哈陵格体育馆举行的庆祝“工人日报”创刊二十四周年的群众集会上发表演说，号召英国人民全力支持苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在柏林会议上提出的和平建议。
    波立特说：苏联在本星期的柏林会议上提出了关于保障欧洲安全的建议，这是对和平事业极伟大的贡献。如果把这些建议付诸实施，那就是向终止欧洲分裂状态前进了一大步。这将保障一切欧洲国家免受任何侵略，这样就可以防止德国军国主义复活以及新的纳粹军队的威胁。
    波立特说，莫洛托夫所建议的条约可以保证保护一切欧洲国家，抵抗侵略者。他指出：“有些人硬说有苏联发动侵略的危险。苏联的建议应该可以干干净净地消除这种论调了。杜勒斯和美国人不愿意签订这种条约，因为这样将打乱他们的侵略欧洲进步国家的全部计划。”
    波立特说，莫洛托夫关于解决德国问题的建议是符合英国的利益的，因此英国人民应当欢迎这样的建议。“只有那些侵略成性、决心维持德国的分裂状态、并重新武装德国西部成为反对苏联的侵略集团的一部分的人才会反对这些建议。”
    波立特号召英国人民重申民族独立的主张，把自己从美国的控制下解放出来。
    波立特指出美国正遭受经济跌落的威胁，而在苏联，生活水平却一直在上升。苏联对外贸易部部长卡巴诺夫提出英国和苏联交换价值四亿英镑的货物的建议，为英国开辟了广阔的前途。必须取消对于英苏贸易的一切限制。
    波立特在谈到在英国领土上驻扎着大批美军的情况时说，他们威胁着英国的安全。他要求把他们送回国去。
    【新华社十六日讯】　塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：二月十三日和十四日，法国许多城市举行了省农民代表大会。据“人道报”报道，在罗亚—舍尔省的布勒瓦，由社会党人、省议会议员科塔姆伯主持的农民代表大会上，全体五百名代表联名写给法国外交部长皮杜尔一份请愿书。
    请愿书中说：“在柏林会议上，已提出了可能以民主方式解决德国问题和消除德国军国主义复活的可能性的建议。为了缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际友好关系——这是繁荣我们农业的必要条件——我们要求你支持缔结一个‘保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约’的建议。”
    在昂德尔—罗亚尔省的都尔与上比利牛斯省的塔布举行的农民代表大会也通过了类似的请愿书。
    所有农民代表大会都坚决反对成立所谓“欧洲防务集团”。
