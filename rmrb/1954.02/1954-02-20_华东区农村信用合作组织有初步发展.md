Rural credit cooperative organizations in the East China region have seen initial development. By the end of last December, the region had 2,644 credit mutual aid groups, 395 credit cooperatives, and 15 credit departments within supply and marketing cooperatives, with nearly 350,000 members.

Due to the effective organization and adjustment of idle rural funds by credit cooperative organizations, the production and living difficulties of some farmers have been resolved. To date, credit cooperative organizations in various areas have absorbed 7 billion yuan in farmer deposits (this is the balance between farmer deposits and withdrawals) and have issued 14.8 billion yuan in loans (including loans from banks). Among these, loans aimed at helping farmers solve agricultural production difficulties constitute the largest proportion.

Credit cooperative organizations also promptly provided loans to help farmers overcome difficulties in sideline production and living. In Beibao Township, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, which suffered from natural disasters, the credit cooperative issued 8.52 million yuan in loans, resolving the shortage of seeds for 423 mu of land. At the same time, it also provided sideline production loans to more than 100 households with labor but lacking funds, helping them overcome the disaster.

The development of rural credit cooperative organizations has effectively combatted the activities of usurers and protected the interests of farmers. In Longmen Township, Tongling County, Anhui Province, farmers in the past had no choice but to pre-sell rice to speculative grain merchants at low prices during the lean season, with each dan of rice being exploited by 15,000 yuan. Since the establishment of credit cooperative organizations, farmers are no longer subjected to this exploitation.

After receiving education on the general line, farmers in various areas have further recognized the benefits of credit cooperatives and have requested to join them. The Shajing Township Credit Cooperative in Changle County, Fujian Province, has grown to 320 shares, an increase of 35 shares compared to when it was established in August last year. In Shanggao Township, Tai'an County, Shandong Province, fourteen credit mutual aid groups were expanded into a credit cooperative in December of last year, and an additional 482 members were developed.

    华东区农村信用合作组织有初步发展
    华东区农村信用合作组织有了初步发展，到去年十二月底，全区已有信用互助组二千六百四十四个，信用合作社三百九十五个，供销合作社信贷部十五个，组员、社员将近三十五万人。
    由于信用合作组织有效地组织和调剂了农村闲散资金，解决了部分农民生产和生活上的困难。到目前为止，各地信用合作组织共吸收了农民存款七十亿元（此系农民存款数与提出存款数的余额），共放款一百四十八亿元（其中有银行的贷款）。其中，以帮助农民解决农业生产困难的贷款比重最大。
    信用合作组织也及时贷款帮助农民解决副业生产和生活的困难，江苏省盐城县北堡乡受了自然灾害，信用合作社发放了八百五十二万元贷款，解决了四百二十三亩田缺乏种籽的困难；同时，还给一百多户有劳动力缺少资金的困难户以副业贷款，使他们渡过灾害。
    农村信用合作组织的发展，有效地打击了高利贷者的活动，保护了农民的利益。安徽省铜陵县龙门乡的农民在过去青黄不接的时候，只好把稻谷以低价预卖给投机粮商，每担稻谷被剥削一万五千元。自从有了信用合作组织后，农民再也不受这种剥削了。
    各地农民受到总路线的教育后，进一步认识到信用合作社的好处，纷纷要求参加信用合作社。福建省长乐县沙京乡信用合作社，已发展到三百二十股，比去年八月建社时增加了三十五股。山东省泰安县上高乡十四个信贷互助组已于去年十二月间扩大为信用合作社，并又发展了四百八十二个社员。
