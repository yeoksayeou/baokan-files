Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 1st: Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on January 30 regarding the US forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The full text is as follows:

    The US ruling clique continues to pursue shameful military adventures in the Far East, openly undermining the proper resolution of the POW issue, and attempting by every means to use the POW issue to achieve its sinister purpose of sabotaging the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, frantically creating a series of criminal conspiracies in the area south of the Korean Military Demarcation Line.

    The US military authorities, under the guise of the United Nations, recently mobilized their armed forces to forcibly seize more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC), handing them over to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs, and creating the crime of illegally and forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who must be repatriated.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a serious protest in its statement of January 10, 1954, against this action being planned by the US. However, the US military authorities shamelessly carried out this destructive plan, flagrantly violating the Armistice Agreement. Therefore, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea authorizes me to express serious concern about this serious situation caused by the unilateral and provocative actions of the US, and to lodge a serious protest against it.

    On June 18, 1953, when the Korean Armistice was about to be reached, the US had already illegally "released" more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war, handing them over to the Syngman Rhee gang for forced detention. Now, the US has taken the illegal measure of forcibly detaining more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that these plans by the US are a serious violation of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, which stipulates the rapid repatriation of prisoners of war, and the Korean Military Armistice Agreement signed by the belligerent parties, and expresses its firm protest and condemnation.

    Such planning by the US is one of the most shameful crimes that the US ruling clique has been carrying out for a long time, with the aim of illegally handling the POW issue, sabotaging the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and continuing to maintain tension in the Far East and the world. As a result of such planning, the situation in Korea has become more serious and tense. The US ruling clique must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by this criminal planning at all times.

    The US has always attempted to use the POW issue to achieve its goal of delaying the realization of the armistice, causing this issue to become one of the most complex issues in the Korean armistice negotiations. However, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly clarified to world public opinion its just position on a reasonable solution to the POW issue, and has made consistent efforts to this end. The statements issued by the Korean and Chinese sides on March 30 and March 31, 1953, respectively, promoted the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war and the resumption of the armistice negotiations, which had been unilaterally interrupted by the US, thereby enabling an agreement to be reached on the "Agreement on the Repatriation of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War" and the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." The Korean and Chinese sides, disregarding the US's wanton actions to sabotage this bilateral agreement, insisted on sincere efforts to achieve the armistice. Due to these sincere efforts by the Korean and Chinese sides, the support of the people of the world, and the continued military failures of the US military on the front lines, the US had no choice but to sign the Korean Military Armistice Agreement.

    As is well known, according to the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War and the Korean Military Armistice Agreement concluded by the belligerent parties, prisoners of war should be treated humanely and should be given all possible conditions for prompt repatriation after the armistice. The US ignored all of this and brutally trampled on this legitimate principle. Because Korean and Chinese prisoners of war demanded the treatment stipulated by the Geneva Convention, the US subjected them to various atrocities, and under the pretext of so-called "voluntary repatriation," implemented forced "screening," committing unprecedented bestial atrocities against prisoners of war who demanded repatriation. The US military authorities violated international regulations and human conscience regarding prisoners of war, not only massacring large numbers of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the most brutal and vicious means, but also using prisoners of war as experimental subjects for medicine and weapons performance. Therefore, the prisoner of war camps managed by the US military authorities are universally recognized as death camps. This is by no means accidental.

    Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, in this tragic situation, rose up to resist the inhuman atrocities of the US military authorities. The famous Koje Island Incident, as well as a series of incidents in other POW camps in which prisoners of war resisted the abuse of the US military authorities, clearly demonstrated how brutally the US military authorities' treatment of prisoners of war violated the Geneva Convention and how frantically they sought to undermine the achievement of the Korean armistice. The bestial atrocities committed by the US military authorities against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war have left an unprecedented and most shameful mark in the history of world war.

    After the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the US military authorities continued to take despicable actions to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. After the prisoners of war who had not been directly repatriated were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) for supervision in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, the US continued to control and oppress Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, manipulating special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to subject prisoners of war who demanded repatriation to cruel abuse and violence.

    Not only that, but the US also undermined the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," continued to obstruct the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and illegally hindered the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides to the prisoners of war. As a result, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides, which should have started on September 25, did not begin until October 15. After the explanation work began, it had to be interrupted due to the sabotage of the US. From October 15 to December 23, that is, until the US unilaterally announced the termination of the explanation work, the Korean and Chinese sides only conducted ten days of explanation work during the ninety-day explanation period, and more than 85 percent of the prisoners of war were deprived of the right to hear the explanation. As mentioned above, the illegal acts committed by the US in the POW camps south of the Military Demarcation Line were truthfully exposed in the "Interim Report" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on December 28, 1953; at the same time, the public trial of the special agents of the Syngman Rhee gang who bestially murdered Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the Indian Military Tribunal, and the series of facts that many Korean and Chinese prisoners of war demanded repatriation and return to our side at the time when the US forcibly seized the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by violence, more clearly revealed it.

    In view of the above-mentioned serious situation, Marshal Kim Il Sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and General Peng Dehuai, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteers, put forward the most just solution to the current POW issue in their letter to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on January 19, 1954. However, due to the illegal planning of the US, Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were deprived of the right to repatriation and forcibly detained.

    It must be pointed out that under the threat of the US military authorities, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did not seriously exercise the legitimate powers conferred by the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" during the supervision of prisoners of war, and disregarded the just attitude of the Polish and Czechoslovak members, but tolerated the unjust attitude of the Swiss and Swedish members, and did not properly perform its duties.

    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in accordance with the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" signed by the belligerent parties, issued the "Announcement to All Prisoners of War" and the "Statement on Working Conditions," formulated the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," and issued the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," etc. The Korean and Chinese sides believe that these documents of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission are basically justified, and at the same time, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has made considerable efforts in performing its duties. However, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on the most important issue of properly resolving the POW issue in accordance with the "Scope of Authority," failed to disregard the opposition and threats of the US, but instead showed submission, thus enabling the US to seize Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that this measure of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is unsatisfactory and expresses great regret.

    The warmongers of the US ruling clique continue to pursue military adventures in Korea, the Far East, and around the world in order to maintain international tension, expand armaments, and brutally violate the Korean Military Armistice Agreement and undermine the proper resolution of the POW issue, proceeding from the sinister aim of ensuring the predatory maximum profits of US monopoly capitalists. This series of actions has deepened the tension in Korea. These criminal actions of the US have aroused great anger among the Korean and Chinese people against the US rulers, and have made the voices of uneasiness and condemnation against the consistent war policy and aggressive attempts pursued by US imperialism even louder among the just public opinion of the world that supports the Korean and Chinese people.

    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea maintains that the US bears the full and serious responsibility for recovering all the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained from June 18 to 22, 1953, and the more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained this time, and for providing an explanation to the Korean and Chinese sides. We also reserve the right to submit this issue to the Korean political conference and other relevant international conferences for discussion. As long as the US does not recover all the forcibly detained Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, no matter where these prisoners of war are detained, and no matter when the political conference is held, we will never give up continuing to investigate this crime of the US.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in line with its consistent policy of justly resolving the Korean issue on the basis of mutual consultation, firmly advocates the prompt convening of a higher-level political conference, taking just measures for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and easing tensions in the Far East and the world, and will continue to make sincere efforts to reconvene the bilateral talks on the issue of a political conference.

    The US has never shown a sincere attitude towards our just demands in the past, and it still does not show a sincere attitude now. The US has not shown any sincerity in fundamentally resolving the Korean issue on the basis of mutual consultation, and continues to stall.

    The governments of Korea and China issued separate statements on January 9 and 10, 1954, advocating the prompt resumption of the bilateral talks on the Korean political conference issue, which were interrupted on December 12, 1953, due to the unilateral withdrawal of the US representative from the meeting. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese representatives to the bilateral talks also proposed that a meeting of the liaison secretaries of both sides be held immediately to resume the bilateral talks. Due to these sincere efforts by the Korean and Chinese sides, the meeting of the liaison secretaries of both sides was held on January 14, 1954. However, the US, like in the bilateral talks, stubbornly insisted on a series of unreasonable demands at the meeting of the liaison secretaries of both sides, obstructing the resumption of the bilateral talks and making it impossible to take appropriate measures to convene a Korean political conference and peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

    Even so, in order to satisfy the desire of peace-loving people around the world to promptly convene a Korean political conference, the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently shown patience with this insincere stalling tactic of the US and have suggested that the bilateral talks be resumed on February 1, 1954. The Korean and Chinese sides also stated that they are willing to carefully consider any suggestions from the US for resuming the bilateral talks. Therefore, whether the bilateral talks can be resumed in the future depends on whether the US is sincere.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that if the United Nations is willing to genuinely resolve the Korean issue peacefully on the basis of consultation and ease international tensions, then it is necessary to immediately urge the resumption of the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly to review the current serious situation in Korea. The US ruling clique, fearing that its own criminal acts will be exposed to the people of the world, is doing its utmost to obstruct the United Nations from taking such measures in order to hinder the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the easing of international tensions. Therefore, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea advocates that the governments of all member states of the United Nations should carry out a more resolute struggle to enable the United Nations to correctly carry out this urgent task facing it, and at the same time, firmly advocates that representatives of the governments of Korea and China must participate in the discussion when the United Nations General Assembly discusses the Korean issue. Promptly easing the international tensions caused by the US ruling clique continuing to pursue aggressive military adventures in Korea, the Far East, and around the world has now become the most urgent demand of peace-loving people around the world. This just demand can only be realized by convening a conference of the five major powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the People's Republic of China to examine and resolve the current urgent international issues through mutual consultation. Therefore, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully supports and endorses the proposal made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Berlin Conference on January 26, 1954, "on measures to ease international tensions and convene a conference of the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China."

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is confident that in its struggle to oppose the US's forced detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Korea and to promote the prompt convening of a higher-level political conference to promote the just resolution of the Korean issue in order to ease tensions in the Far East and the world, it will receive the active support and solidarity of progressive mankind around the world.

    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日发表声明
    严重抗议美方强迫扣留朝中战俘
    【新华社平壤一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日一月三十日发表关于美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的声明。全文如下：
    美国统治集团继续在远东追求着可耻的军事冒险，公然破坏战俘问题的正当解决，并千方百计地企图利用战俘问题达到其破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决的险恶目的，在朝鲜军事分界线以南地区疯狂地制造了一系列的罪恶阴谋。
    挂着联合国招牌的美国军事当局最近动员自己的武装力量，强行劫夺在中立国遣返委员会看管下的二万一千九百余名朝中战俘，把他们押交李承晚、蒋介石匪帮，制造了非法强迫扣留必须予以遣返的朝中战俘的罪行。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九五四年一月十日的声明中，曾提出了严重的抗议，反对美方策划着的这种行动。然而，美国军事当局仍无耻地进行这种破坏计划，横暴地违反了停战协定。为此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府授权本人，对由于美方的片面、挑衅行动而造成的此种严重的局势表示郑重的关心，并对此提出严重的抗议。
    一九五三年六月十八日，在朝鲜停战将要达成的时候，美方已经非法地“释放”了二万七千余名我方战俘，把他们交给李承晚匪帮，加以强迫扣留。现在，美方又采取了强迫扣留二万一千九百余名朝中战俘的非法措施。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为美方的这些策划是对规定迅速遣返战俘的关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约和交战双方签订的朝鲜军事停战协定的严重违反，并表示坚决抗议和谴责。
    美方这样的策划，是美国统治集团在很久以前就已开始进行的最可耻的罪恶之一，目的在于非法处理战俘问题，破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决，继续保持远东和世界的紧张局势。由于这样的策划，朝鲜的局势已更形严重而紧张。对于这种罪恶的策划所引起的严重后果，美国统治集团在任何时候都必须负起完全的责任。
    美方一向企图利用战俘问题达到其拖延停战实现的目的，致使这个问题在朝鲜停战谈判中成为最复杂的问题之一。但是，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已屡次向全世界舆论阐明了合理解决战俘问题的公正立场，同时，并为此而作了始终如一的努力。朝中方面在一九五三年三月三十日和三月三十一日分别发表的声明，促进了病伤战俘的交换和被美方片面中断了的停战谈判的恢复，从而使关于遣返病伤被俘人员协定和“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”达成了协议。朝中方面不顾美方肆意破坏这种双方协议的行动，坚持了实现停战的真诚努力。由于朝中方面这种真诚的努力和全世界人民的支持以及美军在前线继续遭到的军事失败，美方不得不在朝鲜军事停战协定上签了字。
    如所周知，根据关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约和交战双方所缔结的朝鲜军事停战协定，战俘应该受到人道主义的待遇，在停战后应得到迅速被遣返的一切可能的条件。美方无视这一切，而横暴地蹂躏了这一正当的原则。由于朝中方面战俘要求得到根据日内瓦公约所规定的待遇，美方对他们横施种种暴行，在所谓“自愿遣返”的藉口下，实施强迫“甄别”，对要求遣返的战俘制造了前所未闻的野兽暴行。美国军事当局违反了有关战俘的国际法规和人类良心，不仅用最残暴、最毒辣的手段大量屠杀了朝中战俘，而且把战俘当作医学和武器性能的实验对象。因而美国军事当局所管理的战俘营，被全世界公认为死亡营。这绝不是偶然的事情。
    朝中战俘在这种悲惨处境中，奋起反抗美国军事当局惨无人道的暴行。著名的巨济岛杜德事件，以及在其他许多战俘营中发生的反抗美国军事当局虐待战俘的一连串的事件，都明白地表现了美国军事当局对战俘的待遇是如何横暴地违犯了日内瓦公约，它为了破坏朝鲜停战的达成是多么疯狂。美国军事当局对朝中战俘所施行的野兽暴行，在世界战争史上留下了史无前例的最可耻的烙印。
    美国军事当局在停战协定签订以后仍继续采取阻挠战俘遣返的卑劣行动。在根据停战协定、把未直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，美方仍对朝中战俘继续实行控制和压迫，操纵李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务分子，对要求遣返的战俘横施残酷的虐杀和暴力。
    不仅如此，美方并破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”，继续妨碍中立国遣返委员会的工作，非法地阻挠朝中方面对战俘的解释工作。结果，使必须从九月二十五日开始的朝中方面的解释工作，从十月十五日才开始。解释工作开始以后，又由于美方的破坏而不得不中断。从十月十五日到十二月二十三日，即至美方片面宣布终止解释工作时为止，朝中方面在九十天的解释期间中只进行了十天的解释工作，百分之八十五以上的战俘被剥夺了听取解释的权利。如上所述，美方在军事分界线以南的战俘营中所进行的非法行为，在中立国遣返委员会一九五三年十二月二十八日的“临时报告”中也如实地被揭露了；同时印度军事法庭对野兽般的杀害朝中战俘的李承晚匪帮特务分子的公审，和正在美方以暴力强迫劫夺在中立国遣返委员会看管下的朝中战俘的当时，许多朝中战俘要求遣返、回到我方来的一连串的事实，更加清楚地揭露了它。
    根据上述的严重局势，朝鲜人民军最高司令官金日成元帅和中国人民志愿军司令员彭德怀将军在一九五四年一月十九日写给中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军的信里，提出了对目前战俘问题最正当的解决方策。但是，由于美方的非法策划，朝中战俘被剥夺了遣返的权利而被强迫扣留了。
    必须指出：中立国遣返委员会在美国军事当局的威胁下，在看管战俘期间，没有认真行使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所赋予的正当职权，并无视波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员的公正态度，而容许瑞士、瑞典委员们的不公正态度，没有正当地执行自己的职务。
    中立国遣返委员会，根据交战双方所签订的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，公布了“给全体战俘的公告”和“关于工作情况的声明”，制定了“解释和访问工作细则”，发表了“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”等。朝中方面认为，中立国遣返委员会的这些文件基本上是正当的，同时，中立国遣返委员会在执行自己的职务上，作了不小的努力。但是，中立国遣返委员会在按照“职权范围”正当解决战俘问题的最重要的问题上，未能不顾美方的反对和威胁，而相反地表现了屈服，因而使美方得以劫夺朝中战俘。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，对于中立国遣返委员会的这种措施是不能满意的，并表示很大的遗憾。
    美国统治集团的好战分子们，在朝鲜和远东以及世界各地，继续追求着军事冒险，以保持国际紧张局势，扩张军备，并从保证美国垄断资本家们的掠夺性的最大利润的凶恶目的出发，横暴地违反了朝鲜军事停战协定，破坏了战俘问题的正当解决。这一连串的行动，已使朝鲜的紧张局势加深。美方的这种罪恶行动，已激起了朝中人民对美国统治者的极大愤怒，并使支持朝中人民的全世界公正舆论，对美帝国主义所追求着的一贯的战争政策和侵略企图的不安和谴责的呼声更加高涨。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国主张：美方对于一九五三年六月十八日到二十二日被强迫扣留的两万七千余名朝中战俘和这次又被强迫扣留的两万一千九百余名朝中战俘在任何时候都负有全部追回、并向朝中方面提出交代的严重责任。我们并保留把这个问题提交朝鲜政治会议及其他有关国际会议讨论的权利。只要美方不追回被强迫扣留的全部朝中战俘，不论这些战俘被扣留在什么地方，并且不论政治会议何时召开，我们绝不放弃对美方这种罪行继续进行追究。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府本着在互相协商的基础上正当地解决朝鲜问题的一贯政策，坚决主张迅速召开高一级的政治会议、采取和平解决朝鲜问题的公正措施、以缓和远东和世界的紧张局势，并将为重新召开关于政治会议问题的双方会谈而继续作真诚的努力。
    美方对于我方的这样正当的主张，过去从未表现过诚实的态度，现在仍未表现诚实的态度，美方迄未表示在互相协商的基础上根本解决朝鲜问题的诚意，而继续怠工。
    朝中两国政府已在一九五四年一月九日和十日分别发表声明，主张迅速恢复一九五三年十二月十二日由于美方代表片面退出会场而被中断了的关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈。同时，双方会谈的朝中方面代表也提出了为恢复双方会谈而立即举行双方联络秘书会议的建议。由于朝中方面这种真诚的努力，双方联络秘书会议才于一九五四年一月十四日召开。但是，美方像在双方会谈中一样，在双方联络秘书会议上也固执着一连串的无理要求，阻挠双方会谈的恢复，使之不可能采取召开朝鲜政治会议与和平解决朝鲜问题的适当措施。
    虽然如此，为了满足全世界爱好和平人民要求迅速召开朝鲜政治会议的愿望，朝中方面对于美方的这种没有诚意的怠工伎俩一贯表现了忍耐性，并建议在一九五四年二月一日恢复双方会谈。朝中方面并声明，对于美方为恢复双方会谈的任何建议都愿意加以慎重的考虑。因此，今后双方会谈能否恢复，就在于美方有无诚意了。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：如果联合国愿意真正在协商的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题、缓和国际紧张局势的话，那么，就有必要立即促使第八届联合国大会复会，以审查目前朝鲜的严重局势。美国统治集团害怕在全世界人民面前暴露它自己的罪恶行为，它为了妨碍朝鲜问题的和平解决和国际紧张局势的缓和，正在竭力阻挠联合国采取这种措施。因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府主张：联合国各会员国政府应该进行更加坚决的斗争，以使联合国正确执行它所面临的这种紧急任务，同时，并坚决主张：在联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题时必须有朝中两国政府的代表参加讨论。迅速缓和由于美国统治集团在朝鲜和远东以及世界各地继续追求侵略性的军事冒险而造成的国际紧张局势，现在已成为全世界爱好和平人民最迫切的要求。这一正当的要求，只有召开苏联、美国、英国、法国、中华人民共和国五大国会议，以相互的协商对当前迫切的国际问题加以审查和解决，才能实现。因此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府完全支持和赞同苏联莫洛托夫外长一九五四年一月二十六日在柏林会议上所提出的“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”的建议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府确信：在自己为反对美方在朝鲜进行的对朝中战俘的强迫扣留和为迅速召开高一级政治会议，促进朝鲜问题的正当解决，以缓和远东和世界的紧张局势的斗争中，将受到全世界进步人类的积极支持和声援。
