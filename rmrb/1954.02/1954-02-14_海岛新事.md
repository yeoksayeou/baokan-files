	New Happenings on the Island
	Gao Yuan
	This is a small island in the sea, narrow and long, like a carrying pole lying across the ocean.

	The company I visited was stationed at the end of this island. One afternoon, the headquarters called, saying the film projection team was coming and there would be a movie that night.

	Upon hearing this news, the soldiers were overjoyed. The duty platoon leader spoke to the first squad leader, who grabbed his hat and turned to run out.

	The troops set off in formation. When we reached the village entrance, it was already full of people, men, women, old, and young, all dressed in new clothes, as if they were going to a temple fair. In the crowd, I saw the first squad leader gesturing and talking about something. Oh! Suddenly I understood, the platoon leader had asked him to specifically inform the villagers to come and watch the movie together.

	"It's thirty or forty li from here to the headquarters' location. Where will these villagers stay at night, travelling such a long distance?" I thought.

	Everyone walked forward, and the first squad leader would run over to greet people at each household. The crowd behind us continued to grow. They chatted happily along the way. In their conversations, I kept hearing the phrase "visiting relatives." I thought, maybe they were taking advantage of the movie to visit relatives at the front of the island and could stay at their relatives' homes for the night, killing two birds with one stone.

	At noon, soldiers stationed in the central part of the island ran to welcome the villagers. Some were helping the elderly grandmothers, and others were carrying children on their backs, as if they were receiving their own family members. Under the shelters outside their barracks, they had prepared cool tea, washing water, and a hearty lunch. The villagers were at ease as if they were in their own homes, without any restraint.

	After resting, we continued to walk forward. More and more villagers joined us, and they greeted each other almost exclusively with: "Going to visit relatives?" "Yes! Let's go together." At this point, I couldn't help but wonder, it's clearly to watch a movie! Why does everyone say "visiting relatives"? Do so many people have relatives at the front of the island? Have they all not seen each other for many years? Or is today some kind of "visiting relatives festival"?

	In the evening, we arrived at our destination. The headquarters' drill ground was already full of people, with only a space in the middle left empty, undoubtedly reserved for these distinguished guests who had come from afar.

	Before the movie started, I saw a group of soldiers coming out of the barracks, each carrying several quilts and heading down the mountain. "What's this for?" I asked a comrade beside me. He smiled and said, "Don't you even know that? The villagers have come from afar to watch the movie and can't go back at night, so we're preparing places for them to sleep. Otherwise, why would the villagers call watching a movie 'visiting relatives'?" Ah! So that's what "visiting relatives" means. At that moment, my comrade beside me was still saying something, but I couldn't hear it clearly. I was just pondering the vivid and profound meaning of the words "visiting relatives." I remember when I was a child, my grandmother once sent word for me to go to her village to watch a local opera. The opera went late into the night, and I couldn't return, so I stayed at her house. My grandmother's care made me feel so warm and close! So much so that I couldn't forget it for a long time afterward. In the past, something that could only happen among the closest relatives, is now happening between our island troops and the fishermen.

    海岛新事
    高源
    这儿是海上的一个小岛，这个岛又窄又长，像条扁担横在大海里。
    我去的那个连，就住在这个岛的尾部。这天半晌午时，前头指挥部打来了电话：说放映队来了，晚上有电影。
    一听到这消息，战士们个个都欢天喜地。值星排长对一班长说了些什么，一班长抓起帽子扭头就往外跑。
    部队整队出发了，当我们走到村口的时候，那里已站满了人，男的，女的，老的，小的，而且都穿上了新衣服，好像是到什么地方去赶庙似的。在人群中我看见一班长正指手划脚的在讲什么，噢！忽然我明白了，原来排长是要他专门来通知老乡们一道去看电影的。
      “从这儿到指挥部驻地，要有三四十里，这老远的路老乡们晚上在那里歇呢？”我这样想。
    大家向前走着，一有人家，一班长就跑过去招呼。后面群众的队伍，不断在增加。一路上他们高兴地谈笑着。从他们谈笑当中，我老是听到“走亲戚”这几个字眼，我当时想：可能他们都是趁着看电影到岛前头去看亲戚的吧，晚上就可以住在亲戚家里，这倒是一举两得的事。
    晌午了，驻守在岛中部的战士跑来迎接老乡，有的扶着老大娘，有的替老乡背着孩子，像是接待自己的亲人一样。在他们营房外边的凉棚下面，还准备好了凉茶，洗脸水和丰盛的午餐，老乡们就像到了自己家里一样随便，没有一点拘束。
    休息后继续往前走，老乡越来越多，而且他们见面时几乎都是这样招呼：“走亲戚去吗？”“是呀！咱们一块走吧。”这时，我不禁奇怪起来，明明是去看电影嘛！为什么都说是“走亲戚”呢？难道这么多的人全都在岛前头有亲戚？全都是多年不见面了吗？再不，就是今天是个什么“走亲戚的节日”。
    傍晚，到了目的地。指挥部的操场上已坐满了人，只有中间一块地方还在空着，不用说，这是留给这些远道而来的贵宾们的。
    在电影开演以前，我看见从营房里出来一群战士，每人扛着好几床被子向山下走去。“这是干什么？”我问身边的一个同志。他笑着说：“你连这也不知道呀？老乡们远道来看电影，夜里回不去，那是给他们准备睡处去了。要不，老乡们怎么把看电影起名叫‘走亲戚’呢？……”啊！原来“走亲戚”是这么回事。此刻，我身边的那个战士还跟我说了些什么，我已听不清了，我只沉思着“走亲戚”这三个字的生动而深刻的含意。记得我在童年时，有一次外祖母捎话来，要我到她村里去看社戏，戏看到夜深，回不来就住在她家里，外祖母对我的照料使我感到多么亲切和温暖啊！以至事后很久还不能忘怀。过去只有在最近的亲人当中才能有的事，如今在我们岛上的部队和渔民之间发生了。（附图片）
