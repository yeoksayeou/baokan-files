    A Common Peasant Woman's Vote
    Wang Li
    Southwest of Shanghai is Songjiang County. Southeast of Songjiang County town, along the Huangpu River, lies a village called Central Village. The village is scattered along a small stream, with houses hidden among clumps of bamboo forests. A long stone bridge stands in the center of the village. East of the stone bridge is called Wangjia浜 (Wang Family Creek).

    According to the elders, this vast expanse of fertile land was originally reclaimed by the peasants. However, once the wasteland was cultivated into ripe fields, the landlords colluded with the government to seize the land. From then on, "Thousands of families by the riverbank, autumn wind and rain, no candles at night." It wasn't until after Liberation that the peasants of Wangjia浜 were able to stand up.

    Here, one can see the beautiful scenery of Jiangnan throughout the twelve months of the year. An ancient folk poet once wrote:

    In the first month in Songjiang, the spring waters are fresh, wheat seedlings and shepherd's purse are as green as smoke;
    In the second month in Songjiang, swallows fly, broad beans bloom and bamboo shoots are plump;
    In the third month in Songjiang, the dove rains clear, every family plants willows for Qingming;
    In the fourth month in Songjiang, the plum rains are plentiful, new rice seedlings quickly form clumps;
    In the fifth month in Songjiang, the rice grows tall, weeding in the sun, sweat pouring like paste;
    In the sixth month in Songjiang, the water fills the banks, soybeans and spring seedlings are of equal height;
    In the seventh month in Songjiang, the wind gradually cools, cotton is snowy white, and the rice flowers are fragrant;
    In the eighth month in Songjiang, waves crash against the sky, melon vines crawl all over the bamboo fences;
    In the ninth month in Songjiang, frost-covered trees remain, the moon shines on reeds, autumn water is cold;
    In the tenth month in Songjiang, threshing grounds are built everywhere, rice stacks around the ground are denser than walls;
    In the eleventh month in Songjiang, high nets are hung, tall reeds and slender bamboos reflect the fishermen's homes;
    In the twelfth month in Songjiang, the north wind blows, snowflakes flutter with the winter plum blossoms.

    The lotus flowers were fragrant. The pumpkins were ripe. One hot summer day last year, the sun was already setting, and thousands of clouds in the sky shone on the river sand. A southeast wind blew, the bamboo leaves rustled, and people felt a refreshing coolness.

    Peasants walked out of the big bamboo forest west of the stone bridge in groups. Old and young alike were wearing new clothes, their faces beaming with joy. The young people hummed a song: "Flowers bloom beautifully when planted with our own hands, fruits are sweet when trees are planted with our own hands. The flowers of democracy bloom all over the sky, and happy lives last for ten thousand years." They were surrounding a tall man with a purplish-red face, thick lips, and broad shoulders. This was the newly elected people's representative, Gu Ronggen. Before Liberation, he led the peasants in resisting rent; two years ago, he was the chairman of the peasant association who led the peasants of the whole township in the land reform; now he is the vice-chairman of the village's agricultural production cooperative, a Communist Party member with a firm stance and an amiable attitude. At the election meeting that day, over 98% of the two hundred and twenty-eight voters in the entire electoral district voted for him.

    Among the crowd was an ordinary middle-aged peasant woman. Small stature, a reddish-black square face, big eyes, a wide mouth, her hair in a bun. Half a lifetime of hardship had etched deep wrinkles on her face. Her name was Wang Xiuzhen. To cast this vote, she had tossed and turned sleeplessly for several nights. She thought from ancient times to the present, from bitterness to sweetness, from branch to root. She understood that she must cast this vote carefully to express her love for the new China. She counted the capable people in the village from the east to the west, and then from the west to the east, truly "choosing the best from the best," she was determined to elect Gu Ronggen.

    Wang Xiuzhen's wish was fulfilled when the person she voted for was elected. She walked out of the election meeting hall, still holding her voter registration card in her hand. She looked at it carefully as she walked. In the center of the voter registration card, her name was written, and she could see each stroke clearly. Next to her name was a large red stamp. Wang Xiuzhen felt sweetness from her heart to the soles of her feet, and she couldn't help but recall countless past events.

    In the old society, she, the daughter of a poor tenant farmer, had never used her own name. Her mother died when she was nine years old. Her father couldn't bear to marry her off, so he found a young hired worker to be her live-in son-in-law. For more than forty years, she had never left this poor home. At that time, no one considered women as people, saying "A broken pot is not a pot, a woman is not a person," "Cow dung does not enrich the fields, a woman's words are not worth hearing," believing that women should only live their lives around the cooking stove.

    Under the old regime, for the tenant farmers of Central Village, not only were women not considered people, but men were not either. Truly, sweat and blood were worth less than water, and human life was worth less than grass. The government offices were all opened by the landlords, and the landlords and officials wore the same pants. Every year when they demanded rent and taxes, they were relentlessly pressing: in front were the landlord's lackeys, and behind them were the Bao-chiefs. If the peasants couldn't pay the rent, they would bring a group of starving people from the "Old People's Hall" in Songjiang County into the village, eating the food they found in the peasants' homes, taking the things they found, and smashing what was difficult to take; if they still couldn't pay, they would arrest the "criminals" and take them to the government office. In the Qing Dynasty, they were paraded in the streets with wooden cangues; during the "Republic of China," they were subjected to torture and beatings. Generation after generation, many diligent and simple peasants in Central Village were forced onto three paths: imprisonment, fleeing famine, and hanging. This very ordinary peasant woman, her life experience made her truly understand that political power is called "the handle of a knife." The new regime's "handle of a knife" is held in her own hands. In order to hold this "handle of a knife" firmly, she must cast her sacred vote according to her own will.

    Along the stream, past the stone bridge, on her way home, every stalk of rice, every piece of soil, proved that the vote she cast was correct.

    Looking south, sails lined with wispy clouds, the Huangpu River waters surged with white waves. Before Liberation, it was a man-eating monster. Whenever there was a typhoon, the river water mixed with silt, damaging the rice, silting up the fields, and even flooding the houses, carrying away the furniture. After Liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government led the peasants to build two dikes, which tamed this monster and guaranteed years of bumper harvests. Today, as soon as she saw the river water, Wang Xiuzhen thought of that red-faced, tall man Gu Ronggen, who always led the way himself when leading flood prevention and dike repair, regardless of wind, rain, and raging waves. When he saw people, he smiled dreamily before speaking, and his loud speeches were most able to move people's hearts.

    Wang Xiuzhen looked at the golden ox-cart sheds along the edges of the rice paddies and the banks of the stream. A group of strong oxen, water buffaloes, and tan-colored mules were returning from grazing by the river in the evening. She was even more grateful from the bottom of her heart to the agricultural production cooperative and its leaders Gu Ronggen and labor model Wang Menglai. In the past, without being organized, Wang Xiuzhen and her daughters would always be anxious to the point of crying in the fields whenever they had to water the fields during the busy farming season. Today, thanks to the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, the land and labor force are used in a unified and rational manner, and human-powered water wheels have been replaced by ox-carts. No matter how busy the season, Wang Xiuzhen is always full of smiles.

    Looking at the surrounding rice fields from afar, they are all uniformly green. Everyone knows that the fields of Wangjia浜, "used to be green, yellow, and black, but now they are all green." In the past, only the fields of landlords and rich peasants could be cultivated in a timely manner. When their rice seedlings had already grown green, the middle peasants would then plant their seedlings, so it was a mix of green and yellow. When poor families could borrow oxen to plow the fields, the fields were still black. Wang Xiuzhen understood in her heart that the land had changed owners, and those small plots of land had been removed, and it had also changed color. She walked closer to the field, seeing the rice seedlings growing so pleasingly, thick and strong, and orderly. In the past, the rice in Wangjia浜 yielded an average of only a little over a hundred catties per mu, and at most only three hundred catties. After Liberation, it became stronger year by year. By 1952, it had averaged five hundred catties per mu, with the highest reaching eight hundred and seventeen catties. Looking at the rice in 1953, it was growing even better.

    Every ditch that Wang Xiuzhen passed was covered with dense layers of small holes, and dark brown small crabs crawled everywhere. Before Liberation, small crabs were a valuable source of food for the peasants of Central Village. At that time, the poor people had three ropes around their necks – rent rice, donation rice, and debt rice. It was precisely: "When planting the fields, it's a big slope, when harvesting the grain, it's dozens of shis, when the landlord comes, he carries it away in a basket, leaving the peasants with no dinner." Today, everyone in the village can eat three meals of dry rice, and no one takes crabs as food anymore; they have become delicious side dishes.

    Wang Xiuzhen was walking slowly in front, and a young girl caught up with her. She was wearing a "pointed collar shirt" made of red fine striped cloth, and trousers made of light blue Shilin cloth, a round face, fair skin, curved slender eyebrows, big eyes, black pupils, and two small dimples when she smiled. Her oily black hair was tied with a green ribbon. This was Wang Xiuzhen's eldest daughter, Wang Buzhen. Whenever she saw her daughter, Wang Xiuzhen couldn't suppress the joy in her heart, and she would often look at her from head to toe. She especially liked to look at her nimble hands and those beautiful five-colored short socks.

    For decades, the local women had been skilled at knitting socks. However, before Liberation, the fruits of their hard work went into the pockets of the landlords and merchants. At that time, knitting a dozen pairs of socks only earned them one and a half catties of rice. After deducting layer upon layer, they often knitted more than forty pairs of socks a month, earning only a little over one dou of rice. After Liberation, the farmers of this township (Changlou Township) organized their own sock-knitting cooperative. Two sock-knitting factories were set up in the confiscated houses of the landlords, and young girls and daughters-in-law gathered together to work. The exquisite socks they knitted were branded "Wheat Ear" and sold well in major cities across the country. Now, the women can earn 160,000 to 170,000 yuan a month. Wang Buzhen can sometimes earn 210,000 yuan a month, which is equivalent to one shi and one dou of rice, ten times higher than before Liberation.

    Wang Xiuzhen and her daughter walked side by side towards their home. The three newly built tiled houses radiated happiness in the glow of the setting sun. Seeing the ruins and rubble beneath these houses reminded them of the unforgettable blood and tears of hatred.

    It was April 1945. Because the peasants in the village could not pay the military rice, the Japanese devils set fire to the village. Wang Xiuzhen's three-room house, along with her farm tools and furniture, were all burned to ashes. Her husband, Wang Yougen, this kind farmer who had worked hard all his life, contracted tuberculosis from then on. In less than a year, he left his orphans and widows and departed from this world. Her mother and daughters built a thatched shed and lived a life of hardship. Wang Xiuzhen thought to herself that she could only dream of building a house at that time. No one thought that only four years after Liberation, they would build these three tiled houses.

    Wang Xiuzhen and her daughter stepped into their home.

    Her younger daughter, Wang Jinmei, and her son, Wang Bugen, who was studying at the elementary school, had also returned home.

    She walked into her bedroom and sat on an old-fashioned wooden bed. She repeatedly looked at her voter registration card. She turned up her right arm and looked at the scar the size of a teacup, which she got when the Japanese devils slashed her with a military knife the year the houses were burned. She lit the kerosene lamp, and the children all gathered around.

    Wang Xiuzhen described her thoughts along the way to her children, holding the voter registration card and saying, "Children, this small piece of paper is not easy to get. With it, we will never suffer again. With it, we can protect today's happiness, and we can make our lives better and better, and step by step, we can be like the Soviet Union." As she spoke, she walked to the front of the box on the right side of the bed, opened the box on top, took out the invitation card box, and carefully placed all three voter registration cards of the family together with her wedding invitation card.

    一个普通农妇的选票
    王力
    上海市的西南，有个松江县。在松江县城的东南，黄浦江边上，有一个村庄，叫中心村。村庄沿着一条小溪，房屋零散地掩藏在一丛丛的竹林里，村中央有一座长长的石头桥。石头桥东边，叫王家浜。
    据老人们讲，这一大片肥沃的土地，本来是农民开垦的。但是，当荒地种成了熟田之后，地主们便勾结官府，霸占了土地。从此，“江头浦边千万家，秋风秋雨夜无烛”。一直到解放以后，王家浜的农民，才翻过身来。
    在这里，一年十二个月，都可以看到江南的秀丽景色。一位古代的民间诗人曾经这样写道：
    正月松江春水鲜，麦苗荠菜绿如烟；
    二月松江燕子飞，蚕豆开花竹笋肥；
    三月松江鸠雨晴，家家插柳是清明；
    四月松江梅雨多，新秧才莳便成科；
    五月松江稻正长，日中耘草汗如浆；
    六月松江水满堤，黄豆春苗一截齐；
    七月松江风渐凉，棉花雪白稻花香；
    八月松江浪拍天，瓜蔓爬满竹篱边；
    九月松江霜树残，月照芦花秋水寒；
    十月松江尽筑场，绕场稻积密于墙；
    冬月松江网高挂，长芦瘦竹映渔家；
    腊月松江北风吹，雪花飘飘伴寒梅。
    荷花香了。南瓜熟了。去年夏天一个炎热的日子，太阳已经歪西，天空中千株云霞，照耀着江沙。一阵东南风吹过来，竹叶沙沙地响，人们感到透心的清凉。
    农民们成群地从石头桥西边的大竹林里走出来。老老少少都穿着新衣裳，脸上喜气洋洋。青年们哼着歌子：“亲手栽花花儿鲜，亲手栽树果儿甜。民主的花儿开满天，幸福的生活万万年。”他们在包围着一个紫红脸，厚嘴唇，阔肩膀的高个子。这是新选出来的人民代表顾荣根。解放前，他领导农民抗过租米，两年前，他是领导全乡农民进行土地改革的农会主任，现在是本村农业生产合作社的副社长，是一个立场稳、态度和蔼的共产党员。这天的选举大会上，全选区的二百二十八个选民，百分之九十八以上的人都投了他的票。
    在人群中，走着一个普通的中年农妇。小个子，红里带黑的四方脸儿，大眼睛，阔嘴巴，头上梳着发髻，身穿蓝布柳条褂裤。半辈子苦难的生活，使她的脸上刻上很深的皱纹。她的名字叫王秀珍。为了投这张票，她几夜翻来覆去地睡不着觉。她从古想到今，从苦想到甜，从梢想到根，她懂得一定要慎重地投这一票，才能表达自己热爱新中国的情意。她把村中能办事的人，从庄东数到庄西，又从庄西数到庄东，真是“瓜里选瓜”、“筛过再箩”，她立意选举顾荣根。
    王秀珍投票选举的人当了选，总算遂了自己的心愿。她走出了选举大会的会场，手里还拿着选民证。她一边走路，一边仔细看。在选民证的中央，写着自己的名字，她一笔一画地看得清爽。在自己名字旁边还盖着一颗大红印。王秀珍从心里甜到脚后根，不由得想起了千万条往事。
    在旧社会里，她这个穷佃户的女儿，从来没有用过自己的名字。她九岁死了娘，父亲舍不得把她嫁出门，找一个青年雇工当了招女婿。四十多年来，她一步没有离开过这贫寒的家门。那时候，谁也不拿妇女当人，说是“乌盆不算盆，女人不算人”，“牛粪垩田不壮，女人说话不当”，认为女人只应当围着锅台过一辈子。
    在旧政权底下，对于中心村的佃户，不光是女人不算人，男人也不算人。真是血汗不如水，人命不如草。官衙门都是地主开的，地主和官员穿着一条裤子。每年催租米，讨捐税，都是步步进逼：前面是地主的狗腿子，后面便是保长，如果农民交不起米，他们就把松江县城里“老人堂”的一帮饥民们开进村庄，到农民家里见饭就吃，见物就拿，不好拿的就砸得稀碎；如果还是交不起，就把“人犯”捉将官里去，清朝时代是枷号游街，“民国”年间是非刑吊打。中心村世世代代，许多勤劳纯朴的农民，就这样地被逼上三条路：坐牢、逃荒和上吊。这个一切都很平凡的农妇，她的身世使她真正懂得政权叫做“刀把子”。新政权的“刀把子”，是握在自己手里。为着拿稳这个“刀把子”，就必须根据自己的意志，投上神圣的一票。
    她沿着小溪，走过石桥，在回家的路途上，每看到一根稻禾、一块泥土，都证明自己所投的票是正确的。
    向南一望，帆影衬着巧云，黄浦江水白浪滔滔。解放以前，它是一只吃人的怪兽。每逢刮台风的时节，江水夹着泥沙，冲坏了稻禾，淤毁了田地，甚至灌进了房屋，飘走了家具。解放以后，共产党和人民政府领导农民修了两道堤，这才驯服了这只怪兽，保证了连年丰收。今天一看见江水，王秀珍就想起那红脸高个子顾荣根，他在领导防汛和修塘的时候，不管风雨交加，惊涛骇浪，总是自己做在前头。他见了人，没说话，先迷迷地笑，他的洪亮的讲话，最能打动人心。
    王秀珍看着稻田的边缘上，溪河岸上，一座座金黄色的牛车棚。一群壮健的黄牛、水牛，草黄色的骡子，正从江边吃草晚归。她更从心底感激农业生产合作社和它的领导人顾荣根和劳动模范王孟来。往年，没有组织起来，每逢农忙车水时，王秀珍和她的女儿们，总要急得在田里哭。今天，由于成立了农业生产合作社，土地和劳动力统一合理使用，人车改为牛车，不管多么忙的季节，王秀珍都是满面笑容了。
    远看四围的稻田，都是一色碧青。谁都知道，王家浜的田地，“过去是青、黄、黑，现在是一片青”。过去能够及时耕种的，只有地主和富农的田地，当他们的秧禾已经长得青青的时候，中农才插上秧苗，所以是一青一黄。穷人家能借到牛耕田的时候，田地还是一片黑。王秀珍心里明白，土地换了主人，又去掉了那一小块一小块的地界，它也就变了颜色。她走近田边，看禾苗长得真喜人，又粗壮，又整齐。往年，王家浜的稻子，一亩田平均只打一百多斤，顶多的只打三百斤。解放以后一年比一年强，到了一九五二年，一亩田已经平均打五百斤，最高的达到八百十七斤。看一九五三年的稻禾，长得更好。
    王秀珍走过的每一条河沟，都有密层层的小洞，到处爬着深褐色的小螃蟹。解放以前，小螃蟹是中心村农民的宝贵食粮。那时候穷人头上套着三根绞绳——租米、捐米和债米。正是：“种起田来一大坂，收起谷子几十石，地主走来一担挑，弄得农民无夜饭”。今天，村中人都能吃三顿干饭，就再也没有人拿螃蟹当饭吃了，它变成了鲜美的小菜。
    王秀珍在前面慢慢地走着，一个年青的姑娘赶上来。她身穿红细条纹布的“尖角翻领衫”，淡蓝士林布的裤子，圆胖脸儿，白净面皮，弯弯的细眉毛，大眼睛，黑眼珠，笑起来，脸上两个小酒涡，乌油油的头发，打着个绿头绳子的蝴蝶结。这是王秀珍的大女儿王补珍。一看见自己的女儿，王秀珍总是压不住满心的喜悦，常常是从头看到脚。她特别喜欢看她的灵巧的双手和那漂亮的五色的短统袜子。
    几十年来，当地的妇女，都是织袜子的能手。但是，解放以前，辛勤劳动的果实，都装进地主和商人们的荷包里去了。那时织一打袜子，只得一斤半米的报酬，再加上层层克扣，常常一个月织四十多打袜子，只得到一斗多米。解放以后，本乡（长楼乡）农民自己组织了织袜合作社。在没收的地主的房屋里，设了两处织袜厂，年青的姑娘和媳妇们集中起来干活。她们织出来的精美的袜子，商标叫“麦穗牌”，畅销全国各大都市。现在，妇女们一个月可以得到十六、七万元。王补珍有时一个月能得到二十一万元，这就折合一石一斗米，比解放前高出十倍。
    王秀珍母女俩并肩走近了自己的家园。这三间新盖的瓦屋，在夕阳斜照下，放射着幸福的光芒。看到这房屋下边的废墟乱瓦，就想起了那永世难忘的血泪仇恨。
    那是一九四五年的四月天，本村农民因为交不起军米，日本鬼子放火烧毁了村庄。王秀珍家的三开间房屋，连同农具和家具，都被一把火烧光了。她的丈夫王友根，这个勤苦一生的善良的农民，从此得了吐血病，不到一年，他便撇开了孤儿寡妇，离开了人间。她们母女们搭一间茅草棚，度着辛酸的日月。王秀珍心里想，那时候只有在梦中才能盖屋。谁也没有想到解放才四年，就盖上了这三间瓦房。
    王秀珍母女俩踏进自己的家门。
    她的小女儿王金妹和在小学里念书的儿子王补根也回家了。
    她走进了自己的卧室，坐在一张老式的木床上。她反复端详着自己的选民证。她又翻开自己的右手臂，看着那一块茶碗口大的疤痕，那是房屋被烧的那年，日本鬼子用军刀砍伤的。她点上煤油灯，孩子们都围上来了。
    王秀珍向儿女描述这一路上的心事，拿着选民证说道：“孩子们，这张小小的纸头，不是容易得来的。有了它，我们就永远不会受苦。有了它，我们就能保住今天的幸福，就能把日子过得好了还要好，一步一步地能够像苏联一样。”说着，她走向床右边的箱子前面，开开顶上的一只箱子，从里面拿出了拜帖盒子，小心地把全家三张选民证，和她结婚时候的大红帖子放在一起。
