Actively Organize Sources of Goods and Vigorously Supply Agricultural Production Materials

Chen Naijun, Director of the Northwest Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives

I. New Situation and New Tasks

After extensively publicizing the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period in the vast rural areas of Northwest China, the production enthusiasm and mutual aid and cooperation enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants have generally increased. This new situation has put forward a series of new demands on the supply of rural commodities. The most important and prominent of these is the rapid and drastic increase in the peasants' need for means of production, specifically manifested in:

(1) The proportion of peasants' funds used to purchase means of production in their total purchasing power has increased significantly. According to a survey of 15 peasant households in Chenjiazhuang, Gongqu District, Long County, the amount spent on purchasing means of production accounted for 19.45% of total purchasing power in 1952, rising to 37.1% in 1953. Although the amount spent on purchasing means of livelihood also increased in 1953 compared with 1952 (from 9.84 million yuan in 1952 to 13.76 million yuan in 1953), the relative number decreased from 80.55% of total purchasing power in 1952 to 62.9% in 1953. This situation shows that after the broad masses of peasants have achieved initial improvements in their lives, they have concentrated their efforts on expanding reproduction, and this new situation will continue to develop in the future.

(2) Peasants' purchases of means of production have begun to shift from the past practice of scattered, piecemeal, and temporary purchases according to the needs of the production season to planned large-scale purchases before spring plowing. Since the beginning of winter, there has been a general trend in various places of peasants purchasing livestock in large quantities, ordering large carts, purchasing fertilizer, and farm tools, which proves this point.

(3) Under the further development and consolidation of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, many means of production that individual farmers were previously unable to purchase and use can now be purchased and used after being organized. The superiority of mutual aid and cooperation organizations is not only reflected in their ability to rationally use labor and land, but also in their ability to concentrate more funds to do many things that individual farmers cannot do.

(4) Various new types of agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers and other advanced means of production, after years of promotion and trial implementation, have aroused the interest of peasants in their use and have initially mastered the use technology. Since last autumn, some areas have experienced a situation where chemical fertilizers, waterwheels, and walking plows are in short supply, and this situation will continue to develop in the future.

The emergence and development of the above new situations has put forward a top-priority political task for rural supply and marketing cooperatives, that is, to adapt to the new demands of peasants and actively do a good job in the supply of agricultural production materials. Only by doing this work well can supply and marketing cooperatives effectively help peasants increase production and promote the consolidation and development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation.

II. Shortcomings in Past Work

In the past few years, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, under the leadership of the local party and government, have carried out some work in the supply of means of production. According to incomplete statistics for 1953, supply and marketing cooperatives in Northwest China have supplied peasants with more than 25,000 tons of fertilizer, more than 28,000 pieces of new-style farm tools, more than 3.8 million pieces of various old-style farm tools, as well as pesticides and machinery, seeds, feed, livestock, large carts, etc., totaling approximately 260 billion yuan. This has played a certain role in promoting agricultural production. However, the means of production supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives are still too few in variety, limited in quantity, insufficient in reserves, and in short supply, far from meeting the needs of peasants. Even in 1953 alone, the supply of means of production accounted for only 15% of the retail sales of supply and marketing cooperatives. Among the 15 peasant households surveyed above (all of whom were members of the cooperative), not a single one of the various means of production purchased in 1953 came from the supply and marketing cooperative. This is a serious problem that deserves our great vigilance. The reason for this situation is, first of all, that many supply and marketing cooperatives have not clearly recognized in their business thinking the important significance of supplying means of production in helping peasants develop agricultural production, and they do not clearly understand that means of production are the central key to all supply and marketing businesses. The main task of rural supply and marketing cooperatives is to serve agricultural production. Some cadres of supply and marketing cooperatives believe that means of production are "of many types, small in amount, piecemeal, troublesome, and labor-intensive." These comrades have fundamentally failed to recognize the importance of every small means of production to peasants' production. It is of course insignificant whether the supply and marketing cooperative sells more or fewer sickles, but if a farmer lacks it, he cannot harvest crops. If we only care about saving trouble and effort and do not focus on mass production, how can we complete the task of "serving agricultural production"? Some comrades also believe that peasants can handle means of production themselves, and it is superfluous for the cooperative to handle them. It is true that for many years, these problems have been solved by the peasants themselves. But that was in the old society, before the peasants had established their own commercial organizations (cooperatives). Today, with their own cooperatives, if peasants still have to deal with private merchants and endure the pain of exploitation, then the establishment of cooperatives will lose its meaning and will be completely inconsistent with the requirements of the general line of the state during the transition period. Another wrong understanding is that new-style farm tools, waterwheels, pesticides, and machinery are matters for banks, agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy departments, and "cooperatives do things without getting any credit." Therefore, they hold the attitude of "doing as little as possible, preferably not doing it at all, and at most only acting as an agent." This idea was excusable in the past when various new means of production were just beginning to be promoted and tried out, and the state adopted a system of lending in kind. In the future, the state will change all agricultural loans to monetary loans, and peasants have a preliminary understanding of these advanced scientific things and have the power to purchase them. If we still do not take the initiative to be responsible for purchasing and supplying various physical objects to peasants and strengthen publicity, mobilization, organization, and technical instruction, we will inevitably lag behind the requirements of agricultural production development. In addition, some cooperatives hold a perfunctory attitude of "doing what the party and government tell them to do because they have to." They do not ask whether the masses need them, regardless of specifications and quality. In any case, they put a few items on display in the store as a formality, and they do not care about out-of-stock or backlog. This practice is even more wrong. The above erroneous ideological understandings are the basic root causes of the failure of past means of production supply work, and they must be thoroughly corrected in the future.

Secondly, there is a lack of understanding of peasants' production needs, especially the growth and changes in peasants' needs. Detailed investigations and statistics are not made on the varieties, specifications, quantities, and seasonality of the means of production required by peasants in order to carry out planned supply. Instead, they blindly engage in it based on enthusiasm or subjective half-knowledge. Therefore, in operation, either there is a long-term shortage or a long-term backlog; there is this kind but lacks that kind, the goods are not complete, and the quantity is insufficient, which cannot meet the needs of the masses. This situation, especially since the fourth quarter of last year, when the market showed a situation of "everything sells quickly" and "only afraid of not being able to buy, not afraid of not being able to sell," has been a very profound and effective lesson for the majority of cooperative staff.

Thirdly, in the work of organizing sources of goods, there is a lack of unity, education, and transformation of handicraftsmen. It is expressed as "processing and ordering when needed, and pushing away when not needed." They have not been responsible for helping handicraftsmen improve and increase production, solving their production difficulties, and have not taken enough care of them in terms of profits. Therefore, in some places or at some times, handicraftsmen do not accept processing orders, while in other places and at other times, cooperatives are unwilling to process orders. There are few long-term processing orders or sales contracts between each other, so that the production and sales of handicraftsmen cannot be balanced, and the needs of peasants cannot be guaranteed. Another shortcoming of organizing sources of goods is that the scope is too narrow, and it has not developed to all aspects and industries, but is limited to individual objects and individual industries. This has resulted in limited varieties and insufficient quantities. In addition, the lack of attention and good work in the mutual exchange and mutual exchange of what is available between societies has seriously affected the organization and control of sources of goods.

Finally, the organization and supply of means of production by cooperatives is basically still in a scattered and spontaneous state, lacking leadership, organization, and planning. There is no gradual planning, deployment, and inspection work, and the situation is not grasped in time, and problems are not solved. Therefore, societies at all levels are often in a state of unclear tasks, unclear situations, unsolved problems, and inability to improve and increase work.

III. How to Strengthen the Supply of Means of Production

Now, spring plowing production is about to begin. After studying the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, we have clarified the importance of cooperatives supplying agricultural means of production and its political and economic significance in terms of ideology and policy. After checking and criticizing the main problems and shortcomings existing in this work in the past, all cooperative workers should establish the concept of giving priority to the supply of means of production and regard the management of means of production as their most important task that overrides everything else. How can we do this work well? It should be:

(1) Strengthen the organizational leadership of means of production management. Cooperatives at all levels should quickly establish and improve management organizations and departments to supply means of production. Provinces and counties should set up sections and shares to specialize in their respective duties. Each grassroots cooperative should establish a specialized means of production store in the market town to manage various types of means of production according to local needs, striving for complete goods and sufficient inventory to ensure supply. The business departments of the federated cooperatives at all levels should take the wholesale of means of production as their main business operation to support the needs of the grassroots cooperatives. Before spring plowing, the reserves and supply of means of production and existing problems should be thoroughly checked at each level, and a reserve supply plan should be made in coordination with the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments according to local needs to clarify work tasks and be clear about what is in mind.

(2) On the basis of strengthening planning, organize and actively open up sources of goods to all aspects. Grassroots cooperatives and county cooperatives should separately convene a representative meeting of handicraftsmen, handicraft production cooperatives, and groups in the entire region and county, and invite representatives of nearby cooperatives and agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations and experienced peasants to participate. Through the meeting, do a good job in processing and ordering throughout the year or a period, and sign "combination contracts" with peasants. Before convening such a meeting, investigations, statistics, and research should be done on the production needs of peasants, the production capacity of handicraftsmen, and various production difficulties to ensure that the meeting is well held. At the meeting, in-depth publicity and education work on the general line should be carried out for handicraftsmen, clearly pointing out the future development path of handicraftsmen and the basic policy of serving agricultural production and the lives of the masses. The difficulties of handicraftsmen in production such as funds, raw materials, and technology should be effectively helped to solve. In addition to the above work, individual handicraftsmen should be organized into groups or production cooperatives under the principle of voluntariness, and they should be regularly led politically, economically, and technically. Under the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit to ensure the appropriate profits of producers, establish regular and annual processing and ordering contracts with them, and correct the previous bias of "processing in peak season and ignoring in off-season."

(3) On the basis of doing a good job in processing and ordering, internal exchange meetings should be held at least quarterly within the scope of the county or special district to exchange what is available and expand sources of goods. In order to do this work well, when organizing processing and ordering, local areas should not only see the needs of themselves or their local areas, but also pay attention to actively mastering the goods sold in other places to prepare for supporting cooperatives in other regions. For goods that need to be supplied from other places, the plan samples should be notified to the local cooperative in advance for preparation. When cooperatives at all levels convene exchange meetings, the superior cooperative should send people to participate and invite representatives from the state-owned trade department to attend to guide the work and help solve some difficult problems.

(4) The promotion and supply of new-style means of production is an extremely important task related to agricultural production in the future. Cooperatives in various places must now list the supply of new-style means of production as their main task and promote it actively and steadily according to the needs of the masses. In terms of sources of goods, a supply plan should be made in advance and an application should be made to the supply department of the superior cooperative for wholesale. Regarding varieties, specifications, and quality, the superior cooperative should, under possible conditions, guarantee to handle matters according to the requirements of the subordinate cooperative, and resolutely oppose the practice of forcibly distributing unsuitable things downwards. At the same time, the subordinate cooperative is required to thoroughly carry out publicity work and correct the bad practice of subjectively thinking that the masses do not need it and refusing to supply new-style means of production. Because this work is closely related to technology, especially grassroots cadres, it is difficult to carry out the work if they do not master some preliminary knowledge and technology. To this end, it is necessary to closely cooperate with the technical guidance department and send personnel to learn from it to lay the foundation for expanding the management of new-style means of production in the future.

    积极组织货源，大力供应农业生产资料
    全国合作总社西北办事处主任　陈乃君
    一、新的情况和新的任务
    西北广大农村经过大张旗鼓地宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务以后，广大农民的生产积极性和互助合作的积极性普遍高涨。这一新的情况，向农村商品供应工作提出了一系列新的要求，其中最主要最突出的就是农民对生产资料的需要有了急遽的猛烈的增长，具体表现在：
      （一）农民用于购买生产资料的资金在全部购买力中所占比重有了显著的增长。据陇县县功区陈家庄十五户农民的调查，一九五二年购买生产资料金额占全部购买力百分之一九点四五，一九五三年升为百分之三七点一；购买生活资料部分一九五三年与一九五二年相比，虽然金额也有上升（一九五二年为九八四万元，一九五三年为一、三七六万元），但相对数则由一九五二年占全部购买力的百分之八零点五五下降为一九五三年的百分之六二点九。这一情况，说明了广大农民在生活获得初步改善以后，已集中力量注意扩大再生产，今后这一新的情况仍将继续向前发展。
    （二）农民购买生产资料已由过去分散的、零星的按生产季节需要临时添购的情况，开始变为有计划的在春耕以前大批购置。入冬以来，各地普遍出现了农民大批购买牲畜、订制大车、购备肥料、农具等情况就证明了这点。
    （三）在互助合作组织进一步地发展和巩固的情况之下，过去很多为个体农民无力购置和使用的生产资料，在组织起来后能购置和使用了。互助合作组织的优越性不仅表现在能够合理使用劳动力和土地，而且表现在能集中较多的资金，办很多个体农民所办不到的事。
      （四）各种新式农具和化学肥料等先进的生产资料，经过历年来的推广和试办，已引起了农民的使用兴趣并初步掌握了使用技术，去秋以后，一些地区已发生化学肥料、水车、步犁等供不应求现象，这一情况今后也将继续发展。
    以上新的情况的产生与发展，已向农村供销合作社提出了一项头等重要的政治任务，就是要适应农民新的要求，积极地做好农业生产资料供应工作。供销合作社只有把这一工作作好了，才能切实地有效地帮助农民增加生产，促进农业互助合作的巩固和发展。
    二、过去工作中的缺点
    过去数年来，各地供销合作社，在当地党政领导下，曾进行了一些生产资料的供应工作。据一九五三年不完全统计，西北各地供销合作社已供应到农民手中的生产资料，计有肥料二万五千余吨、新式农具二万八千多件、各种旧式农具三百八十余万件，以及农药械、种籽、饲料、牲畜、大车等，总值约二千六百余亿元。这对发展农业生产已起了一定的促进作用。但供销合作社供应的生产资料，仍然是品类过少、数量有限、储备不足、供不应求，远不能满足农民的要求。即以一九五三年而论，生产资料供应仅占供销合作社零售额百分之十五；在上述调查的十五户农民中（全是合作社社员），一九五三年购买的各种生产资料，竟没有一件来自供销合作社，这是值得我们十分警惕的一个严重问题。产生这种情况的原因，首先是很多供销合作社经营思想上没有明确认识供应生产资料对帮助农民发展农业生产的重要意义，不明确生产资料是一切供销业务的中心关键。农村供销合作社的主要任务，就是为农业生产服务。有的供销合作社干部认为生产资料“种类多、金额小、零碎、麻烦、费人费力”。这些同志，根本没有认识每一件细小的生产资料对农民生产上的重要性。供销合作社多卖或少卖一把镰刀，固然所值微不足道，但是一个农民缺少了它，就不能收获庄稼。如果我们只顾省事省力，不从群众生产着眼，那如何能够完成“为农业生产服务”的任务呢？还有些同志认为生产资料“农民自己会办，合作社办是多余的事。”诚然，多少年以来，这些问题是农民自己解决的。但那是在旧社会，农民没有建立起自己的商业组织（合作社）以前的事。今天，有了自己合作社，如果仍然还要农民和私商打交道，忍受剥削的痛苦，那合作社的成立将失掉意义，也与国家过渡时期总路线的要求是完全不相符合的。再一种错误认识就是对新式农具、水车、农药械等，认为是银行、农林、水利部门的事，“合作社办事出力不讨好”，因此抱着“尽量少办，最好不办，最多只能代办”的态度，这种思想，在过去各种新式生产资料方在开始推广试办，国家采取的是实物贷放制的时候，还情有可原。今后国家对农贷已一律改为货币贷放，农民对这些先进的科学的东西已有了初步的认识，而且有力量可以购买，如果我们仍不主动的负责给农民采购供应各种实物，并加强宣传动员组织与技术传授等工作，则必然会落后于农业生产发展的要求。另外，还有些合作社抱着“党政叫办，不得不办”的敷衍应付态度，不问群众是否需要，不管规格质量，反正在门市摆几件做做样子，脱销或积压一概不管，这种作法，更是错误的。以上这些错误的思想认识，是过去生产资料供应工作没有办好的基本根源，今后必须彻底加以纠正。
    其次，是不了解农民生产需要，特别是不了解农民需要的增长和变化情况。对农民所需的生产资料的品种、规格、数量、季节性，不作详细的调查统计，以进行有计划的供应，只是根据热情或主观上的一知半解盲目从事，因而，在经营中，不是长期脱销，便是长期积压；有这种、缺那种，货色不全，数量不足，不能满足群众要求。这种情况，特别是从去年第四季度以来，市场上出现了“是货皆快”、“只怕买不到，不怕卖不了”的情况后，对多数合作社工作人员的教训是十分深刻和有效的。
    再次，在组织货源工作上，缺少对手工业者进行团结、教育、改造的工作，没有把手工业生产与农民的生产需要结合起来。表现了“用着了加工订货，用不着了推开不管”。没有负责帮助手工业者改进和提高生产，解决他们生产上的困难，在利润上也照顾不够。因而，有的地方或有的时期是手工业者不接受加工订货，而另一地方和另一时期则是合作社不愿加工订货。互相之间很少订立长期的加工订货或销货合同，以致使手工业者的产销不能平衡，农民的需要不能保证供应。组织货源的另一个缺点是面太窄，没有向各方面和各个行业发展，只局限于个别对象和个别行业上，因而造成了品种有限，数量不足的现象，再加上没有重视和作好社与社间的互相交流和互换有无的工作，就严重地影响了货源的组织和掌握。
    最后，合作社生产资料的组织与供应工作，基本上仍处于分散的、自发的状态中，缺少有领导、有组织、有计划的进行。没有逐级的计划、布置和检查工作，没有及时掌握情况，解决问题。因而各级社常处于任务不明，情况不清，问题得不到解决，工作不能改进与提高。
    三、如何加强生产资料的供应工作
    现在，春耕生产即将到来，经过学习国家过渡时期总路线总任务，我们在思想上、政策上明确了合作社供应农业生产资料的重要性及其政治和经济上的意义，并检查批判了过去在这一工作上存在的主要问题和缺点后，所有的合作社工作者都应该树立供应生产资料第一的观念，把经营生产资料作为本身压倒一切的头等重要任务。如何才能作好这一工作呢？应当是：
      （一）加强生产资料经营的组织领导工作。各级合作社应迅速建立与健全管理组织与供应生产资料的部门。省、县社分设科与股，以专职责；各基层社应当在集镇建立生产资料专业门市部，根据当地需要，经营各种类型的生产资料，务求货色齐全，库存充足，以保证供应。各级联社业务部门应把生产资料批发作为主要业务经营，以支持基层社的需要。春耕前，应逐级深入检查一次生产资料储备供应情况与存在的问题，根据当地需要，配合农林水利部门，作出储备供应计划，以明确工作任务，作到心中有数。
    （二）在加强计划性的基础上，有组织地积极地向各方面开辟货源。基层社及县社应分别召集一次全区的、全县的手工业者、手工业生产合作社、小组的代表会，并邀请附近合作社及农业生产互助合作组织代表和有经验的农民参加。通过会议，做好全年或一个时期的加工订货工作，并与农民订立“结合合同”。召开这样一个会议，事先应做好农民生产需要、手工业者的生产能力、生产上的各种困难的调查统计与研究工作，以保证会议开好。在会议上，应对手工业者深入进行总路线的宣传教育工作，明确指出手工业者今后发展的道路及为农业生产与群众生活服务的基本方针。对手工业者生产中的资金、原料、技术等困难，应切实帮助解决。除上述工作外，并应在自愿的原则下，把个体手工业者组织成小组或生产合作社，从政治上、经济上、技术上经常领导他们，在互助互利保证生产者的适当利润的原则下，与其建立定期的、常年的加工订货合同，纠正以往“旺季加工、淡季不管”的偏向。
      （三）在作好加工订货的基础上，应以县或专区为范围至少按季召开内部交流会议，互换有无，扩大货源。为了作好这一工作，各地在组织加工订货时，不应只看见本身或本地需要，对行销其他各地货物亦应注意积极掌握，以备支援其他地区合作社。凡需要他地供应的货品，应事先将计划样品通知当地合作社，以便代为准备。在各级社召开交流会时，上级社应派人参加并邀请国营贸易部门的代表出席，以指导工作，并帮助解决一些困难问题。
    （四）新式生产资料的推广和供应是关系今后农业生产的一项极其重要的工作。各地合作社今后必须把新式生产资料的供应列为自己的主要工作，根据群众需要，积极稳步推广。在货源上，应事先作出供应计划，申请上级社供应部门批发。关于品种、规格、质量，上级社应在可能条件下保证按下级社要求办事，坚决反对将不适用的东西强行向下摊派的作风。同时，要求下级社必须深入做好宣传工作，纠正主观的认为群众不需要而拒绝供应新式生产资料的不良作风。由于这一工作与技术关系很大，特别是基层干部，如不掌握一些初步的知识与技术，工作是很难进行的。为此，必须与技术指导部门密切配合，派员向其学习，以奠定今后扩大经营新式生产资料的基础。
