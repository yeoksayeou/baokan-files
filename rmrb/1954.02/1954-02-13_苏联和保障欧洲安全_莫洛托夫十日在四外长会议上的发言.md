    The Soviet Union and Guaranteeing European Security
    ——Molotov's Speech at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference Over Ten Days
    The German question received much attention at this conference. As it stands, there are fundamental differences between the position of the Western Three powers and the Soviet position, which represents the views of some European countries. The Soviet delegation attaches great importance to this discussion of the German question. We believe this discussion should continue. Our people hope that the resolution of the German question will not be shelved.

    Efforts should continue to bring our positions closer and achieve consensus. It must be ensured that the German question is resolved in a way that is satisfactory to our four countries and the peace-loving countries of Europe. This resolution must be consistent with the principles of defending peace and guaranteeing the freedom of the German nation, while also safeguarding the national interests and security of European countries.

    The division of Europe into military blocs should be avoided. In this regard, one cannot help but recall Mr. Eden's words at the League of Nations meeting on September 25, 1936, against dividing countries into groups according to their political systems. He said at that time: "The worst thing I can imagine is countries being divided into groups according to their political systems."

    We have experienced two world wars. Both before the First World War and before the Second World War, Europe was divided into opposing blocs of countries, and not just Europe.

    Before the First World War, the Austro-German bloc was first established, which later became the "Triple Alliance" of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. To counter the establishment of this bloc, another group emerged: first, the Franco-Russian alliance, then the "Triple Entente," composed of Russia, France, and Great Britain.

    The outbreak of the world war followed the establishment of these two blocs. This war was essentially a war between the aforementioned two major blocs.

    Large-country blocs were also established before the Second World War. We remember how much noise was made at the time of the establishment of the bloc known as the "Berlin-Rome Axis." Its final form was the so-called "Anti-Comintern Pact," signed by Hitler's Germany, Fascist Italy, and militarist Japan. The International Military Tribunal in Tokyo in 1946-1948 ruled that this aggressive group, which stood in opposition to other countries, launched the Second World War. It is appropriate here to mention what U.S. Secretary of State Hull said at the time: "Although this pact ostensibly was concluded for anti-communist self-defense, in reality, it was a preparatory step taken by some aggressive nations to further adopt measures to carry out military expansion."

    The Second World War was first launched in the West, in Europe. Two years later, militarist Japan attacked the United States in the East.

    It is necessary to mention these facts so that everyone can soberly look at current events.

    Whether there will be a third world war depends on these few countries of ours. If the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union decide not to allow a new world war to happen, they are capable of doing so.

    To prevent the outbreak of a new war, we should learn from history. First, it must be recognized that if we do not want a new world war to happen, and that is to say, do not want a new war to happen in Europe, then we should do everything possible to prevent European countries from establishing mutually opposing military blocs. At the same time, we cannot forget the particularly dangerous role that German militarism played in launching both the First and Second World Wars.

    The well-known facts of recent years show that the idea of establishing military blocs, primarily against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, has begun to become a reality. The North Atlantic bloc, established five years ago and led by the United States and Great Britain, paved the way in this regard. It is precisely the North Atlantic bloc that is currently doing everything possible to promote plans to establish military blocs in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and the Near East and Middle East.

    The North Atlantic Treaty is very similar in many respects to the Anti-Comintern Pact, which became the fuse for the Second World War. There is no reason to doubt that the fate of the North Atlantic Treaty will be no better than the fate of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Since anti-Soviet plans failed to materialize in the 1930s, they will not be any more certain in the 1950s or 1960s.

    We naturally paid special attention at this Berlin conference to the German question and the question of guaranteeing European security.

    In this regard, the Soviet delegation has repeatedly pointed out the danger of the plan to establish a "European Defense Community." This plan is incompatible with the recognition that the collective security of European countries must be guaranteed.

    Mr. Bidault, Mr. Eden, and Mr. Dulles have defended here the necessity of establishing a "European Defense Community." They told us that this plan does not seem to be directed against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. They implied to us that even with the establishment of a "European Defense Community," that is, the establishment of a so-called "European army" with a re-militarized West Germany participating, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries could obtain so-called security guarantees.

    Is that really the case?

    Of course not.

    Any prerequisite for guaranteeing European security is first to ensure that German militarism cannot be revived; German militarism has already plunged the peoples of Europe into war twice in twenty-five years. And the Western countries' plan to establish a "European Defense Community" is a plan to establish a military bloc with West Germany participating, which will inevitably lead to the revival of German militarism. Since West Germany possesses the largest military-industrial resources and manpower, German militarism would play a leading role in the "European Defense Community." In this way, the Western countries are calling the establishment of a "European Defense Community" a guarantee of security for the Soviet Union, asking the German militarists to play the role of security guarantor, while the revival of German militarism is the main threat to European security.

    Due to the firm opposition of the peoples of Europe, the Western countries have not yet been able to establish a "European Defense Community." Now, the Western countries verbally promise to "guarantee" the security of the Soviet Union and other countries, but in reality, they want to use these verbal guarantees to finally achieve the goal of establishing a "European Defense Community."

    The establishment of a military bloc of six European countries—West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg—means setting these countries against the rest of Europe, deepening the division of Europe, increasing international tensions, and thus threatening the vital interests of the peoples of Europe, including the German people. It is certainly no accident that the "European Defense Community" does not allow other European countries to participate, so it is a narrow, exclusive military bloc.

    The Western countries' plan stipulates that the so-called "Bonn Treaty" will take effect immediately after the "European Defense Community" is established. The "Bonn Treaty" and the "Paris Treaty" make it possible for foreign troops to remain stationed in the heart of Europe for fifty years. It is quite obvious that this fundamentally violates the requirements for guaranteeing the security of the Soviet Union and guaranteeing the normal peaceful life of the peoples of Europe.

    Once the "European Defense Community" is established, it will permanently divide Germany, making it impossible to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, which violates the basic requirements of European security.

    The United States and Great Britain lavishly talk about "guaranteeing" the security of the Soviet Union. What does this mean? Since the United States and Great Britain are the main members of the North Atlantic bloc (of which the "European Defense Community" is to become a part), they will also become partners of a re-militarized West Germany. In this situation, they cannot guarantee the security of the Soviet Union, cannot protect it from aggression by German militarism.

    I would like to recall that even under the Locarno Treaty, Great Britain and Italy, as countries guaranteeing the status quo of France and preventing the threat of attack by militarist Germany, did not belong to a military bloc with Germany.

    All the above shows that the plan to establish a "European Defense Community" is not conducive to the cause of consolidating European peace and security.

    Some people ask us, if the "European Defense Community" is not established, what other methods are there? If the plan to establish such a bloc is abandoned, what can replace the "European Defense Community"? This question has aroused particular interest in France, which we consider quite natural.

    We answer this question by saying: It is necessary to practically realize the concept of collective security for the peoples of Europe to replace the plan to establish a "European Defense Community." The security of European countries must be guaranteed, regardless of their social systems.

    On September 2, 1947, the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance was signed in Rio de Janeiro. The United States and all the republics of Latin America participated in this treaty. This treaty was concluded after the establishment of the United Nations. No one considered this impermissible or superfluous.

    Then we must ask: Why can there be an Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, but not, for example, a European Collective Security Treaty? There is no reason to reject such a proposal. Such a treaty is entirely compatible with the existence of the United Nations.

    The Soviet Union believes that the issue of guaranteeing European security, like the issue of maintaining world peace, can only be resolved through the collective efforts of all peace-loving countries. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that a pan-European collective security system must be established, rather than organizing some countries to oppose other European countries. This system should stipulate close cooperation among all European countries to prevent the disruption of European peace; to provide the necessary resistance once peace is disrupted; and, in addition, should stipulate corresponding specific obligations for these countries, including obligations of a military nature, so that this system can be powerful and effective.

    For many years before the outbreak of the Second World War, the Soviet government emphasized the importance of collective security in every possible way. At that time, the Hitler government most strongly opposed the idea of collective security. For obvious reasons, Hitler, who harbored aggressive plans, opposed collective security.

    If, in the current situation, European countries realize the concept of collective security and conclude a corresponding pan-European treaty, what is wrong from the point of view of strengthening peace?

    The conclusion of a pan-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security will conform to the urgent desire of the European people for consolidating peace. This is a significant contribution to the consolidation of world peace.

    Therefore, what lies before us is not a simple task, but it is entirely achievable.

    We must continue to work hard to completely resolve the German question. Any issues that could not be resolved during the conference can be addressed in the near future; we must never delay the peaceful resolution of the German question in order to implement certain unilateral plans.

    The Soviet government believes that, in order to resolve the German question and to guarantee the security of the entire Europe, it is necessary for the occupying forces to withdraw from East and West Germany, leaving only a limited number of troops necessary to carry out security functions within the scope of the Four-Power Control Mission. The withdrawal of occupying forces from Germany will promote the easing of tensions between European countries, and not just between European countries. Moreover, this matter in itself is extremely important for consolidating peace in Europe.

    We should reach an agreement to take certain urgent measures, especially those measures that need to be taken before a peace treaty with Germany is concluded and before Germany is reunified on a democratic and peaceful basis.

    At the same time, the four countries should take urgent measures to promote the conclusion of a collective security treaty among European countries. This treaty should propose appropriate guarantees to prevent aggression and prevent the disruption of European peace.

    The establishment of a collective security system in Europe will not and should not in any way diminish the importance of resolving the German question as soon as possible, which must be resolved in accordance with the needs of maintaining peace in Europe. Moreover, the implementation of a collective security system helps to create more favorable conditions for resolving the German question, because such a system prohibits dragging this part or that part of Germany into military blocs, which can remove the main obstacles on the road to establishing a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

    Naturally, when establishing a collective security system, one cannot fail to consider the fact that Germany remains divided into two parts. From this, an important conclusion should be drawn: In order to maintain peace in Europe, and for the benefit of the German people themselves, before a peace treaty with Germany is concluded, and before Germany is reunited into a unified country, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany must join the pan-European collective security system together with other countries, and must abide by the principles and purposes of this system.

    The Soviet delegation believes that if the participants of this conference reach a corresponding agreement, that is, an agreement based on the recognition of the proposition of European collective security, then this conference will have taken an important step forward in consolidating peace in Europe. To this end, the Soviet delegation submits the following proposals for consideration at this conference:

      “On Guaranteeing European Security:
    “1. The governments of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union undertake the following obligations: to continue to work hard to satisfactorily resolve the German question based on the principles of guaranteeing peace and national freedom; to continue to work hard to guarantee the rights of all European countries that do not want their national interests and security to be violated by other countries.
    “2. Before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the restoration of German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis, the following measures shall be implemented:
      “A. Within a period of six months, occupying forces shall be withdrawn from East and West Germany simultaneously, leaving only a limited number of troops necessary to carry out security functions within the scope of the Four-Power Control Mission: the Soviet Union is responsible for East Germany, and the United States, Britain, and France are responsible for West Germany.
    “The issue of the number of such troops may be resolved through consultation among the four governments.
      “B. Once the security of any part of Germany is threatened, the countries currently carrying out occupation missions in Germany have the right to move their troops in—regarding East Germany, it is the Soviet Union; regarding West Germany, it is the United States, Britain, and France.
      “C. In order to maintain internal order and border defense, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany may have police forces, the number of troops and armaments of which shall be determined by agreement of the four countries.
      “Inspection teams composed of representatives from the four countries shall be established in West and East Germany to supervise the implementation of this agreement.
      “3. The implementation of the above provisions will guarantee the neutrality of Germany, and can create favorable conditions for resolving the German question in accordance with the interests of consolidating peace in Europe. According to the above provisions, the four countries should take urgent steps to facilitate the conclusion of a pan-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security. This treaty can provide appropriate guarantees to prevent aggression and prevent the disruption of European peace. For this purpose, the four countries agree to initiate a meeting of appropriate European countries.”
    According to the provisions of the document I just read out, the Soviet delegation submits a draft “Pan-European Treaty Guaranteeing European Collective Security” for consideration at the current conference.
    The draft treaty is as follows:
      “Pan-European Treaty Guaranteeing European Collective Security (Basic Principles)
      “In order to guarantee peace and security in Europe and to prevent aggression against any European country,
      “In order to strengthen international cooperation based on the principles of respecting the independence and sovereignty of all countries and not interfering in the internal affairs of any country,
      “In order to prevent the establishment of blocs of some European countries against other European countries, thereby causing international friction and tension, in order to enable all European countries to take concerted action to guarantee European collective security,
      “European countries, in line with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, conclude a pan-European treaty guaranteeing European collective security, which includes the following basic principles:
      “(1) All European countries, regardless of their social systems, may participate in this treaty, as long as they recognize the purposes of the treaty and assume the obligations of the treaty.
    “Before the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany may participate in this treaty, enjoying equal rights. Of course, after the reunification of Germany, the unified Germany may participate in this treaty according to general conditions.
    “The conclusion of the European Collective Security Treaty shall not prejudice the authority of the four countries—the Soviet Union, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and France—over the German question, which should be resolved in the manner previously decided by the four countries.
      “(2) The contracting parties shall not launch any offensive against each other, nor shall they use threats or force in their international relations, and shall resolve any disputes that may arise between them in a peaceful manner, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, in a manner that does not endanger international peace and security in Europe.
    “(3) If any contracting party believes that there is a risk of any armed attack against Europe or one or more contracting parties, all the contracting parties shall conduct consultations in order to take effective steps to eliminate this risk and maintain the security of Europe.
      “(4) Any armed attack by one or more countries against any one or more contracting parties in Europe shall be considered an attack against all contracting parties. In the event of such an attack, each contracting party may exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense, and shall assist in collective self-defense by all possible means, including the use of armed forces, to assist one or more countries that have been subjected to such an attack, in order to restore and maintain international peace and security in Europe.
      “(5) The contracting parties shall jointly discuss as soon as possible to determine the means by which the contracting parties shall provide assistance—including military assistance—when a situation arises in Europe that requires collective efforts to restore and maintain peace in Europe.
      “(6) The contracting parties shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, immediately notify the United Nations Security Council of the exercise of the right of self-defense or the activities that have been carried out or are intended to be carried out for the purpose of maintaining peace and security in Europe.
      “(7) The contracting parties shall not participate in any alliance or federation, or conclude any such agreement, the purpose of which is contrary to the purpose of the European Collective Security Treaty.
      “(8) In order for the participating countries to conduct consultations as stipulated in the treaty, and to consider issues arising from the issue of guaranteeing European security, the following should be stipulated:
      “(A) Hold regular meetings, and hold special meetings when necessary. Each country appoints a government official or a specially designated representative to participate in the meetings.
      “(B) Establish a permanent political consultative committee, the task of which is to draft corresponding recommendations for the governments of the participating countries.
      “(C) Establish a military advisory body, the scope of authority of which will be determined through appropriate discussion.
      “(9) Recognizing that the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace and security, the participating countries should invite the governments of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China to send representatives to participate in the institutions established under the treaty as observers.
      “(10) The current treaty shall in no way undermine the obligations contained in the treaties and agreements of European countries that are in line with the principles and purposes of the current treaty.
      “(11) The treaty shall be valid for fifty years.”
    The Soviet delegation hopes that the current conference will consider its proposals with due attention.

    苏联和保障欧洲安全
    ——莫洛托夫十日在四外长会议上的发言
    这次会议非常注意德国问题。照目前看来，西方三国的立场和代表欧洲一些国家的看法的苏联的立场，有着本质上的分歧。苏联代表团很重视这次对德国问题的讨论。我们认为这次讨论应当继续进行。我们各国人民都希望不要把解决德国问题这件事束之高阁。
    应当继续努力，使我们的立场更加接近和取得一致。必须保证德国问题能得到我们四国和欧洲爱好和平的国家认为满意的解决。这种解决必须符合于保卫和平和保障德国民族自由的原则，同时还应当维护欧洲各国的民族利益和安全。
    应当避免使欧洲分裂成一些军事集团。关于这一点，不能不令人想起艾登先生于一九三六年九月二十五日在国际联盟会议上反对把一些国家分成集团的话，他那时说：“我想像中最坏的情形就是一些国家按照它们的政权形式分成集团。”
    我们已经经历过两次世界大战。无论是第一次世界大战以前，或第二次世界大战以前，欧洲都是分为互相对立的国家集团，而且不仅欧洲如此。
    第一次世界大战前，首先建立了奥德集团，这个集团后来又变成了德国、奥匈帝国和意大利的
  “三国同盟”。为了对付这个集团的建立，又产生了另外一个集团：首先建立了法俄同盟，然后出现了“三国协约”，即由俄国、法国和英国组成的“协约国”。
    上述两个集团建立后，世界大战就爆发了。这次战争基本上是上述两个大国集团之间的战争。
    在第二次世界大战以前也建立了大国集团。我们记得：那时以“柏林—罗马轴心”为名的集团建立时曾经引起了多少的喧嚷。这个集团的最后形式就是所谓“反共产国际协定”，在公约上签字的有希特勒德国、法西斯意大利和军国主义的日本。一九四六——一九四八年东京的国际军事法庭判定：发动第二次世界大战的就是这个与其他国家对立的侵略集团。这里，提一提美国国务卿赫尔当时所说的话，是很合适的，那时他说：“虽然，这个公约表面上是为了反共自卫而缔结的，但是实际上它是一些侵略国家所采取的一个准备步骤，以便进一步采取措施来实行武力扩张。”
    第二次世界大战首先是在西方，在欧洲发动的。两年后，军国主义日本在东方进袭了美国。
    为了使大家能够清醒地看看目前的事件，提到这些事实是必要的。
    有没有第三次世界大战，就取决于我们这几个国家。如果美国、英国、法国和苏联决定不让新的世界大战发生，它们是能够做到这一点的。
    为了阻止新战争的发生，我们应当吸取历史的教训。首先必须承认，如果我们不愿让新的世界大战发生，而这也就是说不让欧洲发生新战争，那就应该尽力阻止欧洲国家建立互相对立的军事集团。同时，我们不能忘记德国军国主义在发动第一次世界大战和发动第二次世界大战时曾起过特别危险的作用。
    近年来人所共知的事实说明，建立首先是反对苏联和人民民主国家的军事集团的念头，已经开始成为事实了。五年以前建立而且是由美国和英国领头的北大西洋集团为这方面铺平了道路。目前千方百计地推动在欧洲、亚洲、太平洋以及近东、中东建立军事集团的计划的，就正是北大西洋集团。
    北大西洋公约在很多方面都很像曾经成为第二次世界大战的导火线的反共产国际协定。没有理由怀疑，北大西洋公约的命运绝不会比反共产国际协定的命运更好。反苏计划在三十年代既然没有能够实现，那么，在五十年代或六十年代也就不会更加有把握。
    我们在这次柏林会议上自然特别注意德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题。
    关于这一点，苏联代表团一再指出了建立“欧洲防务集团”计划的危险性。这种计划和承认必须保障欧洲各国集体安全这一点，是不相容的。
    皮杜尔先生、艾登先生和杜勒斯先生在这里曾经为建立“欧洲防务集团”的必要性辩护。他们对我们说，这个计划似乎并不是反对苏联和人民民主国家的。他们暗示我们，似乎在建立“欧洲防务集团”，就是建立有重新军国主义化的西德参加的所谓“欧洲军”的情况下，苏联及其他爱好和平的欧洲国家也可以得到所谓安全的保障。
    真的是这样吗？
    当然不是这样。
    保障欧洲安全的任何先决条件，首先就是保证德国军国主义不能复活；德国军国主义在二十五年内已经两次把欧洲各国人民推入了战争。而西方国家关于建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划，就是建立有西德参加的军事集团的计划，不可避免地会引起德国军国主义的复活。由于西德拥有最大的军事工业资源和人力，德国军国主义会在“欧洲防务集团”中扮演主角。西方国家就这样把建立“欧洲防务集团”说成是对苏联安全的保障，叫德国军国主义者来扮演保障安全的人的角色，而德国军国主义的复活却是对欧洲安全的主要威胁。
    由于欧洲各国人民的坚决反对，西方国家到现在还没有能够建立“欧洲防务集团”。现在，西方国家口头上答应“保障”苏联及其他国家的安全，实际上却想利用这种口头的保证来最后达到建立“欧洲防务集团”的目的。
    建立六个欧洲国家——西德、法国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡——的军事集团，就意味着使这些国家和欧洲其余国家对立起来，加深欧洲分裂，使国际局势更加紧张，从而威胁欧洲各国人民的切身利益，包括德国人民的利益在内。“欧洲防务集团”不让其他的欧洲国家参加，所以它是一个狭隘的、排外的军事集团，这当然不是偶然的。
    西方国家的计划规定，“欧洲防务集团”建立后，所谓“波恩条约”立即生效。“波恩条约”和“巴黎条约”使外国军队有可能在欧洲的心脏驻留五十年之久。十分明显，这就根本违反了保障苏联安全的要求以及保障欧洲各国人民正常和平生活的要求。
      “欧洲防务集团”一旦建立起来，就会使德国永远分裂，使得对德和约没有可能缔结，而这是违反欧洲安全的起码要求的。
    美国和英国侈谈“保障”苏联的安全。这是什么意思呢？美国和英国既然是北大西洋集团（“欧洲防务集团”要成为这个集团的组成部分）的主要成员，也就要成为重新军国主义化的西德的伙伴。在这种情况下，它们就不能保障苏联的安全，不能使它不受德国军国主义的侵犯。
    我愿意追述一下：即使根据洛迦诺条约，英国与意大利作为保障法国的现状、防止军国主义的德国攻击的威胁的国家，也并不是和德国属于一个军事集团的。
    上述一切说明，建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划无利于巩固欧洲和平与安全的事业。
    有人问我们，不成立“欧洲防务集团”，另外有什么办法呢？如果放弃成立这样一个集团的计划的话，用什么来代替“欧洲防务集团”呢？这个问题在法国引起了特别的兴趣，我们认为这是十分自然的。
    我们回答这个问题说：有必要在实际上实现欧洲各国人民集体安全的观念，来代替建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划。欧洲各国的安全必须得到保障，不论它们的社会制度有何不同。
    一九四七年九月二日，在里约热内卢签订了泛美互助条约。参加这个条约的有美国与拉丁美洲所有共和国。这个条约是在联合国成立以后缔结的。没有人认为这是不能容许的，或是多余的。
    那么我们就要问：为什么能够有一个泛美互助条约，而没有，譬如说，欧洲集体安全条约呢？没有理由拒绝这样一个建议。这样一个条约和联合国的存在是完全可以相容的。
    苏联相信保障欧洲安全问题正如维持世界和平问题一样，只有通过一切爱好和平国家的集体努力才能得到解决。因此，苏联认为必须建立一个全欧集体安全体系，而不是组织一些国家来反对其他欧洲国家。这种体系应该规定所有欧洲国家密切合作来预防对欧洲和平的破坏；在和平一旦遭受破坏时，提供必要的抵抗；此外，应该规定这些国家相应的具体义务，包括属于军事性质的义务，使这个制度得以有力、有效。
    在第二次世界大战爆发以前的好几年中，苏联政府曾以一切可能的办法强调集体安全的重要性。当时，反对集体安全主张最力的是希特勒政府。由于明显的原因，怀有侵略计划的希特勒是反对集体安全的。
    如果在目前的情况下，欧洲国家实现集体安全的观念，并缔结一个相应的全欧条约的话，从加强和平的观点来看，有什么不对头呢？
    缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约将符合欧洲人民对巩固和平的迫切愿望。这是对巩固世界和平的重大贡献。
    因此，摆在我们面前的，就不是一个简单的任务，然而，却是完全可以实现的。
    我们必须继续努力，以便完满地解决德国问题。凡是在会议期间未能解决的问题，我们都可以设法在不久的将来去解决；我们绝不应当为了实行某些片面计划而延迟德国问题的和平解决。
    苏联政府认为，为了解决德国问题，为了保障整个欧洲安全，都需要占领军从东德和西德撤退，仅仅留下为执行四国管制任务范围内的安全职权所需的数量有限的部队。从德国撤退占领军会促进欧洲国家之间紧张关系的缓和，而且不仅是欧洲国家之间紧张关系的缓和。而且，这件事本身，对巩固欧洲和平来说，也是极其重要的。
    我们应当取得协议，采取某些迫切的措施，特别是那些在对德和约没有缔结以及德国还没有在民主与和平的基础上重新统一以前所需要采取的措施。
    同时，四国应当采取紧急措施，促进欧洲各国缔结集体安全条约。这种条约应当提出防止侵略和防止欧洲和平遭到破坏的适当保证。
    在欧洲建立集体安全体系，并不会而且也不应该在任何程度上减弱及早解决德国问题的重要意义，德国问题是必须按照维护欧洲和平的需要来解决的。而且，实行集体安全体系有助于为解决德国问题创造更加有利的条件，因为这种体系禁止把德国的这一部分或那一部分拖进军事集团，这就可以扫除在建立统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的道路上的主要障碍。
    自然，在建立集体安全体系的时候，不能不考虑到德国仍然分裂为两部分这个事实。由此应当得出一个重要的结论：为了维护欧洲的和平，为了德国人民自身的利益，在对德和约没有缔结以前，在德国重新成为一个统一的国家以前，德意志民主共和国及德意志联邦共和国必须和其他国家一道加入全欧集体安全体系，并且必须遵守这个体系的原则和目的。
    苏联代表团认为，如果我们这次会议的参加者达成了相应的协议，即从承认欧洲集体安全这一主张出发的协议，那么，我们这次会议就在巩固欧洲和平方面跨进了重要的一步。为此，苏联代表团把下列建议提交这次会议考虑：
      “关于保障欧洲安全：
    “一、法、英、美、苏四国政府承担下列义务：继续努力，根据保障和平与民族自由的原则，圆满解决德国问题；继续努力，保障所有不愿让他国侵犯其民族利益与安全的欧洲国家的权利。
    “二、在缔结对德和约及在民主与和平的基础上恢复德国统一之前，实行下列措施：
      “甲、在六个月的期限内同时由东德和西德境内撤出占领军，只留下为执行四国管制任务范围内的安全职权所需的数量有限的部队：苏联负责东德，美、英、法负责西德。
    “这种部队的数额问题可由四国政府协商解决。
      “乙、一旦德国两部分中的任何一部分内的安全受到威胁，目前在德国执行占领任务的国家有权把它们的军队开入——关于东德，是苏联；关于西德，是美、英、法。
      “丙、为了维持内部秩序和边境防务，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以有警察部队，部队的人数和武装将由四国的协议来决定。
      “在西德和东德设立由四国代表组成的视察小组，以监督这个协定的执行。
      “三、上述规定的实行将保证德国的中立，并且可以为按照巩固欧洲和平的利益而解决德国问题创造有利的条件。根据上述规定，四国应采取紧急步骤，促成缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约。这个条约可以为防止侵略、防止破坏欧洲和平提供适当的保证。为了这个目的，四国同意发起召开一个适当的欧洲国家的会议。”
    根据我刚才宣读的文件的规定，苏联代表团提出一个“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案，以供目前的会议考虑。
    条约草案如下：
      “保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约（基本原则）
      “为了保障欧洲的和平与安全并且防止对欧洲任何国家的侵略，
      “为了根据尊重各国的独立和主权以及不干涉各国内政的原则来加强国际合作，
      “为了防止一些欧洲国家成立集团来反对其他欧洲国家从而引起国际摩擦与紧张局势，为了使得所有欧洲国家采取一致行动来保障欧洲的集体安全，
      “欧洲国家本着联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，缔结一个保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约，条约包括的基本原则如下：
      “（一）所有的欧洲国家，不管它们的社会制度如何，都可以参加这个条约，只要它们承认条约的宗旨并且承担条约的义务。
    “在一个统一的、和平的、民主的德国成立以前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以参加这个条约，享有同等的权利。当然，在德国统一后，统一的德国可以根据一般的条件参加这个条约。
    “欧洲集体安全条约的缔结不得有损四国——苏联、美利坚合众国、联合王国和法国——对德国问题的权限，这个问题应按四国前此决定的方式解决。
      “（二）缔约国不得彼此发动任何进攻，也不得在它们的国际关系中使用威胁或武力，并且要按照联合国宪章，以和平方式，以不至于危及欧洲的国际和平与安全的方法，来解决它们之间可能发生的任何争端。
    “（三）如果任何一个缔约国认为欧洲将发生任何一个或一个以上的缔约国受到武装进攻的危险，所有的缔约国就要进行磋商，以便采取有效步骤来消除这种危险，并且维护欧洲的安全。
      “（四）任何一国或一些国家对欧洲任何一个或一个以上的缔约国发动武装进攻，将被认为是对所有缔约国进攻。遇有这样的进攻发生，每一缔约国得行使单独自卫或集体自卫的权利，以一切可能的方式，包括使用武装部队，协力进行集体自卫，援助受到了这种进攻的一个或一个以上的国家，以便恢复并维持欧洲的国际和平与安全。
      “（五）缔约国得尽早共同讨论，以确定在欧洲出现了需要作集体努力来恢复并维持欧洲和平的局势时，缔约国提供援助——包括军事援助在内——的办法。
      “（六）缔约国将根据联合国宪章的规定，把行使自卫权利或为了维护欧洲和平与安全所已经进行或打算进行的活动，立即通知联合国安全理事会。
      “（七）缔约国不得参加其宗旨与欧洲集体安全条约的宗旨相抵触的任何同盟或联盟，或缔结任何这样的协定。
      “（八）为了参与国之间进行条约所规定的磋商，为了考虑由保障欧洲安全问题引起的问题，应该作以下规定：
      “（甲）举行定期会议，有必要时举行特别会议，每一个国家指派一个政府官员或是某个特别指定的代表参加会议。
      “（乙）成立一个永久性的政治谘询委员会，这个委员会的任务是替参与国政府草拟相应的建议。
      “（丙）成立一个军事谘询机构，这个机构的职权范围将经过适当的讨论来决定。
      “（九）认识到联合国安全理事会常任理事国对维护国际和平与安全负有特别责任，因此参与国应该邀请美利坚合众国和中华人民共和国政府派遣代表以观察员身分参加根据条约成立的机构。
      “（十）目前的条约不得丝毫破坏欧洲各国那些在原则与宗旨方面和目前的条约相符合的条约与协定中所包含的义务。
      “（十一）条约有效期为五十年。”
    苏联代表团希望目前的会议以适当的注意来考虑它的建议。（新华社据塔斯社柏林十一日电）
