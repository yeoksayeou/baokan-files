Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Newspapers in many countries have commented on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

    Korea
    The Korean Central News Agency commented on February 21 on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, saying: "Encouraged by the realization of the Korean armistice, the unanimous demand of peace-loving people around the world to ease international tensions and the Soviet government's consistent adherence to a peaceful policy have forced the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to agree to hold the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference." The commentary pointed out: The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference reached an agreement on convening a Geneva conference with the participation of the five major powers and related countries to discuss the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, and reached certain agreements on the issue of universal disarmament. This shows that the efforts made by peace-loving people around the world to ease international tensions and the Soviet government's unwavering peaceful policy have achieved positive results. The commentary emphasized: The fact that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference failed to reach an agreement on a series of important international issues, including the German question, the issue of guaranteeing European security, and the Austrian peace treaty, is entirely the responsibility of the United States, Britain, and France.
    Czechoslovakia
    The Czechoslovakian "Red Right" newspaper's editorial stated: The Soviet Union proved at the Berlin conference that it earnestly hopes to resolve all international disputes. All its proposals are in line with the interests of European security and world peace. If the American aggressive bloc had not obstructed the adoption of proposals on the rapid resolution of the German question and other issues, the achievements of this conference could have been even greater. The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference makes it possible for the major powers and related countries to further discuss very important issues.
    Romania
    The Romanian "Spark" newspaper's editorial emphasized: The decisions of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on convening the Geneva conference and on disarmament issues are of great significance. The newspaper also pointed out: The Soviet Union adopted a sincere attitude of consultation at the conference; while the representatives of Western countries, especially the American representative, hoped to use the conference to advance the "European Army" plan, therefore rejecting the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question and the collective security plan, and obstructing the resolution of the Austrian peace treaty issue.
    Hungary
    The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" emphasized: The Berlin conference has ended, but the issues discussed at the conference have not been removed from the agenda. The German question and the Austrian question must be resolved, and peace and European security must be guaranteed!
    Bulgaria
    The Bulgarian "Fatherland Front" newspaper's editorial stated: The Berlin conference achieved certain successes, which is the result of the active and persistent efforts of the Soviet delegation. The Soviet Union proposed at the meeting that a conference be held with the participation of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Britain, and the People's Republic of China. The Soviet Union also suggested that the four countries take measures to find ways to solve the problem of disarmament or substantial reduction of armaments. These proposals received a wide and enthusiastic response around the world, to the extent that Western countries could not completely reject them. On the other hand, Western countries rejected the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question and did not put forward any constructive proposals for resolving international issues. The "Fatherland Front" newspaper also said: The Soviet Union's proposals at the Berlin conference have become the common property of peace-loving people from all walks of life around the world, and there is no doubt that these proposals will receive the strongest support from countries that are closely concerned with maintaining peace.
    West Germany
    Some West German newspapers admitted that many specific proposals put forward by Molotov at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference paved the way for a peaceful solution to the German question and the easing of international tensions. "Free People's Daily" said that the communiqué of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference shows that the method of peaceful consultation is gaining wider recognition. The newspaper emphasized that the suggestions made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov concerning the establishment of pan-German committees in trade, transportation, culture and other fields and on reaching agreements on the number and weapons of East and West German police, etc., directly point out to the Germans the road that should be taken to peacefully resolve the German question for their own interests. Dulles' negative attitude towards all of Molotov's proposals proves that he and Adenauer, who is in collusion with him, do not want to ease international tensions, do not want mutual understanding between Germans, and therefore do not want to peacefully restore German unity.
    "Passau New News" said that the "European Defense Group" is indeed a major obstacle to the peaceful restoration of German unity. The newspaper pointed out that Molotov's plan to guarantee European security can replace the "European Defense Group" treaty. Everything else is just fantasy and propaganda.
    "Aachen New News" wrote: "Only expanding trade relations between East and West is welcome. Until now, extensive trade relations have been helpful in developing peaceful relations between the people of all countries. We hope that we will not turn a deaf ear to Molotov's proposal in Berlin to establish trade relations with the Federal Republic."
    "Prophecy News" said, "Federal Chancellor Adenauer is very much in favor of establishing a unified Europe under the leadership of the United States. We believe that we should strive to establish good relations with all countries. We believe that it is inappropriate to only establish unilateral ties with the United States."
    Indonesia
    Indonesian newspapers commented on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The newspapers emphasized the significance of the agreement to convene a conference in Geneva with the participation of the People's Republic of China. "People's Daily" said in an editorial that the result of the Berlin conference is a victory for the cause of peace and a great victory for common sense. Indonesian Foreign Minister Sunarjo said at a press conference on the 20th that inviting China is a positive factor.

    各国舆论赞扬苏联的和平政策
    四外长会议取得成就是苏联努力的结果
    据新华社讯：许多国家的报纸对柏林四国外长会议的结果发表评论。
    朝鲜
    朝鲜中央通讯社二十一日评论柏林四国外长会议的结果说：“为朝鲜停战的实现所鼓舞的全世界爱好和平的人民一致要求缓和国际紧张局势的呼声以及苏联政府一贯坚持的和平政策，使美、英、法三国政府不得不同意召开柏林四国外长会议。”评论指出：柏林四国外长会议就召开五大国及有关国家参加的日内瓦会议来讨论朝鲜问题和印度支那问题达成了协议，并就普遍裁减军备问题达成了一定的协议。这说明全世界爱好和平的人民对于缓和国际紧张局势所作的努力和苏联政府坚持不渝的和平政策已取得了肯定的成果。评论着重指出：四国外长会议未能就一系列的重要国际问题，其中包括德国问题、保障欧洲安全问题和对奥和约问题达成协议，其责任完全在于美、英、法方面。
    捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论说：苏联在柏林会议中证明了它是热烈希望解决一切国际争端的。它的一切建议都符合于欧洲安全和全世界和平的利益。如果美国侵略集团不阻挠采纳关于迅速解决德国问题和其他问题的建议，这次会议的成果本来可以更大。柏林四国外长会议使得各大国会同有关国家进一步讨论非常重要的问题成为可能。
    罗马尼亚
    罗马尼亚“火花报”的社论着重指出：四国外长会议关于召开日内瓦会议以及关于裁军问题的决定，有重大意义。这个报纸并且指出：苏联在会议上采取了真诚协商的态度；而西方国家的代表，首先是美国代表，则希望利用这个会议来推进“欧洲军”计划，因此拒绝了苏联关于德国问题的建议和集体安全的计划，并且阻挠了对奥和约问题的解决。
    匈牙利
    匈牙利“自由人民报”强调：柏林会议结束了，但是会议上所讨论的问题并没有从日程中除掉。德国问题和奥地利问题必须解决，和平与欧洲的安全必须保证！
    保加利亚
    保加利亚“祖国阵线报”的社论说：柏林会议取得了一定的成就，这是苏联代表团主动坚持努力的结果。苏联在会上提议召开有苏、美、法、英、中华人民共和国参加的会议。苏联还建议四国采取措施，设法解决裁军或大量缩减军备的问题。这些建议获得全世界广泛而热烈的反应，以至西方国家无法完全拒绝。另一方面，西方国家拒绝了苏联关于德国问题的建议，并且没有提出解决国际问题的任何建设性建议。“祖国阵线报”又说：苏联在柏林会议上的建议已成为世界各界和平人士的共同财产，毫无疑问，这些建议将得到密切关心维持和平的各国人民的最有力的支持。
    西　德
    某些西德报纸承认：莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上所提出的许多具体建议，为和平解决德国问题和缓和国际紧张局势问题开辟了道路。“自由人民报”说，四国外长会议公报表明，和平协商的办法日益获得广泛的承认。该报强调指出：苏联外长莫洛托夫所提出的关于成立贸易、运输、文化等方面的全德委员会的建议以及关于就东西德警察的数目和武器达成协议的建议等等，直接向德国人指明了：为了自己的利益而和平解决德国问题，应该走那条道路。杜勒斯对莫洛托夫的一切建议采取了否定的态度，证明他以及跟他串通一气的阿登纳不想缓和国际紧张局势，不想使德国人之间相互谅解，因而也就是不想和平恢复德国的统一。
    “巴骚新报”说，“欧洲防务集团”的确是和平恢复德国统一的大障碍。该报指出，莫洛托夫关于保障欧洲安全的计划可以代替“欧洲防务集团”条约。一切其它的东西都只是一种幻想和宣传而已。
    “亚琛新报”写道：“只有扩大东西方的贸易关系才是受到欢迎的。到现在为止，广泛的贸易关系一直是有助于发展各国人民的和平关系的。我们希望对莫洛托夫在柏林提出的关于与联邦共和国建立贸易关系的主张，不要充耳不闻。”
    “预言报”说，“联邦总理阿登纳颇赞成建立一个在美国领导下的统一的欧洲。我们认为，我们应该努力跟一切国家建立良好的关系。我们认为只跟美国建立片面的联系是不适当的。”
    印　尼
    印度尼西亚报纸评论柏林四国外长会议的结果。报纸强调指出了在日内瓦召开有中华人民共和国参加的会议的协议的意义。“人民日报”在社论中说，柏林会议的结果是和平事业的胜利，是常识的巨大胜利。印度尼西亚外交部部长苏纳约在二十日记者招待会上说，邀请中国是一个积极的因素。
