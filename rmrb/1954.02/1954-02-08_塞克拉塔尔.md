　　"Secretary"
　　By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
　　On the Daban Mountain within the territory of Tekes County, one can often see a person in a blue uniform riding a white horse, galloping on the rugged mountain roads. This is Comrade Wang Lun, the Secretary of the Second District Committee of the CPC Tekes County, who is beloved by the Kazakh people of the Daban Mountain area. Here, whenever the word "Secretary" (i.e., District Committee Secretary) is mentioned, people smile happily, touch their chests with their hands (a national etiquette), and say: "Thank Chairman Mao, he sent us a good cadre!"
　　Wang Lun had some small fluctuations in his thinking. Before he came here, he had expressed his opinion to the organization, requesting not to be transferred here. At that time, he believed that a person who did not understand the local language and was not accustomed to the lifestyle would be unable to work here. However, Wang Lun realized that difficulties were not insurmountable in the face of a Communist Party member. Once he thought of this, he made up his mind and went to the organization department to complete the procedures.
　　The Kazakhs have their own customs. For example, when washing hands, water should not be splashed, but the water on the hands should flow down slowly; when eating, one should not spit; normally, one should not ride a horse towards the yurt... Failure to pay attention to these small things can cause dissatisfaction among the local people. In addition, one must get used to drinking mare's milk and eating lamb.
　　Less than a few days after Wang Lun came to the Second District, the Boerwa (Kazakh) family had a happy event and invited him to participate. Boerwa said, "You are our honored guest. According to our national custom, honored guests must be invited to participate in happy events." On the day of the celebration, the host invited him to sit on a wolf skin-covered seat and presented him with a cooked sheep's head, personally cutting off a sheep's ear and asking him to eat it. This made him very embarrassed. In the end, he decided to eat the sheep's ear.
　　Here, difficulties in work appeared one after another. However, Wang Lun was not intimidated by the difficulties. He thought: Everything can be learned slowly. If you can't learn it in one day, learn it in two days; if one month is not enough, learn it in two months.
　　He first paid attention to fostering good relations with Kazakh cadres, on the one hand, helping them with their work concretely, and on the other hand, learning from them. The year before last, when collecting grain, because the number of livestock had not been counted, the District Chief Teken (Kazakh) decided to collect taxes based on the number of livestock when taxes were collected in the first half of the year. After hearing about this, he immediately went to the District Chief and explained: "If you do this, many herdsmen will suffer." The District Chief asked him why, and he said: "In the past six months, some herdsmen's livestock have decreased, while others have increased. If the collection is based on the numbers from the first half of the year, it will definitely cause dissatisfaction among a few herdsmen." The District Chief said: "We don't have the current numbers, so what should we do! Even if we send someone to count them immediately, I'm afraid it will be too late; moreover, the herdsmen are now living very scattered. This is really troublesome!" After Wang Lun waited for him to finish speaking, he patiently explained to him that cadres should not be afraid of trouble. The District Chief and all the cadres agreed with Wang Lun's opinion and immediately went down to conduct statistics first, and then carried out the collection work.
　　Gradually, many cadres liked to get close to Wang Lun, talk to him about work, and ask Wang Lun to help them with their work. District cadre Duosun Boketi (Kazakh) said to him: "I really hope you can come to my house as a guest, because you tell us many truths." The Third Township Chief said to Wang Lun: "I heard that you can't drink mare's milk, which is very bad. You (referring to the Han people) become friends after drinking wine, and the Kazakh people become friends after drinking mare's milk. In the future, when you drink mare's milk, you must drink it in one gulp, and you won't feel that unpleasant taste." Wang Lun tried drinking it a few times and gradually got used to it. When people heard that the District Committee Secretary could drink mare's milk, they all pulled him into their yurts. Kazakh elder Kulan Bok felt Wang Lun’s shoulder and said: "It seems that you are willing to live with the Kazakh people."
　　Wang Lun spent a lot of energy in order to unite the Kazakh compatriots. Once, he wanted to convene a forum of Ahongs and herdsmen with many livestock to explain the Party's policies towards pastoral areas; but after the invitations were sent out, not many people came to participate. He discussed with the Kazakh cadres how to invite them. The Kazakh cadres believed that the main reason why people didn't come was that they had concerns, and if the District Committee Secretary could personally visit them, the problem would be solved. Because, in their view, going to see them in person was a sign of respect. Wang Lun accepted the cadres' opinions and personally visited those herdsmen who had concerns in their hearts.
　　Bahai is a herdsman from the Third Township, and he has hundreds of livestock. After liberation, he had always been worried that his herd would be confiscated. Wang Lun had invited him to a meeting in the district twice, but he had refused, fearing that he would be detained there. Wang Lun came to see him in person. When Bahai heard that the District Committee Secretary had come to see him, he ran out to greet him and helped Wang Lun off his horse with tears of gratitude in his eyes. The old man frankly asked Wang Lun: "Please tell me the truth, does the herd belong to me or not!" Wang Lun smiled and asked him: "If it's not yours, whose is it? The livestock belonged to you in the past, and they still belong to you now." Bahai savored the District Committee Secretary's question and slowly figured it out.
　　The story of the District Committee Secretary visiting Bahai quickly spread among the herdsmen. There was an Ahong in the Sixth Township named Muhati, who was over seventy years old this year. He has a high reputation among the herdsmen in the whole township. As long as he says a word, no one disobeys. Wang Lun had invited him to attend the meeting, but he excused himself on the grounds that he was old. During the festival, Wang Lun went to visit him in person. When Muhati heard that the District Committee Secretary had come, he ran over happily, held Wang Lun's hands tightly and said: "Unexpected, really unexpected! Today is a festival, and it is also my happy day. I will take out a sheep to make 'Diaoyang' (a kind of game)." From then on, Muhati would say to everyone he met: "Secretary is my friend, we should stand with him and help him with his work."
　　Through Wang Lun's individual visits, many herdsmen's concerns were dispelled. They took the initiative to assist cadres in various tasks. When Sa Hong Bok heard that there were many poisonous snakes on the pasture, he told Wang Lun the method of preventing and controlling poisonous snakes. Every few days, Muhati would ride his horse to find Wang Lun to talk about the current situation in the lives of the herdsmen and their demands.
　　The relationship between Wang Lun and the Kazakh people became closer day by day. When the masses had something to do, they would ask him or ask him to come out and say a word. Last summer, the Kazakh herdsmen on Daban Mountain held a horse racing meeting. The girls ran to the hillsides and forests to collect bright wildflowers, preparing to dedicate them to their beloved "Secretary." When Wang Lun appeared in front of the crowd, he was immediately surrounded, and the girls gave him bouquets of flowers. (Attached picture)

    “塞克拉塔尔”
    本报记者　朱波
    在特克斯县境内的大板山上，经常可以看到一位身着蓝色制服的人，骑着一匹白马奔驰在崎岖的山道上，这就是为大板山区哈萨克族人民所爱戴的中共特克斯县二区区委书记王伦同志。在这里，只要提起“塞克拉塔尔”（即区委书记），人们都幸福地微笑了，用手抚着胸口（一种民族礼节），说：“感谢毛主席，他给我们派来了一位好干部！”
    王伦在思想上曾起过小小的波动。在他到这里以前曾向组织方面提出意见，要求不要把他调到这里来。当时他认为，一个不懂当地语言、生活又不习惯的人在这里是无法工作的。但是，王伦认识到，在一个共产党员面前困难不是不能克服的。一想到这里，他便下了决心，自动到组织部门办了手续。
    哈萨克族有自己的风俗习惯。譬如说，洗手时不能洒水，要使手上的水慢慢地流下去；吃饭时，不能吐口水；平常，不能骑着马向着帐房跑……。要是不注意这些小事情，就会引起当地人民的不满。此外，还得习惯于喝马奶子，吃羊羔肉。
    王伦来二区不到几天，伯尔瓦（哈族）家有喜事，来请他去参加，伯尔瓦说：“你是我们的贵宾。按着我们的民族习惯，有了喜事一定要请贵宾参加。”做喜事的那天，主人请他坐在铺着狼皮的位子上，把煮熟的羊头送到王伦的面前，亲自割下一只羊耳朵请他吃。这使他很为难。最后，他还是下决心把羊耳吃下去了。
    在这里，工作上的困难一个接着一个出现了。但是，王伦没有被困难吓住。他想：什么事情都可以慢慢学会的。一天学不好，就学两天，一个月不行，就学两个月。
    他首先注意搞好和哈族干部的关系，一方面具体地帮助他们进行工作，一方面向他们学习。前年征粮时，因为牲畜数字没有统计，区长特肯（哈族）就决定根据上半年征税时的牲畜数目来征税。他听说后马上就找区长，向区长解释：“如果这样作，会使很多牧民吃亏。”区长问他为什么，他说：“半年来，有些牧民的牲畜减少了，有些牧民的牲畜则有增多。如果按上半年的数字进行征收，一定会引起少数牧民的不满。”区长说：“我们没有现在的数字，那就怎么办呢！即使马上派人去统计，恐怕也来不及了；而且，现在牧民都住得很分散。这可真够麻烦的！”王伦等他说完后，就很耐心地向他解释，说明干部是不能怕麻烦的。区长和全体干部都赞成王伦的意见，并立即下去先进行统计，然后再进行征收工作。
    慢慢地，很多干部都喜欢亲近王伦，找他谈工作，并要求王伦对他们的工作给以帮助。区干部多荪伯克提（哈族）对他说：“我很希望你到我家去作客，因为你告诉我们很多真理。”三乡乡长对王伦说：“我听说你不会喝马奶子，这是很不好的。你们（指汉族）喝了酒会成为朋友，哈萨克族人喝了马奶子也会成为朋友的。以后你喝马奶子的时候，要一口气喝下去，就不会感到那种难闻的味道了。”王伦试喝了几次，慢慢地习惯了。人们听说区委书记能喝马奶子了，都拉他到自己的帐房里去。哈萨克老人库郎伯克拍着王伦的肩头说：“看起来你是愿意和哈萨克人生活在一起的。”
    王伦为了团结哈萨克同胞，曾费了很多的精力。有一回，他要召集阿訇和牲畜多的牧民举行座谈，向他们交代党对牧区的政策；但请帖发出去了，来参加的人却不多，他就和哈族干部商量，怎样才能把他们请来。哈族干部认为，不来的人主要是有顾虑，如果区委书记能亲自拜访他们，问题就解决了。因为，在他们看来，亲自去找是看得起对方的表示。王伦接受了干部们的意见，亲自去拜访那些心里有顾虑的牧民。
    巴海是三乡的一个牧民，他有几百头牲畜。解放后，他一直耽心着他的牧群会被没收。王伦曾两次请他到区上去开会，他都推辞了，怕到了那里被扣押起来。王伦就亲自看望他来了。巴海听说区委书记来看他，就跑出去迎接，流着感激的眼泪把王伦扶下马来。老人很坦白地问王伦：“请你告诉我实话，牧群算不算是我的！”王伦微笑着反问他：“不是你的是谁的？牲畜过去是你的，现在还是你的。”巴海回味着区委书记的反问，慢慢地想开了。
    区委书记访问巴海的故事很快地在牧民中传开了。六乡有一个阿訇，名叫木哈提，今年已七十多岁了。他在全乡牧民中有很高的声望，只要他说一句话，没有一个人不听从的，王伦曾请他参加会议，他借口年纪大推脱了。过节时，王伦就亲自去拜望他，木哈提听说区委书记来了，高兴地跑过来，紧紧地握住王伦的双手说：“想不到，真想不到啊！今天是佳节，也是我的喜日子，我拿出一只羊来做‘刁羊’（一种游戏）”从这以后，木哈提见人就说：“塞克拉塔尔是我的朋友，我们应该和他站在一起，帮助他工作。”
    经过王伦的个别访问，许多牧民的顾虑解除了。他们主动地协助干部做各种工作。撒洪伯克听说牧场上毒蛇多，就把防治毒蛇的方法告诉王伦。木哈提每隔几天就骑上马去找王伦，谈一谈当前牧民生活中的情况和牧民的要求。
    王伦和哈萨克族人的关系，一天比一天密切起来了。群众有了事，都来问他，或者请他出来说一句话。去年夏天，大板山上的哈族牧民举行了赛马大会。姑娘们跑到山坡上、树林里采集鲜艳的野花，准备献给她们心爱的“塞克拉塔尔”。当王伦出现在人群面前的时候，马上就被包围住了，姑娘们把一束一束的鲜花送给他。（附图片）
