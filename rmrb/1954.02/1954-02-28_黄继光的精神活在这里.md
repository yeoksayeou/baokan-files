Huang Jiguang's Spirit Lives Here
Wu Chengyu

Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:

	I have long wanted to write this letter to report to you how the heroic deeds of martyr Huang Jiguang are inspiring the peasants of Dahe Village, Qianjiang County, Sichuan Province, but I have not been able to write it. Recently, I went to that mountain village again, and the enthusiastic scene of the farmers selling their surplus grain to the state for socialism deeply moved me once again, so I decided to write this letter to you.

	It was the year before last: In the cold weather, the news of martyr Huang Jiguang's heroic sacrifice spread to this remote mountain village, stirring the hearts of every farmer. The young militia members said, "The American imperialists killed our brother, we must go and take revenge!" Then forty-three young and middle-aged farmers requested to join the Volunteer Army to go to the Korean front and fight the American devils with you. For those two days, the peaceful mountain village was in an uproar.

	Coincidentally, Guo Yunji, the director of the township farmers' association, came to the village at this time. He said to everyone, "Folks, the front lines produce combat heroes, and we in the rear must strive to be labor models. Producing more grain to support the Volunteer Army and support our country's socialist construction is also resisting America and aiding Korea, and also avenging martyr Huang Jiguang!" At this time, village head He Zhiyun thought of repairing the pond. He said, "We talk about increasing production, but a pond has been in the works for over a year without being built. If it doesn't rain, the crops will wither. Isn't guaranteeing increased production just empty talk?"

	Dear comrades, you don't know. On the southern slope of this village, there is a piece of land as large as nine mu and three fen, which the people call Dongkou Field. Dongkou Field is surrounded by mountains on three sides. Above, there are several trickles of water flowing down; below, there is a vast and fertile rice field. Farmers had long wanted to build a pond here to draw water for irrigation, but this Dongkou Field was occupied by the landlord Zuo Xiangting in the past, so the desire to repair the pond was never realized. After the land reform in 1951, this Dongkou Field returned to the hands of the farmers. In the spring of the year before last, someone proposed repairing the pond, but at that time, everyone was not of one mind and afraid of difficulties, so work was never started.

	When the village chief mentioned it, everyone talked about repairing the pond again. Propagandist Guo Tiansheng said, "It's our fault that we weren't tough enough before and were scared by difficulties. Everyone think about it, martyr Huang Jiguang risked his life for our happy days, are we still afraid of difficulties to repair a pond?" These words immediately boosted everyone's spirits, and they unanimously decided to take advantage of the winter slack to build the pond. When the higher-ups learned about this, they immediately sent water conservancy cadres to help everyone with the design. The county People's Bank also loaned them 7.23 million yuan as expenses for purchasing tools and materials. On the tenth day of the twelfth lunar month of that year, a day of wind and snow, more than two hundred farmers came to Dongkou Field and started work.

	At the construction site, I met an old man with white hair, named An Yuting. Dongkou Field was divided to him during the land reform. At first, everyone thought he was reluctant to exchange this field, but when the village chief talked to him, he said, "Village chief, martyr Huang Jiguang wasn't afraid to sacrifice his life for the people of the whole country, how can I be so selfish!" Not only did he donate Dongkou Field, but he also volunteered to participate in repairing the pond. Li Changchun, a fifteen-year-old child, never lagged behind when working at the construction site. When others asked him why he wanted to repair the pond, he raised his eyebrows, as if unconvinced, and said, "Who doesn't know about resisting America and aiding Korea! We will repair the pond well, produce more grain, and send it to the Volunteer Army uncles so they can eat until they are chubby and eliminate more American devils.... Besides, the grain can also be sent to the workers, so that they can actively build our country and industrialize it as soon as possible. At that time, repairing ponds and dams will use machines, and there will be no need for my shoulders to carry it!" Comrades, you see, how much energy your heroic struggle has added to them!

	The pond was almost repaired, and someone suggested naming it, but what name would be appropriate? For a while, everyone couldn't think of one. One day, Comrade Guo Yunji, the director of the township farmers' association, came to the village again to see the pond being repaired. The farmers asked him to give it a name. He pondered for a moment, then smiled and said, "Folks, this pond of ours was built under the inspiration of martyr Huang Jiguang's spirit, so let's name it 'Huang Jiguang Pond'. After it is completed, erect a stone tablet next to the pond to commemorate the immortal deeds of our heroic soldiers!" The farmers shouted "Good, good, good!" The farmers' association group leader Zhou Minglang volunteered to write the words on the stone tablet, and the stonemason Li Zhengxian volunteered to carve the words on the stone tablet. He said, "I guarantee that the words will be carved deeply, able to withstand the wind and resist the rain, so that even in a communist society, our descendants can see them clearly and forever commemorate martyr Huang Jiguang!"

	On a warm and sunny day, the pond was completely repaired and the stone tablet was also carved. The farmers cheered and carried the stone tablet to erect it next to the pond. A few days later, militia captain and Communist Party member Liu Jisheng planted many pine and cypress trees around the pond, and also planted willows, and bought two loads of fish eggs to put in the pond. He said, "In a few years, 'Huang Jiguang Pond' will be full of green branches and leaves, with trees providing shade, and schools of fish swimming in the pond. Our lives will become even better!"

	In order to realize martyr Huang Jiguang's ideals, last year the farmers of Dahe Village enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the People's Government, launched a patriotic bumper harvest movement, and guaranteed to increase grain production by another 15 to 20 percent on the basis of 1952. Just when the rice was budding and spitting out ears, it hadn't rained heavily for more than two consecutive months, and the green grass on the southern slope had turned yellow from the sun; however, the rice fields irrigated by the water of "Huang Jiguang Pond" were all green and lush, and the rice flowers exuded a clear fragrance. In addition, they adopted advanced experiences such as "sparse seedlings and dense planting" and "rational fertilization", and last year they achieved a rare bumper harvest in twenty years. The seven hundred and thirty-eight loads of fields irrigated by the water of "Huang Jiguang Pond" increased by an average of 50 percent! After studying the general line of our country's transition period, they sold 50,000 catties of surplus grain within three days. On the day of sending the grain, they held high the red flag, beat gongs and drums, and six hundred and more carrying poles lined up from this mountain to that mountain. Three wooden boats, also fully loaded with surplus grain, sped forward on the Xianba River. As they walked, they excitedly discussed the beautiful prospects of socialism. Liu Jisheng said with a smile, "If martyr Huang Jiguang could know about our selling surplus grain, he would definitely be happy and laugh!"

	Dear comrades, martyr Huang Jiguang has sacrificed, but his spirit will live forever, living in the bodies of the thousands upon thousands of Volunteer Army soldiers on the Korean front, and also living in the hearts of the thousands upon thousands of people in the motherland. This spirit is encouraging people to strive for martyr Huang Jiguang's ideal – a happy and fulfilling socialist society.

### 黄继光的精神活在这里

    黄继光的精神活在这里
    吴澄宇亲爱的志愿军同志们：
    我很久就想写这封信，向你们报告黄继光烈士的英雄事迹，是在如何鼓舞着四川省黔江县大河村的农民，但一直没有写成。最近，我又到了那个山村，那里的农民为了社会主义把余粮卖给国家的热烈情形，又一次把我深深打动，所以我决心要给你们写这封信。
    说起来，已经是前年的事情了：正在冷天，黄继光烈士英勇牺牲的消息，传到了这个僻远的山村，激动着每一个农民的心，年青的自卫队员们说：“美帝国主义打死了我们的哥哥，我们要去跟他报仇！”接着就有四十三个青壮年农民要求报名参加志愿军到朝鲜前线去，和你们一块打美国鬼子。那两天，平静的山村，顿时沸腾了起来。
    碰巧这时候，乡农会主任郭云吉来到村里。他对大家说：“老乡们，前方出战斗英雄，我们在后方要争取当劳动模范。多打粮食，支援志愿军，支援咱们国家的社会主义建设，同样也是抗美援朝，也是替黄继光烈士报仇！”这时，村长何治云又想到修塘的事。他说：“我们一说增产，二说增产，一口塘闹了一年多都修不起来，天不下雨，庄稼就要枯死，保证增产不是说空话吗？”
    亲爱的同志们，你们是不知道的。在这个村的南山坡上，有一块九亩三分地那么大的地方，老百姓都管它叫做洞口田。洞口田三面环山，上边，有几股浸水流下来；下边，是一片广阔肥沃的稻田。农民很早就想在这里修建一口塘，引水浇地，可是这块洞口田过去叫地主左相廷霸占着，因此修塘的愿望一直没有实现。一九五一年土地改革后，这块洞口田重新回到了农民的手里。前年春天，有人曾提议修塘，但是，那时大家的心不齐，怕困难，一直没有动工。
    村长一提，大家又谈起修塘的事来了。宣传员郭田胜说：“怪我们以前骨头不硬，被困难吓住啦。大家想想，黄继光烈士为了我们的幸福日子，把自己的命都拼上了，我们修口塘，还怕困难吗？”这些话，一下就把大家的劲鼓起来了，一致决定乘着冬闲把塘修起。上级知道了这件事，马上就派来了水利干部，帮助大家设计。县人民银行也贷给他们七百二十三万元的款子，作为购买工具和材料的费用。就在那年旧历腊月初十，一个风雪漫天的日子，两百多个农民来到洞口田，开始动工了。
    在工地上，我碰到了一个头发花白的老汉，叫安玉廷。洞口田是土地改革时分给他的，起初，大家都以为他舍不得调换这块田，可是村长去和他谈时，他说：“村长，黄继光烈士为了全国人民，牺牲性命都不怕，我还能这样自私！”他把洞口田献出来不说，还自动报名来参加修塘。李长春，是一个十五岁的孩子，在工地上干活，从来不落人后。别人问他为什么要修塘，他把眉毛一扬，好像很不服气地说：“谁不知道抗美援朝呀！我们把塘修好，多打粮食，送给志愿军叔叔吃得胖胖的，多消灭几个美国鬼子……。再说，粮食还可以送给工人，叫他们积极建设咱们的国家，早点工业化，那时，要再修塘修堰就要用机器啦，还用得着我这肩膀挑！”同志们，你们看，你们英勇奋斗的精神，给他们增添了多大的劲头啊！
    塘快修好了，有人建议给它取个名字，但什么名字才恰当呢？一时大家都想不出来。有一天，乡农会主任郭云吉同志又来村里看修塘了。农民请他取个名字。他沉思了一下，笑着说：“老乡们，我们这口塘，是在黄继光烈士的精神鼓舞下修起来的，我们就把它取名叫做‘黄继光塘’吧，修成后，在塘边立块石碑，以纪念我们英雄战士不朽的事迹！”农民连声呼叫“好，好，好！”农会小组长周明朗自动报名给石碑上写字，石工李正先自动报名给石碑刻字。他说：“我保证把字刻得深深的，能经得起风吹，顶得住雨打，就是到了共产主义社会，也管叫我们的子孙看得清楚，永远纪念着黄继光烈士！”
    在一个日暖风和的日子里，塘全部修好了，石碑也刻好了，农民欢呼着把石碑抬来，竖立在塘边。隔了几天，民兵队长、共产党员刘吉胜，又在塘的周围栽植了很多的松树和柏树，还插上杨柳，又买了两挑鱼卵放在塘里。他说：“再过几年呀，
  ‘黄继光塘’准是青枝绿叶，树木成荫，鱼儿成群，我们的生活，也会变得更加美好！”
    为了实现黄继光烈士的理想，去年大河村的农民热烈响应了党和人民政府的号召，展开了爱国丰产运动，保证在一九五二年的基础上，再增产一成半到两成粮食。就在稻谷含苞吐穗的时候，接连两个多月没有落过透雨，南山坡上的青草都叫晒黄了；可是，得到“黄继光塘”水灌溉的一片稻田，禾苗都是绿油油的，稻花散放着清香。再加上他们采用了“少秧密植”、“合理施肥”等先进经验，去年他们获得了二十年来少见的丰收。得到“黄继光塘”水灌溉的七百三十八挑田，平均增产了五成！学习了咱们国家过渡时期的总路线以后，三天之内他们就卖了余粮五万斤。送粮的那一天，他们高举着红旗、敲着锣鼓，六百多条扁担，从山这边排到山那边。三支木船，也满载着余粮，在宪坝河上急驶前进。他们一边走，一边兴奋地谈论着社会主义的美丽远景。刘吉胜笑着说：“要是黄继光烈士能够知道我们卖余粮的事情，一定要高兴得笑哩！”
    亲爱的同志们，黄继光烈士牺牲了，他的精神永远活着，活在朝鲜前线千千万万志愿军的身上，也活在祖国千千万万人民的心里，这种精神正在鼓舞人们为黄继光烈士的理想——幸福美满的社会主义社会而奋斗。
