Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 16th: The Korean-Chinese side today proposed that the Committee for Assisting Displaced Civilians to Return Home hold a meeting on the 17th, with both sides exchanging material regarding the estimated number of displaced civilians and foreign nationals each side is prepared to assist in crossing the border to the other's area. Due to the U.S. side's request for a one-day postponement for administrative reasons, the Committee for Assisting Displaced Civilians to Return Home will hold a meeting on the 18th. The "Understanding on Administrative Details Regarding Assisting Displaced Civilians to Return Home and Foreign Nationals to Go to Areas Controlled by the Other Side," approved by the Military Armistice Commission, stipulates that the work of assisting displaced civilians and foreign nationals to cross the Military Demarcation Line to the other side's area should begin on March 1st, and both sides should exchange relevant materials ten days prior to the aforementioned date.

It has been learned here that the registration work for foreign nationals wishing to go to the other side's area by the local organs of state power in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been completed. A small number of displaced civilians who were displaced in areas under our military control during the war, due to their having settled down and lived happily under the care and attention of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, are unwilling to return to South Korea under the dark rule of Li Seung-man. So far, no displaced civilians have applied for registration with the local civil affairs authorities.

Article 59 of the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates: Both Commanders shall, after the Armistice Agreement becomes effective, permit and assist civilians who are residing in areas under their respective control and who, as a result of the war, have become displaced, to return home, should they so desire, and shall permit and assist the return to their own side of all those captured Korean civilians who express a desire to return. However, the Li Seung-man clique has openly stated that it will detain large numbers of displaced civilians in South Korea, claiming "it will never hand over these people." According to reports from U.S. and British news agencies from Seoul, among the more than 1.5 million displaced civilians in South Korea, as of February 15th, only "about 70 people" had been allowed to return home after "screening."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th: The Korean Central News Agency issued a press communique stating: The local organs of state power in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have registered foreign nationals willing to return to the military control area of the other side. Most of the foreign nationals in our area were repatriated with the assistance of the Soviet government in the first half of 1953.

Registration work is also currently underway in various locations for displaced civilians wishing to return home. There are very few displaced civilians in our area, and until now, no displaced civilians have registered because they wish to return home.

Due to the U.S. side's policy of massively abducting our civilians during the war, there are now a large number of our civilians displaced in various parts of South Korea. According to Reuters, the South Korean government openly admits that there are at least 1.5 million of our displaced civilians wandering in South Korea, but at the same time says that it will never return these people. Therefore, the "Korean Civil Affairs Guidance Office" in Busan announced on January 31st that only 33 of our displaced civilians had registered to return to our side.

    朝鲜协助失所平民返乡委员会将举行会议
    李承晚匪帮公开表示要扣留大批失所平民
   【新华社开城十六日电】朝中方面今天建议协助失所平民返乡委员会在十七日举行会议，双方交换关于各方准备协助越界前往对方地区的失所平民及外籍平民的概数的材料。由于美方以行政性理由要求延期一天，协助失所平民返乡委员会将在十八日举行会议。军事停战委员会批准的“关于协助失所平民返乡及外籍平民前往对方控制地区的行政细节谅解”规定：协助失所平民及外籍平民越过军事分界线前往对方地区的工作应在三月一日开始，双方应在上述日期的十天以前交换有关的材料。
    据此间获悉，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各地政权机关对前往对方地区的外籍平民的登记工作已经结束。在战争期间流离在我方军事控制地区的少数失所平民，由于他们已在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的关怀和照顾下安居乐业，都不愿回到李承晚黑暗统治下的南朝鲜去。到现在为止，没有失所平民向各地民政当局申请登记。
    朝鲜停战协定第五十九款规定：双方司令官在停战后应准许并协助在战争中流离失所、愿意返乡的平民越过军事分界线返回家乡。但是李承晚集团已经公开表示将扣留大批流离在南朝鲜的失所平民，声称“它决不交出这些人”。据美英通讯社发自汉城的消息透露，在南朝鲜各地的一百五十万以上的失所平民中，到二月十五日为止，经过“甄别”后被准许还乡的只有“约七十人”。【新华社平壤十五日电】朝鲜中央通讯社发表新闻公报说：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国各地政权机关已对愿意返回对方军事控制地区的外籍平民进行登记。在我方地区的大部分外籍平民在一九五三年上半年就已在苏联政府的协助下被遣返。
    对愿意返乡的失所平民的登记工作，目前也正在各地进行中。在我方地区的失所平民为数极少，直到现在还没有失所平民因愿意返乡而进行登记。
    由于美方在战争时期实行了大批掳走我方平民的政策，现在有大批我方平民流落在南朝鲜各地。据路透社报道，南朝鲜政府公开承认，流浪在南朝鲜的我方失所平民至少有一百五十万人，但同时却又说，决不交还这些人。因此，釜山的“朝鲜民政辅导处”于一月三十一日宣布说，仅有三十三名我方失所平民为了返回我方而进行了登记。
