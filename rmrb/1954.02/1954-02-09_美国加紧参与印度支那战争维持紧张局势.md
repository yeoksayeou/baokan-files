Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: The intensified interference and participation of the U.S. government is the main reason for the continued bloodshed in Indochina.

    The U.S. Department of Defense issued a statement on the 6th saying that the U.S. "has decided to expedite the delivery of B-26 bombers to the French Air Force in Indochina." The statement also announced that the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" in Indochina, which already includes more than 400 personnel, would be expanded by 200 more. It is understood that forty U.S. B-26 bombers are already en route to Indochina.

    This is just one of the long-rumored methods of U.S. participation in the Indochina War. According to reports, the day before the Department of Defense issued its statement, the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, presented some methods of participation in a closed-door meeting of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. It is said that the methods the U.S. will adopt include: increasing material assistance to France by supplying aircraft, light tonnage vessels, and redeploying U.S. Air Force technicians; direct assistance from the Air Force and Navy, etc.

    In fact, since the U.S. government was forced to agree to an armistice in Korea, it has intensified its interference and participation in the Indochina War as an important means of maintaining international tension. Senior U.S. government officials and generals have never concealed their intention to continue the Indochina War, and openly opposed a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. The "New York Herald Tribune" wrote: "From the very deep meaning of American interests, this war is precisely our war." When Paris generally felt that "since the United States can negotiate an armistice in Korea, there is no understandable reason why the French should not do so in Indochina," the "New York Times" blatantly admitted on the 5th: "We have exerted enormous pressure on France to continue resisting the Communists in Indochina instead of negotiating with them."

### 美国加紧参与印度支那战争维持紧张局势

    美国加紧参与印度支那战争维持紧张局势
    【新华社八日讯】美国政府的加紧干涉和参与，是印度支那继续流血的主要原因。
    美国国防部六日发表一项声明说：美国“已经决定加紧把B二十六型轰炸机送交印度支那的法国空军”。声明并宣布将在印度支那的已经包括四百多人的美国“军事援助顾问团”扩充二百名人员。据悉，有四十架美国的B二十六型轰炸机已在运往印度支那途中。
    这仅是传闻已久的美国参与印度支那战争的办法之一。有消息说，在国防部发表声明的前一天，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在美国参院军事委员会秘密会议中曾提出一些参与的办法。据说，美国将采用的办法有：用供给飞机、轻吨船只和重新派遣美国空军技术人员的方式，来增加对法国的物质援助；空军和海军的直接援助等等。
    事实上，美国政府自从被迫同意在朝鲜实行停战之后，就加紧干涉和参与印度支那战争作为维持国际紧张局势的重要手段。美国政府的高级官员们和将军们，一直不掩饰他们继续印度支那战争的意图，公然反对和平解决印度支那问题。“纽约先驱论坛报”曾写道：“从美国利益这一极深刻的意义说来，这个战争正是我们的战争。”当巴黎普遍感到“既然美国能在朝鲜谈判停战，那就没有说得通的理由认为法国人在印度支那不应这样做”时，“纽约时报”五日赤裸裸地承认：“我们已对法国施以巨大的压力，使它在印度支那继续抵抗共产党，而不去与他们谈判。”
