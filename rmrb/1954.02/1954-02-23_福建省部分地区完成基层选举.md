    福建省部分地区完成基层选举
    福建省厦门市和龙溪、闽侯等专区的基层选举工作已基本结束。龙溪专区已有七百十六个乡、镇完成了选举，其余一百五十个乡、镇也即将完成。闽侯专区也有五百一十四个乡、镇完成了选举。
    在普选运动中，广大人民群众都以国家主人翁的态度积极参加选举。厦门市每个选区参加选举的选民都在百分之九十以上。龙溪专区的不完全统计，两百多个乡内都有百分之九十以上的选民参加选举。云霄、华安等县有三十多个选区的选民百分之百地参加了投票。在举行选举那一天，各地人民都像庆祝节日一样地兴高采烈，打扮得整整齐齐地去参加选举。各地选出来的人民代表都是经过选民充分酝酿讨论、一致认为最满意的优秀人物。如长泰县四十八个乡所选出的人民代表中，有二十三人曾获得各种模范的光荣称号。
    完成普选的地区，群众互助合作的积极性和生产热情更加高涨。海澄县的十四个乡普选后，在人民代表推动下，整顿、巩固了八十四个互助组，扩大了九十个互助组，增加了组员三百零九人。同时，还有十八个互助组要求成立农业生产合作社。连江县贵安乡的农民在普选期间，把全乡两千多亩的稻根全部挖毁，百分之八十五的田地翻犁一遍，还修好了一条八里长的水圳。普选以后，人民中团结友爱的风气也更加发扬了。厦门市关禾街八卦埕妇女卢芝凤因分娩后染病，孩子没人照料，附近的居民便把卢芝凤送进医院，并代她照管孩子。卢芝凤对人民政府和大家的关心，表示十分感谢。
