    Editor's Note: The reading group of the Secretariat of the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Culture and readers such as Yu Guishen wrote to inquire about the Comrades' Trial Committees in Production Enterprises. After consulting with the Specialized Court Division of the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government, we provide the following answers.
    Regarding Several Questions About Comrades' Trial Committees in Production Enterprises

    Q: What is the nature of the Comrades' Trial Committees in Production Enterprises? How are they different from the People's Courts?

    A: The Comrades' Trial Committees in Production Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as Comrades' Trial Committees) are mass self-education organizations of the workers and staff in production enterprises. The members and chairpersons of the Comrades' Trial Committees are elected from the workers and staff, and they work under the leadership of the trade union and the guidance of the local People's Court. On the one hand, the Comrades' Trial Committees are responsible for handling matters related to labor and production discipline among the workers and staff of their unit (which must be submitted by the administrative leadership or approved by the administrative leadership in advance), such as violations of labor discipline, minor responsibility accidents, minor theft, and disputes among employees. The methods of sanction and education are generally: public criticism, admitting mistakes and apologizing, warnings, and making recommendations to the administrative leaders of the production enterprise for administrative punishments such as demerits, salary reduction, demotion, dismissal, or expulsion. On the other hand, they regularly conduct publicity and education among the workers and staff regarding compliance with state laws and labor discipline. The purpose of these two tasks is to educate the workers and staff to consciously abide by labor discipline, earnestly implement state laws, promote enthusiasm for production, and boost production. Comrades' Trial Committees are different from the People's Courts. The People's Courts are organs that exercise judicial power on behalf of the state, while the Comrades' Trial Committees are self-education organizations that workers and staff organize themselves. However, Comrades' Trial Committees are also different from ordinary criticism and self-criticism meetings because the disciplinary education and sanctions carried out through trial methods have a certain degree of compulsion, and those who are sanctioned have an obligation to obey.

    Q: Why do we need to establish Comrades' Trial Committees in industrial and mining enterprises? What benefits do they bring to production?

    A: Our country's general line during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a considerable period and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. To accomplish this great historical task, we must first rely on our working class to have a higher level of political consciousness. In the past, during the period of restoring the national economy and in various social reform movements, our working class has always worked loyally and enthusiastically with a sense of ownership, creating huge wealth for the country. However, there are also a small number of workers and staff who, due to the influence of the old society and non-proletarian ideologies, still engage in behaviors such as absenteeism, tardiness, leaving early, lax work, failure to cherish tools and raw materials, failure to pay attention to product quality, violation of safety regulations and operating procedures, and even fighting and theft. This is one of the important reasons why the production plans of some units are difficult to complete, product quality is low, there are many defective products, and accidents occur frequently. These undesirable phenomena not only cause losses to state property but also seriously endanger the safety of workers and staff, and are therefore opposed by the broad masses of workers and staff. Some incidents are difficult to resolve with general criticism and education methods, but sending them to court for punishment is too severe. It is very necessary and effective to educate those who commit such mistakes through the mass trial method of the Comrades' Trial Committees. The resolution of the Second National Judicial Conference decided to conduct key pilot projects for the establishment of Comrades' Trial Committees in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises with strong leadership, gain experience, and promote them. In accordance with the spirit of this resolution, in 1953, pilot projects for the establishment of Comrades' Trial Committees began in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Tangshan, Anshan, Shenyang, Dalian, Fushun, and other places. Judging from the pilot projects in various places, they have played a good role in educating workers and staff, consolidating labor discipline, and promoting production. Among the seventeen people educated by the Comrades' Trial Committee of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, except for three who progressed slowly, the remaining fourteen progressed very quickly. Jia Shanbao, a worker from a factory in Dalian, actively engaged in production after being educated and broke the factory's production record. A team in a factory in Anshan was unable to complete its production tasks on time in the past. After the Comrades' Trial Committee educated one of the workers in the team, the political consciousness of all the workers in the team was improved, and they are now completing 140% of their production tasks. Some of the workers and staff who attended the trial as observers even automatically confessed their mistakes. Therefore, the Comrades' Trial Committees have been supported by the leaders of industrial and mining enterprises and the broad masses of workers and staff.

    Q: How should Comrades' Trial Committees be established? How should Comrades' Trial Committees work?

    A: According to the pilot projects in various places, the Comrades' Trial Committees are generally established by the trade union with the active assistance and guidance of the local court (where specialized courts are established, it is best to establish Comrades' Trial Committees at the same time). The steps are: first, understand the situation and conduct publicity; then, organize and mobilize the workers and staff, and based on everyone's full understanding and desire to establish a committee, deliberate and conduct elections. The number of members of the Comrades' Trial Committee should be determined according to the size of the unit (industrial and mining enterprise or workshop) and the complexity of the situation, ranging from five to eleven people. The qualifications of the members are generally that they should have a clear history, a firm stand, a correct work style, be active in production, consistently abide by labor discipline, be good at contacting the masses, and be able to bravely criticize and self-criticize. The election of members should be nominated by the broad masses of workers and staff. However, during the pilot project period, it is generally nominated jointly by the party organization, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the unit, and after deliberation and discussion by the workers and staff, the election is conducted by voting or raising hands at the workers' congress or workers' representative meeting. The chairperson is then elected by the elected members. The procedure for handling incidents is: first, select typical cases, conduct in-depth investigation and research, clarify the facts and evidence, make preparations, and conduct public trials on the basis of education and awareness. During the trial, workers and staff or workers' representatives can be invited to participate and speak freely to expand the educational impact. The details and nature of the wrongdoings of the accused, the results of the handling, and the direction of efforts should be written into a written material, signed and sealed by the chairperson and members, and a copy should be sent to the relevant personnel department for supervision and verification.

### 关于生产企业同志审判会的几个问题

专栏：答读者问

    编者按：江苏省文化局秘书科读报小组和读者于贵深等来信询问有关生产企业同志审判会的问题，经我们与中央人民政府司法部专门法院司研究后，作如下答复。
    关于生产企业同志审判会的几个问题
    问：生产企业同志审判会的性质怎样？它和人民法院有什么不同？
    答：生产企业同志审判会（以下简称同志审判会）是生产企业职工群众性的自我教育组织。同志审判会的委员和主席，从职工群众中选举产生，在工会的领导和所在地人民法院的指导下进行工作。同志审判会一方面负责处理本单位职工群众间有关劳动、生产纪律的事件（须是行政领导提交或先经行政领导同意的），如违反劳动纪律、轻微的责任事故、轻微的盗窃和职工间的纠纷等；其制裁、教育方法一般是：当众批评、认错道歉、警告，以及向生产企业行政领导提出记过、降薪、降职、撤职或开除等行政处分的建议。另一方面，经常向职工群众进行遵守国家法令和劳动纪律的宣传教育工作。进行这两种工作的目的，都是为了教育职工群众自觉地遵守劳动纪律，切实执行国家法令，发扬生产的积极性，推动生产。同志审判会不同于人民法院。人民法院是代表国家执行审判职权的机关，而同志审判会则是职工群众自己组织起来的自我教育组织。但同志审判会也不同于一般的批评、检讨会，因为它通过审判方式所进行的纪律教育和制裁，有一定的强制性，受制裁的人有服从的义务。
    问：为什么我们要在工矿企业中建立同志审判会？它对生产有什么好处？
    答：我们国家在过渡时期的总路线，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。要完成这一伟大的历史任务，首先要依靠我们工人阶级有更高的政治觉悟。过去在恢复国民经济时期及各种社会改革运动中，我们工人阶级都是以主人翁的态度，忠诚热情地劳动，给国家创造了巨大的财富。但也有少数职工，由于受旧社会和非无产阶级思想的影响，还有着旷工，迟到，早退，工作松懈，不爱护工具、原料，不注意产品质量，违反保安规程和操作规程，甚至斗殴和盗窃等行为。这就是某些单位的生产计划难以完成，产品低，废品多，事故频繁的重要原因之一。这些不良的现象，不但使国家财产遭受损失，还严重地危害到职工生命的安全，因此为广大职工群众所反对。有一些事件，用一般批评教育方法难以收效，送法院惩办又嫌过重；通过同志审判会群众性的审判方式来教育犯这种过错的人是十分必要而有效的。第二届全国司法会议决议中，决定在领导较强的国营工矿企业重点试建同志审判会，取得经验，进行推广。根据这个决议的精神，一九五三年已在唐山、鞍山、沈阳、旅大、抚顺等地国营工矿企业中开始试建同志审判会。从各地试建情况看来，已起了教育职工、巩固劳动纪律和推动生产的良好作用。鞍山钢铁公司通过同志审判会教育的十七人，除三名进步较慢外，其余十四名进步很快。旅大某厂工人贾善宝受教育后，积极生产，打破了全厂的生产纪录。鞍山某厂的一个班，过去不能按期完成生产任务，通过同志审判会教育了其中的一名工人后，提高了全班工人的政治觉悟，现在完成生产任务百分之一百四十。审判时参加旁听的职工，有的还自动检讨了自己的过错。因此，同志审判会受到了工矿企业领导和职工群众的拥护。
    问：怎样建立同志审判会？同志审判会应该怎样进行工作？
    答：根据各地试建情况，同志审判会一般是由工会主持，在当地法院的积极协助和指导下建立起来的（试建专门法院的地方，最好同时建立同志审判会）。步骤是：首先了解情况，作好宣传；然后组织与动员职工群众，在大家有了充分认识和建立要求的基础上酝酿并进行选举。同志审判会的委员人数，按单位（工矿企业或车间）大小，情况繁简来决定，少的五人，多的十一人上下。委员条件一般要历史清楚，立场坚定，作风正派，生产积极，一贯遵守劳动纪律，善于联系群众并能勇于批评和自我批评。委员的选举，应该由广大职工群众提名；不过在试建期间，一般是先经本单位党组织、行政、工会、青年团联合提名，经职工群众酝酿讨论后，在职工大会上或职工代表会上用投票或举手方法进行选举。主席则由选出的委员中互推选定。处理事件的程序，首先要选好典型事例，进行深入的调查研究，弄清事实、证据，作好准备工作，在教育与自觉的基础上，进行公开审判。审判时可邀请职工群众或职工代表参加，自由发言，以扩大教育影响。被审人的过错情况和性质、处理结果和努力方向等应写成书面材料，由主席、委员署名盖章，并另制副本分送该管人事部门，以便监督和查考。
