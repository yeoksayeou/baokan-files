The Central South Region is universally carrying out inspections of stored grain. Currently, the amount of grain stored by the state in the Central South Region is more than double the highest storage amount last year. Large quantities of grain sold by farmers continue to be delivered to granaries. This grain has not yet been transported and is mostly scattered in rural areas. Many warehouses are rented civilian houses or ancestral halls and temples. Under these circumstances, if storage is not carefully managed, it can easily become moldy. The importance of this issue has attracted the attention of the CCP committees and government departments in various parts of the Central South Region. From January 18th to 26th, the Central South Region held a special conference on grain storage work, deciding to universally inspect grain storage. Based on this decision, counties in Hunan Province and thirty counties in Jiangxi Province have conducted a universal inspection of the grain stored in their granaries. In Henan Province, management personnel from more than twenty county-level granaries are taking advantage of the winter seasonal winds to spread and air out stored grain, reducing its moisture content. Farmers in grain storage locations in Hunan, Guangdong, Hubei and other places have shown enthusiastic concern and a high sense of responsibility for the safety of state grain storage, and have successively established grain protection organizations to participate in grain protection work. Hunan Province has established 889 grain protection committees and more than 5,000 grain protection groups, with more than 40,000 militiamen and farmers participating in the work of protecting granaries.

The CCP committees, People's Governments, grain departments, and cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province are actively strengthening grain storage and defense work.

First, the work of transferring grain and consolidating warehouses has been carried out in a planned manner. In addition to leaving grain to supply local households in need according to plan, the rest has been gradually concentrated in larger warehouses with better storage conditions. Some counties have also combined warehouse consolidation with turning and airing the grain. For example, the grain stored in the Bahe Grain Store in Xishui County originally had a moisture content of 13.2% and a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius. After transfer and airing, the moisture content dropped to 12.8% and the temperature dropped to 37 degrees Celsius. Second, the storage and defense work has been strengthened for grain that has already been concentrated or is awaiting concentration. The main measures are to establish and improve the storage system and implement a division of labor and responsibility system. For example, each grain storage point of the Wangci District Cooperative in Xishui County has assigned one or two people to be specifically responsible for storage. Storage cadres said: "This makes it easier to concentrate on storage and prevent problems with the grain." Work enthusiasm has been improved. Third, inspection work has been strengthened. For example, Deye County first conducted a general inspection of the grain quality in the Chengguan warehouse at the end of December last year. Then, four inspection teams were organized to go to the countryside to conduct inspections and assist rural granaries in carrying out warehouse consolidation and storage work. The Huangpi County People's Supervision Committee also assigned cadres to be specifically responsible for understanding the grain storage situation. At the same time, regular inspection systems have been reorganized and established in various places. For example, the Xishui County leadership has established grain condition registration books in all warehouses in the county, and special personnel are assigned to regularly inspect the warehouses, promptly put forward improvement suggestions when problems are found. In addition, Hubei Province has also strengthened the political and ideological education of storage and defense personnel, and strengthened the reward and punishment system.

    中南区普遍检查库存粮食质量
    湖北省有计划地调集粮食并加强保管工作
    中南区普遍进行储存粮食的检查工作。目前，中南区内国家储存保管的粮食，比去年最高的储存量增加了一倍以上。农民出售的大批粮食，还在继续送入粮库。这些粮食目前还没有来得及调运，多分散在农村，不少仓库又是租用的民房或祠堂、庙宇，在这种情况下，如不注意保管，很容易霉坏。这一问题的重要性，已引起中南各地中共党委和政府部门的注意。中南区在一月十八日到二十六日专门召开了粮食保管工作会议，决定普遍检查一次存粮情况。根据这个决定湖南省各县和江西省的三十个县已将各粮仓的存粮进行了一次普遍检查。河南省有二十多个县的基层粮仓的管理人员，利用冬季季候风，将存粮摊晾过风，降低了存粮水分。湖南、广东、湖北等地粮食储存地点的农民，对国家储粮的安全，表现出热诚的关怀和高度的责任心，他们纷纷成立护仓组织，参加护粮工作。湖南省已成立了八百八十九个护粮委员会和五千多个护粮小组，有四万多个民兵和农民参加了保护粮仓的工作。　（据新华社讯）
    湖北省各地中共党委、人民政府和粮食部门、合作社积极加强粮食保管和保卫工作。
    首先，有计划地进行了调集粮食和并仓工作。各地除按计划留下供应当地缺粮户的粮食外，其余都陆续集中到保管条件较好的大仓库。有些县还结合并仓，翻晒了粮食。如浠水县巴河粮店存粮原来含水分百分之十三点二，温度三十九度，经过运转翻晒，水分降到百分之十二点八，温度降到三十七度。其次，对于已经集中或尚待集中的粮食，加强了保管和保卫工作。主要是建立和健全保管制度，实行分工负责制。如浠水县王祠区合作社的各存粮点都派了一、二人负保管专责。保管干部说：“这样就好一心一意保管，不让粮食发生问题。”工作积极性都提高了。第三，加强检查工作。如大冶县于去年十二月底首先对城关仓库的粮质等普遍进行了检查。然后组织四个检查组，分头下乡进行检查，并协助农村粮库开展并仓和保管工作。黄陂县人民监察委员会并抽出干部专门负责了解粮食保管情况。同时，各地并整顿和建立了经常的检查制度。如浠水县领导方面在全县各仓库设立了粮情登记簿，并由专人定期到仓库进行检查，发现问题，及时提出改进意见。此外，湖北各地还加强了对保管和保卫人员的政策思想教育，加强了奖惩制度。
