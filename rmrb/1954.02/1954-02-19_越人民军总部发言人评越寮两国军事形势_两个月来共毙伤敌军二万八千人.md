Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: According to Vietnam News Agency on February 17th, the spokesperson of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army made a statement to reporters, commenting on the military situation in Vietnam and Laos during last winter and this spring.

The spokesperson said: In the past winter and this spring, the Vietnam People's Army has achieved a series of victories on various battlefields in Vietnam, and the Lao People's Liberation Army has also achieved brilliant results in northern, central, and southern Laos. In the past two months, the enemy suffered 28,000 casualties in the battlefields of Vietnam and Laos. The Vietnam People's Army liberated 24,000 square kilometers of land and the provinces of Lai Chau and Kon Tum, with a population of more than 300,000. According to a communique issued by the Lao Resistance Government, the Lao People's Liberation Army liberated the Nam Ou River basin in northern Laos, most of the Khammouane province in central Laos, the northern part of Savannakhet province, and the Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos. The liberated areas of Laos now total approximately 100,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately one million.

At the same time, our guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines has been strengthened. In the Red River Delta, the Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien areas of central Vietnam, especially the guerrilla bases in South Vietnam, have also expanded.

The spokesperson then talked about the implementation of the "Navarre Plan," saying that the "Navarre Plan" is to concentrate elite troops, carry out large-scale "mopping-up operations" in their rear, and launch frequent invasions of the liberated areas in an attempt to gain the initiative in combat. However, Navarre is now forced to passively dispatch his regular troops to Dien Bien Phu in northwestern Vietnam to cope with the situation, then to Seno in central Laos, and recently to Luang Prabang in northern Laos.

In order to save the current critical situation, Navarre launched an invasion of Tuy Hoa in the Fifth Interzone of central Vietnam, but after suffering a heavy defeat in the highlands, he had to transfer some of his elite troops to Pleiku to defend this stronghold. When the enemy is threatened in one place, they hurriedly dispatch regular troops; but the Vietnam People's Army and the Lao People's Liberation Army always seek out the weakest and most exposed strongholds of the enemy to launch attacks and eliminate them. Therefore, we have always maintained the initiative in combat, while the enemy has become increasingly passive and suffered increasingly disastrous defeats.

The spokesperson exposed the French colonialists' deceptive propaganda, saying that the enemy is very embarrassed by their successive failures. French military communiques often remain silent or try to cover up important events such as the enemy's retreat from Kon Tum city and the annihilation of the enemy in Attopeu in southern Laos. French newspapers and news agencies insist that Lai Chau, Kon Tum, the Nam Ou River basin, Thakhek, Route 9, and the Bolaven Plateau have lost their importance, or that these places have no strategic significance. But these clumsy methods of the French cannot deceive anyone.

The spokesperson finally pointed out: At present, the enemy is trying to save his defeat. Many French military leaders have come to Vietnam one after another, and their masters, the American interventionists, are further interfering in the Indochina War. The Vietnamese military and civilians must be vigilant, annihilate more enemy's active forces, strengthen guerrilla warfare in the rear areas, and actively consolidate the liberated areas. In this way, we will surely be able to crush the military conspiracies of the French and American imperialists and achieve greater victories in this spring's campaigns.

### 越人民军总部发言人评越寮两国军事形势  两个月来共毙伤敌军二万八千人

    越人民军总部发言人评越寮两国军事形势
    两个月来共毙伤敌军二万八千人
      【新华社十八日讯】据越南通讯社十七日讯：越南人民军总司令部发言人对记者发表谈话，评述去冬今春的越、寮两国军事形势。
    发言人说：在去冬今春，越南人民军在越南各战场上取得了一连串的胜利，寮国人民解放军也在寮国的北部、中部和南部取得了辉煌的战绩。过去两个月中，敌人在越南和寮国战场上共伤亡二万八千人。越南人民军解放了土地面积共计二万四千平方公里和有三十多万人口的莱州省和昆嵩省。据寮国抗战政府发表的公报说，寮国人民解放军解放了寮国北部的南乌江流域、寮国中部的甘蒙省大部和沙湾拿吉省的北部以及寮国南部的波罗芬高原。寮国的解放区现在共约十万平方公里，人口共约一百万。
    同时，我们在敌后的游击战争已经加强了，在红河三角洲，中越的广平、广治、承天地区，特别是南越的游击基地也扩大了。
    发言人接着谈到“纳瓦尔军事计划”的实施情况说，“纳瓦尔军事计划”是集结精锐部队，在他们的后方进行大规模的“扫荡战”，对解放区发动频繁的进犯，企图取得作战的主动权。但是，现在纳瓦尔不得不被动地为应付局势而把他的正规部队派遣到越南西北部的奠边府去，接着又派往寮国中部的塞诺，最近又派往寮国北部的琅勃剌邦。
    为了挽救当前的危急局势，纳瓦尔对中越第五联区的绥和进犯，但是当他在高原地带遭到惨重失败后，不得不将他的一部分精锐部队调往波来古防守这个据点。敌军在某一个地方受到了威胁，就急忙调来正规部队；但是越南人民军和寮国人民解放军总是寻找敌人最弱、最暴露的据点发动进攻，并将它拔除。因此，我们始终保持着作战的主动权，而敌人则越来越被动，失败也越来越惨重。
    发言人揭露法国殖民者骗人的宣传说，敌人对于他们接二连三的失败感到非常狼狈，法国的军事公报对于像敌军从昆嵩城撤退和敌军在寮国南部阿速坡被歼灭这种重要事件，常常缄口不谈或者设法掩饰。法国的报纸和通讯社硬说莱州、昆嵩、南乌江流域、他曲、第九号公路和波罗芬高原已失去重要性，或硬说这些地方毫无战略意义。但是法国的这些笨拙的办法是欺骗不了人的。
    发言人最后指出：目前，敌人企图挽救他的失败。许多法国军事领袖都纷纷来到越南，他们的主子——美国干涉者正进一步干涉印度支那战争。越南军民必须要提高警惕，歼灭更多的敌人有生力量，加强敌后地区的游击战，并且积极巩固解放区。这样，我们一定可以粉碎法、美帝国主义者的军事阴谋，并且可以在今春的战役中取得更大的胜利。
