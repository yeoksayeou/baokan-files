Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 20th. The Korean and Chinese side sent a letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on February 20th, strongly protesting the decision of the Indian, Swedish, and Swiss members of the commission to illegally dissolve the commission at 24:00 on February 21, 1954, before the commission had completed the important responsibilities entrusted to it by the Korean Armistice Agreement's "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." The full text of the protest letter from the Korean and Chinese side is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission:

The Indian, Swedish, and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, disregarding the legitimate opposition of the Polish and Czechoslovak members, finally resolved on February 18, 1954, to dissolve the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission at 24:00 on February 21, 1954.

It is known to all that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not completed the vital responsibilities entrusted to it by the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" in the Korean Armistice Agreement. The decision of the majority of the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to cease explanatory work on December 24, 1953, was illegal, and the return of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the United Nations Command on January 20, 1954, was even more illegal. Now, the announcement of the dissolution of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission brings this series of illegal acts to a climax.

It should be pointed out that in order to detain the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the United Nations Command extended the Korean War for more than a year, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was established by agreement between the two sides to ensure that all prisoners of war had the right to repatriation after the armistice. However, the vast majority of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war did not get the opportunity to be repatriated, and they continued to be forcibly detained by the United Nations Command. Under these circumstances, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was actually announced to be dissolved, and those who instigated it cannot but bear the historical responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

Therefore, I am instructed to lodge a serious protest with

    朝中方面致函蒂迈雅将军
    抗议非法解散中立国遣返委员会
    【新华社开城二十日电】朝中方面二月二十日致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将，严重抗议该委员会印度、瑞典和瑞士委员在该委员会尚未完成朝鲜停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所赋予它的重要职责前，即非法决定于一九五四年二月二十一日二十四时解散该委员会。朝中方面抗议函全文如下：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将：
    中立国遣返委员会印度、瑞典和瑞士委员，不顾波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的正当反对，终于在一九五四年二月十八日决议在一九五四年二月二十一日二十四时解散中立国遣返委员会。
    举世皆知，中立国遣返委员会没有完成朝鲜停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所赋予它的重要职责，中立国遣返委员会多数委员在一九五三年十二月二十四日决定停止解释工作是非法的，在一九五四年一月二十日将朝中被俘人员送还联合国军更是非法的，如今又宣布解散中立国遣返委员会，使这一系列的非法行为臻于绝顶。
    应该指出，为了扣留朝中被俘人员，联合国军曾延长朝鲜战争达一年以上，而中立国遣返委员会则是为了保证所有战俘在停战后都有遣返权利由双方协议产生的。但朝中被俘人员的绝大多数并未得到遣返的机会，他们依然遭受了联合国军的强迫扣留。在这种情况下，中立国遣返委员会竟然被宣布解散，其主使者不能不负起由此而产生的一切严重后果的历史责任。
    为此我奉命向你提出严重抗议。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表  朝鲜人民军中将  李相朝
    一九五四年二月二十日
