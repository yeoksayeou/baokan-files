Actively Subscribe to National Bonds to Support National Economic Construction

Invest Surplus Allowance Fees into the Cause of National Economic Construction

A letter from Feng Guoyou, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: When we were in Korea, we were very happy to see the news in the People's Daily about the issuance of national economic construction bonds. The care and concern of the people of the motherland for us and the care for our families are meticulous. In addition to raising vigilance, strengthening defenses, and preparing to thwart sudden enemy attacks to protect the safety of the motherland and carry out construction, we also actively respond to the motherland's call for increasing production and practicing economy. We save one or two liang of rice per person per day; we carefully use the overcoats, hats, and gloves that are supposed to be worn for one year and save them to wear for the second year; our cooks have created a kind of coal-burning stove that saves half of the coal... Whenever new victories are reported from the motherland's economic construction front, the image of the motherland leaping forward immediately appears before our eyes. We sincerely want to invest the allowance fees we have saved into the cause of national economic construction, but we never have the opportunity. Now that's great, we can use the money we saved to buy bonds and contribute to the construction of the motherland. Every volunteer army commander and fighter warmly supports and welcomes this bond issuance. I myself have decided to buy all of the 700,000 yuan RMB I have saved in the past to buy bonds.

For a Better Future, Actively Subscribe to National Economic Construction Bonds

A letter from Zheng Guoquan, a signalman at Changxindian Station: Now the country is issuing national economic construction bonds in order to carry out construction and to enable us to live a better life. We temporarily lend the remaining money to the country; the country takes the money to build factories and open mines, and will pay us back in the future, and also give us interest. The People's Government is really good at doing things. I plan to buy all of my surplus money for bonds. Some comrades were afraid of affecting my life and asked me to buy less. Now I have decided to buy 2 million yuan. Of course, everyone's economic situation is different, and the amount of bond purchases cannot be compared with each other.

Looking back before liberation, I ate bean cake noodles and wore tattered clothes. My whole family lived a life worse than cattle and horses. Thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for liberating us. Now my family of five is truly well-fed and clothed, and living a happy life. Based on my economic situation, the amount I subscribed is completely appropriate. I believe that in order to build a socialist society and live a better life in the future, the people of the whole country will actively subscribe to bonds according to their own circumstances.

Take Out Part of the Money from Selling Grain to Subscribe to Bonds to Support Industrial Construction

A letter from Huang Yongde, a special-class agricultural labor model in Songjiang Province and director of the Yongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingfeng Village, Shuangcheng County: I remember when the People's Victory Discount Bond was issued in 1950, our national economy was still in the recovery period. Since then, many factories have been built, the three major projects in Anshan have started construction, and many large and small water conservancy projects that are directly related to us have also been built. Our agricultural production cooperatives have gradually used horse-drawn farm implements, integrated shovels and harrows, and chemical fertilizers, so the amount of grain harvested has increased year by year; this year, the state also installed mechanical conveyors on our grain depots. Our lives have also improved. Clothing, daily necessities, etc. are getting better and cheaper; buying a rubber car used to cost sixty or seventy shi of soybeans, but now it only costs thirty shi. Everyone said, "The development of national industry is really beneficial to us."

At present, our country has reached a period of planned large-scale economic construction, and issuing national economic construction bonds is a good way to accumulate construction funds. "When everyone adds firewood, the flames rise high." Everyone uses their savings to buy bonds, so that the country can be industrialized and move towards socialism as soon as possible, and they can also get interest. In addition to using part of the money I get from selling grain to add production and living materials, I have decided to withdraw one million yuan to buy bonds. The people in our cooperative are also preparing to take out part of the money from selling grain and the unnecessary expenses that they plan to save during the Lunar New Year to buy bonds.

Widely Publicize the Significance of Issuing Bonds and Mobilize Everyone to Actively Subscribe

A letter from Tang Zhengqing, head of the Fifth Mutual Aid Team in Kaifeng Township, Jiange County, Sichuan Province: After hearing the news about the issuance of national economic construction bonds, I remembered that I had recently gone to the county to study the general line of the country during the transition period. The general line stipulates that the country must implement socialist industrialization, which requires a lot of funds. Now, issuing bonds is a way to accumulate funds. The benefits of industrialization for agriculture are endless. For example, last year the People's Government awarded our mutual aid team a sprayer, which we used to treat cotton insects. It can treat three mu a day, which is two-thirds more efficient than our native method of using "bamboo water guns." My one mu and seven fen of cotton land yielded nearly three times more than in previous years. As the national industry gradually develops, we will use machines to produce in the future, and the harvest will be much greater. Furthermore, subscribing to bonds is also a kind of savings, and you can get interest. I am a provincial labor model, and the mutual aid team I lead is also a model mutual aid team in the special zone and county. In addition to doing a good job in winter production, striving to increase production this year, and leading our mutual aid team to sign a "combination contract" with the supply and marketing cooperative, I also plan to first subscribe to 200,000 yuan of bonds, and I will also widely publicize the significance of issuing bonds to mutual aid team members, relatives and friends, and mobilize everyone to actively subscribe to bonds.

Carefully Calculate and Actively Subscribe to Bonds to Accelerate the Country's Industrialization Construction

A letter from Chen Zhongshan of Dalian Institute of Technology: After the news about the decision of the Central People's Government to issue national economic construction bonds was published in the newspaper last year, the faculty and staff of our school enthusiastically calculated the matter of subscribing to bonds in order to accelerate the construction of the country's socialist industrialization. In mid-January, the school began to promote bonds, and all the faculty and staff immediately subscribed enthusiastically. Zhao Guofan, an assistant teacher in the Civil Engineering Department, and Zhang Lijing, a lecturer in the research office, used the royalties they earned from painstakingly translating the two books "Highway Bridges" and "Mathematical Analysis Tutorial" in their spare time to subscribe to 30 million yuan of bonds. They also said that they would translate more and better Soviet advanced technology and theoretical books in the future to arm our technical personnel and build socialist industry. Wang Xizhi, a lecturer in the Civil Engineering Department, listened to the mobilization report on bond subscription. He went home that night and held a family meeting. After careful calculations, he decided to take out 3 million yuan to buy bonds. The comrades in the Political Counseling Office of the Chemical Engineering Department took out the money they had saved sporadically in the past and bought 8 million yuan of bonds; Hao Pengjiu, a worker in the printing factory, also bought 100,000 yuan of bonds with the money he could save... Everyone realized that buying bonds is a patriotic action to support the country's industrial construction. On January 25, the total subscription number of the whole college exceeded the estimated number by 262.5 percent.

    踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设
    把积余的津贴费投入祖国经济建设事业
    中国人民志愿军战士冯国友来信：我们在朝鲜看到祖国的人民日报上刊载祖国发行国家经济建设公债的消息，都从心眼里感到高兴。祖国人民对我们的关怀、对我们家属的照顾，是无微不至的。我们除了提高警惕、加强戒备、准备随时粉碎敌人的突然侵袭，保卫祖国安全进行建设外，还积极响应祖国的增产节约号召。我们每人每天节省一两米；我们把规定穿一年的大衣、帽子、手套小心使用，留到第二年再穿；我们的炊事员创造了一种烧煤的灶，使烧煤节省了二分之一……。每当祖国经济建设战线上传来了新的胜利消息时，我们眼前立刻映出祖国正在飞跃前进的面貌。我们诚心诚意地想把我们自己积蓄下来的津贴费投入祖国经济建设事业中去，可是总是没有机会。现在可好了，我们可以把积蓄的钱拿来买公债，为祖国建设尽一分力。每一个志愿军指战员对这次发行公债都是热烈拥护和欢迎的。我自己决定把过去积蓄的七十万元人民币全部买公债。
    为了将来更美好的日子，积极认购国家经济建设公债
    长辛店车站信号员郑国全来信：现在国家为了要进行建设，为了使咱们能过更好的日子，所以发行国家经济建设公债。咱们把余下的钱暂时借给国家；国家拿钱去办工厂、开矿山，将来还钱给咱们，而且还给咱们利钱。人民政府办事真是好，我核计要把我积余的钱全部买公债。有的同志怕影响我的生活，叫我少买点。现在我决定买二百万元。当然各人的经济情况不同，买公债的数目是不能互相比的。
    回想解放前，我吃的是豆饼面，穿的是破衣衫，全家过着牛马不如的生活，多亏共产党、毛主席把咱解放了。现在我一家五口真是丰衣足食，过上了幸福的日子。根据我的经济情况，我所认购的数字是完全合适的。我相信，全国人民为了建设社会主义社会，将来能过更美好的日子，都会根据自己的情况积极认购公债的。
    拿出一部分卖粮的钱认购公债，支援工业建设
    松江省特等农业劳动模范、双城县庆丰村永丰农业生产合作社主任黄永德来信：记得一九五○年发行人民胜利折实公债时，我们国家经济还在恢复时期。自那以后，很多工厂修起来了，鞍山三大工程开了工，和我们有直接关系的大小水利工程也修建了不少。我们农业生产合作社渐渐地使起马拉农具、综合铲趟机、化学肥料，因此打的粮食一年比一年多；今年国家还给我们的粮栈上安了机械传送机。我们的生活也跟着上升了。衣料、日用品等越来越好、越便宜；买一台胶皮车，过去得六、七十石大豆，现今只花三十石就能买到。大伙都说：“国家工业发展了，对我们好处真大。”
    眼下我国已经到了有计划的大规模经济建设时期，发行国家经济建设公债是积累建设资金的一个好办法。“大家捧柴火焰高”，每个人都把自己节约的钱买公债，使国家早早工业化，早早走到社会主义，自己还有利息可得。我卖粮所得的钱，除一部分添办生产、生活资料外，决定抽出一百万元买公债。我们社里大伙也准备把卖粮的钱和准备节省阴历年不必要的花费拿出一部分来买公债。
    广泛宣传发行公债的意义，动员大家踊跃认购
    四川省剑阁县开封乡五村互助组组长唐正清来信：听到关于发行国家经济建设公债的消息后，我就想起不久前到县里去学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线。总路线规定国家要实行社会主义工业化，这就要很多资金，如今发行公债，正是积累资金的一个办法。工业化对农业好处是说不完的。譬如，去年人民政府奖给我们互助组一架喷雾器，我们拿来治棉花虫，一天就能治三亩，效率比我们用“竹水枪打”的土法子要高三分之二。我的一亩七分棉花地就比往年多收将近三倍。国家工业逐步发展了，将来我们还要用机器生产，收成更要多得多。再说，认购公债对自己来说，还可以得利息，也是一种储蓄。我是省的劳动模范，我领导的互助组也是专区和县的模范互助组。我除了要搞好冬季生产，争取今年增产以及领导我们互助组和供销合作社订立“结合合同”外，还准备先认购二十万元公债，并且要向互助组组员、亲戚朋友广泛宣传发行公债的意义，动员大家踊跃认购公债。
    精打细算积极认购公债，加速国家工业化的建设
    大连工学院陈仲山来信：去年报上发表了中央人民政府决定发行国家经济建设公债的消息以后，我校教职员工同志们为了加速国家社会主义工业化的建设，就热情地核计着认购公债的事。一月中旬，学校里开始推销公债，全体教职员工同志们立即踊跃认购。土木系助教赵国藩和研究室讲师张理京两人分别把自己利用课余时间辛勤翻译“公路桥梁”、“数学解析教程”二本书所得的稿费认购了三千万元公债，他们还表示以后要更多更好地翻译苏联先进技术理论书籍，来武装我们的技术人员，建设社会主义的工业。土木系讲师王锡祉听了关于认购公债的动员报告，当晚回家就召开家庭会议，精打细算后决定拿出三百万元购买公债。化工系政治辅导室的同志把过去零星积蓄的钱拿出来买了八百万元公债；印刷厂工人郝鹏九也把可以节省的钱购买了十万元公债；……。大家都认识购买公债是支援国家工业建设的爱国行动。一月二十五日，全院认购数字就超过了预计数字的百分之二百六十二点五。
