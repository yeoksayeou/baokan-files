Rural Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Northwest China
Massively Supply Means of Production to Farmers to Increase Production

[By Our Own Correspondent] Northwest China's rural supply and marketing cooperatives are paying attention to opening up local sources of goods and fully supplying farmers and cooperative members with means of production. Since last winter, cooperatives in various parts of Northwest China have begun to reverse the previous tendency of only valuing the supply of means of livelihood while neglecting the supply of means of production, and have actively organized local handicrafts to process agricultural tools for farmers. Last year, Xinjiang Province's cooperatives supplied farmers with more than 900,000 pieces of agricultural tools, large and small, such as hoes, sickles, and plowshares; last winter, they prepared another 1,500 tons of iron, ready to process more than 600,000 pieces of agricultural tools for farmers. Since last winter, cooperatives in various parts of Shaanxi Province have actively prepared a large amount of raw materials for processing orders; the Provincial Supply and Marketing Department has signed contracts for sickles, chaff cutters, chaff cutter blades and other agricultural tools sufficient for farmers to use. The Qinghai Provincial Cooperative, the Gansu Provincial Cooperative, and their respective wholesale stations have all signed contracts with local small handicraftsmen to organize processing orders. In November last year, the Gansu Provincial Cooperative convened a forum with 165 households in seven industries in Lanzhou City, including iron, wood, hemp rope, felt, and leather, and signed contracts for processing small agricultural tools (such as iron nails, ropes, etc.). At the same time, they sent people to find sources of goods outside the region, and have signed contracts for more than 40,000 pieces of goods such as axes and mattocks, and purchased more than 700 tons of scrap iron. Cooperatives in Jiuquan County are implementing the spirit of obtaining materials locally and processing and manufacturing locally, and are now vigorously carrying out the manufacture and repair of vehicles. It is estimated that by the end of March this year, they will be able to supply 700 large carts and 500 small carts. In the process of making agricultural tools, most of the cooperatives in various places have done investigation and research work in advance, understood the needs of farmers and cooperative members and the usage habits of local farmers, and then organized local handicrafts for processing. This not only meets the actual needs of local farmers, but also the price is much cheaper than the market price, saving farmers a lot of money. The agricultural tools processed in Shache Prefecture, Xinjiang are 15 to 20 percent lower than the market price, and in some places even as low as 50 percent.

In addition to storing a large number of various agricultural tools and vehicles for farmers, cooperatives in various places are also actively preparing fertilizers for farmers. At present, according to incomplete statistics from provincial and municipal cooperatives, the stored oil materials, oil cakes, manure, etc., are equivalent to 6,392 tons of oil cakes, of which Ningxia Province and Xi'an City cooperatives have done a better job in storage. The Ningxia Provincial Cooperative has stored 500,000 jin of oil residue; the Xi'an City Cooperative has completed more than 60 percent of the storage plan for the purchase of oil materials. The work of organizing the processing of fertilizers by cooperatives in various places has now been enthusiastically launched. Pingliang, Gansu Province, has organized 33 oil mills, which are actively processing, preparing for timely supply. Shangluo Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, has supplied more than 70,000 jin of fertilizer, and there are still a large number of reserves to continue supplying.

Cooperatives in various places have also paid special attention to the trafficking and adjustment of livestock. According to incomplete statistics, last year, cooperatives in various parts of Northwest China supplied farmers and cooperative members with more than 5,880 heads of livestock, accounting for more than 95 percent of the original supply plan. There are more than 3,840 heads being purchased and transported in Shaanxi and Ningxia provinces and Xi'an city alone. In order to ensure that the livestock purchased are suitable for practical use by farmers, some places are led by the cooperative to organize farmers to select and purchase in the producing areas. When the Qishan County United Cooperative in Shaanxi Province went to Xiahe, Gansu to buy horses, it organized 24 farmers who needed to buy livestock, raised more than 70 percent of the funds for buying livestock, all of which were the proceeds from the sale of surplus grain by farmers, preparing to use it to expand production; at the same time, it also selected and dispatched representatives familiar with livestock performance to select and purchase in the producing areas, overcoming the difficulty of not understanding livestock specifications; therefore, the livestock brought back were very popular among the farmers.

    西北各地农村供销合作社
    大量供应农民生产资料增加生产
    【本报讯】西北各地农村供销合作社，注意开辟当地货源，充分供应农民社员群众生产资料。去冬以来，西北各地合作社，开始扭转了以往只重视供应生活资料而忽视供应生产资料的偏向，并积极组织当地手工业加工农具，供应农民。新疆省合作社去年供应农民砍土镘、镰刀、犁铧等大小农具九十多万件；去冬又准备了一千五百吨铁，准备加工农具六十余万件供应农民。陕西省各地合作社，去年冬季即积极准备了大量原料，进行加工订货；省社供销经理部已签订了足够供应农民使用的镰刀、铡刀、铡背等农具合同。青海省社、甘肃省社及所属各批发站，均先后分别与当地小手工业者签订合同，组织加工订货。甘肃省社去年十一月间召集了兰州市铁、木、麻绳、毛毡、皮革等七个行业，计一百六十五户，举行座谈，并签订了加工小农具（如铁钉、绳索等）的合同，同时又派人到区外找寻货源，已签订订货合同的计有斧头、镢头等四万余件及购废铁七百余吨。酒泉县各地合作社，贯彻就地取材就地加工制作的精神，现在正在大力进行制造、修补车辆，预计到今年三月底以前，即可供应大车七百辆、小车五百辆。各地合作社在制作农具中，大多事先做了调查研究工作，了解农民社员群众的需要量与当地农民的使用习惯，然后组织当地手工业加工。这样既符合当地农民实际需用，而且价格也比市面上便宜得多，给农民节省了很多钱。新疆莎车专区加工的农具，较市价低百分之十五至二十不等，个别地方还低到百分之五十左右。
    除了大量储备各种农具、车辆供应农民外，各地合作社还积极准备肥料，供应农民。目前，据各省、市社不完全的统计，已储备的油料、油饼、粪肥等，共计折合油饼六千三百九十二吨，其中以宁夏省和西安市合作社储备工作做得较好。宁夏省社已储备油渣五十万斤；西安市合作社收购油料已完成储备计划的百分之六十以上。各地合作社组织加工肥料工作，现已热烈展开。甘肃省平凉组织了三十三家油房，正积极加工，准备及时供应。陕西省商雒专区已供应了七万多斤肥料，现尚有大量储备继续供应。
    各地合作社也特别注意了牲口的贩运、调剂工作。去年西北各地合作社供应给农民社员的牲畜，据不完全的统计，已有五千八百八十余头，占原供应计划的百分之九十五以上。正在购运中的，仅陕西、宁夏两省和西安市等地，就有三千八百四十余头。为了使买回的牲口，都能适合农民实用，有些地方就由合作社领导，组织农民到产地选购。陕西省岐山县联社，到甘肃夏河买马时，就组织了二十四户需要购买牲口的农民，筹集了全部买牲口资金的百分之七十以上，这些钱都是农民出卖余粮的款子，准备用到扩大生产上去的；同时还选派了熟悉牲口性能的代表到产地选购，克服了不懂牲口规格的困难；因而运回来的牲口，很受农民群众欢迎。
