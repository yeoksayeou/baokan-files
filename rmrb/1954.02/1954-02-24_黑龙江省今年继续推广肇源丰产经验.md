Heilongjiang Province, building on the success of promoting Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience in 1953, has determined the guiding principle and tasks for continued promotion in 1954.

During the spring plowing preparation period in 1953, Heilongjiang Province vigorously promoted the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience through various means. Over one million farmers throughout the province received technical reform education once or twice, and 130,000 junior-level technical backbones were trained. Wide sowing was quite common during the spring plowing period, improving the quality of field operations. During the summer weeding period, due to excessive rainfall and simultaneous growth of grass and seedlings, the practice of "universally improving hoeing and focusing on implementing Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience" was adopted. During the autumn harvest, combined with the movement to increase production and conserve grain, the pace of the autumn harvest was accelerated, and the quality of autumn harvest operations was improved. Throughout the year, rural cadres learned the mass line work method of going deep into reality, delving into the production process, studying agricultural technology, learning from farmers, and specifically guiding farmers' production in the practice of promoting Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience. Many good cadres emerged who went deep into the masses, leading farmers to actively apply and develop Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience, increasing grain production. Despite multiple disasters in 1953, high-yield fields of major crops such as corn, millet, soybeans, and wheat still accounted for 39.9% of the cultivated land area, dense planting of wheat accounted for 42% of the wheat field area, and the province harvested 4.33 million tons of grain, more than 300,000 tons more than in 1951. The eight southern counties, due to the implementation of the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, universally increased the number of crop plants, coupled with favorable rainfall, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to preliminary statistics from the province, the area of new high-yield records has reached 31,998 hectares. The promotion of Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience requires intensive cultivation and rational close planting, which has further enhanced farmers' understanding of the role of new farm tools. The utilization rate of new farm tools throughout the province has greatly increased compared to the past. According to a survey of 143 technical guidance stations, 832 sets of new-style farm tools planted a total of 12,667 hectares of land, an average of more than 15 hectares per set, more than one and a half times more than in 1952, and most of them increased production. For example, Yiliba Village in Longjiang County used new farm tools to plant 402 hectares and eight mu of wheat, with an average yield of 1,415 jin per hectare, an increase of 147.8% compared to the local general wheat yield of 571 jin per hectare. According to a provincial survey, due to the promotion of Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience, the labor organization within agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams is required to be more rigorous, further leveraging the role of women's labor, thereby also promoting the consolidation and a certain degree of development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations.

After summarizing the achievements of promoting Zhaoyuan's high-yield experience in 1953, Heilongjiang Province decided to continue implementing the principle of "universal publicity and focused promotion" in 1954. Based on the main shortcomings of some regions blindly promoting without considering conditions last year, the province also proposed the principle of "doing what is possible and doing it practically." The technical slogans were revised and supplemented based on the promotion practice of various counties over the past year to: "Deep plowing to preserve moisture, equidistant wide sowing, increasing the application of base fertilizer, thinning seedlings to protect seedlings." Not long ago, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions requiring all counties to specifically apply and develop the Zhaoyuan experience according to local conditions and specific circumstances in order to achieve comprehensive production increase and complete the grain production increase task for 1954. It requires that high-yield fields (including new record lands) reach an average of about 10% of the cultivated land area and insists on combining universal improvement of yield per unit area with focused processing. In terms of methods, the province continues to implement the method of "focused trials, summarizing experience, organizing visits, and gradually promoting." Various localities can appropriately increase the number of crop plants and rationally plant them densely according to local conditions and different crops, reducing the phenomenon of missing seedlings, uneven spacing, and rough cultivation. It is necessary to prevent mechanical application, blindly investing regardless of cost, or the occurrence of deviations such as affecting large-area production increases due to focused processing. Technically, it is required to be simple, easy to implement, and effective, seeking production increases on the basis of stable production.

    黑龙江省今年继续推广肇源丰产经验
    黑龙江省在一九五三年推广肇源丰产经验成功的基础上，确定了一九五四年继续推广的方针任务。
    黑龙江省在一九五三年备耕期间，通过各种形式大张旗鼓地宣传了肇源丰产经验，全省有一百多万农民受到一次到两次技术改革的教育，并培养了十三万名初级技术骨干分子，在春耕期间相当普遍地实行了宽播，提高了田间作业质量；夏锄期间由于雨水过多，草苗齐长，实行了“普遍搞好铲趟，重点贯彻肇源丰产经验”的做法；秋收时期结合开展增产节约粮食运动，加快了秋收进度，提高了秋收作业质量。在一年里，广大农村干部在推广肇源丰产经验的实践中，学会了深入实际，深入生产过程，钻研农业技术，向农民学习又具体指导农民生产的群众路线工作方法，出现了不少深入群众的好干部，领导农民积极地运用和发展了肇源丰产经验，增产了粮食。一九五三年虽在多灾的情况下，苞米、谷子、大豆、小麦等主要作物的丰产田仍占耕地面积的百分之三十九点九，小麦密植占麦田面积的百分之四十二，全省打粮四百三十三万吨，比一九五一年多打三十多万吨。南部八县因为实行了肇源丰产经验，普遍增加了作物株数，加上雨水调和，获得了空前丰收。据全省初步统计，丰产新纪录地已达三万一千九百九十八垧。推广肇源丰产经验，要求做到精耕细作，合理密植，因之促使农民进一步认识了新农具的作用，全省新农具的运用率较过去有很大提高，据一百四十三个技术指导站的调查统计，八百三十二套新式农具，共播种一万二千六百六十七垧地，平均每套播十五垧多地，比一九五二年增加一倍半以上，而且绝大部分增了产，如龙江县依力巴村用新农具播小麦四百零二垧八亩地，平均每垧产量一千四百一十五斤，比当地一般小麦每垧产量五百七十一斤增产百分之一百四十七点八。根据全省的调查，由于肇源丰产经验的推广，要求农业生产合作社和互助组内部的劳动组织更加严密，更进一步发挥妇女劳动力的作用，因之也促进了互助合作组织的巩固与一定程度的发展。
      黑龙江省在总结了一九五三年推广肇源丰产经验的成就后，决定一九五四年仍继续贯彻“普遍宣传，重点推广”的方针，并根据去年推广中有些地区不根据条件盲目推广的这一主要缺点，又提出“量力而行切实做好”的原则，技术口号则根据一年来各县的推广实践修正补充为：“深耕保墒、等距宽播、增施底粪、间苗保苗”。不久之前，中共黑龙江省委发布了指示，要求各县必须根据这一要求因地制宜地具体运用和发展肇源经验，以达到全面增产与完成一九五四年粮食增产任务的目的。要求丰产田（新纪录地包括在内）平均达到耕地面积的百分之十左右，要坚持做到普遍提高单位面积产量和重点加工相结合。在作法上，继续贯彻“重点试作，总结经验，组织参观，逐步推广”的方法，各地可根据当地具体条件和作物的不同，适当增加作物株数，合理密植，减少缺苗、稀厚不匀和耕作粗糙的现象。防止机械搬用，不顾成本盲目投资，或因重点加工影响大面积增产等偏向的发生。在技术上，要求简便易行，行之有效，在稳产基础上求增产。
