The Central China Bureau of the CPC recently issued a notice requiring party committees in all regions to earnestly guide cadres at all levels to study, before the end of March, each of the five parts of the outline for studying the general line, from beginning to end, in sequence. This is to enable cadres to have a correct and more systematic understanding of the basic content of the general line through this study; and to draw a clear line between socialist and capitalist ideology in the study, so as to further grasp policies and better implement the general line in practical work.

The Central China Bureau pointed out in its notice: The study of the general line by cadres in various parts of East China in the previous period generally suffered from the shortcomings of being superficial, incomplete, unsystematic and not comprehensive. Many cadres had, to varying degrees, some one-sided understanding. Party committees in various regions should pay attention to the following points when organizing study: (1) The previous period of study reflected that cadres did not have enough understanding of the actual situation of China's economic construction, and many difficulties arose in the study. In the future, senior groups should refer to the Northwest cadre study methods, designate responsible comrades from certain business departments to make necessary special reports to general cadres, and guide cadres to attach importance to and study the actual situation of China's economic construction, using certain actual materials on industrial construction and the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce to enrich the content of study. (2) Responsible comrades in various regions should still give more reports to their subordinate cadres, answer difficult questions, and closely monitor the study of senior groups. The original study consultants and lecture groups and other organizations should also give full play to their role. (3) Study documents should focus on the study outline and the several documents prescribed in the past, and refer to the relevant documents cited in the outline and various reference documents previously prescribed as needed. (4) If county-level organ cadres are still unable to conduct systematic study according to the outline at present, they should first study the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives after the completion of grain purchasing work, and then spend a longer period of time systematically studying the general line, but the main issues they raised earlier should still be answered in a timely manner. (5) The study time will be extended to the end of March. Cadres who do not adopt the method of making reports with special papers should be tested. After this study comes to an end, the study of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" will continue.

Furthermore: The theoretical study central group of the South China Sub-bureau of the CPC has formulated a plan for further studying the general line of the state during the transition period and conducting special research.

In early January, the theoretical study central group of the South China Sub-bureau of the CPC discussed the issue of general line study under the personal direction of Comrade Tao Zhu, acting secretary of the South China Sub-bureau of the CPC. Comrade Tao Zhu believed that: At present, theoretical study by senior cadres must be grasped tightly, which is a solid guarantee for realizing the party's general line, doing a good job in various tasks, and driving cadres at all levels to study theory well. The key to whether senior cadres study well lies in whether the central group can play an exemplary role. Therefore, the central groups of the sub-bureau, the People's Government of Guangdong Province, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC, and the party committees of various districts must be led by the top leaders, who take personal responsibility and earnestly study well. Although the members of the central group are not often together and are busy with work, as long as there is determination, the method of "squeezing time" and "seizing time" can completely lead to good study. At present, the central group has formulated a specific plan: to study in sequence according to the study outline, divided into five issues, and to end all of them by the end of March. The time arrangement: the first two weeks to study Chapters 9 and 10 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union," two casual talks (started on January 13); one week of study for each topic, with Comrade Tao Zhu and responsible comrades of each department making central speeches respectively; the last four weeks are for special research time, and preparation and conduct of examinations.

In order to make the general line study achieve the effect of guiding and improving work, Comrade Tao Zhu especially emphasized linking it with reality, that is, analyzing and studying based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of the general line, combined with the actual situation and combined with work and business. Now the central group has formulated a special research plan, and stipulates that each person must be responsible for researching a topic, or writing a paper, or writing notes and experiences, or making a special report.

    中共中央华东局通知各级党委
    领导干部按照总路线学习提纲进行学习
    中共中央华南分局理论学习中心小组进行专题研究
    中共中央华东局最近发出通知，要求各地党委在三月底前，认真领导各级干部根据总路线学习提纲的五个部分从头至尾依次进行学习。使干部通过这次学习对总路线的基本内容，有一个正确的和较为系统的了解；并在学习中划清社会主义与资本主义的思想界限，进一步掌握政策，以便在实际工作中更好地贯彻总路线。
    华东局在通知中指出：前一时期华东各地干部对总路线的学习，一般还存在着不深、不透、不系统、不全面的缺点，很多干部或多或少地存在着一些片面的认识。各地党委在组织学习中应注意以下各点：（一）过去一段学习反映干部对我国经济建设的实际情况了解不够，在学习中发生很多困难，今后应由高级组参照西北干部学习办法，指定一定业务部门的负责同志向一般干部作必要的专题报告，引导干部重视和研究中国经济建设的实际情况，以工业建设和农业、手工业与资本主义工商业改造的一定实际材料来丰富学习的内容。（二）各地负责同志仍应多向所属干部作报告，解答疑难问题，并抓紧高级组的学习。原有的学习顾问和讲师团等组织，亦应充分发挥其作用。（三）学习文件以学习提纲及过去所规定的几个文件为主，并按照需要，参阅提纲中所引的有关文件及以前所规定的各种参考文件。（四）县级机关干部，如目前还不能根据提纲进行系统的学习，则在粮食收购工作结束之后，首先学习中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议，以后再以较长时间去系统地学习总路线，但对他们以前所提出的一些主要问题，仍应及时给以解答。（五）学习时间延至三月底结束。凡不采取专题论文作报告的方法进行学习的干部应举行测验。这一学习告一段落后，即继续进行“联共（布）党史”的学习。
    又讯：中共中央华南分局理论学习中心小组，已拟订出进一步学习国家过渡时期总路线和进行专题研究的计划。
    一月上旬，华南分局理论学习中心小组在中共中央华南分局代书记陶铸同志亲自主持下讨论了总路线学习的问题。陶铸同志认为：目前高级干部理论学习必须抓紧，这是实现党的总路线、做好各项工作和带动各级干部学好理论的切实保证。而高级干部学习得好坏，关键在于中心小组能否起示范作用。因此，分局、广东省人民政府、中共广州市委以及各区党委的中心小组，必须由首长带头，亲自负责，认真学好。中心小组的人员虽然经常不在一起，工作较忙，只要有决心，用“挤时间”和“抓时间”的办法，是完全可以学习好的。目前，中心小组拟出具体计划：按照学习提纲分五个问题，循序进行学习，到三月底全部结束。时间的安排：头两个星期学习
  “联共（布）党史”第九章和第十章，漫谈两次（已于一月十三日开始）；每题学习一个星期，分别由陶铸同志和各部负责同志作中心发言；最后四周为专题研究时间，并准备和进行考试。
    为使总路线学习获得指导和改进工作的成效，陶铸同志特别强调联系实际，即根据马克思列宁主义的理论和总路线的精神，结合实际情况，结合工作业务，进行分析和研究。现中心小组已拟定出专题研究计划，并规定每人必须负责研究一个题目，或写论文，或写笔记、心得，或作专题报告。
