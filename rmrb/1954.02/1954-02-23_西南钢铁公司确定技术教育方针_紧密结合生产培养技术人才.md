    Southwest Steel Company recently held an education conference for its affiliated factories and mines last month, determining to systematically carry out technical education in order to cultivate technical talents for the nation.
    In 1953, Southwest Steel Company cultivated more than 3,800 technical cadres, professional cadres, and skilled workers for the country, covering more than 20 types of work and specialties including steelmaking, iron smelting, steel rolling, machinery, electrical engineering, chemical analysis, construction, drawing, and planning. In addition, it trained more than 120 visiting interns and transferred more than 80 technical cadres and professional cadres to the state. However, there were still many shortcomings and problems in this work over the past year. The organizational structure of the education departments in various factories and mines is generally not sound; the factories and mines that have established institutions lack a clear scope of responsibilities; in most factories and mines, the time for technical education is not guaranteed; the leaders of various factories and mines generally lack inspection, supervision, and assistance for education work, and good experiences have not been summarized and promoted in a timely manner, and so on.
    Based on affirming achievements and examining and analyzing shortcomings, the conference discussed and determined the guidelines and tasks for carrying out technical education work in 1954, determining that this year's technical education work will be closely integrated with production, starting from production needs and conditions, and widely carrying out technical and business learning for on-the-job employees. The focus will be on the education of skilled workers, technical cadres, and veteran cadres, supplemented by the general staff; those directly involved in production will be the main focus, supplemented by those indirectly involved in production. Combine practical needs, learn from advanced Soviet science and technology, and implement the teaching policy of combining labor and technology. When preparing employee training plans, the labor plan will be the foundation, and the plan to promote employees will be the main basis, combined with the conditions and capabilities of the department to research and determine. In terms of teaching methods, it was determined that factories and mines can adopt spare-time technical schools, short-term off-the-job training courses, apprenticeship contracts, special business learning, and sending people out to study, depending on the circumstances.
    In order to smoothly carry out systematic and planned technical education work, the conference believes that the leaders of factories and mines should immediately transfer personnel to establish and improve full-time institutions, and the factories and mines should strengthen the ideological education of personnel in the education departments to overcome their fear of difficulties and their lack of peace of mind in their work. Leaders at all levels should mobilize all forces to assist the work of the education departments, and the personnel of the education departments should also actively seek the help of leaders and all parties. The teaching content, progress, and implementation of apprenticeship contracts should be thoroughly inspected at any time in order to discover problems and correct them in a timely manner. The education departments should establish and improve the responsibility system, establish a normal daily work system, and carry out work in a planned and orderly manner. Factories and mines should also conduct ideological education on learning technology among all employees, and set off a wave of teaching and learning technology.

    西南钢铁公司确定技术教育方针
    紧密结合生产培养技术人才
    西南钢铁公司于上月召开所属厂矿教育会议，确定有计划地开展技术教育，为国家培养技术人才。
    西南钢铁公司在一九五三年中，共为国家培养了三千八百多名技术干部、专业干部和技术工人，包括炼钢、炼铁、轧钢、机械、电工、化验、修建、绘图、计划等二十多个工种和专业。此外，还培养了外来实习人员一百二十多人，并为国家输送了八十多名技术干部和专业干部。但是，一年来在这一工作上还存在着不少的缺点和问题。各厂矿教育部门组织机构一般尚不健全；已设立机构的厂矿，没有一定的职责范围；大部分厂矿技术教育工作的时间没有保障；各厂矿领导上一般对教育工作还缺乏检查、督促和帮助，以及好的经验没有及时总结推广等等。
    会议在肯定成绩和检查分析缺点的基础上，讨论并确定了一九五四年开展技术教育工作的方针和任务，确定今年的技术教育工作将紧密地结合生产，从生产需要和生产条件出发，广泛开展在职职工的技术业务学习。以技术工人、技术干部、老干部的教育为主，一般的职工为辅；直接掌握生产的职工为主，间接生产的职工为辅。结合实际的需要，学习苏联先进科学技术，贯彻劳动与技术相结合的教学方针。在编制职工培养计划时，以劳动计划为基础，以需要提拔职工的计划为主要依据，结合本部门的条件与能力研究确定。在教学的方式方面，确定：各厂矿可按不同情况，采用业余技术学校、短期脱离生产训练班、师徒合同、专题业务学习、派人出外学习等。
    为了顺利开展系统的有计划的技术教育工作，会议认为：厂矿领导上应立即抽调人员建立和健全专职机构，各厂矿要加强对教育部门人员的思想教育，克服他们怕困难、不安心工作的思想。各级领导并要动员各方面力量协助教育部门的工作，教育部门人员也应积极争取领导上和各方面的帮助。对教学内容、进度、师徒合同执行情况要随时深入检查，以便发现问题及时纠正。教育部门要建立与健全责任制度，建立正常的日常工作制度，有计划有秩序地进行工作。各厂矿还要在全体职工中进行学习技术的思想教育，掀起传授技术、学习技术的热潮。
