    [Our Newspaper] After studying the general line of the state's transition period, Wang Chonglun, through careful calculation, has formulated an advanced personal plan for increasing production and practicing economy, aiming to complete sixteen months' worth of production quota throughout the year. This plan is very advanced because: First, in January of this year, according to the regulations for revising quotas every six months, the Anshan Iron and Steel Machinery General Factory revised Wang Chonglun's quota. For example, the original quota for making card activators was two minutes and thirty seconds each. Wang Chonglun improved his work efficiency by six and a half times, so the revised quota is twenty minutes each. Second, Wang Chonglun will stop producing jackhammer parts, which he has been producing for a year and is very skilled at. The products from now on will be complex and constantly changing. Under these circumstances, further increasing production will have many difficulties. However, Wang Chonglun, determined to accelerate the realization of the country's socialist industrialization, did not stop moving forward due to these difficulties. With the help of the workshop Party branch and administration, he began to formulate his 1954 plan at the end of last year. He first thought of greatly shortening auxiliary production time, finding tricks in the tool bits, tool shank back caps, and even machine switches, determined not to waste a single second of production time. For example, in the past, six to eight tool bits were consumed every day, and it took at least five minutes to change a tool bit. Wang Chonglun carefully studied and changed the method of grinding tool bits, grinding each of the four right angles of the tool bit into a 粍 round angle. The tool bit became more durable, and now only one or two or three are consumed per day, reducing tens of minutes of non-production time. Secondly, Wang Chonglun estimates that there will be a large number of flat workpieces this year. Therefore, according to the suggestion of engineer Lü Qubing from the 724 Factory to use the Koledov planing method, he is determined to learn advanced Soviet experience, and at the same time, constantly study and create in his work, find tricks, and tap potential, so that he can complete about ten more days of workload per month. Achieving these two conditions, he can complete sixteen months' worth of quota throughout the year.
    Wang Chonglun's plan is also relatively comprehensive. It also includes guarantees for no defective products, second-class products, or machine accidents throughout the year, and ensuring that not a bit of gauze or a drop of oil is wasted, and strictly observing labor discipline.
    Wang Chonglun's advanced plan has been approved by the workshop. He strictly implements his plan every day, and production efficiency is gradually increasing. For example, when making ratchet wheels, the new quota is twelve minutes, but in reality, he makes one in eight minutes. He is full of confidence and wants to strive to overfulfill his advanced production increase and economy plan, and drive the workshop workers to move forward together.

### 王崇伦订出个人增产节约的先进计划  今年要完成十六个月的生产定额

    王崇伦订出个人增产节约的先进计划
    今年要完成十六个月的生产定额
    【本报讯】王崇伦在学习了国家过渡时期总路线以后，经过精打细算，又订出了先进的个人增产节约计划，今年全年要完成十六个月的生产定额。这一计划是很先进的，因为：一、今年一月，根据半年修改一次定额的规定，鞍钢机械总厂修改了王崇伦的定额，如做卡动器，原定额是两点三十分钟一个，王崇伦提高工作效率六倍半，因此，修改后的定额是二十分钟一个。二、王崇伦生产了一年并且技术已十分熟练的凿岩机零件，就要停止生产，今后的产品是复杂而经常变化的。在这样情况下，再提高生产，是有不少困难的。可是，决心为加速实现国家社会主义工业化事业的王崇伦，并没有因困难的阻挡而停止前进。他在车间党支部和行政的帮助下，从去年年底就开始制订一九五四年的计划。他首先想到大力缩短辅助生产时间，在刀头、刀杆背帽、甚至机器开关上找到窍门，决心做到不浪费一分一秒的生产时间。如过去每天要耗用六个到八个刀头，换一个刀头至少得五分钟，王崇伦仔细研究，改变了磨刀头的方法，把刀头的四个直角各磨成一粍圆的角度，刀头就更加耐用了，现在一天只耗用一个或两三个，减少了几十分钟的非生产时间。其次，王崇伦估计到今年会有大批平面活，因此，他根据七二四厂工程师吕去病向他提出的用科列索夫刨刀法的建议，决心学习苏联先进经验，同时在工作中再不断钻研创造，找窍门、挖潜力，这样，一个月可以多完成十天左右的工作量。实现这两个条件，全年可以完成十六个月的定额。
    王崇伦的计划也是比较全面的。其中也包括全年不出废品、二级品和机器事故，并做到不浪费一点纱布、一滴油，严格遵守劳动纪律的保证。
    王崇伦的先进计划已经车间批准。他每天严格执行自己的计划，生产效率在逐渐提高，如做制逆轮，新定额是十二分钟，实际上八分钟做一个。他信心百倍，要争取超额完成自己的先进增产节约计划，并带动车间工人一齐前进。
