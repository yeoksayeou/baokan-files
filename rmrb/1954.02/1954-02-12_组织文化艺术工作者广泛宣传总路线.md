	Worker-Peasant Joint Performance Convention

	On January 17th, the Gansu Daily, the Gansu Peasant Newspaper, and the Gansu People's Broadcasting Station jointly held a "Worker-Peasant Joint Performance Convention." More than thirty people participated in the joint performances, including amateur art enthusiasts and folk artists from among workers, peasants, the People's Liberation Army, government cadres, teachers, and residents. In addition, the Northwest Military Region Political Department Art Troupe, the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Political Department Art Troupe, and others also performed some music and dance programs.

	This joint performance was conducted under the principle of self-creation and self-performance by workers and peasants. The performance items were short and pithy folk art forms deeply loved by workers and peasants, such as 快板 (clapper talk), 郿鄠调 (Meihu Opera tune), 花儿 (flower songs), folk tunes, etc. The content of the performances was also quite rich. The participants used the art forms they were familiar with to introduce production situations to each other, sing about the general line, sing about the bright future of socialism, express the feelings of mutual support and mutual gratitude between workers and peasants, and sing about the great labor of workers and peasants in building socialism.

	The joint performance convention also displayed the artistic talents of the working people, such as the 花儿 (flower songs) of seventy-year-old peasant Zhang Shixun, folk artist Mi Yongqing, and Hui people Ma Weijun, Ma Chengji, and Ma Shouyi, which were all quite good artistic works.

	Going to the Villages of Southern Xinjiang

	The Preparatory Committee of the Southern Xinjiang Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Xinjiang Province, in order to promote the grain purchase policy to farmers, organized a literary and art propaganda team composed of actors, poets, folk artists, art workers, and propaganda cadres from various ethnic groups such as Uyghur, Han, and Uzbek. They took films such as "The White-Haired Girl," slideshows of "Grain Purchase," and three sets of comic books to conduct roving propaganda in the villages of Kashgar. At the same time, a "New Year Picture Exhibition" was held in the Kashgar Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Library. Among them were three sets of newly created comic books: "Sima Yi Sells Surplus Grain to the State," "Who Benefits from Selling Grain," and "Kerim Mutual Aid Team." In addition, there were two large-scale propaganda posters. These paintings all vividly depicted the facts of how farmers actively sold grain through concrete facts, which had a certain educational effect on the audience.

	Comrades from units such as the Xinjiang Pictorial, the Preparatory Committee of the Southern Xinjiang Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Literary and Art Section of the CPC Southern Xinjiang District Committee participated in the painting. In early December of last year, they studied the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period and went deep into the countryside to experience life before creating.

	Training Active Members of Literary and Art Activities

	The Dayong County Cultural Center in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region held a training class for active members of literary and art activities in January. Sixty-four people, including members of rural amateur drama troupes, folk artists, and propagandists, participated in the training class. This study enabled everyone to have a further understanding of building a socialist society; they also had a clearer understanding of how literary and art activities can actively serve to promote the country's general line. The active members of literary and art activities who participated in the study were very enthusiastic and actively made their own work plans, guaranteeing that after returning, under the leadership of the township government, they would reorganize the drama troupe and make full use of folk art forms popular with the masses, such as 三棒鼓 (sanbang drum), 花灯 (flower lantern dance), 鱼骨筒 (fish bone tube), 土地戏 (land opera), mountain songs, and 莲花落 (lianhualuo ballad), to carry out propaganda.

	Literary and Art Propaganda Performance

	In order to further and more deeply implement the propaganda and education of the country's general line and general tasks during the transition period among the broad masses, the Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Jiangsu Province organized various units to hold literary and art propaganda performances last month. Nearly 2,000 people attended the performance. The programs included "Sell Grain to the State" (锡剧 - Xiju opera), "Buying a Plow" (淮剧 - Huaiju opera), "Old Man Liu Sells Grain" (锡剧 - Xiju opera), and "Before the Wheat Harvest" (话剧 - spoken drama) which educated the peasants; and "Eight-Inch Shoe Fabric" (曲艺 - Quyi art form - Changzhou Daqing), "Fulfilling Responsibilities" (锡剧 - Xiju opera), "Great News" (评弹 - Pingtan ballad singing), "It's My Fault" (沪剧 - Huju opera), "Banning Illegal Profiteers" (曲艺 - Quyi art form - Four-Character Chant), and "Resolutely Crack Down on Speculative Profiteers" (锡剧 - Xiju opera and 通俗话剧 - popular spoken drama) which educated workers and residents. In terms of content, they all reflected real life, and in terms of form, they were diverse, and were warmly welcomed by the audience.

    组织文化艺术工作者广泛宣传总路线
      工农联唱大会
    一月十七日，甘肃日报社、甘肃农民报社和甘肃人民广播电台举办了“工农联唱大会”。有三十多人参加联唱，包括工人、农民、解放军、机关干部、教员、居民中业余的文艺爱好者和民间艺人。此外，西北军区政治部文艺工作团、铁道部第一工程局政治部文艺工作团等也参加表演了一些音乐舞蹈节目。
    这次联唱，是在工农群众自编自唱的原则下进行的。演唱的项目，是为工农群众所深切喜爱的短小精悍的民间文艺形式，如快板、郿鄠调、花儿、民间小曲等。演唱的内容，也相当丰富。参加联唱的人，运用各人所熟悉的文艺形式，互相介绍生产情况，歌唱总路线，歌唱社会主义的灿烂前途，表现工人农民的互相支援和互相感谢的心情，歌唱工农群众为建设社会主义的巨大劳动。
    联唱大会也显示了劳动人民的艺术才能，如七十岁的老农民张世勋，民间艺人米永庆和回民马维骏、马成骥、马守义等人的花儿，都是相当好的文艺作品。
    到南疆的乡村去
    新疆省南疆文学艺术界联合会筹委会，为了向农民进行购粮政策的宣传，组织了一个由维、汉、乌等族的演员、诗人、民间艺人、美术工作者、宣传干部等组织的文艺宣传队，带着“白毛女”等影片、“购粮”幻灯片和三套连环画等，深入喀什乡村巡回宣传。同时，在喀什中苏友协图书室又举行“新年画展”。其中有：新创作的“司马益把余粮卖给国家”、“卖粮对谁有利”、“克里木互助组”三套连环画。另外还有两幅大型宣传画，这些画都是通过具体事实，通俗生动地描写了农民如何踊跃售粮的事实，对观众起了一定的教育作用。
    这次参加绘画的有新疆画报社、南疆文联筹委会、中共南疆区委文艺科等单位的同志。他们于去年十二月初，学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，并深入农村体验了生活后，才进行创作的。
    训练文艺活动积极分子
    湘西苗族自治区大庸县文化馆，在一月中举办了文艺活动积极分子训练班。参加训练班学习的有农村业余剧团团员、民间艺人和宣传员等六十四人。这次学习，使大家对建设社会主义社会有了进一步的认识；对文艺活动如何积极为宣传国家总路线服务，也有了更明确的认识。参加学习的文艺活动积极分子热情都很高，纷纷订出自己的工作计划，保证回去以后，在乡政府领导下，把剧团整顿好，充分运用三棒鼓、花灯、鱼骨筒、土地戏、山歌、莲花落等群众喜闻乐见的民间艺术形式，去进行宣传。　　　　（大庸县文化馆）
    文艺宣传会演
    江苏常州市文教局、文联为了在广大群众中进一步普遍深入地贯彻国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的宣传教育，在上月曾组织各单位举行文艺宣传会演，观众近二千人，演出节目有教育农民的“把粮食卖给国家”（锡剧）、“买犁”（淮剧）、“刘老汉卖粮”（锡剧）、“麦收之前”（话剧）；教育工人和居民的有“八寸鞋面布”（曲艺——常州道情）、“尽责任”（锡剧）、“大喜讯”（评弹）、“是我勿好”（沪剧）、“取缔不法奸商”（曲艺——四字唱）、“坚决打击投机奸商”（锡剧和通俗话剧）。在内容上都反映了现实生活，在形式上又是多样的，受到观众热烈的欢迎。
