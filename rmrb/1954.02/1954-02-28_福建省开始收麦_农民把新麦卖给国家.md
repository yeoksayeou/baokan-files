Fujian Province Begins Harvesting Wheat
	Farmers Sell New Wheat to the State

	While northern China is still frozen and snow-covered, in Fujian Province, which is almost "spring all year round," wheat has already begun to be harvested. In the Jinjiang and Minhou special districts of the province, some early wheat varieties began to appear on the market as early as mid-January. In other areas, new wheat will be successively available on the market in early March.

	Last year, farmers in Fujian Province planted more than 100,000 mu of wheat, an increase of more than 10 percent over 1952. Many areas have researched and improved wheat planting methods, which has resulted in this year's wheat harvest being much earlier than in previous years; some areas have advanced the harvest by about a month.

	After harvesting the new wheat, the farmers in Fujian Province promptly dried and winnowed it, and sold it to the state. State-owned grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have promptly posted notices and are conducting purchases. According to incomplete statistics, as of the beginning of this month, Jinjiang and Minhou special districts have purchased more than 290,000 jin of new wheat.

    福建省开始收麦
    农民把新麦卖给国家
    当我国北方还是天寒地冻的时候，在几乎是“四季皆春”的福建省，小麦已开始收割。该省晋江、闽侯两专区的新麦，有些早在一月中旬就开始登场。其他地区在三月上旬新麦也将陆续上市。
    去年福建省农民多种了十几万亩小麦，种植面积比一九五二年扩大百分之十以上。许多地区研究和改进了小麦的种植方法，使今年小麦收获期比往年提早很多；个别地区提早了约一个月。
    福建省农民们在收割新麦后，都及时晒干颺净，卖给国家。国营粮食部门和供销合作社已及时挂牌，进行收购。据不完全统计，晋江、闽侯两专区到本月上旬为止，已收购新麦二十九万多斤。
