Xinhua News Agency, Kandy, 12th: The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held a meeting on the 9th to discuss the economic situation in Asia and the Far East.

    Soviet representative M.A. Menshikov pointed out at the meeting that signs of economic crisis are increasing in some Asian countries. He said: The fundamental reasons for the deteriorating economic situation in Asian and Far Eastern countries are: 1. Certain countries want to subordinate the economies of Asian and Far Eastern countries to their aggressive purposes, and shift the burden of arms expansion and the impending domestic crisis to economically underdeveloped countries; 2. The policies of certain countries seriously hinder the development of economic and other relations between Asian and Far Eastern countries and the countries of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp; 3. The monopoly capitalist groups of large capitalist countries continue to depress the prices of exports from Asian and Far Eastern countries on the one hand, while maintaining high prices for imports from these countries.

    In his speech, Menshikov cited facts and figures to illustrate the economic and cultural achievements of the People's Republic of China, and talked about the achievements of the Central Asian Soviet Republics in these areas.

    Menshikov said that, taking into account the needs and interests of Asian and Far Eastern countries, the Soviet Union is ready to develop trade with these countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, to conclude long-term mutual purchase contracts with these countries, and to study the specific requests of these countries for technical assistance based on their importance to the economic development of these countries.

    The Soviet representative finally invited representatives from India, Burma (Myanmar), Indonesia, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Afghanistan, Pakistan, Thailand, Japan, the Philippines, Nepal, Malaya (Malaysia), and British Borneo (two to five representatives from each country) to visit the Soviet Union for one month in September and October 1954 to learn about the economic development of the Soviet Union.

    苏联准备和亚洲各国缔结长期购货合同
   【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社康提讯：联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会于九日举行会议，讨论亚洲和远东的经济情况。
    苏联代表米·阿·曼希科夫在会上指出，在一些亚洲国家里，经济危机的迹象正在增加。他说：亚洲和远东国家经济情况恶化的根本原因是：一、某些国家想使亚洲和远东国家的经济从属于它们的侵略目的，并把扩充军备以及国内即将来到的危机的负担转嫁到经济不发达的国家身上；二、某些国家的政策严重地阻碍了亚洲和远东国家与和平、民主、社会主义阵营各国的经济关系及其他关系的发展；三、大资本主义国家垄断资本集团继续一方面压低亚洲与远东国家的出口货价格，同时却使这些国家的进口货维持很高的价格。
    曼希科夫在发言中列举事实和数字，说明中华人民共和国的经济与文化成就，并谈到中亚细亚各苏维埃共和国在这些方面的成就。
    曼希科夫说，考虑到亚洲和远东国家的需要和利益，苏联准备在平等互利的基础上发展和这些国家的贸易，准备和这些国家缔结互相购货的长期合同，并根据对于这些国家的经济发展的重要性来研究这些国家请求给予技术援助的具体要求。
    苏联代表最后邀请印度、缅甸、印尼、锡兰、阿富汗、巴基斯坦、泰国、日本、菲律宾、尼泊尔、马来亚和英属婆罗洲的代表（各派二人到五人），在一九五四年九月和十月间到苏联作一个月的访问，以了解苏联的经济发展情况。
