Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: TASS, Moscow—"Pravda" published an editorial on February 14th entitled "Unbreakable Soviet-Chinese Friendship—A Powerful Factor in Maintaining Peace," stating: Today is the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. The people of the Soviet Union and China, as well as all progressive mankind, note with great satisfaction that Soviet-Chinese friendship has become a powerful factor in maintaining peace and ensuring the security of people of all countries.

    The editorial quoted the congratulatory telegrams exchanged between G.M. Malenkov and Mao Zedong, stating: Soviet-Chinese friendship has a long history. The national liberation struggle of the Chinese people has always received the sincere support of the Soviet people. The great victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party against domestic and international reactionary forces has created favorable conditions for lasting and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people.

    The editorial pointed out: The treaty signed on February 14, 1950, consolidated this friendship and became an unshakable foundation for comprehensive political, economic, and cultural cooperation based on the principles of equality. The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have established a broad system of mutually beneficial economic relations. A prominent feature of Soviet-Chinese economic relations is their continuous expansion. Trade between the Soviet Union and China has increased several times in recent years. In the summer of 1953, the Soviet government agreed to meet the requirements of the People's Republic of China and decided to provide extensive long-term assistance to complete China's economic development plan. By the end of 1959, the Soviet Union will help China build and renovate 141 large-scale projects, including iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, machine manufacturing plants, tractor factories, and automobile factories. The Soviet people consider it their great international responsibility to help the Chinese people strengthen their country and build a better life.

    The hardworking and brave Chinese people, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party, have made great progress in building a new life. The democratic reforms implemented by the People's Government have changed the face of the country and the lives of the people. The historic land reform has been completed. In 1952, the total output of China's major industrial and agricultural products exceeded the highest annual output in Chinese history. In 1953, the People's Republic of China began to implement its first Five-Year Plan. The plan for the first year of the Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed. Many large industrial enterprises have already started production and are now producing complex machine tools and various industrial equipment. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are embarking on the industrialization of their country, transforming China into an industrial-agricultural country. Agriculture, having freed itself from the shackles of feudal production relations, is developing its productive forces. Agricultural production is increasing. The cooperative movement is expanding in rural areas. The lives of the Chinese people have undergone fundamental changes. The living standards of workers and peasants are constantly improving. The broad masses have the opportunity to receive culture and knowledge. In China, more than 100 million adults and children are now studying. The alliance of the working class and the peasantry is the foundation of the Chinese people's victory. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the current period in Chinese history is a new stage—the stage of socialist transformation.

    The great changes taking place among the Chinese people, the economic and political achievements of the People's Republic of China, the consolidation of the country, and the close unity of the masses with the government and the Communist Party have increasingly strengthened the international position of the People's Republic of China and increased its importance as a major factor for peace in the Far East and the world. Thanks to the active efforts of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Korean War, which contained the most serious international disputes, was stopped, and the armistice agreement was signed, which created favorable conditions for further easing international tensions.

    It is very clear that continuing to ignore the fundamental changes taking place in Asia—mainly manifested in the victory of the Chinese people and the establishment of the People's Republic of China—will worsen international relations and hinder the resolution of urgent international issues closely related to the people of all countries. However, there are still countries like the United States that refuse to "recognize" the People's Republic of China. But "not recognizing" facts, especially "not recognizing" major historical developments, has never produced good results. If we sincerely talk about respecting the rights of all countries, we must first stop pursuing the policy of ignoring China and restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and all international organizations.

    Twenty-five countries, large and small, with nearly one billion people, have taken the path of establishing normal diplomatic relations with China—a path determined by the realities of life. Without China's participation, the issue of easing international tensions cannot be resolved smoothly. As a major country, China can help solve international issues not only related to Asia. China's participation will greatly contribute to the solution of international issues such as: disarmament, reaching agreements on atomic issues, developing international trade, and ultimately improving relations between large and small countries. This should be the goal of a five-power conference. The Soviet Union has put forward a corresponding proposal for convening a five-power conference. This is the demand that the Soviet Union has insisted on at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

    The banner of peace and international friendship is sacred to the Soviet people. It is equally sacred to our great friends, the Chinese people. Peaceful and friendly coexistence with the people of all countries is the most cherished goal and the most ardent desire of the Soviet and Chinese people. The unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is a powerful factor in maintaining peace and ensuring the security of the people of all countries.

    The Soviet people sincerely hope that the great Chinese people will achieve success in their selfless struggle to realize the industrialization of their country, continuously improve their economic, cultural and living standards, and extremely strengthen their people's democratic state.

    牢不可破的苏中友谊——维护和平的强有力因素
    ——苏联“真理报”二月十四日社论摘要
   【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十四日以“牢不可破的苏中友谊——维护和平的强有力因素”为题发表社论说：今天是苏联与中华人民共和国签订中苏友好同盟互助条约四周年纪念日。苏联和中国人民以及所有进步人类极为满意地注意到苏中友谊已经成了维护和平，保障世界各国人民安全的强有力因素。
    社论引述了格·马·马林科夫和毛泽东互致祝贺的电文后说：苏中友谊是有悠久历史的。中国人民的民族解放斗争一直得到苏联人民的真诚支持。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下取得的对国内与国际反动势力的伟大胜利，为苏中人民之间的持久与牢不可破的友谊创造了有利条件。
    社论指出：一九五○年二月十四日签订的这个条约巩固了这种友谊，成了根据平等原则，进行全面的政治、经济与文化合作的不可动摇的基础。苏联与中华人民共和国建立了广泛的互利经济关系体系。苏中经济关系的一个突出的特点就是这种关系的不断扩大。苏中两国之间的贸易近年来已经增加了好几倍。一九五三年夏季，苏联政府同意满足中华人民共和国的要求，决定给予广泛的长期的援助，来完成中国的经济发展计划。到一九五九年年底为止，苏联将帮助中国新建和改建一百四十一项规模巨大的工程，其中包括钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿、机器制造厂、拖拉机制造厂和汽车厂。苏联人民认为帮助中国人民加强他们的国家并建设美好的生活是他们的巨大的国际责任。
    勤劳、勇敢的中国人民在他们的光荣的共产党的领导下，在建设新生活方面有了很大的进展。人民政府实行的民主改革已经改变了国家的面貌与人民的生活。历史性的土地改革已经完成了。一九五二年，中国工农业主要生产品的总量就已经超过了中国历史上最高年产量。一九五三年，中华人民共和国开始执行第一个五年计划。五年计划第一年的计划已经胜利完成。许多大工业企业已经开始投入生产，目前已经开始生产复杂的工作母机与各种各样的工业设备。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，正着手把他们的国家工业化，把中国变成一个工业—农业国。农业在摆脱了封建生产关系的束缚之后，生产力正在发展。农业生产正在提高。合作运动正在农村扩大。中国人民的生活已经发生了根本的改变。工人和农民的生活水平在日益提高。广大的群众已经有机会接受文化和知识。在中国，现在有一亿多成年人和儿童在学习。工人阶级和农民的联盟是中国人民胜利的基础。毛泽东同志说中国历史上目前这个时期是一个新阶段——社会主义改造的阶段。
    中国人民所进行的伟大的变革、中华人民共和国在经济和政治上的成就、国家的巩固以及群众与政府及共产党的紧密团结，使得中华人民共和国的国际地位日益加强，使得它作为远东和全世界和平的重大因素的重要性越来越增加。由于中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的主动努力，包藏着最严重的国际纠纷的朝鲜战争得以停止，停战协定签订了，这个协定为国际紧张局势的进一步缓和创造了有利的条件。
    十分明显，继续对亚洲所发生的根本改变——这主要表现在中国人民的胜利以及中华人民共和国的成立方面——置之不理，将使国际关系恶化，并且阻碍与世界各国人民切身相关的迫切国际问题得到解决。不过还有像美国这样的国家仍然拒绝“承认”中华人民共和国。但是“不承认”事实，尤其是“不承认”重大的历史发展情况，从来也没有产生过好的结果。如果我们诚恳地谈论尊重各国的权利、首先就必须停止奉行忽视中国的政策，必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国和所有国际组织中受到侵犯的权利。
    拥有差不多十亿人口的二十五个大小国家，已经采取了和中国建立正常外交关系的道路——一条生活现实所决定的道路。没有中国参加，缓和国际紧张局势的问题就无法顺利解决。作为一个大国，中国能够帮助解决不仅是与亚洲有关的国际问题。中国的参加将大大有助于下列国际问题的解决，譬如：裁减军备、在原子问题上取得协议，发展国际贸易、最后是改善大小国家之间的关系。这应该作为五大国会议的目标。为召开五大国会议，苏联已经提出了一项相应的建议。苏联在柏林四国外长会议上所坚持的就是这种要求。
    和平与国际友谊的旗帜对于苏联人民是神圣的。对于我们伟大的朋友——中国人民同样也是神圣的。与各国人民和平、友好相处是苏中两国人民最关怀的目标，也是两国人民最热烈的愿望。苏联和中华人民共和国的牢不可破的友谊是维护和平与保障各国人民安全的一个强有力的因素。
    苏联人民衷心希望伟大的中国人民在为实现他们国家的工业化，不断提高他们的经济、文化和生活水平以及极度加强他们人民民主国家而进行的忘我斗争中取得成就。
