    Welcome the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team
    The first group of players from the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team, composed of internationally renowned football players, arrived in Beijing on February 12th. In addition to holding matches and performances with our country's football teams in Beijing, the team will also visit Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. The people of our country, our sports workers, and athletes express a warm welcome and brotherly respect to the glorious Hungarian National Football Mixed Team for their visit to our country. We firmly believe that the visit of the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team will not only enhance the friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Hungary, especially the sports workers and athletes of the two countries, but also promote the further development of sports in our country, especially football.
    The Hungarian People's Republic is one of the most developed countries in the world in terms of sports. At the 15th International Olympic Games in 1952, Hungarian national athletes won a total of forty-two gold medals, fifteen silver medals, and thirty-two bronze medals in various competitions with athletes from sixty-eight countries, ranking third in total score only after the Soviet Union and the United States. In particular, in football, the Hungarian national team has won victories in all international competitions since 1951 and won the title of the 15th International Olympic Football Champion. Most outstandingly, in a match against a mixed team of British professional footballers in London, England, on November 25, 1953, the Hungarian football team defeated the previously undefeated British professional football team with an absolute advantage of six to three, opening a new page in the history of world football.
    The reason why the sports of the Hungarian People's Republic have developed so rapidly in just eight years is primarily due to the strong advocacy of the Hungarian Party and government. When making decisions on restoring and developing the national economy and cultural undertakings, the Hungarian Party and government paid great attention to sports, allocating a considerable amount of funds in the national budget to build and renovate sports venues and add sports equipment. In 1951, the Hungarian Council of Ministers clearly pointed out in an instruction preparing for the establishment of a National Sports Commission: "The development of sports and its central guidance are the tasks of the state itself in the Hungarian People's Republic, which is engaged in socialist construction." Under the earnest care of the Party and the government, sports activities in Hungarian factories, rural areas, troops, government offices, schools, and among the people have been widely carried out, and various sports techniques have been significantly improved.
    Unswervingly learning from the Soviet Union is another important reason for promoting the rapid development of Hungarian sports. Gyula Hegyi, Chairman of the Sports Committee of the Hungarian People's Republic, said: "We are turning sports into the property of millions of people. For this purpose, we are transforming all Hungarian sports organizations. Hungarian sports will be the most national, but its content, purpose, and tasks will be the same as those of the Soviet Union, subject to one idea—to make the younger generation physically strong, well-trained, loyal to the people, and prepared for labor and defending the motherland." The Hungarian Party and government are convinced of the superiority of the advanced theories and experience of Soviet sports. In 1949, they implemented the "Preparing for Labor and Defense" sports system. By 1952, more than 480,000 people had reached the passing standard. Now, sports have gradually become a part of the lives of the Hungarian people.
    Under the strong advocacy of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Comrade Mao Zedong, China's sports are advancing under the slogan of learning from the Soviet Union. The rapid popularization and improvement of Hungarian sports is our example. We must learn the excellent techniques of Hungarian football, learn their spirit of unswervingly learning from the Soviet Union, and actively carry out mass sports activities.

    欢迎匈牙利国家足球混合队
    由具有国际声誉的足球运动员组成的匈牙利国家足球混合队首批队员，已于二月十二日到达北京。该队除在北京和我国各足球代表队进行比赛、表演外，并将赴上海、武汉等地访问。我国人民、我国体育工作者和运动员，对光荣的匈牙利国家足球混合队来我国访问，表示热烈的欢迎和兄弟般的敬意。我们坚信，通过匈牙利国家足球混合队的访问，不仅可以增进中匈两国人民，尤其是两国体育工作者和运动员的友好合作，同时还可以推动我国体育运动，特别是足球运动的进一步发展。
    匈牙利人民共和国是全世界体育运动最发达的国家之一。在一九五二年第十五届国际奥林匹克运动会上，匈牙利国家选手，在和六十八个国家选手的各种竞赛中，共赢得四十二枚金质奖章、十五枚银质奖章和三十二枚铜质奖章，总分仅次于苏联、美国而荣居第三位。特别是足球运动，自一九五一年以来，匈牙利国家代表队在历次国际比赛中都获得胜利，曾荣获第十五届国际奥林匹克足球冠军称号，而最杰出的是一九五三年十一月二十五日在英国伦敦和英国职业足球队混合队的一场比赛，匈牙利足球队以六比三的绝对优势打败了过去九十年来常胜不败的英国职业足球队，翻开了世界足球运动史的新页。
    匈牙利人民共和国的体育运动，在短短八年内所以能有如此迅速的发展，首先是由于匈牙利的党和政府的大力提倡。匈牙利的党和政府在作出关于恢复和发展国民经济与文化事业的决定时，对体育运动事业给予莫大的关注，在国家预算中拨出相当数量的资金，来兴建和重修体育场所，添设运动器械。一九五一年，匈牙利部长会议在准备成立全国体育运动委员会的一项指示中曾明确指出：“正在从事社会主义建设的匈牙利人民共和国，体育运动的发展和它的中心指导工作是国家本身的任务。”在党和政府的殷切关怀下，匈牙利的工厂、农村、部队、机关、学校和人民群众间的体育运动得到了广泛的开展，各种运动技术也随即有了显著的提高。
    坚定不移地向苏联学习，是促进匈牙利体育运动迅速发展的另一重要原因。匈牙利人民共和国体育运动委员会主席赫基·纠拉说：“我们正在把体育变成千百万人民群众的财产。为了这种目的，我们正改造着匈牙利的一切体育组织。匈牙利体育运动将是最具有民族性的，但是它的内容、目的和任务将和苏联一样，服从于一个思想——使青年一代成为身体健壮，经过锻炼，忠于人民以及对于劳动和保卫祖国有着准备的人。”匈牙利的党和政府确信苏联体育运动的先进理论和经验的优越性，在一九四九年便实行了“准备劳动与卫国”体育制度，至一九五二年，即有四十八万余人达到及格标准。现在，体育运动已逐渐成为匈牙利人民生活的一部分。
    在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东同志的大力倡导下，我国的体育运动正在学习苏联的口号下前进着。匈牙利体育运动的迅速普及和提高，正是我们的榜样。我们必须学习匈牙利足球运动的优良技术，学习他们坚定不移地向苏联学习的精神，积极开展群众性的体育运动。
