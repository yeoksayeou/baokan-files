    The grain purchasing work that began in the fourth quarter of last year is estimated to exceed the planned target by now. This is the result of the concerted efforts of the entire party and all the people under the inspiration of the general line. This is another victory of great significance in the country's economic and political work. In order to consolidate the achieved results of the grain purchase work, the following three tasks must be carefully carried out at present: First, earnestly carry out the work of grain delivery, transportation to warehouses, storage, and transfer; second, strengthen the grain supply work; third, immediately lead the peasants to prepare for this year's production, and vigorously improve the supply of materials in rural areas, as well as savings and credit work.
    In the past few months, thanks to a series of economic measures taken by the state, coupled with in-depth and extensive political education of the peasants by the entire party, the enthusiasm of the peasants to sell grain has been greatly encouraged. The broad masses of peasants have actively reported the amount of surplus grain they are willing to sell, once again demonstrating their patriotic spirit. However, the work in the past stage is only part of the entire grain work and only a good start. At present, it is necessary to continue to do a good job in grain delivery, to ensure that the grain is transported to the state warehouses in a timely manner, and to prevent mildew and deterioration, so that the purchased grain truly becomes the material in the hands of the state. In order to do this well, it is still necessary to continue to carefully ascertain the grain situation in the rural areas, and on the basis of the peasants' current purchases, do a realistic job of the peasants' grain sales; strengthen the grain transfer work and warehouse storage work.
    In terms of the current grain situation, after completing the state's grain requisition and purchase tasks, and excluding the peasants' rations, seeds, and feed, there is still about 20 percent of the total surplus grain in the rural areas, which shows that the rural grain is still abundant. However, from the perspective of villages and households, their surplus grain holdings are uneven. Some farmers, due to the need for production and living funds, sold some of the necessary grain for turnover; other farmers, due to their high enthusiasm for selling surplus grain, subscribed for excessive quantities. These two groups of farmers currently have no surplus grain, or very little surplus grain, and some will have to buy back some grain more or less in the future. In contrast, in some areas, due to insufficient publicity and education on our part, and some farmers not realizing the importance of selling grain to the state, the amount they subscribed for is still insufficient, and they still have more surplus grain in their hands. Therefore, in the grain delivery work, attention should be paid to both taking care of the needs of the state and taking care of the possibility of each village and household selling surplus grain, carefully verifying whether the amount of surplus grain sold by farmers is realistic, and doing a good job in the internal allocation of surplus grain in rural areas to ensure that the grain delivery work is done well.
    In terms of the grain transportation and warehousing work, because China's transportation conditions are still very backward today, grain transportation mainly relies on human and animal power. This year, the peasants' grain sales are concentrated and the quantity is large. To transport these grains into warehouses requires mobilizing thousands of people. This is an extremely arduous organizational mobilization task. In addition, the spring plowing season is approaching and the winter production work in rural areas is also very intense. Therefore, it is necessary to seize the short period of February and March to quickly and orderly transport the purchased grain to the location designated by the state. If this work is not done well and the time is delayed, it will affect spring plowing, create many difficulties for grain supply work, and bring unnecessary losses to the state and the people.
    In terms of grain storage, because there was more rain and higher grain moisture and more impurities in some areas last year; and the grain entered the warehouse in a short time, the amount of commercial grain controlled by the state plus public grain is very large, and the warehouse capacity is insufficient. Therefore, this year's grain storage work faces many difficulties. The way to overcome difficulties and do a good job in grain storage, in addition to mobilizing grain storage workers to actively and responsibly strengthen management, it is also necessary to continue to mobilize the power of the whole party and all the people. For example, in order to solve the difficulty of insufficient warehouse capacity, some areas have temporarily rented some private houses as granaries. Then, the broad masses of people in these areas should be educated to explain to them that the grain stored by the state is to supply the needs of the military and civilians, ensure national construction and support the resistance against U.S. aggression and aid Korea. This is related to the vital interests of everyone, and they should be mobilized to actively and proactively assist in the grain storage work, strictly prevent theft, fire, and other accidents, and resolutely fight against all saboteurs. Only by shaping the storage work into a broad mass work can our grain storage work be done well. If there is any negligence, it will cause significant losses to the state and the people. This should arouse our serious attention.
    After completing the grain purchase work, it is also necessary to do a good job in the grain supply work. This is a unified component of the national grain policy. The scope of the state's supply includes not only cities above the county level, but also market towns, grain-deficient economic crop areas, about 10% of the rural population who are grain-deficient households, and about 10% of the rural population who are farmers in disaster areas. That is to say, the population guaranteed supply by the state, in rural areas alone, is nearly 100 million, plus cities, the total is nearly 200 million. Guaranteeing that these 200 million urban and rural people eat grain at reasonable prices is, without a doubt, an extremely arduous task. Therefore, the Party and the government have repeatedly emphasized that while purchasing grain, all localities should pay attention to doing a good job in grain supply. In the past few months, the unified grain supply work carried out by the state in cities and industrial and mining areas has guaranteed the needs of the people and has been supported by the broad masses of people. This proves that the unified grain supply by the state is completely necessary and possible. However, in market towns and vast rural areas, all localities have concentrated their efforts on grain purchase work, and grain supply work has not yet been rolled out. Now that the grain purchase work has come to a preliminary end, sufficient strength must be used to take into account the grain supply to rural areas and market towns. It should be recognized that the supply work in these areas is much more complicated than in cities and industrial and mining areas, because the grain-deficient households in the vast rural areas and market towns are scattered, the situation of the grain-deficient households varies, and it is difficult to grasp. In addition, we have no experience in the supply work in market towns and rural areas, and there may be more difficulties. In order to do this work well, the party and government leading departments in these areas must give sufficient attention to it, strengthen leadership in policies and practical work, and absorb the preliminary experience of unified grain supply already obtained in cities, combine it with local specific conditions, and apply it. It is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity of the unified grain supply, so that the state's grain supply policy is known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, so as to obtain the active support of the broad masses of farmers. Only in this way can the unified grain supply work in rural areas and market towns be done well.
    Developing agricultural production, whether in the past, present, or future, is the center of the Party's work in rural areas. Therefore, the Party and the government have repeatedly emphasized: while purchasing grain, it is necessary to do a good job of preparing for the expansion of agricultural production. Under the inspiration of the general line, the peasants' demand for developing production is very urgent, which creates good conditions for us to lead agricultural production. During the grain purchase period, many areas started from production and ended with production, helping farmers to draw up production plans and calculate production accounts. This not only smoothly completed the grain purchase task, but also greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers to increase grain production and develop mutual aid and cooperation, thus making the face of rural areas refreshed. However, some areas have not paid enough attention to improving the peasants' enthusiasm for production through the grain purchase work. In order to guarantee the realization of the task of increasing production in 1954, in areas where the grain purchase work has been completed or basically completed, we must quickly guide the peasants to shift to production. At present, it is necessary to organize winter plowing, conserve soil moisture, cultivate soil fertility, prevent pests, build and repair small-scale water conservancy projects, and enhance the ability to resist drought and flood in 1954. It is necessary to universally mobilize fertilizer accumulation and increase natural fertilizers so as to increase the amount of fertilization in the fields even under the conditions of insufficient commercial fertilizers, thereby increasing yields. In addition, it is also necessary to do a good job in maintaining draught animals and other work.
    Developing agricultural production is not enough to rely on the peasants' own strength. The state must provide assistance in many ways. Here, strengthening the supply of materials to rural areas by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, especially the supply of means of production, is of great significance. In the past few months, state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives have supplied more means of production and means of livelihood than in previous years in coordination with grain purchases. However, we must also see the new atmosphere that has emerged in rural areas after the grain purchase work, and improve our work according to the new situation. For example, at present, mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production have developed greatly. With the increase of agricultural production cooperatives, the reform of agricultural production technology will have further development, and the demand for new-style farm tools, large livestock, fertilizers, and other agricultural machinery will also increase; with the technological reform and production increase, farmers' means of livelihood will also put forward many new requirements in terms of variety, quantity, and quality. The working cadres of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives should pay attention to this new situation, earnestly study the changes in rural areas, and not only should supply the existing possible supply of means of production needed by farmers as much as possible, but also should actively organize the source of goods according to the needs of farmers and supply the materials needed by farmers according to possible conditions. On the other hand, developing agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives are three indispensable aspects of guiding the healthy development of the rural economy in a planned way and steadily transforming the small-peasant economy. These are three types of mutual aid and cooperation that are divided and connected and mutually promote each other. In the future, with the increasing upsurge of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production, the business of supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives must also be correspondingly developed, so that they are further closely linked with the mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production and systematically support the movement of agricultural cooperation.
    There is no doubt that the tasks before us are very arduous. However, with the mobilization of the whole party and the efforts of all the people, we can not only educate the peasants to change their long-standing habit of selling grain and sell their surplus grain enthusiastically and centrally, so that this year's grain purchase task can be overfulfilled, then we also have full confidence in doing the above-mentioned tasks well. At present, some areas where the grain purchase work is progressing slowly, seeing that other areas have completed the grain purchase task, are afraid that their work is lagging behind, and have generated impetuous emotions, and even phenomena of coercion and command, which should be quickly corrected. The cadres in these areas should learn from the successful experience of other areas, always adhere to the method of self-education of the masses, adhere to the method of persuasion and education, and strive to complete the grain purchase task. Impetuosity cannot solve the problem, and coercion and command are not allowed.
    In order to do the above-mentioned tasks well, this requires the party committees at all levels to rely more closely on the masses, make persistent efforts, give full play to the enthusiasm of the whole party and the broad masses of people, and earnestly implement the relevant policies in their work to successfully complete the current arduous task.

    粮食工作当前的重要任务
    从去年第四季度开始的粮食收购工作，到目前为止，估计已可以超额完成计划。这是在总路线的鼓舞下，全党和全体人民一致努力的结果。这是国家经济和政治工作的又一个具有重大意义的胜利。为了巩固购粮工作既得的成绩，当前必须注意做好下列三项工作：第一、认真做好缴粮以及运送入仓、保管调运等工作；第二、加强粮食的供应工作；第三、立即领导农民准备今年生产，并大力改进农村的物资供应以及储蓄信贷等工作。
    过去几个月中，由于国家采取了一系列的经济措施，加上全党动员向农民进行了深入而广泛的政治教育，鼓舞了农民们的售粮情绪，广大农民纷纷踊跃自报出售余粮的数字，又一次表现了农民们的爱国精神。但过去这一阶段的工作，还只是整个粮食工作的一部分，只是一个良好的开端。目前还需要继续做好缴粮工作，使粮食及时地运到国家仓库，并防止发生霉烂变质等现象，使收购的粮食真正成为国家手中的物资。为了做好这项工作，就还必须继续细致地摸清农村中的粮食情况，在农民现在认购的基础上，实事求是地做好农民的售粮工作；加强粮食调运工作和仓库保管工作。
    就目前粮食情况来说，在完成了国家的征粮和购粮任务以及除掉农民口粮、种籽、饲料以外，农村中还有约占余粮总额百分之二十左右的余粮，这说明农村粮食还是富裕的。但是，从村与村、户与户来看，它们拥有余粮的情况是不平衡的。某些农民为了生产和生活资金的需要，卖出了一部分生活必需的粮食进行周转；另一些农民由于出售余粮的积极性很高，认售的数量过多。这两部分农民，他们目前已无余粮，或者余粮很少，有的以后还要或多或少地买回一些粮食。与此相反，有些地方由于我们宣传教育不够，和有些农民没有认识到把粮食卖给国家的重要意义，他们认售的数量还不足，他们手上还拥有较多的余粮。因此，在缴粮工作中，应该注意既要照顾到国家的需要，又要照顾到每村每户出售余粮的可能，认真地核对农民出售余粮的数字是否切合实际，并做好农村余粮的内部调剂工作，保证把缴粮工作做好。
    就粮食运送入仓工作来说，由于我国今天的交通运输条件还很落后，粮食运送主要的还是依靠人力和畜力，而今年农民卖粮集中，数量又大，要把这些粮食运送入库，就需要动员成千成万的人力。这是一件极其艰巨的组织动员工作。加之目前已迫近春耕时期，农村冬季生产工作也很紧张，因此还必须抓紧二月和三月这短短的时间，迅速地、有秩序地把收购到的粮食运送到国家指定的地点。如果这项工作做得不好，拖延了时间，就会影响春耕，就会给粮食供应工作造成很多困难，就会给国家和人民带来不必要的损失。
    就粮食的保管来说，由于去年有些地区雨水多，粮食水分高、杂质多；而粮食入仓的时间短促，国家掌握的商品粮加上公粮的数量又很大，加上仓容不足，因此今年粮食保管工作是存在着很多困难的。克服困难做好粮食保管工作的办法，除了动员粮食保管工作人员积极负责加强管理工作而外，还必须继续动员全党和全体人民的力量。譬如，目前有些地区为了解决仓容不足的困难，临时租用了一部分民房作为粮仓，那末，就应该教育这些地区的广大群众，向他们说明国家储备的粮食，就是为了供应军民需要，保证国家建设和支援抗美援朝，这是关系到每一个人的切身利益的，动员他们积极主动地起来协助做好粮食保管工作，严密防止盗窃、失火等事故，并与一切破坏分子进行坚决的斗争。只有把保管工作形成为一个广泛的群众性的工作，我们的粮食保管工作才能够做好。如果稍有疏忽，就会使国家和人民遭到重大的损失。这一点应该引起我们的严重注意。
    作好了粮食收购工作，还必须作好粮食供应工作。这是国家粮食政策的统一组成部分。国家所要供应的范围不但包括县以上城市，也包括集镇，包括缺粮的经济作物区，包括农村人口中大约百分之十左右的缺粮户和大约占农村人口百分之十左右的灾区农民，这就是说，国家保证供应的人口，仅在农村，即近一亿，加上城市，总数近两亿。保证这两万万城乡人民吃到合理价格的粮食，毫无疑问，这是一个极其繁重的任务。所以，党和政府曾一再强调指出与收购粮食的同时，各地应该注意做好粮食的供应工作。过去几个月中，国家在城市和工矿区所进行的粮食统一供应工作，保证了人民的需要，得到了广大人民的拥护，这证明了由国家进行统一的粮食供应是完全必要和可能的。但是，在集镇和广大农村中，各地都因集中人力进行粮食收购工作，粮食供应工作还没有铺开。现在，购粮工作已初步告一段落，必须用足够的力量兼顾到对农村和集镇的粮食供应。应该认识，这些地区的供应工作比之城市和工矿区要复杂得多，因为广大农村和集镇的缺粮户分散，缺粮户的情况又参差不齐，难于掌握，加之我们在集镇与农村的供应工作还没有经验，困难可能就会更多一些。为了做好这一工作，这些地区的党政领导部门必须予以足够的重视，加强政策上和实际工作中的领导，并可吸收城市中已经取得的粮食统一供应的初步经验，结合当地具体情况，加以运用。必须广泛而深入地进行粮食统一供应的宣传，使国家的粮食供应政策家喻户晓，深入人心，以便取得广大农民群众的积极拥护，只有这样，农村和集镇的粮食统一供应工作才能做好。
    发展农业生产，无论过去、现在和将来，都是党在农村工作的中心。所以，党和政府一再强调：在收购粮食的同时，必须做好扩大农业生产的准备工作。在总路线的鼓舞之下，农民发展生产的要求很迫切，这给我们领导农业生产创造了良好的条件。很多地区在购粮期间，从生产入手到生产落脚，帮助农民打生产谱，算生产账，不但顺利地完成了购粮任务，而且大大地激发了农民增产粮食和发展互助合作的积极性，从而使农村的面貌为之一新。但也有些地区没有很好地注意通过购粮工作这个环节，去提高农民的生产积极性。为了保证实现一九五四年增产的任务，在完成或基本完成购粮工作的地区，应急速引导农民转入生产。目前要组织冬耕、保墒、培养地力、预防虫害，兴办和整修小型水利，增强一九五四年抗旱防涝的力量。要普遍发动积肥、增加自然肥料，以便在商品肥料不足的条件下仍能增加田地的施肥量，从而增加产量。此外，还要做好保养耕畜等工作。
    发展农业生产，光靠农民自己的力量是不够的，国家必须给予多方面的帮助。这里，加强国营商业和供销合作社对农村的物资供应工作，特别是生产资料的供应工作，具有着重要的意义。过去几个月，国营商业和供销合作社配合购粮，已供应了较往年为多的生产资料和生活资料。但是，我们还必须看到购粮工作以后农村出现的新气象，根据新的情况来改进我们的工作。例如，目前农业生产互助合作有很大的开展，随着农业生产合作社的增加，农业生产技术改革就将会有进一步的发展，新式农具、大牲畜、肥料及其它农械的需要也将增多；随着技术改革和生产增加，农民的生活资料不论在品种上、数量上、质量上也将提出许多新的要求。国营商业和供销合作社的工作干部，就应该重视这种新的情况，认真研究农村的变化，不仅应当把现有的可能供应的为农民需要的生产资料尽量供应给农民，而且应该根据农民的需要，积极组织货源，按可能的条件供应农民所需要的物资。另一方面，发展农业生产合作社、供销合作社、信用合作社，这是有计划地指导农村经济健康发展、稳步地改造小农经济所不可缺少的三个方面，这是互相分工而又互相联系和互相促进的三种互助合作。今后随着农业生产互助合作运动的日益高涨，供销合作社和信用合作社的业务也必须相应地有所发展，使其与农业生产互助合作进一步地密切联系起来，有系统地支持农业合作化的运动。
    毫无疑问，摆在我们面前的任务是很艰巨的，但是，在全党动员和全体人民努力下，我们既能教育农民改变了多年来的卖粮习惯，踊跃地集中地卖出了余粮，使得今年的购粮任务可以超额完成，那末，我们也就有充分的信心来做好上面所说的各项工作。目前有些购粮工作进展较为迟缓的地区，看到其他地区已经完成了购粮任务，怕自己工作落后，产生了急躁情绪，甚至发生强迫命令的现象，这是应该迅速纠正的。这些地区的干部应该学习其他地区的成功的经验，始终坚持群众自我教育的方法，坚持说服教育的方法，努力争取完成购粮任务，急躁是不能解决问题的，强迫命令是不允许的。
    为了做好上面所说各项工作，这就要求各级党委更密切地依靠群众，再接再厉，充分发挥全党和广大群众的积极性，并在工作中切实贯彻有关各项政策，胜利地完成当前的艰巨的任务。
