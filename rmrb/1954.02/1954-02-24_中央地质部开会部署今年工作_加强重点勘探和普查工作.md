The Central Geological Department of the People's Government recently convened a meeting of directors of local geological bureaus and captains of exploration teams to deploy geological exploration work for 1954.

After the major transformation and development of geological work in 1953, the meeting believed that it is now possible and necessary to comprehensively consider the needs of national construction for various mineral resources. Therefore, it was determined that the geological exploration work in 1954 should be further developed on the existing foundation, improve the quality of work, cultivate key personnel, strengthen collaboration, ensure the completion of key exploration and important engineering geological work, systematically expand prospecting and ore finding, and gradually strengthen scientific research work. The goal is to rapidly meet the resource needs of the country's first Five-Year Plan and actively prepare for the resource needs of the country's long-term plan.

Based on this task and the established plan, the Geological Department will first explore for coking coal required by the national ferrous metallurgical industry and power coal for important industrial areas; further explore for refractory clay and flux and other mineral raw materials required by the iron and steel industry; meet the current national needs for resources such as manganese, lead, and tin; and find certain metal minerals required for refining special steel. At the same time, actively carry out geological and hydropower station surveys in the Yellow River Basin, and continue to explore for copper and other mineral raw materials. According to the above-mentioned predetermined tasks, the number of geological exploration projects this year will increase by nearly one-third compared with 1953, the workload will increase by 50 percent, and the drilling workload will increase by 80 percent.

In order to actively prepare reserve production areas for various minerals and closely coordinate them with key exploration work, the meeting determined that this year, with the growth of geological exploration forces, it would carry out large-scale, targeted, and planned prospecting and ore-finding work. The number of prospecting projects will increase nearly fivefold compared to last year. This year, a large number of geology college and university geology department graduates will participate in this work, and teachers and students of geology colleges will also participate in internships during the summer vacation. To this end, the meeting proposed to sort out existing data and mass ore reporting data as soon as possible, prepare technical backbones, and convene mass ore reporting meetings by region, so as to launch a prospecting and ore-finding campaign in the second half of this year that combines specialized technical teams, the assistance of local people's governments, and the support of the broad masses of the people.

The meeting believed that it is necessary to gradually strengthen geological scientific research work this year to guide prospecting work and exploration work, and pointed out that scientific research work must proceed from national needs and be closely integrated with current practical work. It is necessary to strengthen the research and sorting of existing geological exploration data.

In order to ensure the completion of the two central tasks of key exploration and prospecting this year, explore for the expected mineral quantities, and find new mineral deposits, the meeting emphasized that it is necessary to improve work quality, improve scientific and technological levels, conduct correct exploration designs, and overcome blindness in work. To this end, it is necessary to continue to deeply and comprehensively study the advanced geological science theory and technology of the Soviet Union, emphasize the combination of theory and practice, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. At the same time, the meeting believed that it is also necessary to actively improve management levels, strengthen plan management and technical management, further establish and improve the responsibility system, and strengthen political work.

At this meeting, Liu Jie, Vice Minister of the Geological Department, first made a report on "The Basic Summary of Geological Work in 1953 and the Tasks for 1954," and finally Minister Li Siguang made a summary. Minister Li Siguang emphasized that this year, we must pay attention to preventing and overcoming the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end of the work, properly arrange the work in the three aspects of key exploration, prospecting and scientific research, continue to work hard to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to complete the geological exploration plan for 1954.

    中央地质部开会部署今年工作
    加强重点勘探和普查工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府地质部最近召开各地质局局长、各勘探队队长会议，部署一九五四年的地质勘探工作。
    经过一九五三年地质工作的大转变和大发展，会议认为现在已有可能并且必须全面地来考虑满足国家建设对于各种矿产资源的要求。因此，确定一九五四年的地质勘探工作，应在已有的基础上进一步发展，提高工作质量，培养骨干，加强协作，保证完成重点勘探和重要的工程地质工作，有计划地扩大普查找矿，逐步加强科学研究工作，为迅速满足国家第一个五年计划所需要的资源，并积极为准备国家远景计划所需要的资源而斗争。
    根据这一任务和已经确定的计划，地质部今年将首先为国家探明黑色冶金工业所需的炼焦煤和重要工业区的动力用煤；进一步探明钢铁工业所需的耐火粘土和熔剂等矿物原料；满足当前国家对于锰、铅、锡等资源的需要；找到炼制特殊钢所需的某些金属矿物。同时，积极进行黄河流域地质和水力发电站的勘察，继续进行铜和其他矿物原料的勘探。根据上述的预定任务，今年地质勘探工作的项目比一九五三年增加近三分之一，工作量增加百分之五十，钻探工作量增加百分之八十。
    为了积极准备各种矿产的后备产地，使它和重点勘探工作密切配合，会议根据地质勘探力量增长的情况，确定今年将进行规模较大的有目标、有计划的普查找矿工作。普查找矿的项目比去年增加将近五倍。今年将有大批的地质学院和大学地质系毕业生参加这个工作，地质学院的师生也将利用暑期参加实习。为此，会议提出要及早整理现有资料和群众报矿资料，准备技术骨干，分区召开群众报矿会议，以便在今年下半年展开一个有专门技术队伍参加、有地方人民政府人员帮助、有广大人民群众支持的三者相结合的普查找矿运动。
    会议认为今年必须逐步加强地质科学研究工作，以指导普查工作和勘探工作，并指出科学研究工作必须从国家需要出发，密切结合当前实际工作来进行，要加强对已有地质勘探资料的研究和整理。
    为了保证完成一九五四年重点勘探和普查找矿的两大中心任务，探明预期的矿量，找到新的矿产地，会议强调必须提高工作质量，提高科学技术水平，进行正确的勘探设计，克服工作中的盲目性。为此，必须继续深入地、全面地学习苏联先进的地质科学理论和技术，强调理论和实际相结合，展开批评和自我批评。同时，会议认为还必须积极提高管理水平，加强计划管理和技术管理，进一步建立和健全责任制，加强政治工作。
    这次会议首先由地质部副部长刘杰作“一九五三年地质工作的基本总结与一九五四年的任务”的报告，最后由李四光部长作总结。李四光部长强调指出：今年必须注意防止和克服工作中的前松后紧的现象，适当地安排重点勘探、普查找矿和科学研究三方面的工作，继续努力学习苏联先进经验，为完成一九五四年的地质勘探计划而斗争。
