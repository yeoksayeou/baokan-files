Yue Shuiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bishan County, Sichuan Province
Overcomes Members' "Closed-Door" Mentality and Expands the Cooperative

    The members of the Yue Shuiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qinggang Village, Bishan County, Sichuan Province, have overcome their "closed-door" mentality and are actively working to expand the cooperative.
    After hearing the publicity about the general line, the peasants of Qinggang Village clearly saw that only by taking the socialist road could everyone be happy. They requested to join the Yue Shuiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative, and many people signed up to participate in the cooperative's expansion study sessions. More than 120 peasant households from Qingming, Shigang and other villages near Qinggang Village also actively signed up to join the cooperative.
    After attending the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the cooperative's director, Yue Shuiqing, recognized the important significance of expanding the cooperative. Upon returning, he first conveyed the spirit of the Provincial Committee's Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference to the village cadres and the masses, and clearly explained the issue of expanding the cooperative. When the masses heard that the cooperative was going to expand, they were overjoyed. However, some members of Yue Shuiqing's cooperative were unwilling to expand the cooperative. Many veteran members believed: "We have worked hard for more than a year, the fields have just been processed, so much fertilizer has been applied, and so much capital has been invested in sideline businesses and public property. It has not been easy to get to this point, and if new members come in, they will dilute our benefits." In addition, some members had personal opinions about certain peasants outside the cooperative and did not agree to these people joining the cooperative.
    In order to overcome the "closed-door" mentality of the members, Yue Shuiqing and the party members in the cooperative, Xiao Yongguo, Sun Kexiang, and others, after discussing the issue, convened a meeting of cooperative cadres and a meeting of cooperative members to further educate everyone about the two roads and collectivism, and encourage members to discuss: Why should the cooperative be expanded? What are the benefits of expanding the cooperative? They made everyone realize that only when the vast number of peasants are organized and take the road of collectivization can production be increased, the country be built, and socialism be realized. Xu Yongbi, the leader of the women's group, said: "Individual peasants produce less grain, which not only makes it difficult for them to live, but also prevents them from helping the country's industrial construction. Cooperatives can produce more grain, and we should absorb them when they want to participate." Old member Luo Haicheng also said: "Yes, those of us who joined the cooperative earlier have a responsibility to bring along the peasant brothers who have not yet joined the cooperative and walk together on the broad road of socialism. We should welcome them when they ask to join the cooperative; just our ten or eight households cannot reach socialism." After such persuasion and education, the thinking of other members was also cleared, and some specific problems in expanding the cooperative were further resolved. Each member has also become an active propagandist for expanding the cooperative.

    四川璧山县岳水清农业生产合作社
    克服社员的“关门”思想扩大了合作社
    四川省璧山县青杠村岳水清农业生产合作社社员，克服“关门”思想，积极进行扩大合作社工作。
    青杠村农民听到总路线的宣传后，看清了走社会主义的道路才能大家幸福，纷纷要求参加岳水清农业生产合作社，到合作社报名参加扩社学习的人很多。青杠村附近的青明、石杠等村，也有一百二十多户农民积极要求报名入社。
    社长岳水清参加了中共四川省委互助合作会议后，认识了扩大合作社的重要意义，回去首先向村干部和群众传达省委互助合作会议的精神，讲清楚了扩社问题，群众一听说合作社要扩大，都高兴万分。可是岳水清社里有些社员却不愿意扩大合作社。不少老社员认为：“我们辛辛苦苦的搞了一年多，田地刚加过工，施了那么多肥料，搞副业、公共财产又下了那么大的本钱，好容易搞到这个地步，新社员一进来，就会把我们的被盖扯薄。”另外有些社员对社外某些农民有私人意见，也不同意这些人入社。
    为了克服社员的“关门”思想，岳水清和社内的党员萧永国、孙可相等研究后，召开了社干会和社员大会，进一步向大家进行两条道路的教育和集体主义教育，启发社员讨论：为什么要扩大社？扩大社有什么好处？使大家认识到只有广大农民都组织起来，走集体化的道路，增加生产、建设国家，社会主义才能实现。妇女组长徐永碧说：“单干的农民粮食打得少，不但自己生活有困难，而且不能帮助国家工业建设。合作社能多打粮食，他们要求参加，我们应该吸收。”老社员罗海成也说：“是啊，我们先参加合作社的人，有责任把没有入社的农民兄弟带起来，一同走上社会主义的大路。他们要求入社，我们应当欢迎；光我们十来八户人也到不了社会主义。”其他的社员经过这样说服教育，思想也打通了，扩社中的一些具体问题也就进一步获得解决。每个社员也都变成了扩社的积极宣传者。
