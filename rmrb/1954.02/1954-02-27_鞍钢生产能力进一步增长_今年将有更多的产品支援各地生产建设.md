Anshan Iron and Steel Works (Angang) will produce more steel and other products this year to support production and construction in various regions. In 1953, the quantity of products Angang supplied to various regions had already exceeded that of 1949 by more than 120 times. In the past year, due to the improvement of equipment, tools, and operating methods in existing enterprises, and the commissioning of new plants—the Large Rolling Mill, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and blast furnaces, etc.—Angang's production capacity has greatly increased. This year, the quantity of products Angang supplies to various regions for production and construction will increase by about 20% compared to last year. One of the large steel products produced by the Large Rolling Mill this year will strongly support the construction of projects such as the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which are currently under construction. The seamless steel tubes that Angang shipped to various regions last year have already been used in production and construction. This year, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant will further meet the needs of production and construction in various regions. This year, Angang's support to Northeast, North China, East China, Southwest and other regions in terms of steelmaking pig iron and casting pig iron will double compared to last year, and a large amount of smelting coke will be supplied to many iron-smelting plants. This year, Angang's supply of steel to various farm tool factories will also increase significantly. In January alone, Angang supplied the Lingshan Farm Tool Factory with more than 3,500 tons of square steel, which can be made into more than 35,000 double-shared plows, equivalent to one-fifth of the total amount of steel Angang supplied to more than ten farm tool factories in Northeast and North China last year. This year, the quantity of ammonium sulfate, a chemical fertilizer used for agriculture supplied by Angang, will also increase by about 30% compared to last year. The quantity of ammonium sulfate shipped out of Angang in January exceeded that of January last year by one time. In addition, this year Angang will also supply tens of thousands of tons of chemical industry by-products such as pure benzene, power benzene, and refined naphthalene to pharmaceutical factories in various regions, which can be used to manufacture a large number of pesticides, mothballs, and so on.

    鞍钢生产能力进一步增长
    今年将有更多的产品支援各地生产建设
    鞍钢今年将生产更多的钢铁等产品，支援各地生产建设。一九五三年鞍钢供应各地的产品数量，已超过一九四九年的一百二十多倍。近一年来，由于旧有企业改进了设备、工具和操作方法，新建厂——大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和炼铁炉等投入生产，鞍钢生产能力大大提高。今年鞍钢供应各地生产建设的产品数量，将比去年增加百分之二十左右。今年大型轧钢厂所生产的大型钢材之一——将大力支援目前正在修建的宝成铁路、兰新铁路、武汉长江大桥等工程。鞍钢去年运往各地的无缝钢管，已被用在生产建设上去。今年，无缝钢管厂将进一步满足各地生产建设的需要。今年鞍钢支援东北、华北、华东、西南等地的炼钢生铁与铸造生铁，将比去年增加一倍，将供应许多炼铁厂大批的熔炼焦炭。鞍钢今年供给各农具厂的钢材，也将大大增加，仅一月份鞍钢供给灵山农具厂的方钢便有三千五百多吨，可制成三万五千多部双铧犁，相当于去年鞍钢供给东北、华北等地十余个农具工厂钢材总数的五分之一。今年鞍钢供应农业用的化学肥料——硫铵的数量，也将比去年增加百分之三十左右，一月份鞍钢运出的硫铵的数量，超过去年一月份的一倍。此外，鞍钢今年还要供给各地制药厂上万吨的纯苯、动力苯、精奈等化学工业副产品，可以制造出大批的农药、卫生球等。
