    National Theaters and Troupes in the Capital
    1954 Performance Plan

    To establish a normal repertoire performance system, the national theaters and troupes in Beijing have preliminarily formulated a 1954 repertoire performance plan after careful selection and review.

    Following the instructions of the Ministry of Culture, the China Youth Art Theater will focus on performing Chinese dramas with modern themes, supplemented by foreign dramas with historical themes, producing new repertoire while organizing retained repertoire, and maintaining regular performances in the theater. The theater plans to stage six plays this year, with 300 performances (240 public performances in the theater and 60 touring performances). The repertoire includes "Julius Fucik" (written by Soviet Yulius Borekovsky), "Steel Transportation Soldier" (written by Huang Ti), "Forty Years of Wishes," one-act plays "People Strive for Higher Ground," "Grass Sprouts Compete to Grow," and "Grain." To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Chekhov's death, Chekhov's famous play "Three Sisters" will be performed. The China Youth Art Theater's affiliated children's theater troupe will, in addition to organizing the original repertoire "Comrades Are With You," also perform the new plays "The Big Bad Wolf," "Be a Good Team Member," and "Red Scarves and Volunteer Army Uncles." In addition to coordinating with the general line propaganda during the Spring Festival by touring the countryside with one-act plays "Red Flag," "People Strive for Higher Ground," "Moon Bay," "Grain," and "Before Wheat Harvest," the Beijing People's Art Theater will also perform Soviet writer Anatoly Sofronov's new play "One Cannot Live Like That," Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm," and a newly created script with the theme of intellectual transformation. In addition, a one-act play by Chekhov will also be performed. The Central Experimental Opera House plans to perform the new operas "Liu Hulan" and "Song of the Prairie" this year, while also performing Ping opera "Sunshine After the Rain Has Good Prospects"; organizing and performing the large-scale mythological drama "Third Sister Descends to Earth" (Wuju), organizing existing operas: "The White-Haired Girl," "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," "The Whole Family is Glorious" and five traditional opera programs: "Hairpin Phoenix," "Blue Bridge Meeting," etc. The Central Song and Dance Troupe plans to organize and newly practice the following programs this year: ten choral programs including "Flying Tiger Mountain," "Alamuhan," "Ode to Stalin," "Yellow River Cantata," "Long Drum Dance," "Song on the River," and "Hero Yang Gensi"; orchestral music including "Yao Drum Dance," Mozart's "Violin Concerto," "Northern Shaanxi Suite," "Nostalgia," and "Youth Dance"; and nine folk music and dance programs including "Little Shepherd Boy," "Flying a Kite," "Lotus Lantern," "Running Donkey," "Tea Picking," and "Flower Drum Lantern." The China Peking Opera Troupe plans to perform 600 performances this year. In addition to the programs in the "Repertoire for Performance" in 1953, it also plans to organize and perform 20 programs including "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang," "Wild Boar Forest," "Generals and Ministers Reconcile," "Liu Yin Ji," "Black Whirlwind," "Hunting Tigers," "Eliminating Three Evils," and "Opposing Xuzhou." In addition, preparations are being made to write and perform "Song Jingshi," "Romance of the West Chamber," "Yue Fei," and "Three Great Mountains." The China Ping Opera Troupe plans to perform four new plays reflecting modern life this year: "The Volunteer Army's Fiancee," "Reunion," "Apricot Forest Record," and "Moon Bay Village," and adapt and organize nine programs including "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," "Zhuo Wenjun," "Du Shiniang," and "Sunshine After the Rain Has Good Prospects."

    Tianjin Holds First Opera Observation and Performance Conference

    The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau held the first Opera Observation and Performance Conference from January 15th to 31st. More than 750 opera workers from 19 professional troupes participated in this observation and performance. The more than 40 repertoires performed demonstrated that Tianjin's Ping opera, Hebei Bangzi, Peking opera, and Yue opera, and other types of drama, have made great progress in reform work in recent years. Among the programs performed, there was the Ping opera repertoire "Women's Representative," which reflects modern life, and excellent traditional repertoires such as Hebei Bangzi "Beating the Golden Branch," Ping opera "Jingtai Meeting," Yue opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," and Peking opera "Yan Yang Lou." The performances of these programs were all very successful. Ten repertoires, including Ping opera "Women's Representative" and Peking opera "Yan Yang Lou," won performance awards at the conference, and 68 actors won individual performance awards, including Han Junqing and 14 others who won first prizes. In addition, opera workers Wang Qinglin and Li Guichun, who have contributed to the opera cause, received certificates of merit, and outstanding playwrights, directors, and musicians received script awards, director awards, and music awards respectively.

    Drama Workers Observe and Learn

    In order to promote the exchange of experience and improve the professional level of state-owned drama troupes across the country, the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government organized more than 80 directors, actors, and stage designers from drama troupes across the country in November 1953 to observe the China Youth Art Theater's performance of "Julius Fucik" and the Beijing People's Art Theater's performance of "One Cannot Live Like That" in Beijing. The duration was fifty-one days.

    During the observation period, all observers participated in all activities of the China Youth Art Theater and the Beijing People's Art Theater in rehearsing "Julius Fucik" and "One Cannot Live Like That" (from analyzing and studying the scripts, studying the roles, to the entire rehearsal process), and under the enthusiastic care and assistance of the two theaters, organized symposiums on rehearsal systems, theater affairs, stage art design, actor business learning, and other issues, and exchanged experiences. The Art Affairs Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture also invited Guang Weiran, Zhou Weizhi, Jiao Juyin, Zhang Geng, Ouyang Shanzun, Sun Weishi, Zhao Yue, and others to make special reports on drama art. In addition, observation and study evening parties for drama, Peking opera, Ping opera, opera, acrobatics, dance, film, etc. were organized.

    Through the above observation and learning, all observers have gained a deeper understanding of how directors, actors, and stage designers can master realistic creative methods. (Wei Zhenqing)
