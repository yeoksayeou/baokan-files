    Xinhua News Agency, Prague. According to "Red Right Report": Czechoslovak Republic President Zápotocký and a delegation from the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government attended a conference of National Front activists in Brno on the 23rd.

    Zápotocký delivered an important speech at the meeting. He pointed out that the Brno State National Front activists' congress was held on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the February events (February 25th). Six years ago, under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and our forever-remembered Comrade Gottwald, our working people crushed the conspiracy and evil plans of domestic and foreign reactionaries to launch an anti-state coup. In those days, all working people showed a firm determination to never retreat in the face of the attacks of domestic reactionaries and the threats of foreign reactionaries, and to complete the revolutionary cause and advance towards the socialist construction of our country. The program of the new government of the National Front, established under the firm demands of the people, stipulated the continued gradual restriction of all capitalist exploitation and the continued carrying out of socialist construction. This program was the will of the entire people. The Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) for the construction and transformation of our entire economic life was born from this will. Completing the Five-Year Plan was a huge task that required full effort. The fact that this task has been generally completed is a great achievement of our working people.

    Zápotocký then used specific examples to illustrate the crimes of Slánský and other traitorous bandits in colluding with foreign reactionaries to sabotage socialist construction. He said that the government is taking resolute measures to eliminate the consequences of these sabotage activities.

    When talking about agricultural production, Zápotocký said that only large-scale production based on socialist unified agricultural cooperatives can guarantee the satisfaction of the growing material demands of the residents. The task of the Party and the government is to unswervingly implement the agricultural policy formulated by drawing on the experience of the glorious Soviet Communist Party. He emphasized that in order to maximize the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of all working people, it is necessary to constantly care for the rise of production and the improvement of labor productivity.

    Finally, when talking about the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting, Zápotocký said: I can say on behalf of all the people of our country that we fully agree with and warmly support the views of the Soviet government because it conforms to the principles of democracy, peace, and independence of all countries. We will continue to complete Comrade Gottwald's legacy under the leadership of the Communist Party, build socialism in our country, and defend world peace.

    支持苏联在四国外长会议上提出的观点
    【新华社布拉格讯】据“红色权利报”报道：捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基、捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府代表团，二十三日赴布尔诺州参加了民族阵线活动分子大会。
    萨波托斯基在会上发表了重要演说。他指出：布尔诺州民族阵线活动分子大会是在二月事件（二月二十五日）六周年前夕举行的。六年前，我国劳动人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党和我们永远怀念的哥特瓦尔德同志的领导下，粉碎了国内外反动派举行反国家的政变的阴谋和罪恶计划。在那些日子里，所有劳动人民都表现出坚强的决心，决不在国内反动派的进攻和国外反动派的威胁面前后退，一定要完成革命事业，向我国的社会主义建设前进。在人民的坚决要求下成立的民族阵线的新政府的纲领，规定要继续逐步限制一切资本主义剥削和继续进行社会主义建设，这一纲领是全体人民的意志。建设和改造我们全部经济生活的五年计划（一九四九——一九五三年）便是由这个意志产生的。完成五年计划是一个巨大的、必须全力以赴的任务。如果说这个任务已一般地完成了的话，这正是我们劳动人民的巨大成就。
    萨波托斯基接着以具体事例说明斯兰斯基等卖国匪徒配合外国反动派对社会主义建设进行破坏的罪行。他说：政府正在采取坚决的措施消除这些破坏活动所造成的后果。
    萨波托斯基在谈到农业生产时说：只有以社会主义性质的统一农业合作社为基础的大规模生产，才能保证满足居民不断增长的物质要求。党和政府的任务在于坚持不懈地实行由于吸取光辉的苏联共产党的经验而制订的农业政策。他强调说，为了最大限度地满足全体劳动人民的物质和文化要求，必须不断地关心生产的高涨和劳动生产率的提高。
    萨波托斯基最后在谈到柏林四国外长会议时说：我可以代表我国全体人民说，我们完全同意并热烈支持苏联政府的观点，因为它符合各国人民的民主、和平、独立的原则。我们将继续在共产党的领导下，完成哥特瓦尔德同志的遗志，在我国建设社会主义，保卫世界和平。
