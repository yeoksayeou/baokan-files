	【Report from this newspaper】This year, the four large-scale state-owned cotton mills being newly built in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Xi'an and other places in our country are tensely carrying out various preparatory work before construction, and will simultaneously begin full construction in March.
	Last year, our country began to build four large-scale state-owned cotton mills in the above-mentioned areas. These four factories are now starting to install machinery and will be put into production one after another starting in the second quarter of this year. The scale of the four large factories newly built this year is twice as large as the four factories established last year. Therefore, the capital construction task of the textile industry this year has also increased a lot compared with last year. The amount of capital construction work is 211.66 percent of that in 1953, and the construction area is 217.87 percent of that of last year. These four projects, in terms of their huge scale and technical complexity, are unprecedented in the history of my country's textile industry.
	In order to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of this year's capital construction tasks, the Ministry of Textile Industry and its affiliated construction units actively carried out various preparations for the new factories to be built this year while installing machinery in the new factories built in 1953. At present, the preliminary designs of the four new cotton mills have been completed and will be handed over for construction drawings starting in March. The supply of building materials is also proceeding tensely. The main building materials allocated by the state have been transported to the four construction sites.
	In the past year, all construction sites have explored some experience in construction. The Capital Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry has successively held a series of professional symposiums on labor quotas, planning statistics, labor protection, construction management, and political work at construction sites since November last year, summarizing and exchanging the advanced experience of the four major construction sites. The implementation of these advanced experiences will improve the construction and management level of this year's capital construction and prepare good conditions for completing this year's construction tasks.

    今年新建的四个大棉纺织厂即将开始施工
   【本报讯】今年，我国在北京、石家庄、郑州、西安等地新建的四个规模巨大的国营棉纺织厂，正紧张地进行施工前的各项准备工作，将于三月间同时开始全面施工。
    去年，我国开始在上述地区新建四个规模较大的国营棉纺织厂，这四个厂现已在着手安装机器。今年第二季度起即可先后投入生产。今年新建的四个大厂的规模，较去年建立的四个厂增大一倍。因而今年纺织工业的基本建设任务，也比去年增长很多，基本建设工作量为一九五三年的百分之二一一点六六；建筑面积为去年的百分之二一七点八七。这四项工程，就其规模的巨大和技术的复杂程度，都是我国纺织工业历史上空前未有的。
    为了保证完成和超额完成今年的基本建设任务，中央纺织工业部与部属各建设单位，在进行一九五三年新建厂安装机器的同时，就积极地进行了今年新建厂的各项准备工作。目前，四个棉纺织新厂的初步设计业已完成，并将于三月起陆续交出施工图。建筑材料供应工作也在紧张进行。由国家统一分配的主要建筑材料物资，已分别运到四个工地。
    去年一年，各工地在施工中都摸索出了一些经验，纺织工业部基本建设局从去年十一月份起，连续召开了工料定额、计划统计、劳动保护、施工管理以及工地政治工作等一系列专业座谈会，总结和交流了四个主要工地的先进经验。这些先进经验的贯彻执行，将使今年基本建设的施工与管理水平提高一步，给完成今年的施工任务准备了良好条件。
