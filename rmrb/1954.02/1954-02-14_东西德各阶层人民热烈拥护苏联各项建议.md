Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Recently, the Committee on German Reunification, the government of the German Democratic Republic, and the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers have received many letters from both East and West Germany expressing support for the various proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference to safeguard the national interests of Germany.

    The tenants of Hamburg, in their letter, pointed out that the residents of West Germany are bearing heavy financial burdens, which are the result of the Bonn government's pursuit of a militarization policy. The letter stated: "We want neither a new Wehrmacht nor a new military alliance. What we want is a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, so that we can live in friendship and trade with the peoples of other countries." The West German Social Democratic Party's newspaper, "Hannover News," recently wrote: "We Germans should ask our conscience whether we are willing to sacrifice the unity of our nation as a product of the European Defense Community? We want to openly declare that we do not agree to do so..." Weber, a well-known social activist and retired colonel in West Germany, also pointed out in the press release of the "League of Germans for Unity, Peace, and Freedom" that residents of all strata in West Germany are increasingly dissatisfied with Adenauer's militarization policy.

    东西德各阶层人民热烈拥护苏联各项建议
    据新华社十三日讯：最近德国统一问题委员会、德意志民主共和国政府和四国外长会议收到由德国东西两部寄来的许多信件，表示拥护苏联代表团在柏林外长会议上所提出的维护德国民族利益的各项建议。
    汉堡的全体房客在他们的信中指出，西德居民承担着沉重的财政负担，这种负担是由于波恩政府奉行军国主义化政策而产生的，信中写道：“我们既不要新的国防军，也不要新的军事同盟。我们要的是一个统一、和平与民主的德国，以便与其他各国人民友好相处和通商。”西德的社会民主党的机关报“汉诺威新闻报”最近写道：“我们德国人应该问问自己的良心，我们是不是愿意把我们民族的统一作为欧洲防务集团的牺牲品？我们要公开地宣布我们不同意这样做……”西德的著名社会活动家、退职的上校韦伯在“德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟”的新闻公报上也指出，西德各阶层的居民都越来越不满意阿登纳的军国主义化政策。
