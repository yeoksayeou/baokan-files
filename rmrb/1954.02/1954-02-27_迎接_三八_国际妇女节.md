International Democratic Women's Federation President Eugénie Cotton Issues Statement

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: TASS, Paris, February 25th: "L'Humanité" published a statement by Eugénie Cotton, President of the International Democratic Women's Federation and President of the French Women's Union, on the upcoming "March 8th" International Women's Day.

Mrs. Cotton pointed out that women around the world hope to prevent war and ensure the happiness of their children. She said that the main obstacle to obtaining this happiness is war. Therefore, French women are fighting to strengthen peace. "The struggle of women and mothers against war is growing stronger year by year. French women, together with all forces for peace, welcome the Korean armistice. Now, French women, together with all forces for peace, demand an end to the war in Vietnam and a peaceful settlement of the German question."

World Federation of Trade Unions Issues Statement

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: TASS, Vienna, February 25th: The World Federation of Trade Unions issued the following statement to the press:

On the occasion of the traditional "March 8th" International Women's Day, the WFTU extends warm congratulations to women of all countries and their largest organization, the International Democratic Women's Federation. The WFTU calls on all workers and trade union organizations to actively participate in celebrating this holiday, which has played an important role in the struggle for women's liberation and is closely linked to the development of the workers' movement. The WFTU calls on all trade unions to strengthen the struggle to achieve women's demands and rights: equal pay for equal work, full pay during maternity leave, the establishment of childcare facilities, broad vocational education, and the elimination of all discrimination against women.

The WFTU calls attention to the fact that the WFTU has been resolutely fighting for the rights of working women since its inception, and the demand for "equal pay for equal work" was one of the most important economic demands put forward at the WFTU International Conference held in London in 1945. The United Nations Economic and Social Council agreed to this principle proposed by the WFTU.

As "March 8th" International Women's Day approaches, the WFTU emphasizes that workers and trade unions should not relax their efforts to absorb women into trade union activities.

If women are more fully represented in trade unions and work more actively in trade unions, not only will the struggle to meet their demands and rights be more effective, but also the struggle to meet the demands and rights of all workers will be more effective. This will make the strength of trade unions and working people even stronger.

In the struggle to improve living standards, defend and expand democratic freedoms, and strive for national independence and world peace, the unity of action of male and female workers belonging to different political tendencies and different trade unions will be further strengthened.

    迎接“三八”国际妇女节
    国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人发表声明
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯：“人道报”刊载了国际民主妇女联合会主席、法兰西妇女联盟主席欧仁妮·戈登就即将到来的“三八”国际妇女节发表的一篇声明。
    戈登夫人指出，全世界妇女都希望防止战争，保障她们儿童的幸福。她说，得到这个幸福的主要障碍是战争。因此，法国妇女正为加强和平而斗争。“妇女们、母亲们进行的反对战争的斗争一年比一年壮大了。法国妇女和所有的和平力量一道欢迎朝鲜停战。现在，法国妇女和所有的和平力量一道要求停止越南战争，并要求和平解决德国问题。”
    世界工会联合会发表声明
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社维也纳二十五日讯：世界工会联合会向报界发表声明如下：
    值此传统的“三八”国际妇女节，世界工联谨向各国妇女以及她们的最大的组织——国际民主妇女联合会——致以热烈的祝贺。世界工联号召全体工人和工会组织积极参加庆祝这个在妇女争取解放的斗争中起了重要的作用、并且与工人运动的发展有密切联系的节日，世界工联号召所有的工会加强斗争，争取实现妇女的要求与权利：同工同酬、产假工资照发、设立照管儿童的机构、广泛的职业教育、消除对妇女的各种歧视。
    世界工联要求大家注意，世界工联自从成立以来一直在为争取劳动妇女的权利而坚决斗争，“同工同酬”的要求是一九四五年在伦敦举行的世界工联国际会议所提出的最重要的经济要求之一。联合国经社理事会同意了世界工联所提出的这个原则。
    值此“三八”国际妇女节即将来到的时候，世界工联要强调指出，工人和工会不应该放松它们的吸收妇女参加工会活动的努力。
    如果妇女们在工会中有更充分的代表性，并且在工会中更积极地工作，不仅争取满足她们的要求与权利的斗争会收到更大的效果，而且争取满足全体工人的要求与权利的斗争也会收到更大的效果。这会使得工会和劳动人民的力量更加强大起来。
    在争取提高生活水平、保卫和扩大民主自由、争取民族独立与世界和平的斗争中，属于不同政治倾向和不同工会的男女工人的行动一致将进一步加强。
