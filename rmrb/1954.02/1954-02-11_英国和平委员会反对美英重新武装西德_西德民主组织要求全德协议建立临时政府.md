Xinhua News Agency, London, February 10th: TASS reports from London on February 9th: The Executive Committee of the British Peace Committee held a meeting in London. The meeting issued a statement saying that the four-power discussions on the German question have reached a critical juncture. Those who support the rearmament of Germany are already talking about interrupting the Berlin talks. Ostensibly, the dispute revolves around issues such as election procedures and the establishment of an all-German government; but in reality, the United States and British governments are determined to rearm West Germany within the European Defense Community. This is the fundamental obstacle to any agreement between the four powers.

    If Germany is allowed to become a threat to European security once again, lasting peace will be fundamentally impossible. Rearming Germany and giving it the right to decide to form military alliances with the West or the East is tantamount to giving it the right to incite one side against the other.

    The statement pointed out: The vast majority of people in Britain, France, Germany, and other European countries oppose the re-establishment of German militarism. What people need is a peace treaty with Germany that prevents a unified Germany from joining any military alliance against any country that participated in the war against Hitler's Germany. This is the position of the majority of people in Britain and France, and it is also the position supported by the Soviet Union.

    The statement concluded by calling on the British people to resolutely demand that Eden strive to reach an agreement to ensure European security and enable the German people to restore national unity and form a government of their own choosing.

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 10th: TASS reports from Berlin on February 9th: The German Press Agency (DPA) reports from Dusseldorf: The Presidium of the “League of Germans for Unity, Peace and Freedom” passed a statement at its meeting in Dusseldorf on February 6th. The statement said: "The foreign ministers of the four powers are currently discussing the German question in Berlin, but no German representatives are participating. For the vital interests of the German people, the views of the Germans must be presented by representatives authorized by the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic."

    The statement condemned the West German Federal Government for disagreeing to send a plenipotentiary delegation to participate in the negotiations and condemned it for agreeing to the "European Defense Community" treaty and the "General Treaty," thereby encouraging the revival of militarism and revanchist sentiments.

    The statement emphasized that "the continued holding of negotiations on the German question depends to a large extent on the German people, who must themselves fight for the realization of their demand for the conclusion of a just peace treaty. The only way to conclude this treaty is to establish a provisional all-German government that is not bound by the 'European Defense Community' treaty and the 'General Treaty.' Therefore, the main task is to reach an agreement among Germans in all walks of life in order to establish such a government. No German fails to understand that now is the time to take action to ensure German unity and European security."

    英国和平委员会反对美英重新武装西德
    西德民主组织要求全德协议建立临时政府
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社伦敦九日讯：英国和平委员会执行委员会在伦敦举行会议，会议发表声明说：四国关于德国问题的讨论已经进入紧急关头。支持德国重新武装的人已经在谈论要中断柏林会谈了。表面上，争执是发生在选举程序及成立全德政府等等问题上；而实际上，美国和英国政府决心要在欧洲防务集团内重新武装西德。这就是四国达成任何协议的基本障碍。
    假使听任德国再度成为欧洲安全的威胁，那就根本不可能有持久和平。重新武装德国，并且让它有权决定与西方或东方结成军事同盟，这就等于使它有权挑拨这一方来反对那一方。
    声明指出：英国、法国、德国以及其他欧洲国家的绝大多数人民，都反对重新建立德国军国主义。人们所需要的是一个对德和约，这个和约可以使统一的德国不能加入反对参加过反希特勒德国的战争的任何国家的任何军事联盟。这是英国和法国大多数人的主张，也是苏联所支持的主张。
    声明最后号召英国人民坚决要求艾登努力争取达成协议，以便保证欧洲安全，并且使德国人民恢复国家的统一和组成一个由自己选择的政府。
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社柏林九日讯：德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫消息：德国人争取统一、和平与自由联盟主席团二月六日在杜塞尔多夫的会议上通过了一项声明。声明说：“四大国外长目前正在柏林讨论德国问题，但却没有德国代表参加。为了德国人民的切身利益，德国人的观点必须由联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国所授权的代表提出。”
    声明谴责西德联邦政府不同意派遣一个全权代表团参加谈判，并谴责它同意“欧洲防务集团”条约和“一般性条约”，从而鼓励军国主义和复仇主义情绪的复活。
    声明强调说，“继续就德国问题举行谈判在很大程度上有赖于德国人民，他们必须自己为实现他们提出的缔结一个公正的和约的要求而斗争。使这个条约得以缔结的唯一途径就是成立一个不受‘欧洲防务集团’条约和‘一般性条约’束缚的临时全德政府。因此，主要任务就是在各行各业的德国人中间取得协议，以便成立这样的一个政府。没有一个德国人不明白，现在是采取行动来保证德国统一和欧洲安全的时候了。”
