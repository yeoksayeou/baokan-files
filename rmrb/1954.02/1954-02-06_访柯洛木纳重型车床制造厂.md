    Visiting the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Factory
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

    On a recent bitterly cold day, we visited the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Factory in the Moscow region with long-awaited anticipation. In this factory, we witnessed firsthand the Soviet Union's assistance to our country in realizing national industrialization and gained a concrete understanding of the tremendous development of the Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry during the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    We were warmly received by the factory director, Comrade N. Nosovsky, at the factory headquarters. On the wall of the director's office hung portraits of Stalin and Chairman Mao woven in Hangzhou silk. We sensed the close relationship between this factory and our country. The director told us that these two tapestries were farewell gifts from six Chinese interns. They had interned in this factory for two years and returned to their country in August last year, expressing their eagerness to return to their motherland to participate in socialist construction, but also their reluctance to leave the factory and comrades they had become familiar with.

    This factory, which has helped our country train industrial talents, has developed since the war. According to the director, before 1914, there was only a small farm tool factory here. The factory was expanded before 1940, but the majority of the factory was built after 1948. The factory is developing year by year. In 1953, the number of workers increased by 27.6 percent compared to 1950 and by 58.5 percent compared to 1948. However, the factory's output grew even faster. The factory's total output in 1953 increased by 96.6 percent compared to 1950 and by 328.6 percent compared to 1948. The increase in production is a direct result of increased labor productivity. Due to the mechanization and rationalization of production, the improvement of operating procedures, and the reduction of strenuous labor, the factory's labor productivity increased by 54.1 percent in 1953 compared to 1950 and by 170.3 percent compared to 1948.

    The director and chief engineer led us to the workshops. The factory has many workshops, and it is impossible to see them all in a day or two. Therefore, the director and chief engineer selectively led us to the most important and interesting departments. We went to the foundry, various machine tool machining and assembly workshops, the design department, and the technical school. Treading on the accumulated snow and facing the cold wind, we walked from one huge workshop to another. The more the hosts introduced, the more enthusiastic they became, and the more excited we became.

    Along the way, we saw the scale of the factory's continued expansion and construction. The factory's cadre force is also strong. The design and technical departments have concentrated a strong design and drafting team. The secondary technical school is training a large number of cadres; the day class has 550 children of employees studying, and the night class has 300 employees studying while remaining in production. In the foundry, much of the strenuous labor of mixing sand, making molds, and removing sand is mechanized. In the various machining and assembly workshops, the workers' labor and political enthusiasm were overflowing, and socialist competitions were being launched everywhere to welcome the upcoming elections of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in March of this year. A red banner hung on the wall of a large workshop: "Consolidate world peace with a labor upsurge and early completion of the 1954 plan." On a large milling machine, worker Lebeskov produced top-quality products every day, exceeding the quota by about one and a half times. On a large planer, worker Miknyikov completed 220 percent of the quota every day. The processed parts must pass through a special inspection room. We saw inspectors there using precision instruments to test the accuracy of each part. There is an electric meter that can automatically report the angle of the parts. When assembling the machine tools, each part also undergoes several trials and processing. Such strict inspection of parts and the entire machine tool shows that the superior quality of the machine tools produced in the Soviet Union is not accidental.

    In a machining and assembly workshop, a large machine tool was disassembled into several large wooden boxes, with the words "To Harbin, China" printed on the boxes. This is neither the first nor the last. From 1949 to 1953, the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Factory manufactured and sent to our country 79 large and heavy machine tools, including two vertical turret lathes with a diameter of 5 meters, five vertical turret lathes with a diameter of 3.2 meters, ten vertical turret lathes with a diameter of 2.5 meters, one gear milling machine with a diameter of 3 meters, nineteen gear milling machines with a diameter of 1.5 meters, two face lathes with a diameter of 2 meters, and forty thread-cutting lathes with a length of 3 to 5 meters. The Kolomna factory will also manufacture 19 heavy machine tools for our country in 1954, including six vertical turret lathes with a diameter of 3.2 meters, two gear milling machines with a diameter of 3 meters, and one vertical turret lathe weighing 300 tons with a diameter of 6.5 meters. The director and all the employees are very happy to manufacture machine tools for China. They have gone through the road of national industrialization and know that the machine manufacturing industry is the heart of industry, and machine tools are the mother machines that produce machines and are urgently needed for our country's machine manufacturing plants. The vertical turret lathes with diameters of 5 meters and 6.5 meters supplied to our country by this factory last year and this year are rare giant machine tools and are also the most modern in the Soviet Union. This fact once again proves the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country and once again proves the depth of the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The workers working on "3T C" brand (the abbreviation of this heavy machine tool manufacturing factory) machine tools all over our country today will be encouraged by the performance of these giant Soviet machine tools and by the friendship of the Soviet workers who manufactured these machine tools.

    The specialty of the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Factory is the production of rare vertical turret lathes, which are produced to meet the needs of manufacturing large hydroelectric turbines for large hydroelectric power stations. This is just like the Sverdlovsk Ural Machine-Building Plant, which specializes in producing powerful rolling mills (which can roll steel plates weighing six to fifteen tons), and the Gorky Milling Machine Factory, which specializes in producing rare milling machines (which can cut grooves of 125 to 227 mm deep and 22 to 29.3 mm wide in metal). From this, we can appreciate the specialization of the Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry. The specialization of industry is naturally very convenient and beneficial for mass production, increasing product output and quality, and reducing costs.

    In the machining and assembly workshop of the Kolomna factory, we saw huge cranes rumbling busily. They hoisted huge steel blocks onto various large machine tools for processing and hoisted the processed large parts onto specially prepared foundation pits for assembly. In the past, the cranes in the workshop could only lift one ton, but now they can lift 150 tons. There is a vertical turret lathe with a diameter of 5 meters, and a large steel millstone-like part to be processed is placed on its turntable. A worker next to the control panel turns on the power switch, and the turntable rotates, bringing the loaded part to meet the cutting edge. This type of machine tool only began to be manufactured two years ago. There is a large steel ring to be processed with a diameter of 18 meters, and the machine tool rotates inside the steel ring for processing. From the foundry to the machining workshop, parts for rare vertical turret lathes that can process parts with a diameter of 9 to 13 meters are being manufactured. This rare machine tool only began to be produced last year. The first one has been installed in the Kharkov Turbine Generator Factory.

    Judging from the prepared parts, this rare vertical turret lathe that can process parts with a diameter of 9 to 13 meters is indeed a giant among machine tools. This type of machine tool is assembled from more than 20,000 parts and weighs more than 500 tons. It is like a three-story building, with an area of about 260 square meters. It can process parts for turbines or other machines weighing 170 tons. There are two carriages on the turntable that adjust the cutting tools on the crossbeam. With the help of the carriages, the machine tool can process cylindrical surfaces, conical surfaces, and flat surfaces, cutting off wide and thick shavings. Depending on the weight of the part being processed, the turntable rotates at a speed of one to seven revolutions per minute. In order to drive the machinery, 42 electric motors with power ranging from 0.25 to 150 kilowatts are installed on the machine tool. Only one worker needs to manage the operation of the machine tool through the switches on the control panel. This rare vertical turret lathe was manufactured by the excellent designers and all the employees of the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Factory based on Soviet advanced technology. Now they are continuing to design even more powerful turret lathes.

    During the visit to the Kolomna Heavy Machine Tool Factory, one cannot help but think of the rapid development of the Soviet machine tool manufacturing industry. The Soviet Union originally did not have a machine tool manufacturing industry. It was established during the period of national industrialization. In the last year of the First Five-Year Plan, 1932, the Soviet Union produced 19,700 machine tools, which was 13 times that of 1913. In 1941, the machine tools produced by the Soviet Union were four and a half times that of 1932. At the end of the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union produced 40 types of machine tools in terms of form and size, 500 types in 1941, and 2,000 types in 1950. In the past seven years, the number of machine tools in the Soviet Union has more than doubled. Many new types of highly productive machine tools have appeared in the years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The development of the machine tool manufacturing industry is a powerful guarantee that the Soviet Union is continuing to develop heavy industry on the one hand, and greatly developing agriculture and light industry on the other.

    访柯洛木纳重型车床制造厂
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    在最近一个严寒的日子，我们怀着渴望已久的心情，参观了莫斯科州柯洛木纳重型车床制造厂。在这个工厂里，我们亲眼看到了苏联帮助我国实现国家工业化的事实，具体认识了苏联车床制造业在第五个五年计划中的巨大发展。
    我们在工厂厂部受到厂长纳·诺索甫斯基同志的热情款待。厂长办公室的墙上挂着杭州织的斯大林肖像和毛主席肖像。我们预感到这个工厂与我国的亲切关系。厂长告诉我们，这两幅织锦是六位中国实习生的临别赠品。他们在这个工厂里实习了两年，于去年八月间学成返国，临别时表示迫切要回祖国参加社会主义建设，又恋恋不舍这里已经熟悉的工厂和同志。
    这个曾经帮助我国培养工业化人材的工厂，是在战后发展起来的。据厂长谈：在一九一四年以前，这里只有一小座农具工厂，一九四○年以前工厂扩建了，但工厂的绝大部分是在一九四八年以后建立的。工厂一年年发展着。一九五三年工人的数目，比一九五○年增加了百分之二七·六，比一九四八年增加了百分之五八·五。但是工厂的产量增长得更快。工厂在一九五三年的总产量比一九五○年增加了百分之九六·六，比一九四八年增加了百分之三二八·六。产品的增加，是劳动生产率提高的直接结果。由于生产的机械化和合理化，操作规程的改善，费力劳动的减轻，工厂的劳动生产率在一九五三年比一九五○年增加了百分之五四·一，比一九四八年增加了百分之一七○·三。
    厂长和总工程师带领了我们到车间去。工厂有许多车间，没有一两天工夫是看不完的。因此厂长和总工程师有选择地带领我们看了最重要的、最有兴趣的部门。我们到了铸造车间、各式车床机械加工和装配车间、设计科、技术学校。踏着积雪、迎着寒风，从一个巨大的车间走到另一个巨大的车间，主人越介绍越热情，我们也越看越兴奋。
    一路上看到了工厂继续扩大建设的规模。工厂的干部也很雄厚。设计科和技术科集中着一支强大的设计和绘图队伍。中等技术学校培养着大批干部；日班有五百五十名职工的子女学习，夜班有三百名不脱离生产的职工在进修。在铸造车间，许多和沙、制型、落沙的费力劳动都是机械化的。在各个机械加工和装配车间，洋溢着工人们的劳动和政治的热情，到处展开迎接将在今年三月举行的苏联最高苏维埃选举的社会主义竞赛。一个大车间的墙壁上挂着红布标语：“以劳动高潮和提前完成一九五四年计划来巩固世界和平”。在一台大铣床上，工人列别斯科夫每天生产着超过定额约一倍半的优等品。在一台大刨床上，工人米项尼科夫每天完成着百分之二二○的定额。加工后的零件，要经过专门的检查室。我们看到那里的检查员在用精密的仪器检验各个零件的精确程度。有一个电表，它能自动报告零件的角度。在装配车床时，各个零件也经过几遍试装和加工。对零件对整个车床这样严密的检查，说明苏联所出产的车床的质量的优越，并不是偶然的。
    在一个机械加工和装配车间，一台大车床分装在好几个大木箱里，箱面印着发往中国哈尔滨的字样。这不是头一台，也不是最后一台。从一九四九年到一九五三年，柯洛木纳重型车床制造厂曾经前后为我国制造了和向我国发送了七十九台巨大和重型的车床；包括直径五公尺的立式转塔车床二台，直径三·二公尺的立式转塔车床五台，直径二·五公尺的立式转塔车床十台，直径三公尺的铣齿车床
  一台，直径一·五公尺的铣齿车床十九台，直径二公尺的正面镟床二台，三到五公尺长的螺切镟床四十台。柯洛木纳工厂在一九五四年还要为我国制造十九台重型车床，其中包括六台直径三·二公尺的立式转塔车床，二台直径三公尺的铣齿车床，一台重三百吨、直径六·五公尺的立式转塔车床。厂长和全体职工非常高兴为中国制造车床。他们走过了国家工业化的道路，知道机器制造业是工业的心脏，而车床又是产生机器的母机，对于我国机器制造厂是迫切需要的。这个工厂去年和今年所供给我国的直径五公尺和六·五公尺的立式转塔车床，是稀有的巨型车床，在苏联也是最新式的。这个事实又一次证明苏联对我国大公无私的帮助，又一次证明中苏两国友谊的深厚。我国各地今天在“3T C”牌（这个重型车床制造厂的简称）车床上工作的工人们，会为这些巨人似的苏联车床的性能，为制造这些车床的苏联工人的友谊而鼓舞吧。
    柯洛木纳重型车床制造厂的特长是生产稀有的立式转塔车床，这种巨型车床是适应制造大水电站的大水力涡轮机等需要而生产的。这正如斯维尔德洛夫斯克乌拉尔机器制造厂专门生产强大的轧钢机（它能够轧重六吨到十五吨的钢板），高尔基铣床制造厂专门生产稀有的铣床（它能够在金属上切出深一二五到二二七公厘和宽二十二到二十九·三公厘的槽沟）。从这里可以体会到苏联车床制造业的专门化。工业的专门化，对于大批生产，对于提高产品的产量与质量和降低成本，自然是很方便和有利的。
    在柯洛木纳工厂的机械加工和装配车间，我们看到巨大的吊车在隆隆地忙碌着。它们把巨大的钢块吊到各式大车床上加工，把加工过的大零件吊到特别准备的基坑上装配。从前车间的吊车起重不过一吨，现在能起重一百五十吨。有一台直径五公尺的立式转塔车床，它的转盘上放着一个大钢磨似的被加工零件。一个工人在旁边操纵台上开动电门，转盘旋转着，把所载的零件迎着刀刃切割。这种车床在两年前才开始制造。有一个直径十八公尺的被加工的大钢圈，车床放在钢圈内旋转加工。从铸造车间到机械加工车间都在制造能够对直径九到十三公尺零件加工的稀有立式转塔车床的部件。这种稀有车床在去年才开始生产。第一台已经安装在哈尔科夫涡轮发电机制造厂里。
    从所准备的部件看来，这种能够对直径九到十三公尺零件加工的稀有立式转塔车床的确是车床中的巨人。这种车床是由二万多零件装配起来的，重量在五百吨以上。它像一座三层高楼，面积约二百六十平方公尺。它能够对一百七十吨重的涡轮机或其他机器的零件加工。在转盘上面有两个装在横梁上调节切刀的扶架。在扶架的帮助下，车床能够对圆柱形面、锥形面和平面加工，切下又宽又厚的刨屑。看加工零件的轻重，转盘每分钟转一到七转不等。为了转动机械，车床上安装着四十二部发电力从○·二五到一五○瓩的电动机。只要一个工人通过操纵台上的电门来管理车床的工作。这种稀有立式转塔车床，是柯洛木纳重型车床制造厂优秀的设计人员和全体职工根据苏联的高超技术而制造出来的。现在他们在继续设计更强大的转塔车床。
    在柯洛木纳重型车床制造厂参观时，令人不能不想起苏联车床制造业的飞跃发展。苏联原先没有车床制造业。它是在国家工业化时期才建立起来的。在第一个五年计划的最后一年，一九三二年，苏联出产了一万九千七百台车床，即为一九一三年的十三倍。一九四一年，苏联出产的车床为一九三二年的四倍半。在第一个五年计划末，苏联出产四十种形式尺寸的车床，在一九四一年出产五百种，在一九五○年出产二千种。最近七年中，苏联车床数目增加了一倍以上。在第五个五年计划年份出现许多新式的高度生产率的车床。车床制造业的发达，是苏联今天一面继续发展重工业，一面大大发展农业和轻工业的强有力的保证。
