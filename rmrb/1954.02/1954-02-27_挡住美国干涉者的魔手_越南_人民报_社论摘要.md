Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: According to Vietnam News Agency on February 25th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's organ, the "People's Daily," recently published an editorial entitled "Block the Devil's Hand of American Interventionists!"

The editorial first pointed out: Since suffering a disastrous defeat in Korea, American imperialism has intensified its "aid" to the French colonialists in order to continue and expand its war of aggression in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Recently, the United States has taken advantage of the difficult situation of the French colonialists and has more shamelessly and directly participated in the Indochina War. On the one hand, it has stepped up "aid" to the French aggressors, attempting to alleviate France's current crisis; on the other hand, it has seized this opportunity to further seize France's interests in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, plotting to turn these countries into American strategic bases.

The editorial, after listing various evil activities of the American interventionists in stepping up their participation in the Indochina War, pointed out that as the four foreign ministers met in Berlin to discuss ways to ease international tensions, the shameless activities of the United States in Indochina once again proved its unwillingness. The United States openly violates the wishes of peace-loving people around the world, especially the French and American people who are fighting to end the war of aggression against Vietnam. The United States' direct intervention in Indochina clearly exposes its hypocritical peace propaganda and war-provoking conspiracy.

The editorial emphasized: The actions of American interventionists in colluding with French colonialists to intensify the war of aggression in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos not only directly infringe upon the freedom and security of the people of these three countries, but also threaten the freedom and security of the people of Southeast Asian countries, and directly threaten peace in Asia and the world. The French and American imperialists should bear full responsibility before world public opinion for the intensification of tensions in the Far East.

The editorial concluded: In the past eight years, despite the continuous "aid" of money and materials from the United States to the French colonialists, the Vietnamese army and people have overcome all kinds of difficulties and hardships, fought heroically, and achieved greater and greater victories. Today, no matter how sinister their conspiracy, the American interventionists cannot shake the Vietnamese people's fighting will and confidence in victory, nor can they save the French aggressors from their dilemma in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Direct American intervention will only deepen the indignation of the Vietnamese people, prompting the Vietnamese army and people to further strengthen their unity, fight bravely, annihilate more enemies, and smash the conspiracies of the French and American imperialists. At the same time, the United States' direct intervention in the Indochina War will undoubtedly deepen the contradictions between the French colonialists and American imperialists and will promote the people of the world, especially the French and American people, to strengthen their unity and fight more actively, demanding a peaceful solution to the Indochina issue and stopping the devil's hand of American interventionists.

    挡住美国干涉者的魔手
    ——越南“人民报”社论摘要
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社二十五日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”最近发表社论，题为“挡住美国干涉者的魔手！”
    社论首先指出：美帝国主义者自从在朝鲜遭到惨败后，就加紧了对法国殖民者的“援助”，以便继续并扩大在越南、高棉和寮国的侵略战争。最近，美国利用法国殖民者的困难局面，更无耻地、直接地参与了印度支那战争。它一方面加紧“援助”法国侵略者，企图缓和法国目前的危机；另一方面又抓住这个机会进一步夺取法国在越南、高棉和寮国的利益，阴谋把这些国家变成美国的战略基地。
    社论在列举美国干涉者最近加紧参与印度支那战争的各种罪恶活动以后指出，当四国外长在柏林开会讨论缓和国际紧张局势的办法时，美国在印度支那进行的无耻活动再度证明了它的不愿意的态度。美国公然违反全世界爱好和平人民、特别是正在为结束侵越战争而斗争的法国人民和美国人民的愿望。美国直接干涉印度支那的举动清楚地暴露了它的虚伪的和平宣传和挑拨战争的阴谋。
    社论着重指出：美国干涉者协同法国殖民者加紧进行在越南、高棉和寮国的侵略战争的举动，不仅直接侵犯了这三个国家人民的自由和安全，而且也威胁着东南亚各国人民的自由和安全，并直接威胁着亚洲和世界和平。法、美帝国主义者在世界舆论面前，应该对远东紧张局势的加剧负全部责任。
    社论最后说：在过去八年中，尽管美国不断给予法国殖民者以金钱和物资“援助”，越南军民仍克服了种种艰难困苦，英雄地作战并取得了越来越大的胜利。今天，无论他们的阴谋如何险恶，美国干涉者还是不能动摇越南人民的战斗意志和胜利信心，也不能挽救法国侵略者在越南、高棉和寮国的进退两难的被动处境。美国的直接干涉只会加深越南人民的愤慨，促使越南军民进一步加强团结，勇敢地战斗，歼灭更多的敌人，粉碎法、美帝国主义者的阴谋。同时，美国直接干涉印度支那战争的行径无疑会加深法国殖民者和美帝国主义者之间的矛盾，并且会促使世界人民、特别是法国人民和美国人民加强团结，更积极地进行斗争，要求和平解决印度支那问题，制止美国干涉者的魔掌。
