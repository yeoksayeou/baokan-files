    Developing and Transforming the Transportation Industry is an Urgent Task for the People of All Ethnic Groups in Yunnan
    Guo Yingqiu, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government
    Yunnan is located in the southwestern border region of the motherland, with a vast area, numerous ethnic groups, and a long defense line. Developing the transportation industry is of particularly significant importance for promoting production, uniting fraternal ethnic groups, and strengthening national defense construction.
    Yunnan's transportation is very backward: the railway mileage is very short and not connected to the interior; water transport is limited due to rapid river currents and small transport capacity; highways, although the main arteries on the plateau, are winding and dangerous, unable to meet transportation needs; although general folk transport tools have great potential, they have not been fully utilized due to insufficient organization. Therefore, actively developing and transforming transportation in the border region has become an urgent task for the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan. Since the liberation of Yunnan, we have done a lot of work in transportation.
    After democratic reform and production reform, the past phenomenon of unqualified railway line quality has been eliminated, and the repair and maintenance of vehicles and large buildings has also been significantly improved. Labor productivity has increased by 111% compared with 1950, the volume of transport has increased by 230%, transport costs have decreased by 73.8%, and financial revenue and expenditure have changed from loss to profit.
    In terms of highway transportation, twelve new routes have been built; the number of kilometers of open highways has increased fivefold compared with the early days of liberation, and the number of state-owned vehicles, taking 1950 as 100, rose to 311 in 1953. After production reform, various transportation indicators have continued to grow. As of now, production efficiency has increased by 169.7% compared with 1950, the volume of transport has increased by 747%, and transport costs have decreased by 25.91%. Under the leadership of state-owned enterprises, through the "Five-Anti" movement, the private automobile transportation industry has rationally adjusted sources of goods, unified freight rates and vehicle allocation, and made great improvements in business management and production efficiency.
    The organization and transformation of folk transport tools is a serious and complex struggle. After land reform and various democratic reforms, folk transport tools were liberated from the shackles of the landlord class and feudal bosses, but how to organize these scattered, backward, diverse, and different types of transport tools is still a major issue. Over the past three years, according to instructions from higher levels and work needs, special districts and counties have separately organized joint transportation companies (such as Zhaotong District) or joint transportation agencies (such as Heqing County), organized transportation headquarters (such as Simao District), mass transportation stations (such as Xiaguan and other places) or mass transportation offices (such as Baoshan District); professional carts, caravans, and wooden boats have been organized into transportation teams, and some sideline mules, horses, and ox carts have been organized into mutual aid groups, appropriately exerting the assistant role of backward transportation tools to advanced transportation tools. For example, in the first half of 1952, the transport of grain throughout the province using backward transport tools accounted for 63% of the total task; the 41 mule and horse mutual aid groups organized by Heqing County transported more than 6.3 million catties of materials from January to October 1953; the transportation team commanded by the Simao Special District Transportation Headquarters transported 10 million catties of materials in nine months, and there are many such examples in other special districts and counties.
    The above efforts and achievements not only play a major role in promoting industrial and agricultural production in the interior, expanding material exchange, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, but also have serious significance for gradually changing the backward situation of production and life of the people of all ethnic groups in the border region, in order to powerfully unite the people of all ethnic groups to consolidate national defense. For example, Fohai and Lancang counties organize their own mules and horses to exchange local products for a large amount of salt from the interior; the remote Longchuan and Ruili counties, which used to rely on foreign industrial products for a long time, have now turned around and rely on the supply of domestic industrial products. This economic connection strongly supports our political work in ethnic minority areas. The further strengthening of ethnic unity also demonstrates the further consolidation of our border defense construction.
    The general line of the state during the transition period and the first five-year plan require our transportation work to meet the needs of increasingly expanding industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation, to meet the needs of gradually attracting remote areas into national economic life, and, as border transportation, especially to meet the needs of national defense construction. Therefore, we must further strengthen the construction of transportation, strive to attract some new areas into our national economic life, and open up new and huge sources for the development of productive forces.
    Taking the province's industrial production as a whole, the output of various major industrial products, taking 1950 as 100, reached 242 for tin, 148 for raw coal, 271 for iron, and 293 for salt in 1953. Other products such as yarn, cloth, sugar, and paper have also overfulfilled their plans. In the process of gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization in the future, we need to provide more transportation capacity to support industrial capital construction, supply raw materials and workers' living materials, and transport various industrial products.
    The restoration and development of agricultural production in the province is also rapid. The output of various major agricultural products, such as grain, increased by 27.47% compared with 1950, cotton increased by 266.66%, flue-cured tobacco increased by 205.58%, and sugarcane increased by 56.47%. The output of other local specialties has also increased. In the future, this growth rate will increase year by year, and the unified deployment of agricultural products will inevitably be strengthened year by year.
    With the development of industrial and agricultural production, the purchasing power of the people of the province is also increasing year by year. Taking the average purchasing power index of the province in 1950 as 100, it rose to 179 in 1953. Taking the sales performance of state-owned commercial enterprises in the province for several major commodities in 1950 as 100, cotton cloth rose to 726 in 1953, matches to 437, salt to 145, and oil to 904. The demand for production materials such as agricultural tools and fertilizers by the vast number of peasants is also increasing year by year.
    Faced with the development of production and the market, although the volume of transportation in the province has increased year by year (taking the volume of state-owned automobile transportation in 1950 as 100, it was 380 in 1951, 663 in 1952, and rose to 1,817 in 1953), it is still far from meeting the needs. At present, the number of cities and counties in Yunnan Province that are not accessible by automobiles still accounts for 45.5% of the total number of cities and counties. It takes several days to travel from the special commissioner's office to the county, up to 15 days in the farthest cases, and it takes six or seven days to travel from the county to the countryside. There are also shortcomings in the operation, management, organization, and dispatch of the state-owned transportation system in the province. The railway freight rates in the province are 150% higher than the unified national railway freight rates, and passenger fares are 50% higher; on the one hand, there is a shortage of automobile transportation capacity, and on the other hand, the transportation efficiency of enterprises and agencies that own 80% of the province's state-owned operating vehicles is only one-half to one-third of that of operating vehicles.
    The development of mass transportation has nearly doubled since liberation
  (according to data from Dali Special District). According to incomplete statistics, the province currently has the following professional folk transport tools: 3,064 carts, 973 ox carts, 41,548 pack horses, 1,326 pack oxen, 116 handcarts, and a number of large and small wooden boats. In addition to human transportation and various folk transport tools that engage in transportation as a sideline, the strength should be said to be not small, but without sufficient leadership and organizational work, it will not play a large role in the country's planned transportation. For example, a township in Yongping County had only 300 pack horses at the time of liberation, but it has blindly developed to 1,600 horses in the past three years; freight rates in various special districts are very unbalanced. Taking Baoshan Special District as 100, the adjacent Dali Special District is 160, and the Lijiang Special District adjacent to Dali District is as low as 71.8, while the highest Simao Special District reaches 210. These are major weaknesses in our border transportation.
    In order to change the current transportation situation in Yunnan Province, we must gradually develop socialist transportation forces, transform non-socialist transportation forces, and continue to develop transportation means and advanced transportation tools to the border region in a planned manner. The main task at present is to fully utilize and give full play to the potential capacity of all existing transportation tools and equipment, strengthen operation and management, and provide the country with large-volume, high-quality, low-cost, fast, and safe transportation capacity.
    The state-owned transportation system must implement thorough technical transformation and organizational transformation. First of all, all employees are required to sincerely learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Vigorously overcome backward phenomena in driving, repairing, maintaining, and organizing and dispatching. This technical transformation completely depends on the party's organizational work and political work. Therefore, in all state-owned transportation systems, it is necessary to combine the study of the general line of the state during the transition period, deeply oppose subjectivism and bureaucracy, criticize the bourgeois management ideology, learn socialist management methods and improve necessary work systems, give play to the labor enthusiasm of the masses of employees, strengthen labor discipline, and improve revolutionary vigilance.
    The phenomenon of vehicle idleness in enterprise and agency-owned vehicles should be resolutely solved by adopting the following two methods: one is to unify management and dispatch of vehicles under the principle of ensuring supply, and the other is to stipulate the monthly output task of vehicles according to actual conditions. If vehicle idleness is found, state-owned transportation departments may not transport on their behalf and appropriately reduce their surplus vehicles.
    The planned extension of highway construction to the border region and ethnic minority areas has not only economic significance, but also political and national defense significance. In the past, our general shortcomings were that technical work lagged behind political work, and we attached importance to building new routes while neglecting road maintenance. The state's call for increasing production and practicing economy has not yet universally become the driving force for our work. In the future, we must actively improve according to the state's plan requirements. At the same time as building highways, it is also very important to mobilize the masses to repair post roads and bridges in a planned manner.
    Although the private automobile transportation industry in the province has made some improvements on the basis of the "Five-Anti" movement, it still cannot meet the new requirements of planned transportation due to its decentralized and backward operation and management. State-owned transportation departments must actively lead them to carry out organizational rectification and production reform. Independent producers who own their own vehicles, accounting for about 26% of the private transportation, can consider forming transportation production cooperatives, and the rest can respectively adopt the method of joint state-private operation or the method of forming a unified private automobile transportation company to change the existing organization of the automobile transportation joint association and serve planned transportation under the unified leadership of state-owned transportation departments.
    For the large number of folk transport tools, the main thing is to strengthen socialist transformation. The road to transformation is to organize mutual assistance and cooperation and gradually incorporate them into the track of national transportation plans. At the same time, appropriate technical transformation of folk transport tools must also be carried out. For example, Yunnan's handcarts. If board cars or Sichuan-style chicken carts are used instead, transportation efficiency can be greatly increased. Of course, both organization and corresponding technical transformation must strengthen political work and must be based on the principle of voluntariness. Difficulties in the work cannot be solved by mandatory orders.
    The abnormally high and low freight rates are the result of the existence of a free market and the spontaneous forces of the small-scale production economy. Allowing this situation to exist is to allow market prices to be chaotic and the blind development of backward transportation tools. Therefore, the freight rates of professional or sideline folk transport tools must be reasonably adjusted according to the production, transportation, and sales conditions. In places with highways, they should also jointly implement the unified freight rates stipulated for highway transportation with public and private automobiles; necessary education or punishment must be given to illegal merchants who raise freight rates and specialize in grain or other market speculation in the name of transportation.
    At the beginning of national construction, the basic construction investment in border transportation cannot be too much. Therefore, we cannot have the fantasy of changing the face of transportation "all at once." The current issue is to firmly grasp the central link of "organization and dispatch," organically link our existing advanced, backward, and various types of transportation tools, strengthen management and transformation, and give full play to their potential strength.
    Since its establishment half a year ago, the Provincial "Border Material Supply Committee" has played a good role in gradually promoting consignment plans, strengthening the relationship between freight parties, and completing major and urgent material transportation; the transportation command headquarters or transportation stations in special offices and key counties and districts should be further strengthened on the existing basis; the transportation departments or personnel of the people's governments in counties and cities that do not establish transportation command agencies should be responsible for the unified management and dispatch of transportation capacity. Through the consignment system and various work contact systems, the relationship between needs and possibilities, producers and consumers, and material departments and transportation departments will be further closely integrated.
    Of course, to complete these tasks is not just a matter for the transportation departments. The main thing is to strengthen the party's leadership over transportation. Only if we pay attention to and gradually manage transportation work early can we further strengthen border economic work, strengthen ethnic unity, and strengthen national defense.

    发展和改造交通运输业是云南各族人民的迫切任务
  　云南省人民政府副主席  郭影秋
    云南地处祖国西南边疆，地区辽阔，民族众多，国防线漫长。发展交通运输事业，对于促进生产，团结兄弟民族，加强国防建设，具有特别重大的意义。
    云南的交通运输是很落后的：铁路里程很短，且与内地不通；水运因江流湍急，运具与运量都很少；公路虽为高原上的大动脉，但盘山越谷，迂回险峻，不能满足运输要求；一般民间运输工具虽有很大潜力，但因组织工作不够，未能充分发挥其运输效能。因此，积极地发展并改造边疆的交通运输工作，就成为云南各族人民的迫切任务。云南解放以来，我们在交通运输方面做了很多工作。
    铁路运输经过民主改革与生产改革后，过去线路质量不合格的现象已经消灭，车辆和大型建筑物的修理保养工作也有显著改进，劳动生产率较一九五○年提高了百分之一一一，运输量增长了百分之二三○，运输成本降低了百分之七十三点八，财务收支由亏损而变为盈余。
    公路运输方面，新建路线十二条；通车公路的里数已较解放初期增加五倍，国营汽车辆数如以一九五○年为一○○，一九五三年上升为三一一。经过生产改革之后，各种运输指标不断增长，截至目前止，生产效率较一九五○年提高百分之一六九点七，运输量提高百分之七四七，运输成本则降低百分之二十五点九一。私营汽车运输业在国营企业领导下，通过“五反”运动，合理地调整了货源，统一了运价与车辆调配，在经营管理和生产效率上也有很大改进。
    对民间运输工具的组织与改造，是一个严重复杂的斗争。经过了土地改革和各项民主改革，民间运输工具虽从地主阶级和封建把头的束缚中解放出来，但如何把这种分散的、落后的、多样的和各种性质不同的运输工具组织起来，还是一个重大问题。三年多来，根据上级指示与工作需要，各专区和各县都分别组织了联运公司（如昭通区）或联运代办处（如鹤庆县），组织了运输指挥部（如思茅区）、群众运输站（如下关等地）或群众运输办公室（如保山区）；将专业的马车、马帮、木船组成运输队，有的将副业的骡马、牛车组成运输互助组，适当地发挥了落后运输工具对于先进运输工具的助手作用。如一九五二年上半年的全省粮食调运任务，利用落后运输工具运输的占总任务的百分之六十三；鹤庆县组织的四十一个骡马互助组，一九五三年一至十月共运输物资六百三十余万斤；思茅专区运输指挥部所指挥的运输队，九个月即运出物资一千万斤，其他专区和县的这类例子很多。
    以上的努力和成就，不仅对内地工农业生产的促进、物资交流的扩大、工农联盟的巩固，起着重大作用，而对于逐步改变边疆各族人民生产和生活的落后情况，以便有力地团结各族人民巩固国防，更有其严重意义。例如佛海、澜沧各县，组织自己的骡马，用土产向内地换回大量食盐；边远的陇川、瑞丽各县，过去长期依赖外国工业品供应的，现在则扭转身来依靠国内工业品的供应。这种经济生活的联系，有力地支持了我们在兄弟民族地区的政治工作。民族团结的进一步加强，也正说明了我们边防建设的进一步巩固。
    国家过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年建设计划，要求我们的交通运输工作必须满足日渐扩大的工农业生产和商品流通的需要，满足逐步吸引边远地区加入国民经济生活的需要，作为边疆运输来说，特别是要满足国防建设的需要。因此我们必须进一步加强交通运输的建设工作，努力把一些新的地区吸引到我国国民经济生活中来，开辟发展生产力的新的巨大源泉。
    以全省的工业生产而论，各种主要工业产品的产量，如以一九五○年为一○○，到一九五三年大锡为二四二，原煤为一四八，铁为二七一，食盐为二九三。其他如纱、布、糖、纸等产品，也都超额完成了计划。在今后逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化的过程中，对工业基本建设的支持，对原材料及工人生活资料的供应，对各种工业产品的运送，需要我们提供更多的运输力。
    全省的农业生产的恢复与发展也是迅速的。各种主要农产品，如粮食比一九五○年增产百分之二七点四七，棉花增产百分之二六六点六六，烤烟增产百分之二○五点五八，甘蔗增产百分之五六点四七。其他土特产品的产量也都有所增加。今后这种增产的指标将会逐年上升，农产品的统一调度也必然逐年加强。
    随着工农业生产的发展，全省人民群众的购买力也在逐年增长。如以一九五○年全省人民平均购买力指数为一○○，到一九五三年已上升为一七九。如以一九五○年全省国营商业对几种主要商品的销售实绩各为一○○，一九五三年棉布已上升为七二六，火柴为四三七，食盐为一四五，油类为九○四。广大农民对于生产资料如农具、肥料等等的需要量，也在逐年增大。
    面对着生产和市场发展的情况，全省交通运输量虽然逐年都有所增加（国营汽车运输量如以一九五○年为一○○，则一九五一年为三八○，一九五二年为六六三，到一九五三年已上升为一、八一七）。但是距离需要还是很远的。现在云南全省不通汽车的市县单位还占整个市县数的百分之四五点五，专署到县要走好几天，最远的要走十五天，县到乡村有的也要走上六、七天。全省国营的运输系统的经营管理、组织调度等方面，也还存在着缺点。省内的铁路运价和全国铁路的统一运价相比，货运高了百分之一五○，客运高了百分之五○；汽车运输力一方面感到不足，另一方面占全省国营营运汽车辆数百分之八○的企业及机关自用汽车，其运输效率仅占营运汽车的二分之一以至三分之一。
    在群众运输方面，解放以来有将近一倍的发展
  （根据大理专区的资料），根据不完全的统计，全省现有专业的民间运输工具：马车三、○六四辆，牛车九七三辆，驮马四一、五四八匹，驮牛一、三二六头，手推车一一六辆，大小木船若干只，再加上人力运输及以运输为副业的各种民间运输工具，力量应当说是不算很小，但没有足够的领导力量与组织工作，他在国家的计划运输上将不会发生多大作用。如永平县的一个乡，在解放时只有驮马三○○匹，三年多来竟盲目发展到一、六○○匹；各专区的运价很不平衡，如以保山专区为一○○，邻接保山区的大理专区为一六○，邻接大理区的丽江专区则又低至七一点八，最高的思茅专区则达二一○。这些，都是我们边疆运输事业的重大弱点。
    为了改变云南省目前的运输情况，我们必须逐步地发展社会主义的运输力量，改造非社会主义的运输力量，继续有计划的发展通往边疆的交通手段与先进运输工具。而当前的主要任务，就是充分利用和发挥现有一切运输工具与设备的潜在能力，加强经营管理，为国家提供量大、质好、价廉、迅速安全的运输力。
    国营的运输系统。必须实行彻底的技术改造和组织改造。首先要求全体职工诚心诚意地学习苏联先进经验。大力克服行驶、修理、保养与组织调度等方面的落后现象。这种技术上的改造，完全取决于党的组织工作和政治工作，因此，在所有国营运输系统中，必须结合对国家过渡时期总路线的学习，深入的反对主观主义与官僚主义，批判资产阶级的经营管理思想，学会社会主义的管理方法并改进必要的工作制度，发挥职工群众的劳动热情，加强劳动纪律，提高革命的警惕性。
    对企业及机关自用汽车的窝车现象，应当坚定的采用下列两种办法来解决：一种是在保证供应的原则下，将汽车统一管理、统一调度，另一种是根据实际情况规定汽车的月产任务，发现窝车现象，国营运输部门可不代运输并酌减其多余车辆。
    公路建设有计划地向边疆及兄弟民族地区伸展，不只有经济的意义，而且有政治的、国防的意义。过去我们一般的缺点是技术工作落后于政治工作，重视新建路线忽视养路工作；国家的增产节约号召，还没有普遍的成为我们推动工作的力量，今后必须按国家的计划要求，积极改进。与修建公路的同时，有计划的发动群众整修驿道、桥梁也是很重要的工作。
      全省的私营汽车运输业，在“五反”运动的基础上虽有某些改进，但由于他们经营管理上的分散性与落后性，还不能适应计划运输的新的要求。国营运输部门，必须积极领导他们进行组织整顿和生产改革，占私营运输比重约百分之二十六的自车自开的独立生产者，可考虑组成运输生产合作社，其余则分别采用公私合营的办法或用统一的组成私营汽车运输公司的办法，改变其现有的汽车运输联营社的组织，在国营运输部门统一领导下，为计划运输服务。
    对于为数甚大的民间运输工具，主要的是加强社会主义改造。改造的道路是组织互助合作，把他们逐步的纳入国家运输计划的轨道。同时，还必须对民间运输工具进行适当的技术改造。例如云南的手推车。如果改用板车或四川型的鸡公车，就可以大大增加运输效率。当然，组织起来和相应的技术改造，都必须加强政治工作，都必须根据自愿原则，工作中的困难是不能用强迫命令的办法来解决的。
    运价的畸高畸低，是自由市场的存在和小生产经济自发势力的结果，允许这种情况存在，就是允许市场物价紊乱和落后运输工具的盲目发展。因此，对于专业的或副业的民间运输工具的运价必须根据产、运、销三方面的情况，进行合理的调整，在有公路的地方并应使之与公私营汽车共同执行公路运输统一规定的运价；对于高抬运价和以运输为名而专事粮食或其他市场投机的不法商贩，必须给予应有教育或惩办。
    在国家建设开始，对边疆交通运输事业的基本建设投资不可能太多，因此我们不能发生“一下子”改变运输面貌的空想，当前的问题是要抓紧“组织调度”这一中心环节，把我们现有的先进的、落后的、各种性质不同的运输工具，有机地联系起来，加强管理和改造，充分发挥其潜在力量。
    省的“边疆物资供应委员会”成立半年以来，在逐步推广托运计划，密切货运双方关系，完成主要的及紧急的物资运输等方面，已经发生了良好的作用；专署及重点县区的运输指挥部或运输站，应在现有的基础上进一步加强；不成立运输指挥机构的县市，人民政府的交通部门或人员，应当担负运输力统一管理和调度的责任。通过托运制度及各种工作联系制度，把需要与可能、生产者与消费者、物资部门与运输部门之间的关系，进一步地密切结合。
    当然，要完成这些任务，并不单只是交通运输部门的事，主要的还须加强党对交通运输工作的领导。只有我们及早地注意并逐步管好交通运输工作，才能进一步加强边疆的经济工作、加强民族团结，加强国防。
