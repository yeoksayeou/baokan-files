    Some Factories and Mines in Hunan
    Begin Using Seamless Steel Pipes Manufactured by Anshan Iron and Steel
    The seamless steel pipes produced by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Pipe Plant have begun to be used in some factories and mines in Hunan Province. The first batch of seamless steel pipes transported to Changsha primarily met the urgent production needs of units such as the Changsha Mining Machinery Plant and the Hunan Inland Water Navigation Administration's Ship Repair Plant. In the past, these factories were affected in boiler repairs and modifications, as well as in the manufacture of drilling machines and mining machinery, due to the lack of seamless steel pipes. When the first batch of seamless steel pipes arrived in Changsha, the Changsha Branch of the China Hardware and Machinery Company quickly printed notices, detailing the specifications and performance of the seamless steel pipes, to bring good news to some factories and mines that urgently needed them. After testing by relevant factories and mines, the first batch of seamless steel pipes proved to be of good quality. (According to Xinhua News Agency dispatch)

    湖南某些工厂矿山
    开始使用鞍钢制造的无缝钢管
    鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂生产的无缝钢管，已开始在湖南省某些工厂矿山中使用。运到长沙的第一批无缝钢管，首先满足了生产上迫切需要的长沙矿山机械厂、湖南内河航运管理局船舶修理厂等单位。这些工厂过去因为没有无缝钢管，锅炉的检修和改装，钻探机和矿山机械的制造都受到影响。当第一批无缝钢管运到长沙后，中国五金机械公司长沙分公司连忙印制通知书，详细介绍无缝钢管的规格和性能，给一些正需要无缝钢管的工厂矿山报喜。第一批无缝钢管经过有关厂矿的试验，证明质量很好。　　　　　　　　　　（据新华社讯）
