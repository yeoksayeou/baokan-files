(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24th) A rally was held in the Kremlin on the 22nd by representatives of Moscow city and Moscow Oblast youth to bid farewell to the first group of young men and women volunteers going to Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, and the Volga River region to cultivate virgin and wasteland.

Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Malenkov, Molotov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Saburov, Pervukhin, Shvernik, Ponomarenko, and Kirichenko attended the send-off. When they took their seats on the rostrum, the participants responded with warm and prolonged applause.

The Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, Shelepin, delivered the opening remarks. He announced that in just a few days, more than 5,000 young people in Moscow, more than 1,000 young people in Kuban, and 8,000 Young Communist League members in the Ukrainian Republic had volunteered to participate in land reclamation work.

Soviet Minister of Agriculture Benediktov then spoke at the meeting about the scale of Soviet land reclamation work. He pointed out that in the next two years, the Soviet Union will reclaim at least 13 million hectares of virgin land. Collective farms and machine tractor stations in Siberia, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and the Volga River region have already cultivated 1.8 million hectares of land this spring. State farms in the area will also reclaim 500,000 hectares of land this year.

The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation and Minister of Agriculture, Lobanov, spoke at the meeting. He said that most of this land will be sown with wheat. The machine tractor stations in these areas will receive thousands of powerful diesel tractors, combines, trucks, seed drills, and other machines. He pointed out that reclaiming virgin land will increase the country's grain output by hundreds of millions of poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) in a short period of time. No country in history has ever reclaimed land on such a large scale and at such a rapid pace as the Soviet Union. Only the Soviet Union, which has established a strong industry and collective agriculture, can undertake such a task.

Also speaking at the meeting were the Minister of Soviet State Farms, Kozlov, and Renkin, a fitter at the Moscow Midjet Automobile Factory and initiator of the new patriotic movement among Soviet youth, and Balakin, a combine operator from Kuban, among others.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a speech at the meeting and was warmly welcomed by the participants.

The meeting unanimously adopted a letter to the members of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League and the youth of the Soviet Union, calling on them to support this initiative launched by young patriots and actively participate in this great undertaking.

    莫斯科集会欢送志愿参加开垦工作的青年
    马林科夫、莫洛托夫等出席欢送会
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科市和莫斯科州青年代表二十二日在克里姆林宫举行欢送会，欢送第一批志愿到哈萨克，西伯利亚、乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域开垦处女地和荒地的男女青年。
    苏联共产党和政府的领袖马林科夫、莫洛托夫、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、萨布罗夫、别尔乌辛、什维尔尼克、波诺马连科和基里钦科参加了欢送会。当他们在主席台上就座时，与会者报以热烈的、经久不息的掌声。
    苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记谢列平致开会词。他宣布：在短短的几天内，莫斯科已有五千多名青年、库班有一千多名青年、乌克兰共和国有八千名青年团员志愿参加开垦工作。
    苏联农业部部长别湼吉克托夫接着在会上谈到了苏联开垦工作的规模。他指出：在今后两年内，苏联至少要开垦一千三百万公顷处女地。西伯利亚、哈萨克、乌拉尔和伏尔加河流域的集体农庄和机器拖拉机站，在今年春天已开垦了一百八十万公顷土地。当地的国营农场今年还将开垦五十万公顷土地。
    俄罗斯联邦部长会议第一副主席、农业部部长洛巴诺夫在会上讲了话。他说这些土地大部分将播种小麦。这些地区的机器拖拉机站将得到几千部效力强大的柴油拖拉机、联合机、卡车、种子条播机和其他机器。他指出，开垦处女地将可以在短时期内为国家增加几亿普特谷物（每普特合三二点七六市斤）。历史上从来没有任何一个国家像苏联这样大规模地、迅速地开垦土地。只有建立起了强大的工业和集体农业的苏联才能担当起这样的任务。
    在会上发言的还有苏联国营农场部部长科兹洛夫、苏联青年新爱国运动的发起者——莫斯科米德杰特汽车制造工厂安装工人伦金、库班的联合机操使者巴拉金等人。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫在会上发表了演说，受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。
    会议一致通过了告苏联列宁共产主义青年团团员和苏联青年书，号召他们支持青年爱国者所发起的这个创举，积极参加这一伟大的事业。
