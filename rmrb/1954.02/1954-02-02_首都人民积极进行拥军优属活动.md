Xinhua News Agency, 1st. The capital's activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen have begun. The atmosphere of the Spring Festival is first seen at the homes of the families of martyrs and servicemen. Citizens have hung red "Glorious Family" lanterns on the doors of many families of martyrs and servicemen, and cleaned their courtyards thoroughly.

The people of the capital have launched a movement to do one good deed for families of martyrs and servicemen. All the primary school students in the Dongdan District were divided into groups on January 29th to help clean every martyr's and serviceman's home. Residents of the Nanbanjie Hutong Police Station in the Xuanwu District helped families of martyrs and servicemen clean their courtyards. Ma Songshan, an old man in his seventies, also participated. Many residents voluntarily took apart quilts and washed clothes for the local garrison. Pei Chongyu's family in the Haidian District alone took apart and washed twenty quilts for the People's Liberation Army. The people of the city also wrote letters to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army to congratulate them on the Spring Festival. Some also attached various gifts to express their respect.

Many district governments have held symposiums for representatives of families of martyrs and servicemen and demobilized and transferred soldiers to solicit their opinions on the preferential treatment work over the past year. The Xisi District organized 308 cadres, led by Deputy District Mayor Li Zhengbao, to conduct cordial visits to 700 families of martyrs and servicemen, combined with inspection of the preferential treatment work. Before the Spring Festival, the Dongjiao District People's Government had distributed relief funds to poor families of martyrs and servicemen to enable them to spend the Spring Festival peacefully.

The families of servicemen are very grateful for the care of the people's government and the concern of the masses. When the preferential treatment team arrived at the home of Ren Zhenqing, an old man and family member of a Volunteer, he said with great emotion: "The government and the masses always come to comfort us. I will definitely write to my son and tell him about the government's and the masses' love for me."

Beijing Municipality and various districts have established Spring Festival Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Families-of-Servicemen Movement Committees to lead the movement. After the Spring Festival, the citywide movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of servicemen will be fully launched, and various districts and police stations will hold army-civilian get-togethers. On January 31, the Xuanwu District held an army-civilian get-together with more than 2,300 people. Seven large and small theaters in the Tianqiao area provided free entertainment to families of martyrs and servicemen on January 29. During the Spring Festival, a garden party of 30,000 people will be held for families of martyrs and servicemen, revolutionary disabled soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and the garrison.

Beijing Municipality will also hold a representative conference of families of martyrs and servicemen, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers.

    首都人民积极进行拥军优属活动
    【新华社一日讯】首都的拥军优属活动已展开。春节的景象首先展现在烈属、军属门前，市民在很多烈属、军属的门上挂起了红色的光荣灯，把他们的院落打扫得干干净净。
    首都人民发起了一个为烈属、军属作一件事运动。东单区的全体小学生，在一月二十九日分组到每户烈属、军属家里，帮助大扫除。宣武区南半截胡同派出所的居民，帮助烈属、军属打扫院落，七十多岁的老人马松山也参加了。好多居民自动地给当地驻军拆被子、洗衣服，海淀区仅裴崇誉一家即为解放军拆洗了被子二十条。全市人民并纷纷给志愿军和朝鲜人民军写信祝贺春节。有些还附寄了各种表示敬意的礼物。
    很多区政府都召开了烈属、军属代表以及复员转业军人座谈会，征求他们对一年来优抚工作的意见。西四区组织了三百零八个干部，由副区长李正宝带领，对七百户烈属、军属进行了亲切的慰问，并结合检查优抚工作。东郊区人民政府在春节前已把救济款发给贫苦烈属、军属，使他们安度春节。
    军属们非常感激人民政府的照顾和群众的关怀。当优抚小组到达志愿军家属任真卿老大爷的家里时，他非常感动的说：“政府、群众老是来慰问我们，我一定给我的儿子写信，把政府和群众对我的爱戴告诉他。”
    北京市和各区都已建立了春节拥军优属运动委员会，领导拥军优属运动。春节后，全市的拥军优属运动即将全面展开，各区及派出所将分别举行军民联欢大会。一月三十一日，宣武区已举行了二千三百多人的军民联欢大会。天桥一带的七个大小剧院，在一月二十九日免费招待了烈属、军属。春节期间并将举行烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人与驻军三万人的游园大会。
    北京市并将举行烈属、军属、革命残废军人及复员转业军人代表大会。
