    Broad Masses of Peasants in Central-South China Display High Enthusiasm for Production, Actively Joining Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations to Strive for More Grain Production
   [Our Newspaper] Following the completion of grain procurement work, the broad masses of peasants in Central-South China are actively investing themselves in winter production and developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement. They are striving to produce more grain in 1954, sell it to the state, and support the country's industrial construction.
    According to preliminary statistics from the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, the area sown with wheat, barley, oilseed crops, and green manure crops has reached more than 145 million mu. Counties such as Nanchang and Pingxiang in Jiangxi Province have overfulfilled their winter planting plans. Winter plowing, pest control, manure accumulation, and water conservancy construction are being widely carried out throughout the region. Dongxiang County, Jiangxi Province, plans to accumulate more than 7.34 million dan of various fertilizers by the time of spring plowing, an average of 23 dan of fertilizer per mu of land, an increase of 6 dan per mu compared to the same period last year. More than 40 counties in Hubei Province have launched a campaign to build agricultural water conservancy projects. According to statistics from 320 townships in nine counties including Sui, Jingmen, and Yuan'an, more than 2,300 small reservoirs and ponds have recently been completed. In the Yue Dong district of Guangdong Province, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, seven flood control projects, and many small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects have begun construction; the Jinshihou sluice gate project in Chenghai County, which can irrigate 60,000 mu of land, has been completed after 45 days of concentrated effort. In addition to purchasing large quantities of livestock, farm tools, and fertilizers, farmers in various regions are actively saving spring plowing production funds in state banks. As of the end of December last year, farmers' savings in the Central-South region increased by 70.6 percent compared to the end of October last year, with Jiangxi Province increasing by 353.5 percent and Hubei Province increasing by 212.9 percent. Some farmers in Hengnan County, Hunan Province, composed a folk song, which can be used to illustrate the current general mood of farmers in Central-South China who are actively seeking to expand production: "The worker-peasant alliance helps each other, you work in the factories, I grow grain, you make machines for agriculture, I sell grain for industry. Sell tens of millions of catties of grain, deposit large sums of money in the bank, prepare for spring plowing and production, and strive to sell more grain every year."
    Through the publicity of the general line, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants in Central-South China has been raised. Many farmers have realized the benefits of "organizing," and many have requested to join mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Some "nominal" mutual aid teams have automatically carried out rectification, and many established year-round mutual aid teams have requested to be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. According to statistics from 140 villages in Junxian County, Henan Province, 388 new year-round mutual aid teams have recently been developed, with 2,340 households participating; the county's original 106 year-round mutual aid teams have recently absorbed another 707 households, of which 40 year-round mutual aid teams have requested to be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. Hubei Province plans to establish more than 520 agricultural production cooperatives this year, and more than 200 cooperatives are currently being planned. Hunan Province plans to organize 50 percent of the province's farmers to participate in various types of mutual aid teams this year, focusing on running 300 agricultural production cooperatives well. According to the demands of the peasants and the possible conditions, the Central-South region is prepared to organize half of the farmers this year, of which those participating in year-round mutual aid teams will account for 25 percent of the number of organized farmers. During the grain procurement period, supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives in Central-South China have also developed. In Caihe and Jimin districts of Xishui County, Hubei Province, 18 new credit cooperatives were organized. The broad masses of peasants in Central-South China regard joining mutual aid and cooperative organizations as "getting on a ferry," believing that: "Doing a good job in mutual aid and cooperation will develop production and gradually transition to a socialist society!"

    中南区广大农民生产积极性高涨
    纷纷参加互助合作组织争取增产更多粮食
   【本报讯】中南区广大农民在完成购粮工作后，正积极投入冬季生产，开展互助合作运动。为在一九五四年增产更多粮食，卖给国家，支援国家工业建设而努力。
    据湖南、江西、河南、广东、广西五省的初步统计，现已播种的小麦、大麦、油料作物和绿肥作物等共达一亿四千五百多万亩，江西省南昌、萍乡等县都超额完成了冬种计划。冬耕、除虫、积肥和兴修水利等工作，已在各地广泛展开。江西省东乡县计划到春耕时积集各种肥料七百三十四万多担，平均每亩田有肥料二十三担，比去年同时期每亩增加六担。湖北省已有四十余县展开兴修农田水利运动，据随县、荆门、远安等九县三百二十个乡的统计，最近完成的小型塘堰工程有二千三百余处。广东省粤东区现已有九个大、中型水库，七处防洪工程和许多小型农田水利工程开工；澄海县能灌溉六万亩田的金狮喉水闸工程，经过四十五天突击，已经完工。各地农民除添购大批牲畜、农具、肥料外，并积极向国家银行储蓄春耕生产资金。截至去年十二月底，中南全区农民储蓄的款项，比去年十月底增加百分之七十点六，其中江西省增加百分之三百五十三点五，湖北省增加百分之二百一十二点九。湖南省衡南县有的农民编了一首山歌，这首山歌可以用来说明目前中南区一般农民积极要求扩大生产的心情：“工农联盟互相帮，你做工来我种粮，你为农业造机器，我为工业来卖粮。卖出粮食千万斤，大量钱款存银行，准备春耕大生产，争取年年多卖粮。”
    经过总路线宣传，中南区广大农民的社会主义觉悟提高了，许多农民认识到“组织起来”的好处，纷纷要求参加互助合作组织。有些“挂名”互助组自动进行了整顿，不少有基础的常年互助组纷纷要求转为农业生产合作社。河南省浚县一百四十个村的统计，最近新发展的常年互助组有三百八十八个，参加的有二千三百四十户；该县原有的一百零六个常年互助组，最近又吸收了七百零七户，其中有四十个常年互助组要求转为农业生产合作社。湖北省今年计划建立五百二十多个农业生产合作社，目前已有二百多个社正在酝酿成立。湖南省今年计划组织全省百分之五十的农户参加各种类型的互助组，重点办好三百个农业生产合作社。中南全区根据农民的要求和可能的条件，准备在今年将半数农户组织起来，其中参加常年互助组的将占组织起来的农户数的百分之二十五。在购粮期间，中南区供销合作社和信用合作社也有了发展。湖北省浠水县蔡河、积民两区就新组织了十八个信用合作社。中南区广大农民把参加互助合作组织看作是“上渡船”，他们认为：“搞好互助合作，就能发展生产，逐步过渡到社会主义社会！”
