Xinhua News Agency, Berlin: According to TASS, on the evening of the 18th, in some districts of West Berlin, such as Neukölln (American sector), Kreuzberg (American sector), Tiergarten (British sector), and Wedding (French sector), many working people held large marches. The demonstrators protested against the provocative "silent resistance" launched by the West Berlin authorities and right-wing trade union leaders against the Soviet proposals at the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference.

These marches truly expressed the wishes of the working people of West Berlin, many of whom were unemployed. They demanded the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the restoration of German unity on a democratic basis. They resolutely opposed the Bonn and Paris Treaties and the militarization of West Germany and West Berlin. The West Berlin authorities dispatched large numbers of police to deal with the marching working people. Stumm's henchmen used rubber batons to beat German patriots, not sparing the old, the weak, or women. The police also arrested many participants in the marches.

    西柏林人民举行游行要求缔结对德和约
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：十八日晚，在西柏林的一些区，如新科隆区（美占区）、克罗埃次堡区（美占区）、蒂尔加登区（英占区）和韦定区（法占区），许多劳动人民举行了大游行。游行者抗议西柏林当局和右翼工会领袖对苏联在柏林外长会议上的建议所发动的挑衅性的“沉默抵制”。
    这次游行真正表达了西柏林劳动人民的愿望，游行者中有许多是失业者。他们要求缔结对德和约，要求在民主基础上恢复德国的统一。他们坚决反对波恩与巴黎条约，反对西德和西柏林军国主义化。西柏林当局派出大队警察来对付游行的劳动人民。斯图姆的喽啰用橡皮棒殴打德国爱国者，老弱和妇女也不例外。警察并逮捕了许多参加游行的人。
