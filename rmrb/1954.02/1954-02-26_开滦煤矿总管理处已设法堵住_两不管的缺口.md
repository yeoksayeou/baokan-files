Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from People's Daily Readers

    Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office Has Managed to Plug the "Gap of No One's Concern"
    Letter from the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office: On November 26th of last year, the People's Daily published a letter from reader Wang Lan regarding "A Gap of No One's Concern," criticizing the outflow of coal dust from our mine's coal washing plant. This criticism is entirely correct. The small coal dust settling pond of the Kailuan Coal Washing Plant is managed by the coal washing plant, while the large coal dust settling pond is managed by the Linxi Mine Transportation Section. In September and early November of last year, there were large-scale coal dust spills, totaling approximately 3,500 to 4,000 tons. The reason for this was that after the Linxi Mine Transportation Section took over the management of the large coal dust settling pond, they neither established a set of procedures nor assigned a dedicated person to be responsible. They also failed to excavate the pond when it was full of coal dust. At the same time, because they did not provide vehicles in a timely manner, the coal dust from the small pond could not be hoisted out promptly. The large and small coal dust settling ponds were often filled with coal dust, which prevented the water discharged from the coal washing plant from settling in the ponds first, causing a large amount of coal dust to flow out with the water, resulting in a huge loss of state property. The Linxi Mine Transportation Section should bear the primary responsibility for this; while the coal washing plant, although it negotiated with the Transportation Section regarding the untimely supply of vehicles, did not actively consult with the Transportation Section to resolve the problem. When the coal dust spill was discovered, they also failed to actively propose solutions, which was also wrong. Our General Management Office did not pay enough attention when the coal dust spill was first discovered, and only took measures to stop it after a large amount of coal dust had already flowed out. This shows that our leadership's bureaucratic work style is serious. We usually do not inspect and supervise our work enough, resulting in the loss of state wealth. This is a lesson we should remember! We have now, in addition to ordering the Linxi Mine Transportation Section and the coal washing plant to conduct in-depth self-criticisms and giving necessary punishments to the relevant personnel, organized a team to rush to excavate the coal dust settling ponds to prevent the coal dust from continuing to flow out, and decided that all coal dust settling ponds will be managed by the coal washing plant. Currently, two cadres have been assigned to handle this work full-time.

### 开滦煤矿总管理处已设法堵住“两不管的缺口”

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    开滦煤矿总管理处已设法堵住“两不管的缺口”
    开滦煤矿总管理处来信：去年十一月二十六日人民日报发表了读者王蓝关于“一个两不管的缺口”的来信，对我矿洗煤厂烟子外流事件提出批评。这一批评是完全正确的。开滦洗煤厂小烟子池是由洗煤厂管理的，大烟子池则归林西矿运输科管理。去年九月及十一月初，发生了大量跑烟子的事件，共约跑掉烟子三千五百吨至四千吨。其原因是林西矿运输科接受管理大烟子池以后，既没有订出一套办法，也没有责成专人负责，在池里满积烟子时也不进行挖掘；同时，因为他们供给车辆不及时，小池的烟子也不能及时吊出。大、小烟子池经常被烟子淤满，就使洗煤厂放出来的水不能先在池子沉淀，大量烟子顺水外跑，国家财产受到巨大损失。对此，林西矿运输科应负主要责任；而洗煤厂对运输科供给车辆不及时的问题，虽然进行了交涉，但没有积极地和运输科商洽解决。当发现跑烟子时，也没有积极提出解决办法，也是不对的。我们总管理处在刚发现跑烟子时未加重视，直到烟子大量外跑后才采取措施，加以制止。这说明了我们领导方面的官僚主义作风是严重的。我们平时对工作检查和督促不够，造成国家财富的损失。这是值得我们记取的教训！我们现在除责成林西矿运输科、洗煤厂进行深刻检讨，对有关人员进行必要处分外，已组织力量抢挖烟子池，制止烟子继续外跑，并决定烟子池全部归洗煤厂管理，现已有两名干部专职办理这项工作。
