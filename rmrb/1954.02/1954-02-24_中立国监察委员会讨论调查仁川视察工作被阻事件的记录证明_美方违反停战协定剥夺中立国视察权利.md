Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 23rd: Facts revealed during the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's discussion on the investigation by the alternate member delegation sent to Incheon have established that the US side seriously violated the Armistice Agreement by prohibiting the Neutral Nations Inspection Team in Incheon from entering Incheon port to perform inspection duties on the afternoon of January 20th and the morning of January 21st. The Korean-Chinese side has received the records of the relevant meetings submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

According to the records of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, US Liaison Officer Major Ricas openly stated to the team: "Due to the movement of prisoners of war, the Neutral Nations Inspection Team must not conduct inspection work in the port for security reasons on the afternoon of January 20th and the morning of January 21st." Ricas also claimed that he had received orders from his superiors to prohibit the team from entering the port during this period, even if the team made a request. This proves that the US side, in order to facilitate its use of Incheon port, loaded more than 14,000 coerced and detained Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war onto US warships to be sent to Chiang Kai-shek as cannon fodder, blatantly further violating the Armistice Agreement, depriving the Neutral Nations Inspection Team of its right to inspect Incheon port, and prohibiting the team from entering the port to perform inspection duties.

The Czechoslovak and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission pointed out in the discussion that the US side's prohibition of the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team from performing its duties and tasks violated Paragraph 13(f) and Paragraph 17 of the Armistice Agreement. Paragraph 13(f) of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that the commanders of both sides shall "provide full protection and all possible assistance and cooperation" to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams when they are performing their duties and tasks. Paragraph 17 stipulates that the commanders of both sides must actively cooperate with the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission "in order to achieve compliance with the letter and spirit of all provisions of this Armistice Agreement."

The meeting records submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also cited facts of the US side repeatedly obstructing and interfering with the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The US side tried its best to obstruct the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from investigating the incident of its prohibition of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team from performing its duties in order to evade its responsibility for violating the Armistice Agreement. Due to pressure from the US side, the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission rejected the Korean-Chinese side's request to immediately dispatch a mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team to investigate the US side's violation of the Armistice Agreement. On January 27th, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission sent its four neutral nations alternate members to Incheon to investigate the situation of the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team being obstructed by the US side from performing its duties. However, the four neutral nations alternate members stayed in Incheon for five days and failed to start the investigation work, and were forced to return to Panmunjom on January 31st. The Czechoslovak and Polish members subsequently made two suggestions that the four neutral nations alternate members should go to Incheon again to conduct an investigation, but they were unreasonably rejected by the Swedish and Swiss members. Up to now, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has neither submitted an investigation report on this incident, nor has it submitted the relevant review of the commission to the Korean-Chinese side.

    中立国监察委员会讨论调查仁川视察工作被阻事件的记录证明
    美方违反停战协定剥夺中立国视察权利
    【新华社开城二十三日电】中立国监察委员会讨论关于派往仁川的候补委员团调查工作的过程中揭发的事实，已确定美方在一月二十日下午和二十一日上午禁止仁川中立国视察小组进入仁川港口执行视察任务，严重违反了停战协定。朝中方面已收到中立国监察委员会送交的有关各次会议的记录。
    根据中立国监察委员会的记录，美方联络官里卡斯少校曾公开对小组声称：“由于战俘的移动，一月二十日下午和一月二十一日上午为了安全的理由，中立国视察小组不得在港口进行视察工作。”里卡斯并声称他接到他的上级的命令，禁止小组在这段时间内进入港口，即使在小组提出要求的情况下。这证明美方为了便于其使用仁川港口，把强迫扣留的一万四千多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员押上美军船舰运给蒋介石当炮灰，公然进一步违反停战协定，剥夺中立国视察小组在仁川港口视察的权利，禁止小组进入港口执行视察任务。
    中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员在讨论中指出：美方禁止仁川中立国视察小组执行其职司与任务，违反了停战协定第十三款午项和第十七款。停战协定第十三款午项规定：双方司令官在中立国视察小组执行其职司与任务时，应“给予充分保护及一切可能的协助与合作”。第十七款规定：双方司令官须与中立国监察委员会积极合作，“以求得对本停战协定全部规定的文字与精神的遵守”。
    中立国监察委员会提交的会议记录，并举出了美方一再阻挠和干涉中立国监察委员会的工作的事实。美方极力阻挠中立国监察委员会调查其禁止中立国视察小组执行任务的事件，以逃避其违反停战协定的责任。由于美方的压力，中立国监察委员会的瑞典和瑞士委员否决了朝中方面关于立即派遣机动中立国视察小组调查美方这一违反停战协定事件的请求。中立国监察委员会在一月二十七日曾派出其四名中立国候补委员前往仁川，调查仁川中立国视察小组被美方阻挠执行任务的情况。但四名中立国候补委员在仁川停留五天并未能开始调查工作，被迫在一月三十一日返回板门店。捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员此后曾两次提出四名中立国候补委员应再度前往仁川进行调查的建议，但都被瑞典和瑞士委员无理地否决。迄今为止，中立国监察委员会既未能提出一份关于这一事件的调查报告，亦未能向朝中方面提出委员会的有关审定。
