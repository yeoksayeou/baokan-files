Xinhua News Agency report:

    During the Spring Festival this year, workers and peasants across the country widely engaged in get-togethers, adopting methods of mutual visits and tours, further strengthening the brotherly and close unity between workers and peasants.
    During this period, many factories and rural areas across the country dispatched their own delegations. According to statistics, during the Spring Festival, factories and mines in Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Anshan, Nanjing, Changsha, Jinan, and other places sent out seventy-five worker delegations, totaling more than 35,000 people. At the same time, peasants from the suburbs of many cities and many rural areas also sent their representatives to cities and industrial and mining areas. These representatives included nationally renowned industrial labor models, agricultural labor models, advanced production workers, as well as engineers, technicians, factory directors, collective farm chairmen, agricultural production cooperative directors, agricultural mutual aid group leaders, and many worker and peasant representatives who had made outstanding achievements in industrial and agricultural production. They engaged in joyful get-togethers in the capital Beijing, in the steel capital Anshan, on the Huai River construction site, in the Daye mining area, on the Wushaoling construction site of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and in many other cities, industrial and mining areas, collective farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and peasant households.
    Peasant representatives were warmly welcomed upon their arrival at factories and mines, and worker representatives were warmly welcomed upon their arrival in rural areas. They mutually introduced their production achievements and living conditions. Many worker delegations brought products from their factories to introduce the production situation to the peasants and to solicit their opinions on the products. Workers from farm tool factories visiting the countryside not only solicited opinions but also helped peasants repair new-style farm tools and introduced methods for preserving farm tools. When Zhong Chengxian, director of the laboratory of the Tianjin First Printing and Dyeing Factory, Wang Yicheng, a worker from a woolen mill, and Zhang Changxin, a worker from a knitting factory, visited the peasant Xia Changyou's home, Zhong Chengxian took out the printed cloth produced by his factory for the peasants to see. He said: This kind of printed cloth can print two bolts per minute and is supplied to peasant sisters for clothing. He hoped that the sisters would offer their opinions on the patterns. The women were amazed to hear that two bolts of cloth could be printed in one minute and expressed great admiration for the workers. Some peasants from collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives also enthusiastically guided workers to visit their agricultural machinery rooms, newly built sheds, and spacious cattle sheds. Workers in Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an, Anshan, and other places also held special evening parties to entertain the peasants. Workers and peasants in various places also exchanged gifts with each other. The staff and workers of the Lingshan Farm Tool Factory in Anshan City voluntarily contributed one day's labor, using the wages from that day to buy three "Worker-Peasant Alliance" harvesters and six large double-wheeled double-furrow plows, which were donated to the "May 1st" Collective Farm in Chengde County and the Han En and Wang Ximing agricultural production cooperatives, respectively. Peasants in various places also brought their agricultural products to give to the workers. Kong Guangju, a peasant from Xincheng Township in the suburbs of Tianjin, even specially glued various grains onto paper to form a plaque with the eight characters "Worker-Peasant Unity, Build the Motherland" to give to the workers.
    Through get-togethers and visits, workers and peasants gained a further understanding of each other and recognized the important significance of mutual support. Many peasants who had visited the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant gave a thumbs-up to everyone they met, praising the greatness of the working class. Huang Yongde, Cui De, Shi Chengfa, and others, agricultural labor models from Songjiang Province who visited Anshan Iron and Steel, said in a letter to all the peasants in Songjiang Province: "This visit has opened our eyes. In the past, we only heard people say that the steel and iron materials from Anshan Iron and Steel were used to build large factories and tall buildings, to make machines, and to lay railroads, all for the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural mechanization. Today, we have seen Anshan Iron and Steel with our own eyes and seen thousands and thousands of tons of steel and iron materials being shipped out of the factory. Our hearts are even clearer. We think: With these things, socialist industrialization and agricultural mechanization are not far from us." The members of the Ma Fengshan mutual aid group in Luguxiang, Shijingshan, visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. Seeing that industry was developing so rapidly, they felt that the peasants had a very important responsibility and decided to transform the mutual aid group into an agricultural production cooperative to quickly increase agricultural production to meet the needs of industry. Guo Rong, director of the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, visited the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and expressed that he must strengthen the planning of production and produce more grain and oil crops to supply industry. Li Fangliang, an agricultural labor model from the suburbs of Benxi City, was very moved to hear Qu Fuming, an industrial labor model, introduce how their entire class united and overfulfilled the state's production tasks under difficult conditions. He said that he must learn the workers' collectivist spirit and do a good job in production. During the visits, many peasants also asked the workers to produce more agricultural machines for them so that they could produce more grain and industrial raw materials; they also hoped that the workers would produce more cloth and other daily necessities. These demands made the workers feel that their responsibilities were even greater. Many workers expressed that they would certainly not disappoint the expectations of their peasant brothers.
    Through visits, discussions, and get-togethers, many workers also received a profound education. The workers unanimously thanked the peasants for their support and pledged to vigorously help the peasants increase production. The workers who visited the countryside saw that the peasants were actively organizing themselves and developing production and selling the best surplus grain to the state, and they all praised them unanimously. Workers' representatives from the Zibo industrial and mining area in Shandong kindly thanked their peasant brothers for their help in a discussion, because the peasants near the mining area not only produced a large amount of grain, raw materials, and vegetables to supply the factory but also, during the heavy rain last year, when the flood threatened the mine's production, braved the heavy rain to help the coal miners fill the cracks and ancient wells, ensuring the mine's production. Workers who visited near the railway lines and construction sites were very grateful to hear the peasants introduce their vivid stories of how they protected the railway and defended the construction site machinery. Some workers had a correct view of the peasants after visiting the countryside. Wang Yongjie, an engineer from the state-owned Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory, Niu Xinyi, a female worker, and others discovered after visiting the countryside that today's peasants were very different from the peasants they had previously known. Niu Xinyi learned that 60% of the peasants in her hometown had now been organized, and the rice harvest per mu had increased by one-third compared to the past. In particular, she was very surprised and admired by the vivid examples of peasants enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state after receiving education on the General Line. Wang Yongjie was impressed by how quickly the peasants were progressing under the leadership of the Communist Party when he saw an elderly peasant woman in her sixties able to analyze problems in an orderly manner. They expressed that they would maintain regular contact with the peasants in the future and encourage each other to make progress.

    春节前后工农广泛进行联欢活动
    进一步加强了工农的团结
    据新华社讯：今年春节期间，全国各地的工人和农民采取互相访问、参观的方式，广泛地进行了联欢活动，进一步加强了工农之间兄弟般的亲密团结。
    这一时期，全国许多工厂和农村都派出自己的代表团。据统计，在春节期间，北京、天津、沈阳、上海、广州、西安、鞍山、南京、长沙、济南等地的工厂和矿山，派出了七十五个工人代表团，共三万五千多人。同时，许多城市的郊区和许多农村的农民，也派出了自己的代表到城市和工矿区去。这些代表中有全国著名的工业劳动模范、农业劳动模范、先进生产工作者，以及在工农业生产中成绩卓著的工程师、技术人员、工厂厂长、集体农庄主席、农业生产合作社主任、农业互助组组长和许多工人、农民代表。他们在首都北京，在钢都鞍山，在淮河工地，在大冶矿区，在兰新铁路乌鞘岭工地，在其他许多城市、工矿区、集体农庄、农业生产合作社和农民家庭里，尽情地进行了联欢活动。
    各地农民代表到达厂矿和工人代表到达农村后，都受到热烈欢迎。他们互相介绍了生产成绩和生活情况。许多工人代表团带着自己厂里的产品，向农民介绍生产情形，征求农民兄弟对产品的意见。下乡访问的农具厂工人，一面征求意见，一面帮助农民修理新式农具，并向农民介绍保管农具的方法。天津第一印染厂化验室主任钟承宪、毛织厂工人王义成、针织厂工人张长新等到农民夏长友家里访问时，锺承宪拿出自己厂出产的花布给农民看。他说：这种花布一分钟能印两匹，是供给农民姐妹们穿的，他希望姐妹们对花样提出意见。妇女们听说一分钟能印出两匹布，都感到惊奇，对工人表示非常敬佩。有些集体农庄和农业生产合作社的农民，还热情地引导工人参观他们的农业机器房、新盖的车棚和宽敞的牛舍。北京、天津、西安、鞍山等地的工人，并举办专门晚会招待了农民。各地工人和农民，还互相赠送了礼物。鞍山市灵山农具厂的职工自动献工一日，用这一天的工资买了三台
  “工农联盟”号收割机和六台大型双轮双铧犁，分别赠给承德县“五一”集体农庄和韩恩、王喜明两个农业生产合作社。各地农民也拿出自己的农产品送给工人。天津市郊区新城乡农民孔广居还特地用各种谷粒在纸上黏成“工农团结，建设祖国”八个字的匾额送给工人。
    经过联欢、访问，工人和农民相互有了进一步的了解，并认识到互相支援的重要意义。参观过鞍山钢铁公司和石景山钢铁厂的许多农民，见了人就竖起大拇指，称赞工人阶级的伟大。到鞍钢参观的松江省农业劳动模范黄永德、崔德、石成发等在写给松江省全省农民的一封信中说：“这次参观使我们开了眼界。过去光听人说鞍钢这些钢材、铁材是用来建设大工厂和高楼大厦，造机器，铺铁道的，都为了国家的社会主义工业化和农业机械化。今天我们亲眼看到了鞍钢，看到了成千上万吨的钢材、铁材从工厂往外运，心里更透彻了。我们想：有了这些东西，社会主义工业化和农业机械化就离我们不远了。”石景山鲁谷乡马凤山互助组的组员们参观了石景山钢铁厂，他们看到工业发展得这样快，感到农民的责任很重大，决心把互助组转为农业生产合作社，赶快提高农业生产，适应工业的需要。丰台区张郭庄农业生产合作社主任郭荣参观了长辛店机车车辆修理工厂后，表示一定要加强生产的计划性，多生产粮食和油料作物，供应工业。本溪市郊农业劳动模范李芳良听到工业劳动模范曲福明介绍他们全班团结一致，在困难条件下超额完成国家生产任务的情形，非常感动，他表示一定要学习工人集体主义精神，搞好生产。在访问中，许多农民还要求工人能为他们生产出更多的农业机器，使他们能生产更多的粮食和工业原料；也希望工人多生产些布匹等日用品。这些要求，使工人们感到自己的责任更加重大。许多工人表示一定不辜负农民弟兄的期望。
    经过访问、座谈、联欢，许多工人也受到了深刻的教育。工人们一致感谢农民的支援，并纷纷保证要大力帮助农民增加生产。下乡访问的工人看到了农民积极组织起来，发展生产，并把最好的余粮卖给国家的情形，都一致称赞。山东淄博工矿区工人代表在座谈中亲切地感谢农民兄弟对他们的帮助，因为矿区附近的农民不仅生产了大量粮食、原料和蔬菜供给工厂，还在去年大雨期间，当水灾威胁着矿山生产的时候，冒着大雨帮助煤矿工人填平了裂缝、古井，保证了矿山的生产。在铁路线附近和工地附近访问的工人，听到农民介绍他们怎样保护铁路和保卫工地机器的生动事迹，都非常感激。有些工人在访问农村后对农民都有了正确的看法。国营浙江麻纺织厂工程师王雍劫、女工钮心怡等访问农村后，发觉今天的农民和他们以前所了解的农民已经大不相同了。钮心怡知道她的家乡到现在已有百分之六十的农民组织起来，稻谷的收获量每亩比以前增加三分之一。特别是农民受到总路线教育后，踊跃地把余粮卖给国家的生动事例，使她非常惊奇和钦佩。王雍劫看到一个六十多岁的老农妇能够有条有理地分析问题，感到农民在共产党的领导下，进步得真快。他们表示今后要经常和农民联系，互相鼓励进步。
