    "Mom is Happier Than Any Other Year"
    Editor's Note: Zhang Baozhen is a model military dependent in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, a people's representative of the district, a military dependent representative, and a model propagandist. Her husband, Liu Yuxiang, is an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" strike and a Communist Party member. Her eldest son, Liu Zhenhai, is the stationmaster of Handan Railway Station and a Communist Party member. Her second son, Liu Zhenhe, is a member of the Communist Youth League and works at the Jingxing County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Hebei Province. Her third son, Liu Zhenquan, is also a member of the Communist Youth League and joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1949. The following is a letter she wrote to her third son, Liu Zhenquan, after the Spring Festival.

    Zhenquan, my son:
    This year's Spring Festival, Mom is happier than any other year: Chairman Mao has set the general line for the country's transition period for us. Before the Spring Festival, Mom was elected as a people's representative of our district. You also sent back a meritorious service report, and your elder brothers have all become models and received awards... Really, good news has all come together!
    Some time ago, you wrote in your letter: "Mom, I am your son, and also the son of the country. I will defend the motherland to the end!" In your letter, you also repeatedly urged me to respond to the government's call, to study Chairman Mao's general line well, and to participate well in the general election.... Child, your words are all in Mom's heart. Think about it, your father is an old worker from the "February 7th" strike, and we are a revolutionary military family. Mom is also a Party propagandist, how can we lag behind others! When we first heard about the general line here, some people just couldn't understand it, especially our country's grain policy, they couldn't understand it even more. But, Mom understands it all in my heart. If the country doesn't have enough grain, not only will industrialization be impossible, but the lives of the common people will also be difficult. Not to mention anything else, don't you remember the world when the Japanese devils were in our Shijiazhuang? At that time, all the grain was occupied by unscrupulous merchants. The price would rise as they said, changing prices all the time. The little money your father earned hard on the railway was gone in the blink of an eye. Now Chairman Mao leads us well, there's no worry about food or clothing. Last May, your eldest brother became the stationmaster of Handan Railway Station, and your second brother also became a telegraph operator in the Jingxing Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Even your father, who is getting old and sick and unable to work, still receives more than two hundred thousand yuan in pension every month. Not long after you joined the army, the railway built workers' dormitories, and our family was allocated five rooms, with a kitchen and bedrooms, electric lights, running water, glass windows... everything is complete. Comparing the past with the present, Mom always feels that Chairman Mao's general line is correct. Because of this, no matter where Mom goes, as long as I have the opportunity, I will publicize the general line to the masses. Zhenquan, these years, the masses' minds have been opened, as long as the truth is explained clearly, everyone's thinking will quickly change.
    In January, we had a general election here. As a propagandist, Mom explained the principles of the general election to the masses, and publicized that our country must achieve socialism and that people's democratic dictatorship must be done well. The district said that Mom's propaganda was good and even awarded me a "Peace Diary." On the day of the general election, Mom got up early, changed into new clothes, and went to vote. I went the earliest, but the election place was already crowded with people, even more lively than a big celebration! When the masses saw me coming, they said, "Sister-in-law Liu is worthy of being a representative!" Mom didn't say anything, but I already had a bottom line in my heart: "If I am really elected, I must live up to the hopes of the masses!" On the day of the general electorate meeting, when the election committee announced that out of 1,667 voters, Mom got 1,293 votes! Then, many people ran over to offer flowers to the elected representatives, and Mom wore three flowers on my chest: one big red one and two pink ones. Mom looked at the flowers, smiled, and felt like I was decades younger! Really, I really didn't expect that I, who am over half a lifetime old, could still get this honor!
    On the night of January 19th, your eldest brother returned to our Shijiazhuang because of official business. At that time, everyone in our family was asleep. As soon as he entered the door, he shouted, "Dad, here, this is Zhenquan's meritorious service!" Your dad didn't bother to put on his clothes, got up from the bed, took the meritorious service report, and said, "I said it a long time ago, the child said it a long time ago, he would send back a meritorious service report... Really, what he says, he means it!" The next day, your dad made a frame himself and hung the meritorious service report under Chairman Mao's portrait. In addition, the city awarded me a military dependent model certificate, an election certificate, and the photos you sent back, almost filling the south wall of our house!
    Ten days before the Spring Festival, your eldest sister-in-law and second sister-in-law all came back, and they all brought Mom good New Year's gifts. Your eldest sister-in-law said that your eldest brother works very hard and has recently received a bonus; your second sister-in-law said that your second brother was also rated as a work model in late January and became the leader of the administrative and Communist Youth League team. Your eldest sister-in-law has only been in Handan for two or three months, and she has been elected as the household registration team leader. Their family members have also formed a mutual aid group and signed a patriotic pact to ensure that railway workers eat well and sleep well. Recently, the local railway trade union also awarded them a red flag!
    Zhenquan, these are what Mom needs! With these New Year's gifts, Mom feels more at ease than anything else during the New Year.
    On the day of the Spring Festival, as soon as we finished eating dumplings, many people came to our house to express their sympathy. There were leaders from the city and residents from the streets. Some people had never even met before, but they were so affectionate when they met, asking if our family had any difficulties or if there were any areas that were not being taken care of....
    What difficulties are there? What areas are not being taken care of? Last April, your father got sick, and I don't know who spread the word. Men and women, the courtyard was crowded with people, and even District Chief Xu from our district came. Chang Ruihua, the doctor on our street, is so old, but she still came to give your father injections at night, and she didn't want money. When the masses heard that your father was going to be sent to the hospital, everyone scrambled to carry him, but your father refused, so he hired a tricycle, but the tricycle worker didn't want any money either. Niu Meirui on our street, who is almost fifty years old and sick, didn't join the preferential treatment group, but she insisted on making a pair of shoes for Mom. Mom refused, so she secretly measured a shoe sample and made a pair with her own materials. She said, "I don't have anything else, so this is just a little of my heart!"
    Ten days before the Spring Festival, the People's Government sent comfort money. Our family cut meat, bought flour, vermicelli, vegetables..., and steamed three cages of steamed buns, six cages of steamed dumplings, and three cages of corn bread..., enough to eat for ten days. Zhenquan, what difficulties does our family have! Mom just remembers the comfort card that the Municipal People's Government sent to us on the day of the Spring Festival, which said: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory!" Mom will definitely follow this path! Although Mom is fifty-one years old this year, I still want to see a socialist society with you!

    Mom Zhang Baozhen

### “妈心里比哪一年都喜欢”

    “妈心里比哪一年都喜欢”
    编者按：张宝珍是河北省石家庄市的军属模范、区人民代表、军属代表和模范宣传员。她的丈夫叫刘玉祥，是参加过“二七”罢工的老工人，共产党员。大儿子刘振海，是邯郸火车站站长，共产党员。二儿子刘振和是青年团员，在河北省井陉县邮电局工作。三儿子刘振全也是青年团员，于一九四九年参加中国人民解放军。下面是她春节后写给三儿子刘振全的信。振全儿：
    今年的春节，妈心里比哪一年都喜欢：毛主席给咱规定了国家过渡时期的总路线，春节前，妈又当选了咱们区上的人民代表，你也送回来了立功喜报，你大哥、二哥都当了模范，得了奖……。真是，喜事都凑到一块了！
    前些日子你来信说：“妈妈，我是你的儿子，也是国家的儿子，我要保卫祖国到底！”信里，你还左嘱托右嘱托，叫妈好好响应政府的号召，好好学习毛主席规定出来的总路线，好好参加普选……。孩子，你的话，全说到妈的心眼里了。你想想看，你爸爸是个“二七”的老工人，咱们又是个革命军属，妈还是党的宣传员，啥事还能落到人家的后头！咱这里才听说总路线的时候，有些人就是想不通，特别是对咱们国家的粮食政策，更不能了解。可是，妈心里全明白，国家要是没有足够的粮食，不要说工业化不了，就是老百姓的日子也难过好。别的不说，你还不记得日本鬼子在咱石家庄时的那个世道。那时，粮食全霸占在奸商的手里，说涨就涨，一会一个价，你爸爸在铁路上辛辛苦苦挣来的一点钱，还不是一转眼就完了。如今毛主席领导得好，不愁吃，不愁穿。去年五月，你大哥又当了邯郸火车站的站长，你二哥在井陉邮电局也当上了电务员，就是你爸爸上了几岁年纪，又得了病，不能工作，每月还有二十多万元的养老金。你参军不久，铁路上就盖了工人宿舍，光咱家就分给了五间，厨房是厨房，卧室是卧室的，电灯、自来水、玻璃窗户……样样俱全。想前比后，妈总觉得毛主席规定的总路线就是正确。就因为这，妈不管走到哪里，只要一碰到机会就向群众宣传总路线。振全儿，这几年群众的心窍都开啦，只要一讲清道理，大家的思想也就很快转变过来了。
      一月间，咱这里实行了普选。妈这个宣传员，就向群众讲普选的道理，宣传咱们国家要到达社会主义非搞好人民民主专政不行。区上说妈宣传得好，还奖给一本“和平日记本”哩。普选那天，妈一早就起来，换了新衣裳去选举了。我去的顶早，可是选举的地方已挤满了人，真比办啥大喜事还热闹！群众一看到我来，就说：“刘嫂就配当个代表！”妈嘴里没说，可心里早有了底：“要真的当选了，一定对得住群众的希望！”开全体选民大会那天，选举委员会一宣布，一千六百六十七个选民，妈就得了一千二百九十三票！接着，很多人都跑来给当选的代表献花，光妈的胸前就戴了三朵：一朵大红的，两朵粉红的。妈看看花，笑笑，觉得就好像年轻了几十岁一样！真是，真是想不到，大半辈子的人了，还能得到这份光荣哩！
    一月十九日夜里，你大哥因为公事回到咱石家庄来。那时候，咱家里的人都睡觉了。他一进门，就嚷叫：“爸爸，给，这是振全立的功！”你爸没顾得穿衣服，就从床上爬起来，接过立功喜报，就说：“早就说过了，孩子早就说过了，要寄回来个立功喜报……真是，说一句算一句呀！”第二天，你爸就自个儿做了个镜框，把立功喜报挂到毛主席像下边。再加上市里奖给我的军属模范奖状、当选证书和你们寄回来的照片，咱屋子里的南墙上差不多快挂满了！
    春节前十几天，你大嫂、二嫂全回来了，她们都给妈带回来了好年礼。你大嫂说，你大哥工作很卖力气，最近还得了奖金；你二嫂说，你二哥在一月下旬又被评上了工作模范，还当上了行政和团的小组长。你大嫂才到邯郸两三个月，就被人家选为户口组长，她们家属还成立了互助组，订立了爱国公约，保证铁路职工吃好、睡好。最近，当地铁路工会还奖给了她们一面红旗呢！
    振全，妈需要的就是这些！有了这些年礼，妈过年心里比什么都踏实。
    春节那天，才吃完饺子，很多人就到咱家来慰问。又是市里的首长，又是街道的居民，有些人连面也没见过，他们一见面就是那么亲热，问咱家有没有困难，有没有照顾不到的地方……。
    还有啥困难？还有啥照顾不到的地方？去年四月间，你爸得了病，不知谁传出去了风声，男的，女的，院子里都挤满了人，连咱区上的徐区长也来了。咱街上的医生常瑞华，人家那么大年纪，还连夜来给你爸打针，给他钱也不要。群众听说要送你爸到医院里去，大家都挣着要抬，你爸不肯，才雇了个三轮，可是三轮车工人也是一个钱也没要。咱街道上的牛梅瑞，快五十岁的人啦，又有病，没有参加优抚小组，可是她非要给妈做对鞋不行，妈不肯，她就偷偷地比了个鞋样，用自己的材料做了一对。她说：“我没有别的，这就算是我的一点心意吧！”
    离春节还有十几天，人民政府就送来了慰劳款，咱家割了肉，买了面粉、粉条、青菜……，又蒸了三笼馒头、六笼饱子、三笼窝窝头……，足够吃十几天。振全，你说咱家还有啥困难！妈就记着市人民政府春节那天送给咱的那张慰问片，那上面写着：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”！妈一定照着这条路走！妈今年虽然五十一岁了，还要和你们一起看看社会主义社会！妈张宝珍
