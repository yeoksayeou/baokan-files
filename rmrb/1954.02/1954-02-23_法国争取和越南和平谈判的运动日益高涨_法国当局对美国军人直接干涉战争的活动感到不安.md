Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: TASS, Paris, February 19th - The tense military and political situation in Indochina has caused unease among French right-wing newspapers and intensified the French movement for peaceful negotiations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. News from various newspapers indicates that French authorities are uneasy about the recent intensification of activities by American soldiers, who seek to expand direct American intervention in the Indochina situation.

The "Le Monde" correspondent in Washington, Henri Pierre, particularly pointed out that Admiral Radford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and some military figures close to him, are making special efforts to expand American intervention in the Indochina War. Pierre wrote: "Admiral Radford's friends, such as Generals O'Daniel and Van Fleet, as well as some 'Taiwan elements' and 'South Korean elements,' are openly attempting to supervise and direct the war (the Indochina War). How can they think that the French would agree to relinquish control over war and peace, and merely retain the empty title of executor?" The "France-Soir" correspondent in Saigon described the areas of French-controlled Indochina as being in "extreme chaos."

"Le Monde's" parliamentary commentator, Jacques Fauvet, pointed out that some individuals in the Laniel government advocate a peaceful solution to the Indochina problem. He cited Paul Reynaud, Palewski, Schuman, Edgar Faure, and Jacquinot who, before Bidault attended the Berlin Conference, "had strenuously advocated" that the Minister of Foreign Affairs should seize every opportunity to resolve the issue of convening a conference on Asian issues, particularly the Indochina issue. Fauvet wrote: "More and more ministers and parliamentarians, whether they are in favor of or against the establishment of a 'European Army,' are paying more attention to the Indochina issue than ever before."

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: TASS, Paris, February 21st - An increasing number of prominent French political and social figures are beginning to understand the serious political and economic consequences of the Indochina War for France. Renowned French professor, Lavelle, wrote an article in the latest issue of the weekly "Tribune des Nations," strongly opposing the continuation of this ruinous war.

Lavelle wrote: "We have fallen into this endless and fruitless Indochina War, a very serious mistake that Washington has driven us to commit. As for how foolish it is to continue this war, it has probably been discussed enough." He continued: "We continue this hateful slaughter simply to carry out the orders of the Americans. The Americans are unspeakably disappointed because they have lost vast Chinese territory." He condemned the overall direction of American Asian policy, considering it a policy hostile to the national interests of Asian countries.

Lavelle wrote: "In the future, both in fact and in law, Asia can only be managed by Asians themselves. If Washington does not recognize this fact, it will be greatly mistaken." He also wrote that the United States and other Western countries should no longer implement any power politics towards Asia, should no longer create any obstacles for the Asian people in managing their own affairs, should engage in free trade with them, should expedite the establishment of peace in Korea, should express support for the reasonable demands of these Asian countries, and should accept People's China's participation in all United Nations agencies.

Lavelle continued: "But we French, merely to submissively subordinate ourselves to Washington, and to gain some material benefits to balance the deficit in foreign trade, stubbornly persist in this unwise Indochina War. We have disgraced ourselves to such an extent that we would agree to sell the blood of French officers, soldiers, mercenaries, especially North African mercenaries, for 385 million US dollars within a year and a half. This march towards extinction costs us more than 600 billion francs each year. Therefore, only by selling the blood of the French can we help balance the balance of payments... But we cannot indefinitely use French blood as the main item of 'export' to the United States."

    法国争取和越南和平谈判的运动日益高涨
    法国当局对美国军人直接干涉战争的活动感到不安
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社巴黎十九日讯：印度支那的紧张的军事和政治局势引起了法国右翼报纸的不安，并使法国争取和越南民主共和国政府进行和平谈判的运动更加激烈。由各报的消息中可以判明，法国当局对美国军人最近加紧活动感到不安，因为美国军人想要扩大美国对印度支那事件的直接干涉。
    “世界报”驻华盛顿记者安利·皮埃尔特别指出，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福海军上将以及和他接近的一些军界人士，都特别努力于扩大美国对印度支那战争的干涉。皮埃尔写道：“雷德福海军上将的朋友如奥丹尼尔将军、范佛里特将军以及一些‘台湾分子’和‘南朝鲜分子’都公开地企图监督指挥战争（印度支那战争）。他们怎么会这样想：法国人会同意放弃对战争与和平的控制，而徒挂一个执行者的虚名呢？”“法兰西晚报”驻西贡记者描写了法国所控制的印度支那的各地区是如何的“混乱之至”。
    “世界报”议会评论员雅克·福维指出，拉尼埃政府中的某些人士是主张和平解决印度支那问题的。他举出了保罗·雷诺、巴拉辛、夏季诺、埃加·富尔和雅盖，在皮杜尔出席柏林会议之前，
  “曾竭力主张”外交部部长要利用一切可能，以便解决召开关于亚洲问题、特别是印度支那问题的会议的问题。福维写道：“越来越多的部长们和议员们，不管是赞成或反对建立‘欧洲军’的，对印度支那问题比任何时候都要重视了。”
   【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十一日讯：越来越多的法国显要的政治和社会人士开始理解到，印度支那战争给法国的政治和经济带来了严重的后果。法国著名教授拉维尔涅在最近一期“民族论坛”周刊上撰文，强烈反对继续这个招致破产的战争。
    拉维尔涅写道：“我们陷入了这个没有止境、得不到结果的印度支那战争，是华盛顿驱使我们犯下的极严重的错误。至于继续这场战争该是多么糊涂这一点，恐怕已经谈得够多了。”他继续说：“我们继续这种令人憎恨的屠杀，只不过是为了执行美国人的命令。美国人因为失去了广大的中国领土而感到说不出的失望。”他谴责美国的亚洲政策的总方针，认为这是一种敌视亚洲各国民族利益的政策。
    拉维尔涅写道：“今后在事实上和法律上，亚洲只能由亚洲人自己管理，如果华盛顿不承认这一事实，那它就大错而特错了。”他又写道，美国和其他西方国家对亚洲不应再施行任何实力政策，不要再对亚洲人民在管理他们自己的事务方面加以任何阻挠，应当和他们进行自由贸易，尽速建立朝鲜和平，应当表示支持这些亚洲国家的合理要求并接纳人民中国参加联合国一切机构。
    拉维尔涅继续说：“但是我们法国人却仅仅为了卑躬屈膝地从属于华盛顿，为了要平衡对外贸易的差额而沾点物质利益，继续顽固地坚持这个不智的印度支那战争。我们已丢脸到这种程度：竟会为了三亿八千五百万美元而同意在一年半以内出卖法国的军官、士兵以及雇佣兵，特别是北非的雇佣兵的鲜血。这种走向灭亡的远征每年要花费我们六千多亿法郎，因此，只有出卖法国人的鲜血才能帮助我们平衡支付差额……但我们是不能长期把法国人的鲜血作为对美国‘输出’的主要项目的。”
