Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 9th: A large-scale expansion project to further transform the production landscape of the Kailuan Coal Mine has commenced or is about to commence. These projects include the construction of four ventilation shafts for the new Zhaogezhuang Mine, Linxi Mine, Tangjiazhuang Mine, and Tangshan Mine; three blind shafts for the Zhaogezhuang Mine, Tangshan Mine, etc.; a transportation shaft for the Linxi Mine; as well as key projects such as roadway development and geological drilling. With the exception of the Tangshan Mine ventilation shaft, which is scheduled to begin construction next year, all of these projects will commence successively this spring and summer; among them, the Zhaogezhuang Mine's ventilation shaft and roadway development projects have already begun construction.

The Kailuan Coal Mine is the second-largest coal mine in China, second only to the Fushun Coal Mine in Northeast China, and its industrial coal is widely sold throughout the country. Once these expansion projects that have begun this year and the Tangshan Mine ventilation shaft project that will begin construction next year are completed, the Kailuan Coal Mine will be able to switch from the current two shifts of coal mining per day to three shifts per day, and the annual coal output will nearly double that of 1953. Achieving these increased outputs by opening new mines would take at least five years and require a large investment. Now, by expanding on the existing foundation, it will only take two to three years, and the investment will be at least half of that required to open new mines, with the saved investment being roughly equivalent to the capital for building three 50,000-spindle cotton mills.

Upon completion of these expansion projects, the safety and working conditions of the Kailuan Coal Mine workers will also be fundamentally improved. It will completely solve the historically severe problem of poor underground ventilation in the Kailuan Coal Mine, allowing underground miners to receive three cubic meters of air per minute and breathe sufficient fresh air. The entire mine will also basically achieve mechanized coal mining to replace heavy manual labor. The Kailuan Coal Mine inherited an unbalanced and unreasonable production equipment situation from its history. For example, the coal transportation capacity of the underground main roadways, the coal hoisting capacity at the pithead, and the transportation capacity on the ground are all quite large, but the underground ventilation capacity and the production capacity of the coal mining faces are very small, so the transportation potential cannot be fully utilized, production is unsafe, and efficiency is low. Before liberation, each miner underground could only get half a cubic meter of air per minute, and all used very backward manual tools. After liberation, the Kailuan Coal Mine vigorously improved ventilation equipment and carried out mechanization of working faces, but ventilation and working face production capacity still lagged far behind the capacity of the transportation system. The expansion project that began this year is aimed at this situation, and it will make the production capacity of all aspects fully adapted, eliminate the various serious wastes caused by unbalanced and unreasonable equipment, and greatly increase coal production while improving worker safety and labor conditions.

### 开滦煤矿大规模扩建工程开始进行  这些工程完成后，煤产量将比去年提高近一倍

    开滦煤矿大规模扩建工程开始进行
    这些工程完成后，煤产量将比去年提高近一倍
    【新华社唐山九日电】进一步改变开滦煤矿生产面貌的大规模扩建工程已经开始或即将开始了。这些工程包括新建赵各庄矿、林西矿、唐家庄矿、唐山矿的四个风井，赵各庄矿、唐山矿等的三个暗井，林西矿的交通井，以及巷道开拓、地质钻探等重点工程。这些工程除唐山矿的风井准备明年施工以外，全部将在今年春、夏两季陆续兴工；其中赵各庄矿的风井和巷道开拓等工程并已开始兴建。
    开滦煤矿是我国仅次于东北抚顺煤矿的第二个大煤矿，所产工业用煤广销各地。今年动工的这些扩建工程和明年动工的唐山矿风井工程完成后，开滦煤矿就能从现在的每日两班采煤改为每日三班采煤，煤的年产量将比一九五三年提高将近一倍。这些提高的产量，如果用开凿新矿井的办法去实现的话，至少需要五年，而且投资很大；现在在原有的基础上经过扩建，只需两年到三年的时间就够了，而且投资也至少比开凿新井节省一半，节省的投资约等于新建三个五万锭子的纱厂的资金。
    这些扩建工程完成后，还将从根本上改善开滦煤矿职工的安全和劳动条件。它将彻底解决开滦煤矿历史上井下通风严重不良的问题，使井下矿工每分钟能得到三立方公尺的风量，呼吸到充分的新鲜空气。全矿并将基本上实现以机械来代替笨重的手工采煤。开滦煤矿从历史上遗留下来了生产设备不平衡和不合理的状况。如井下大巷的运煤能力，井口提升煤的能力，地面上的运输能力都相当大，但是井下的通风能力和采煤工作面的生产能力却很小，以致运输潜力不能发挥，生产不安全，效率低。解放前，井下每个矿工每分钟只能得到半立方公尺的风量，而且全部使用很落后的手工工具。解放后，开滦煤矿大力改善通风设备，进行工作面机械化，但是通风、工作面生产能力还远远赶不上运输系统的能力。今年开始的扩建工程就是针对这种情况进行的，它将使各方面的生产能力完全达到适应的程度，消灭因设备不平衡不合理而造成的各种严重浪费，而且在改善工人安全和劳动条件的同时，大大提高煤的产量。
