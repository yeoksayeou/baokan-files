With the Support of the State-Owned Economy and Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
The Southwest Region Has Established More Than Two Hundred Handicraft Production Cooperatives
    Over the past three years, the handicraft production cooperatives in the Southwest Region, guided by the principle of "consolidation and improvement, focused development," and under the leadership of the Communist Party committees and the People's Government at all levels, and with the strong support of the state-owned economy and supply and marketing cooperatives, have established 281 handicraft production cooperatives in more than 30 industries, with 10,000 members. Among them, agricultural implement production cooperatives account for 49.82 percent; cotton weaving and knitting cooperatives account for 16.7 percent; and the total output value in 1953 was approximately 150 billion yuan.
    These craftsmen have seen significant development in production and demonstrated the superiority of organization after forming handicraft production cooperatives.
    After being organized into handicraft production cooperatives, the main means of production are owned by all members, changing the old production relations, and greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of the members. In addition, division of labor and cooperation, and the rational organization of labor, have improved labor productivity, saved raw materials, and reduced product costs. For example, the Chengdu Cloth Shoe Cooperative invented a sanding machine, increasing work efficiency tenfold, and reducing the working hours of members from ten to eight hours per day. Due to the increase in production and reduction in costs, the selling price of the cooperative's serge exercise shoes was reduced by 19 percent compared to before. The Sichuan Luzhou Palm Fiber Cooperative invented a fiber-grabbing machine, increasing work efficiency sixfold. On the basis of the continuous improvement of productivity in handicraft production cooperatives, equipment has been improved, and production has been upgraded from handicraft to semi-mechanized and mechanized production. The Chengdu Cloth Shoe Cooperative has only been organized for a little over a year, and the number of members has increased from 42 to 107, and the capital has increased from 1.1 million yuan to 88 million yuan, adding more than 100 pairs of shoe lasts, six machine tools, and a one-horsepower motor as collective property. In addition, weaving, timber, automobile repair and other cooperatives have also changed from using hand tools to semi-mechanized and mechanized production.
    With the strong support of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives through methods such as processing orders, supplying raw materials, and promoting products, handicraft production cooperatives have not only overcome the long-standing difficulties of small sales channels, limited capital, and blind production faced by craftsmen, but also brought handicrafts into the orbit of the national planned economy, making production subordinate to the needs of the state and the people. With the continuous development of production, the material and cultural life of the members has also gradually improved, and they generally participate in political, cultural learning and other social and recreational activities.

    在国营经济和供销合作社的扶持下
    西南区建立了二百多个手工业生产合作社
    三年多来，西南区手工业生产合作社根据“巩固提高、重点发展”的方针，在中共各级党委和人民政府的领导与国营经济和供销合作社的大力扶持下，至目前止，全区已在三十多种行业中建立了二百八十一个手工业生产合作社，社员达一万人。其中农具生产社占百分之四十九点八二；棉织针织社占百分之十六点七；一九五三年的生产总值约为一千五百亿元。
    这些手工业者在组织了手工业生产合作社后，生产有很大发展，显示了组织起来的优越性。
    在组织成手工业生产合作社以后，由于合作社的主要生产工具为全体社员所有，改变了旧的生产关系，社员的生产热情高涨；加之分工协作，合理组织劳动的结果，这就提高了劳动生产率，节省了原料，降低了产品成本。如成都市布鞋社发明了砂边机，提高工作效率十倍，社员的劳动时间从每天十小时减少为八小时。由于产量提高，降低了成本，该社冲服呢操鞋的售价比以前降低了百分之十九，四川泸州市棕丝社发明了抓丝机，提高工作效率六倍。在手工业生产合作社生产率不断提高的基础上，改善了设备，从手工业生产提高到半机械和机械化生产。成都市布鞋社组织起来才一年多，社员已由四十二人发展到一百零七人，资金由一百一十万元增加到八千八百万元，添置了一百多对楦头、六部机车、一部一匹马力的马达等公有财产，此外如织布、木材、汽车修理等社也已经由使用手工工具改为半机械化和机械化生产了。
    手工业生产合作社在国营商业和供销合作社用加工订货、供给原料推销产品等方式大力的扶助下，不但克服了手工业者长期存在的销路小、资金少、盲目生产等困难，且把手工业纳入国家计划经济的轨道，使生产服从于国家和人民的需要。随着生产的不断发展，社员的物质和文化生活也逐步得到改善，一般都参加了政治、文化学习及其他社会文娱活动。
