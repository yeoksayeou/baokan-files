Party Life:

    Shanxi Province's campaign to promote the General Line among farmers was a grand and momentous undertaking. Through the efforts of over a million Party members, cadres, propagandists, and active members of the masses, the General Line's message has been spread far and wide, greatly boosting morale. This has significantly advanced grain procurement, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and various other rural initiatives.

    Starting from mid-November of last year, each county successively convened expanded county Party committee meetings, meetings of Party activists, and people's representative conferences. Short-term training courses were also held for Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and volunteer teachers to disseminate and discuss the Party's General Line for the transition period. Following this, the province, prefectures, and counties dispatched over 25,000 cadres to delve into the villages, where they conducted intensive training for nearly a million Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and non-Party activists by district or township. Each county also convened meetings of Party and non-Party activists to educate them on the General Line. This large contingent of cadres, Party members, and activists became the main force for promoting the General Line among farmers. Simultaneously, Party speakers, propagandists, and other forms of propaganda organizations and tools were mobilized, launching a vigorous propaganda campaign. The results of promoting the General Line have been tremendous: (1) After understanding the General Line and the state's grain purchasing policy, the farmers' awareness greatly increased, and they enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. A patriotic grain-selling fervor swept across various regions, and the province overfulfilled its grain procurement plan. Members of the Changzhi Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm, after studying the General Line, had sold approximately 6,800 *shi* (over 1,020,000 *jin*) of surplus grain to support national construction by the end of last November. The 984 agricultural production cooperatives in Changzhi Prefecture collectively sold over 4 million *jin* of grain. Members of the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong said, "We were content with the amount of grain we received from the cooperative, but after studying the General Line, we realized that we are now transitioning to socialism, and life will be even better under socialism. We must work even harder to support national industrialization." At a meeting of cooperative members held on December 1st for "Patriotic Review Day," the entire membership decided to sell 200,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the state. (2) The capitalist tendencies of some rural Party members, cadres, and the broad masses of farmers were criticized. Everyone clarified the future direction of agricultural development. Before the promotion of the General Line, capitalist tendencies were quite serious in some rural areas, and class differentiation was severe in a few places. In Nancheng Township, a suburb of Taiyuan City, sixteen households sold their land, and another eight wanted to sell their land after the land reform; two households became wealthy by hiring many day laborers. Moreover, capitalist ideology had infiltrated certain Party organizations, and a small number of Party members began to degenerate. In three village branches in Yangqu, many Party members engaged in speculative trading. During the General Line education campaign, this capitalist ideology was criticized, which greatly enhanced the masses' socialist consciousness. The masses in Qianzhai Township, Shuoxian County, said, "If we don't follow Chairman Mao, we'll end up nowhere." Li Zhan'ao, the Party branch secretary of Fanwang Temple Township, had been a long-term farmhand for a landlord before liberation. After the land reform, he turned over and became a cadre. However, his thinking changed as his life improved, and he became less active in his work. This study of the General Line cured his ailment, and now he is very active in his work. (3) The General Line encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation, and many farmers voluntarily signed up to establish agricultural production cooperatives or join mutual aid teams. To date, farmers have requested the establishment of 8,000 new agricultural production cooperatives. More than 6,000 of them have successfully completed their preparatory and organizational work and have been formally established. (4) Through the promotion of the General Line, rural work was reviewed and improved, grassroots Party organizations were consolidated, and the Party's combat effectiveness was enhanced. Some grassroots cadres became very passive after rectifying rash advances and opposing the "five excesses." After studying the General Line, these cadres said, "The General Line's beacon illuminates our path forward; the knots in our hearts have been untied, and we have a solid foundation for doing things." They worked tirelessly and were full of enthusiasm. The appearance of backward villages is also changing. According to statistics from seven counties in Changzhi Prefecture, 83 of the original 137 backward townships have been transformed. (5) In the process of promoting the General Line, the propaganda network was consolidated, and the Party's political work in rural areas was strengthened. After opposing the "five excesses" and merging townships, Party organizations in various regions largely neglected the leadership of the propaganda network. As a result, propaganda work declined for a time. During this large-scale campaign to promote the General Line, Party speakers and propagandists were mobilized to give reports and conduct propaganda among the farmers; reading groups, blackboard newspapers, and other propaganda tools were also activated. Many villages and townships consolidated their propaganda networks through the promotion of the General Line and grain procurement work, enabling propaganda work to become more regular, and the propagandists' ability to promote was also improved. Propagandists reflected, "In the past, when a movement came, the branch would 'sharpen its weapons at the last minute' and simply make arrangements; during work, if people asked questions, we couldn't answer and had to turn away." This time, a method of studying in segments, promoting in segments, promoting as we studied was adopted, and we constantly understood and studied the masses' ideological situation and summarized propaganda experiences. Everyone had methods and high morale. Propagandists said, "Before, we would finish after saying a few words, but now the more we talk, the more we want to say, and the masses love to listen."

    Shanxi Province has gained many relatively successful experiences in promoting the General Line. In summary, the main aspects are as follows:

      (1) To vigorously promote the General Line among the people, it is necessary to have a strong propaganda team that has undergone certain training. At the same time, leading organs must fully supply them with various propaganda materials. Cadres at all levels in Shanxi Province began studying the General Line in mid-November of last year. About 6,000 Party speakers, 220,000 propagandists, and nearly a million cadres and active members of the masses learned the spirit of the General Line relatively deeply and comprehensively after studying, and learned some propaganda methods, becoming a strong propaganda team. Propaganda tools such as blackboard newspapers, loudspeakers, rural theatrical troupes, and radios in many places were fully utilized, allowing the masses to have the opportunity to hear the promotion of the General Line many times.

    During this period, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee continuously supplied various propaganda materials. The Provincial Party Committee issued 30,000 copies of "A Letter to Communist Party Members in Rural Areas Throughout the Province"; the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee also reprinted relevant editorials from the People's Daily and Shanxi Daily, as well as the eight articles published in the People's Daily on "Promoting the General Line to Farmers," as the main teaching materials for current rural branches and study documents for rural work cadres, as well as materials for promoting to farmers. This ensured that the content of this propaganda was rich and correct. At the same time, Shanxi Daily and Farmer Daily successively published speeches on "How to Take the Socialist Road?" Farmer Daily also organized a discussion on "What Road Should Farmers Take?" Shanxi Provincial People's Broadcasting Station held a propaganda month to promote the General Line, which also played a significant role in promoting the General Line.

      (2) Whether the promotion of the General Line can go deep, and even whether the grain procurement work can be completed smoothly, depends on holding successful meetings of Party activists at the county, district, and township levels to clear the thoughts of Party members, Youth League members, propagandists, and activists. Serious ideological struggles were carried out at these meetings in various places. The focus of the debate generally centered on the following aspects: Whether national industrialization is beneficial to farmers, what is wrong with allowing the free development of capitalist tendencies in rural areas, and whether the state's purchase of grain is beneficial to farmers. On these issues, the struggle between the farmers' spontaneous capitalist thoughts and socialist thoughts is the most obvious and sharp. At these meetings, help them to distinguish the boundaries between these two paths. First, repeatedly explain the General Line to everyone, and then conduct discussions. During the discussion process, start by summarizing the achievements of local agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and conduct analysis and criticism through typical examples, historical comparisons, and comparisons of good and bad. For example, at a meeting of Party activists in Wuzhai County, a good and a bad typical example were selected: Lianjiagou Village in Lianjiagou Township. Under the leadership of Party branch secretary Sun Shangqian, 16 of the 18 households in the village participated in the agricultural production cooperative. After three years of mutual aid and cooperation, they embarked on the road to collective prosperity. In the past, the average income per person was 560 *jin* of grain, but now it has increased to 1,200 *jin*. In the past, eight households in the village lacked grain. Now these grain-deficient households have become surplus grain households. The whole village has a total of 24,000 *jin* of surplus grain and 11 million yuan in bank deposits. On the contrary, the Party members of Duijiu Ping Village in this township not only did not lead the masses to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, but even engaged in speculative trading, resulting in serious class differentiation in the village. Many households sold their houses and land. In this way, no one can guarantee that they will not go bankrupt in a few years. After this comparison, everyone woke up and said, "We must take the road of Lianjiagou and not the road of Duijiu Ping." Many counties have adopted this method of comparing good and bad typical examples, and the results have been extremely significant. From this kind of comparison, it is not only easy to make everyone recognize the danger of taking the capitalist road, but also easy to guide them from the practice of implementing the Party's General Line in the past four years to calculate the benefits of national industrialization and price stability to the development of rural mutual aid and cooperation. Each county, in accordance with the People's Daily editorial of November 15, 1953: "Help Farmers Calculate Three Accounts," and the Shanxi Daily editorial of November 21, 1953: "In the Current Rural Work, Communist Party Members Must Clarify Three Questions," used local specific examples to enlighten everyone to calculate the three accounts clearly, and clarify whether there is an enthusiasm for taking the socialist road among the peasant masses at present, whether the gradual realization of socialist industrialization of the country is beneficial to the peasants, and who benefits from the state's grain procurement and why the state's grain procurement can promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, etc. Thus, the county, district, and township Party members, cadres, and activists greatly improved their understanding of the General Line, and clarified the correct relationship between the state and the individual, industry and agriculture, urban and rural areas, and the present and the future. Ren Qingzhu, a Party member of Yin Di Township, Huoxian County, used grain to lend at high interest rates and hired long-term farmhands. In September of last year, the Party branch held a meeting to ask him to immediately dismiss the long-term farmhands and stop the act of lending grain at high interest rates. At that time, although he implemented the decision of the branch, his thinking was not clear. He thought, "I am willing to lend grain for profit, and he is willing to borrow money and pay interest; I am willing to pay money to hire people, and he is willing to sell his labor as a long-term farmhand. What's wrong with that?" After the boundaries between the two roads were clarified at this meeting of Party activists, he burst into tears, made a painful review, expressed his determination to change his ways, become a good Party member again, and sell all the surplus grain to the state. In the process of educating cadres and activists in various places, on the one hand, model figures in implementing the General Line and patriotic grain sales were commended and rewarded, and on the other hand, prominent bad people and bad deeds were seriously dealt with, in order to promote the positive factors in Party members and cadres and overcome negative factors.

      (3) According to the farmers' personal experiences, use methods such as recalling, comparing, and calculating accounts to enable the farmers to draw a clear line between bourgeois ideology and socialist ideology. Various places have created many effective propaganda methods in these aspects. Many places use the method of enlightening farmers to dig out the root of why the majority of people cannot become rich, and calculating how landlords and profiteers get rich to connect the farmers' personal experiences with the struggle between the two roads. By digging out the root of poverty, farmers know that the small-scale peasant economy is unstable, so "in the past, I always wanted to get rich, but in the end, I was still a long-term farmhand"; by digging out the root of poverty, farmers saw the facts of class differentiation caused by not taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation in some places, and thus suddenly realized the danger of not taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation. Wang Zhenxing, a farmer in Wanjin Bridge, Huairen County, said, "Eight middle-peasant households in our village went bankrupt and sold their land to become hired workers, but one household bought land and lent money. In this way, no one can guarantee that they will not go bankrupt in a few years." At the same time, various places also compared the production of local agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers, so that the masses understood that the more socialist factors there are, the more production and income can be increased. From calculating the account of how landlords and profiteers get rich, the masses understood that grain is the main means by which landlords and profiteers exploit farmers. If grain is not purchased by the state, the masses will suffer endless losses. Many Party members and masses understood that selling surplus grain to the state is to block the mouth of capitalism, and participating in mutual aid and cooperation is to open the road to socialism. Some places enlighten farmers to conduct comparisons and calculations in many aspects, so that the masses understand the relationship between national industrialization and the development of agricultural production. Some farmers said, "With heavy industry, there is national defense, like building a wall in the yard, not afraid of foxes or wolves," "With heavy industry, there can be tractors. Without industrialization, we will always be carrying poles and donkeys." The vast majority of farmers expressed that they want to increase grain production and use grain and agricultural products to support industrial construction. The farmers' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance has also been further improved.

      (4) Find out the masses' ideological concerns and conduct timely propaganda and education targeted at the main problems. At the beginning of the work of the Kuangcun Township Branch of the Communist Party of Xin County, the first thing it did was to collect and study the ideological situation of the masses, and found that some farmers mistakenly thought that "the state's purchase of grain is a second public grain levy," and small vendors and those who grow economic crops are afraid that they will not be able to buy grain to eat. In response to these ideas, the branch first carried out education on the General Line in various grassroots organizations, and imparted the content of propaganda to the propagandists. The propagandists used individual talks, small-scale forums, blackboard newspapers, and winter schools to carry out propaganda to the masses and eliminate the masses' ideological concerns. Then the branch found that the well-to-do middle peasants had many ideological concerns, misunderstood the policy and were unwilling to sell grain, etc., so the branch organized propagandists to have individual talks with them to clear their thoughts. For example, Ge Qingliang, a well-to-do middle peasant, had a lot of surplus grain at home, and this year's vegetables were also a bumper harvest. His three sons were all working in factories, and their annual income was not small, but he repeatedly said that he was unwilling to sell surplus grain. Propagandist Wang Qiaoquan helped him calculate the account of the bumper harvest of vegetables, and calculated that without fertilizer, the vegetables could not have such a harvest; at the same time, he explained that his son was also a worker, and workers could not produce without food, and industry could not support agriculture. After repeated explanations, Ge Qingliang was willing to sell grain to the state.

    Although the promotion and implementation of the General Line has achieved the above results and some experience, there are still some problems, mainly: (1) Some places have had a partial tendency in the content of propaganda. For example, the propaganda was limited to the grain purchase task, and the comprehensive content of the General Line was not sufficiently promoted. (2) The propaganda in some places was too simple and essentially became coercion and command. For example, telling the peasants, "If you don't sell surplus grain, you want to exploit people," "If you are willing to take the big end or the small end, you are willing to sell surplus grain if you take the big end."
  (3) This propaganda paid attention to the whole Party's participation, but some places did not combine it with the rectification of the propaganda network to prepare for the regularization of the General Line propaganda. Especially recently, the counties and townships have produced "breathe a sigh of relief" and "take a break" thoughts to varying degrees. Therefore, the General Line propaganda in some places has shown a decline. To this end, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee issued the "Plan on Continuing to Deepen the Study and Propaganda of the Party's General Line in the Transition Period in the Province in the First Quarter of 1954 (January to March)" requiring all localities to continue to deeply promote the General Line to the farmers around mutual aid and cooperation and other work on the basis of the current large-scale promotion of the General Line.

    山西省对农民群众进行总路线宣传教育的经验
    张久成
    山西省这次向农民宣传总路线的工作规模壮阔声势浩大。经过了上百万的党员、干部、宣传员以及群众的积极分子的努力。总路线的宣传已经做到了家喻户晓振奋人心，因而大大推动了粮食收购工作、互助合作运动以及其他各种农村工作。
    从去年十一月中旬起，各县相继召开县委扩大会议、党的活动分子会议和人民代表会议，以及在党员、团员、宣传员和义务教员等短期训练班，传达与讨论了党在过渡时期的总路线。紧接着省、专区、县三级派出二万五千余名干部深入乡村，按区或乡集训了近百万的党员、团员、宣传员及非党积极分子。各县也都召集了党内外积极分子会议，进行总路线教育。这一大批干部、党员、积极分子就成了向农民宣传总路线的主要骨干。同时，党的报告员、宣传员以及其他宣传组织形式、宣传工具都一齐出动，大张旗鼓地展开了宣传活动。宣传总路线的收效是极其巨大的：（一）农民群众懂得了总路线和国家的购粮政策后，觉悟大大提高，纷纷把余粮卖给国家。各地掀起了爱国售粮热潮，全省超额完成了收购粮食的计划。长治中苏友好集体农庄庄员学习了总路线，到去年十一月底全庄已出卖余粮约六千八百石（合一百零二万余斤），支援国家建设。长治专区九百八十四个农业生产合作社，集体售粮四百多万斤。大同陈家庄农业生产合作社社员们说：“咱从社内分了不少粮食便满足起来了，学习了总路线，才知道现在正向社会主义过渡，过渡到社会主义，生活就更幸福。这可得更加劲生产，支援国家工业化。”全体社员在去年十二月一日过“爱国检查日”时举行的社员大会上，决定把二十万斤余粮卖给国家。（二）批判了有些农村党员、干部和广大农民群众的资本主义思想。大家明确了今后农业发展方向。在宣传总路线以前，农村中有些地方资本主义思想相当严重，个别地方的阶级分化也很厉害。太原市郊区南城营乡土地改革以后，有十六户卖地，还有八户要卖地；有两户发了财雇零工很多。而且资本主义思想已经侵袭到某些党组织内，有少数党员开始蜕化变质。阳曲三个村支部就有不少的党员做投机买卖。在进行总路线教育时，就对这种资本主义思想进行了批判，这就大大提高了群众的社会主义觉悟。朔县前寨乡的群众说：“不跟毛主席走，到那也是墙头。”范网寺乡支部书记李占鳌，解放前给地主当长工，土地改革后翻了身，当了干部。可是，生活上升后，思想起了变化，工作不积极了。这次学习总路线，把他的病根给治好了，现在工作非常积极。（三）总路线鼓舞了农民的互助合作积极性，许多农民自动报名建立农业生产合作社或参加互助组。到目前为止，农民要求新建的农业生产合作社已达八千个。其中有六千多个已经胜利完成了酝酿和组织工作，正式建立起来。（四）经过总路线的宣传，检查改进了农村工作，整顿了党的基层组织，提高了党的战斗力。纠正冒进和反“五多”后有些基层干部工作很消极。学习了总路线后，这些干部说：“总路线灯塔照亮了我们前进的道路，心坎上的疙瘩解开了，做事也有了底了。”他们在工作中不辞劳苦，情绪非常饱满。落后村的面貌也在改变着。据长治专区七个县统计，原有一百三十七个落后乡，现在有八十三个改变好了。（五）在宣传总路线的过程中，整顿了宣传网，加强了党在农村中的政治工作。反“五多”和划乡后，各地党组织大都忽视了对宣传网工作的领导。因而宣传工作曾一度消沉下来。这次大张旗鼓宣传总路线过程中，党的报告员和宣传员都出动向农民群众作了报告和进行宣传；读报组、黑板报等各种宣传工具也都活跃起来了；不少乡村通过宣传总路线和购粮工作整顿了宣传网，使宣传工作经常起来，宣传员的宣传能力因而也提高了。宣传员反映：“过去运动来时，支部‘临阵磨枪’简单布置一下；工作中，人家一问，咱们张嘴说不出来，只有扭头走。”这次宣传中采用了分段学，分段宣传，就学就宣传的办法，并且随时了解、研究群众思想情况和总结宣传经验，大家有了办法，情绪很高。宣传员说：“以前说几句就完了，现在越说越想说，群众也爱听。”
    山西省在宣传总路线中，取得了很多比较成功的经验，综合起来，主要有以下几个方面：
      （一）向人民群众大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，首先要有一支经过一定训练的强大的宣传队伍。同时领导机关要充分供给其各种宣传资料。山西省各级干部在去年十一月中旬就开始学习总路线。全省约六千余名党的报告员、二十二万宣传员以及近百万的干部和群众中的积极分子等，经过学习都比较深刻、全面地了解了总路线的精神，并且学会了一些宣传方法，成为一支强大的宣传队伍。许多地方的黑板报、广播筒、农村剧团、收音机等宣传工具都被充分地运用起来，使群众能有机会多次听到总路线的宣传。
    山西省委在这一期间源源供给了各种宣传资料，省委印发了三万份“给全省农村共产党员的一封信”；省委宣传部并翻印了人民日报和山西日报有关的社论，以及人民日报发表的“向农民宣传总路线”的八篇文章，作为当前农村支部的主要教材和农村工作干部的学习文件，以及向农民进行宣传的资料。这就保证了这次宣传的内容丰富、正确。同时山西日报和农民报又连续发表了“关于怎样走社会主义的路？”的讲话；农民报并组织了“农民应当走什么道路”的讨论。山西省人民广播电台举办了宣传总路线的广播月，这对宣传总路线也都起到重大的作用。
      （二）总路线的宣传能否深入，以至粮食收购工作能否顺利完成，关键在于开好县、区、乡党的活动分子会议，打通党员、团员、宣传员和积极分子的思想。各地在这些会议上都开展了严重的思想斗争。争论的焦点一般都集中在以下几个方面：国家工业化对农民是否有利、听任农村中的资本主义倾向自由发展有什么不好，以及国家收购粮食对农民是否有利等。在这些问题上，反映农民自发的资本主义思想与社会主义思想的斗争是最明显最尖锐的。在这些会议上，要帮助他们划清这两条道路的界限。首先要向大家反复讲解总路线，而后进行讨论，在讨论过程中，从总结当地农业生产和互助合作运动的成绩入手，通过典型事例，历史对比，好坏对比等方法进行分析批判。如五寨县在党的活动分子会议上，选择了一好一坏的典型事例：连家沟乡连家沟村，在党支部书记孙尚谦的领导下，全村十八户中，有十六户参加了农业生产合作社，经过三年互助合作，走上了集体富裕的道路，过去每人平均收入五百六十斤粮食，现在提高到一千二百斤。全村原有八户缺粮。现在这些缺粮户都变成了余粮户。全村共有余粮二万四千斤，在银行存款一千一百万元。相反的，这个乡的碓臼坪村的党员不仅没有领导群众走互助合作道路，甚至还做投机卖买，以致这个村发生了严重的阶级分化，许多户出卖房子，出卖土地。经过这样对比后，大家都惊醒起来，表示“要走连家沟的路不走碓臼坪的路”。许多县都采取了这种好坏典型的对比方法，收效都极为显著。从这样的对比中，不仅容易使大家认清走资本主义道路的危险性，也容易引导他们从四年来贯彻党的总路线的实践中，算清国家工业化和物价稳定对农村互助合作发展生产的好处。各县都根据一九五三年十一月十五日人民日报社论：“帮农民算三笔账”，和一九五三年十一月二十一日山西日报社论：“在当前农村工作中共产党员必须弄清楚三个问题”的精神，用当地具体事例，启发大家算清了三笔账，弄清了目前在农民群众中有没有走社会主义道路的积极性、国家逐步实现社会主义工业化对农民是否有利、和国家收购粮食对谁有利以及为什么国家收购粮食可以促进互助合作运动的发展等问题。从而大大提高了县、区、乡党员干部和积极分子对总路线的认识，明确了国家与个人、工业与农业、城市与乡村、目前与将来的正确关系。霍县阴底乡党员任庆祝，用粮食放高利贷、雇长工。去年九月，党支部开会要他立即解雇长工和停止放高利贷行为，那时他虽然执行了支部的决定，但思想不通，认为“我愿放粮得利，他愿借债负息；我愿出钱雇人，他愿卖力当长工，这有什么不可以呢。”这次在党的活动分子会议上，划清了两条道路的界限之后，他痛哭流涕，作了沉痛的检讨，表示决心改过，重新作个好党员，并将全部余粮卖给国家。各地在对干部积极分子进行教育的过程中，一方面表扬与奖励了执行总路线和爱国售粮中的模范人物，另一方面又严肃处理了突出的坏人坏事，以发扬党员干部中的积极因素，克服消极因素。
      （三）根据农民的切身经历，运用回忆、对比、算账等方法，使农民划清资产阶级思想和社会主义思想的界限，各地在这些方面创造了很多有效的宣传方法。许多地方用启发农民挖多数人富裕不了的根、算地主奸商怎样发财的办法，把农民的亲身经历和两条道路的斗争联系起来。通过挖穷根，农民们知道了小农经济就是不稳定的，所以“过去老想富，结果除了当长工还是当长工”；通过挖穷根，使农民们看清了有些地方不走互助合作道路而引起的阶级分化的事实，因而恍然大悟，懂得了不走互助合作道路的危险。怀仁县万金桥农民王振兴说：“我村八户中农破产卖地当了雇工，有一户却买地、放账，这样，再过几年谁也保不住要破产。”同时，各地还把当地农业生产合作社、互助组和单干农民的生产作了对比，使群众了解了社会主义因素越多，越能增加生产增加收入。从算地主奸商怎样发财这笔账中，群众懂得了粮食是地主奸商剥削农民的主要手段，粮食如果不由国家收购，群众就有吃不尽的亏。不少党员、群众明白了把余粮卖给国家就是堵资本主义的口，参加互助合作是开社会主义的路。有些地方启发农民从多方面进行对比算账，使群众认识了国家工业化和发展农业生产的关系。有些农民说：“有了重工业就有了国防，像院里筑了围墙，不怕狐狸不怕狼”，“有了重工业才能有拖拉机，不工业化我们永远是扁担、毛驴”。绝大多数农民表示要增产粮食，用粮食和农产品来支援工业建设。农民们对工农联盟的认识也进一步提高了。
      （四）摸清群众思想顾虑，针对主要问题及时进行宣传教育。中共忻县匡村乡支部工作一开始，就首先搜集与研究了群众的思想情况，发现有
  一部分农民误认为“国家收购粮食是征第二次公粮”，肩挑小贩和种经济作物的怕买不到粮食吃。支部针对这些思想，首先在各基层组织进行了总路线的教育，并给宣传员传授了宣传内容，宣传员运用个别谈话、小型座谈会，黑板报和冬学等方式向群众展开宣传，解除群众的思想顾虑。接着支部又发现富裕中农的思想顾虑很多，对政策有误解不愿卖粮等，支部便组织宣传员分别和他们进行个别谈话打通思想。如富裕中农葛清亮家里的余粮很多，今年的蔬菜又丰收，三个儿子都在工厂做工，每年的收入不少，但一再表示不愿意卖余粮。宣传员王巧全，帮助他算了一下蔬菜丰收的账，算出了没有肥田粉，蔬菜就不可能有这样的收成；同时说明他儿子也是工人，工人没饭吃就不能生产，工业就不能支援农业了。经过反复的讲解后，葛清亮愿意把粮食卖给国家。
    这次宣传贯彻总路线虽已取得以上成绩与一些经验，但还存在一些问题，主要是：（一）有些地方在宣传内容方面曾发生了片面性的偏向。如在宣传中只局限于购粮任务，对总路线的全面内容宣传不够。（二）有些地方的宣传过分简单，实质上成了强迫命令，比如向农民讲：“不卖余粮是想剥削人”，“你愿冒大尖冒小尖，愿冒大尖就卖余粮”。
  （三）此次宣传注意了全党动手，但是有些地方没有结合整顿宣传网，为总路线宣传的经常化进行准备。特别是最近各县各乡已轻重不同地产生了“松口气”、“歇一歇”思想。因此有些地方的总路线宣传已呈现消沉现象。为此，山西省委发布了“关于一九五四年第一季度（一月至三月）在全省继续深入党在过渡时期总路线的学习和宣传计划”要求各地在目前大张旗鼓宣传总路线的基础上，围绕互助合作及其他工作继续深入地向农民宣传总路线。
