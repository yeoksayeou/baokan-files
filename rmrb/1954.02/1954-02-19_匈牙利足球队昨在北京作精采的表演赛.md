Hungarian Football Team Gives a Brilliant Exhibition Match in Beijing Yesterday

　　On the 18th, the Hungarian National Football Mixed Team gave a brilliant exhibition match. More than 20,000 spectators in the stands of the Xiannongtan Stadium were captivated by the Hungarian team's outstanding and wonderful football skills from beginning to end.

　　The exhibition match was conducted by Hungarian team members divided into Red and White teams. Li Chaogui, a member of the Central Sports Academy football team, was invited to participate in the Red team's performance, serving as the right inside forward. The chief referee was Titekos Pál, the coach of the Hungarian team, a veteran football player who had been selected as a national player more than 40 times. As a result of the exhibition match, the White team won 4-1.

　　In the exhibition match, both teams adopted advanced tactics of all-out offense and all-out defense. During the attack, the two center backs and five forwards used triangular short passes and cross-passes to cut into the opponent's defense from both wings. In defense, the two inside forwards also returned to block the opponent's forwards' attack. The team's movements were coordinated, and every pass was received by someone, with very few mistakes.

　　This exhibition match was full of highlights, and the audience applauded continuously. The Hungarian team's accurate short passes, the players' flexible positioning, wonderful feints, and the technique of stopping the ball with the instep of the foot left a deeper impression on the audience in the capital during this exhibition match. The White team's center forward, Susa, is the main player of the Hungarian team. His basic movements such as dribbling, carrying the ball, passing, stopping the ball, and intercepting the ball have reached a high level. His long-range shots are powerful and forceful, and his close-range shots are alert and composed. In the exhibition match, he scored two goals alone. One goal was scored when the opposing goalkeeper rushed out to save the ball, and he lightly and beautifully chipped the ball into the net. The other goal was a volley from a sharp ball about two feet high passed from the mid-left side. The audience was very interested in every movement of Susa. Kish, the right inside forward of the White team, showed amazing sprinting ability. He also scored two goals in this exhibition match. One of them was a header after breaking through the Red team's defense with a high-speed central insertion, receiving a half-high ball from the left wing. The goalkeepers of the two teams, Durai and Zhu Pesti, performed with a high degree of resourcefulness and decisiveness. They won warm applause from the audience with their wonderful actions such as lying down to save, jumping to save, rushing to grab, and tumbling. The Hungarian team members' proficiency in using headers also made the audience praise them. In the second half of the exhibition match, the White team's goalkeeper rushed out to save a dangerous ball, but failed to catch it firmly. Li Chaogui, the right inside forward of the Red team, took advantage of the goalkeeper's failure to return to defense and quickly headed the ball. The audience thought that this ball would definitely go in. Who knew that Jan Kovács, the White team's defender, had cleverly run to the goalkeeper's position and headed the ball back into a corner kick. The audience gave warm applause to this unexpected and wonderful performance.

　　In the viewing area, in addition to the teams participating in the friendly matches in Beijing, there were also football players from North China and Inner Mongolia. They carefully observed and studied every movement of the Hungarian team members with all their attention, as examples for their own learning.

　　At the end of the match, the audience thanked the Hungarian team for their wonderful performance with warm and lasting applause. (Xinhua News Agency)

    匈牙利足球队昨在北京作精采的表演赛
    十八日匈牙利国家足球混合队作了精采的表演赛。在先农坛体育场看台上的两万多观众，自始至终都紧紧地被匈牙利队卓越而美妙的足球技术所吸引。
    表演赛是由匈牙利队队员分成红白两队进行的。我中央体育学院足球队队员李朝贵应邀参加红队表演，担任右内锋。总裁判是匈牙利队的教练蒂特科什·帕尔，他是一位曾经四十多次当选为国家选手的足球老将。表演赛结果，白队以四比一获胜。
    表演赛中，两队都采取全面进攻全面防守的先进战术。进攻时，两中卫与五前锋用三角短传和交叉互传，从两翼切入对方防线。防守时，两内锋也回师阻遏对方前锋的进攻。全队动作协调一致，每传出一球，一定有人接应，极少失误。
    这一场表演赛，精采百出，观众掌声不绝。匈牙利队准确的短传，队员们跑位的灵活，美妙的假动作和用脚背停球的技术，在这一场表演赛中，给首都观众留下了更深刻的印象。白队中锋苏查是匈牙利队主力，他的盘球、带球、传球、停球、截球等基本动作达到高度水平，远射球疾劲有力，近射球机警从容。表演赛中，他一人攻进两球。一球是乘对方守门员冲出扑球时，以轻松美妙的姿态，将球高挑入网。一球是将中左侧传来约二英尺高的急球，悬空射中。观众对苏查的每一动作都感到很大的兴趣。白队右内锋基什，表现出惊人的冲刺能力。他在这场表演赛中也独进两球。其中有一球是利用高速度的中央插进，突破红队防线，接应左翼传来半高球，用头攻入。两队守门员杜拉伊和朱·佩斯蒂的表演表现了高度的机智果断。他们以卧扑、跃救、冲抢、翻滚等精采动作赢得观众热烈喝采。匈牙利队队员运用头球之熟练，也使观众赞美不已。下半时表演赛中，白队守门员冲出抢救一险球，没有抓牢，红队右内锋李朝贵利用守门员不及回防的空隙，迅速用头球攻门，观众们都以为这球必进无疑。谁知白队后卫扬·科瓦奇已机智地跑到守门员的位置上，用头将球还击成角球。四周观众对这一出人意料、美妙无比的精采表演报以热烈掌声。
    在观摩席上的我国足球运动员，除了参加在京各场友谊比赛的各队外，还有华北和内蒙的足球运动员们。他们全神贯注地细致观察和研究匈牙利队队员的每一动作，作为自己的学习榜样。
    终场时，观众们以热烈的、经久不息的掌声感谢匈牙利队的精采表演。　　（新华社）
