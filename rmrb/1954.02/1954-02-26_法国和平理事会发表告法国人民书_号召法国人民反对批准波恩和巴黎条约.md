    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 25th: TASS, Paris, February 24th: "l'Humanité" published a letter to the French people from the Standing Committee of the French National Peace Council. It pointed out: The Berlin Conference is a new step towards easing international tensions. The plan to establish a military alliance with an armed Germany is a threat to peace. Only by taking into account the fundamental interests of France and the security of other European countries can the German question be resolved peacefully. Only by rejecting the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty will it be possible for the four countries to resume negotiations more quickly and find a solution acceptable to everyone.
    The National Peace Council calls on all French people to openly express their views on this issue, so that parliamentarians will take these views into account when they finally vote for or against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris Treaties.
    "l'Humanité" also published a resolution of the National Committee of the French Veterans Union. This organization called on French citizens to demand that parliamentarians "clearly state their attitude towards the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, that is, to refuse to ratify these two treaties. If these two treaties are ratified, it will mean the loss of our national independence and a fatal danger to our country."

    法国和平理事会发表告法国人民书
    号召法国人民反对批准波恩和巴黎条约
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国全国和平理事会常设委员会的告法国人民书。其中指出：柏林会议是向缓和国际紧张局势迈进的新的一步。建立一个有武装起来的德国参加的军事联盟的计划，是对和平的威胁。只有考虑到法国的根本利益和欧洲其他各国的安全，通过和平方式，德国问题才能解决。只有拒绝波恩条约和巴黎条约，才有可能使四国更快地再度举行谈判并找出大家都可以接受的解决办法。
    全国和平理事会号召全体法国人对这个问题公开表示自己的意见，好使议会议员在他们要最后表示赞成或是反对批准波恩条约和巴黎条约时考虑到这些意见。
    “人道报”还刊载了法兰西退伍军人联盟全国委员会的决议。这个组织呼吁法国公民们要求议会议员“对波恩条约和巴黎条约明确表示态度，就是要拒绝批准这两个条约。如果批准了这两个条约，那就意味着我国独立的丧失，并且是对我国的致命危险。”
