    To Implement the General Line, We Must Adhere to the Principle of the Party's Unified Leadership
    Xǔ Bāngyí
    Our Party has clearly presented the general line and general task for the country during the transition period to the people of the whole country. In order to realize the Party's general line, the Party's leadership role becomes increasingly important today. The new historical period and new historical tasks urgently require the Party's organizations to continuously improve the level of leadership, and more strictly adhere to the principle of the Party's unified leadership.
    The unity and collectivity of the Party's leadership is an important principle in Lenin and Stalin's theory of Party building. Our Party, based on Lenin and Stalin's thinking on Party building, has always adhered to the Party's unified leadership. Our Party Constitution stipulates in its General Program: "The Communist Party of China is organized according to the principle of democratic centralism and is a unified fighting organization linked by conscious discipline that all members must abide by. The strength of the Communist Party of China lies in its strong unity, unified will, and consistent action. No behavior that deviates from the Party's program and constitution is allowed within the Party, nor can acts that undermine Party discipline, seek independence from the Party, engage in small group activities, or practice double-dealing be tolerated. The Communist Party of China must always pay attention to removing from its ranks those who undermine the Party's program and constitution, Party discipline, and cannot correct themselves." In the Party Central Committee's directives and in Comrade Mao Zedong's related works, the importance of the Party's unified will, unified discipline, and centralized leadership has been repeatedly emphasized. This is one of the decisive conditions for our Party to lead the Chinese revolution to victory.
    Today, our Party has become the ruling party leading the national regime; our country has entered a new period of large-scale planned economic construction. The tasks we face are arduous. In our practical work, we will encounter many unfamiliar new things and will inevitably encounter many difficulties. In the process of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, we must also engage in various forms of serious struggle. Therefore, in today's situation, we must further emphasize the Party's unified leadership in order to unite the whole Party to implement the general line of the transition period and avoid rightist or "leftist" errors.
    To adhere to the principle of the Party's unified leadership, we must resolutely oppose and resist decentralism. Many facts show that decentralism is a scourge in national construction. Some functional departments in organizations at all levels tend to overemphasize the work of their own departments and the leadership of vertical systems, assigning tasks to lower levels independently and arbitrarily, without unified arrangements, without distinguishing between priorities and urgency, or between major and minor tasks, resulting in "everyone being a superior and everything being the center," which affects the completion of central tasks. The "five excesses" phenomenon revealed in various places during work inspections not long ago is a product of this decentralism. There are also individual leading comrades in certain departments who do not submit major issues related to Party policies and the vital interests of the people to the Party organization for discussion, nor do they ask for instructions from higher Party committees, but self-righteously act arbitrarily, resulting in serious errors.
    Comrades who suffer from decentralism often cannot correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the Party, nor can they correctly handle the relationship between lower and upper levels, or between the part and the whole. They mistakenly equate the individual with the Party organization, even placing themselves above the Party organization; they also mistakenly equate lower-level organizations with higher-level organizations, failing to recognize the relationship of being led and leading; they also mistakenly separate the part from the whole, even attempting to make the interests of the whole subordinate to the interests of the part. Precisely because of the one-sidedness in their thinking methods and the individualism in their ideology, they are bound to make decentralist errors in their practical work.
    Comrades who suffer from decentralism often ignore the principle that "the Party is the highest form of class organization of the proletariat." They mistakenly equate political power organizations or mass organizations with the Party, failing to recognize that the Party is the leading core of all mass organizations and political power organizations. The Party must guide and supervise the work of these organizations to ensure the effective implementation of the state's general line.
    Decentralism is undoubtedly incompatible with the principle of the Party's unified leadership and is incompatible with Leninism. It is one of the ideological enemies of implementing the general line. The existence of decentralism in the Party organization will weaken the Party's strength and prevent the implementation of the Party's line and policies.
    To overcome decentralism, we must adhere to the principle of the Party's unified leadership and strictly implement the provisions of the Party Constitution regarding "the individual member of the Party is subordinate to the Party organization to which he belongs, the minority is subordinate to the majority, the lower-level organization is subordinate to the higher-level organization, and the part is uniformly subordinate to the Central Committee."
    One point that needs to be particularly emphasized here is that the entire Party must uniformly obey the leadership of the Central Committee. The Party Central Committee is the head and heart of the Party, the command post of the entire Party. The Party Central Committee concentrates the most outstanding and experienced leaders of the entire Party, and all the wisdom of the Party is concentrated in the Party Central Committee. At present, we need even more to unify all possible and necessary powers under the leadership of the Central Committee, preventing any phenomenon of decentralized power. Unified action under the will of the Party Central Committee is the guarantee for implementing the general line.
    In the cause of national construction, adhering to the principle of the Party's unified leadership and overcoming decentralism should also emphasize doing everything in accordance with the national plan. The national plan is formulated under the unified will of the Party Central Committee. It is the concentrated expression of the long-term and supreme interests of all the people, and also the program of action for the people of the whole country. Undermining the national plan undermines the unity of the Party's leadership. Precisely for this reason, we should greatly promote the spirit of considering the overall situation and obeying the whole within our Party, and oppose the narrow tendency of departmentalism. For example, our country's first five-year construction plan centers on the development of heavy industry, with the 141 large-scale projects aided by the Soviet government as the key. We must grasp this decisive main link, concentrate a large number of outstanding cadres and huge amounts of funds and various construction forces to support the construction of these 141 projects. If someone does not act in accordance with the national plan, engages in decentralism and departmentalism, unilaterally emphasizes the importance of the work of their own department, and only asks the Party and the state to give them more outstanding cadres and allocate more funds, while being unwilling to draw more and better cadres to strengthen other more important departments, this will inevitably cause adverse effects on the national construction cause and delay the progress of national construction. Although these people say they support the state's general line in words, they actually hinder the implementation of the state's general line. Comrade Mao Zedong made a very pertinent criticism of departmentalists in the article "Rectify the Party's Style of Work." He pointed out: "We must oppose the tendency of departmentalism, which only cares about oneself and not others. Anyone who does not care about the difficulties of others, refuses to transfer cadres under his jurisdiction when others need them, or sends bad people to others, ‘digging one's neighbor's well to irrigate one's own field,’ and does not think about other departments, other places, or other people, is called a departmentalist. This is a complete loss of the communist spirit."
    In order to adhere to the principle of the Party's unified leadership, it is necessary to further promote democracy within the Party, conscientiously improve the Party committee system, and implement the Party's collective leadership.
    The Party's unified leadership does not negate democracy within the Party, and the Party's centralism is built on the basis of democracy. If democracy within the Party is undermined, it will be impossible to realize the Party's unified leadership in name and in fact. The Party's centralism and the Party's democracy are in a dialectical relationship. The essence of democracy within the Party is to improve the enthusiasm of Party members and the masses, and to consolidate Party discipline and unity. At present, promoting democracy within the Party, giving full play to the high initiative and creativity of Party members, and enhancing Party members' sense of responsibility for the Party's cause are of particular importance for consolidating Party unity and completing the state's general line and general task during the transition period. We know that all of the Party's achievements rely on the collective strength of Party members and the masses. Therefore, the Party always requires its members to attach importance to the Party's collective leadership and oppose the idealistic view of blindly worshiping individuals. It is impossible to imagine that the state's general line and general task during the transition period can be realized without relying on collective strength and wisdom.
    To promote democracy within the Party and ensure the collectivity of the Party's leadership, it is necessary to conscientiously improve the Party committee system. All important work plans, instructions, decisions, etc., should be collectively discussed and approved by the Party committee. No individual or small number of people are allowed to decide important issues casually. In any Party organization, no matter how capable and knowledgeable the leader is, he cannot replace the collective wisdom and experience. Only by adopting the method of collective leadership and pooling the wisdom of the masses can we effectively give play to the initiative and enthusiasm of Party members and cadres. Practical life has fully proven that any individual or small number of people who decide issues casually may cause major errors. As Comrade Stalin said: "Individual decisions are always, or almost always, one-sided. In every committee, in every collective organization, there are people who can express worthwhile opinions. In every committee, in every collective organization, there are people who can express erroneous opinions. Based on the experience of three revolutions, we know that among a hundred individual decisions that have not been collectively reviewed and collectively revised, almost ninety are one-sided." (Stalin: "Conversation with the German writer Ludwig")
    We have some leaders who often violate the principle of collective leadership. Some individual Party committee secretaries often place themselves above the Party committee, unsupervised by the Party, failing to report their work to the Party committee, and refusing to accept criticism from others; some Party committee members do not care about the entire work of the Party organization, but only want to "handle things alone," and do not submit some major issues in their work to the Party committee for discussion before deciding on their own; there are also some Party committees that relax unified leadership over the work of government departments and mass organizations, using the excuse of not understanding the business to allow these departments to "go their own way"; and some leading personnel of business departments think that the Party committee does not understand the business, so they individually take over the work of a certain department; these are all manifestations of undermining the Party committee system and violating the principle of collective leadership.
    We must recognize that in the transition period, continuing to strengthen the Party's supervision over all departments and every Communist Party member (no matter how "special" this department is, or how high the position of this Party member is) is one of the keys to ensuring the implementation of the general line. The Party must supervise any department and any Party member to see if they are working in accordance with the general line, and whether they have deviated from or even violated the general line. As long as there is a slight deviation from the general line, the Party must correct it. Experience has shown that wherever there is no or a lack of Party supervision, there will be a departure from the general line, and right-leaning or "left-leaning" errors will be made.
    Some people think that "emphasizing the Party's unified leadership will make things difficult to handle." This is incorrect. The work of national construction is complex and complicated, requiring cooperation and coordination from all parties. The fact is that things are easier to handle when they are unified; the less unified, the more difficult things are to handle.
    "Will emphasizing the Party's unified leadership hinder the initiative and creativity of Party members and cadres?" No, it won't. Communist Party members should develop initiative and creativity in accordance with the Party's general line and under the Party's unified leadership. The Party encourages and supports this initiative and enthusiasm at all times. The Party Constitution stipulates: "Party members and Party organizations who demonstrate that they are completely loyal to the cause of the Party and the people in their work, are models of observing the discipline of the Party and the revolutionary government, are creative in realizing the Party's program, Party policies, and the decisions of the Central Committee and higher-level organizations, outstandingly complete the Party's tasks, and gain the sincere support of the masses of the people, shall be rewarded." It would be wrong to emphasize initiative and enthusiasm while being divorced from the Party's leadership. The Party's unified leadership does not advocate blind obedience; on the contrary, it is to further promote democracy within the Party so that every Party member can contribute his wisdom to the Party. Therefore, adhering to the principle of the Party's unified leadership and giving play to the initiative and creativity of Party members are not contradictory.
    "Implementing collective leadership makes it easier for individuals; if something goes wrong, everyone can be responsible." This view is also incorrect. Implementing collective leadership does not mean that no one is responsible. On the contrary, it strengthens the individual's responsibility to the collective. Everyone should ensure the effective implementation of all resolutions passed by collective discussion. If something goes wrong in the work and mistakes are made, responsibility must be investigated. Therefore, it would be a misunderstanding or distortion of collective leadership to think that individuals can shirk some responsibility after implementing collective leadership.
    It must be pointed out that while we emphasize the Party's unified leadership, we do not neglect the importance of division of labor and responsibility under unified leadership. Unified leadership does not negate appropriate division of labor and individual responsibility. For example, the implementation of the factory director responsibility system in state-owned factories and mines is required by the production process of socialist modernization industry itself. This one-chief system is fundamentally different from the autocratic and domineering dictatorship in capitalist enterprises. It is combined with the democratization of management. This one-chief system does not mean being divorced from Party supervision, and it does not contradict the collective leadership system of the Party committee in the Party organization in the enterprise.
    In order to adhere to the principle of the Party's unified leadership, it is also necessary to strengthen ideological work. We must continuously improve the socialist consciousness of Party members and cadres, oppose the bourgeois ideology that has invaded the Party, and resolutely struggle against all tendencies that deviate from the state's general line, deviate from the Party's supervision, and undermine the Party's unified leadership. During the period of gradually carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie will inevitably be reflected in the ideological struggle within the Party. All kinds of decentralism, and all tendencies that violate or undermine the Party's centralized unity, are reflections of bourgeois individualism and liberalism within the Party. In the transition period, the bourgeoisie is precisely using this individualism and liberalism as weapons, attempting to ideologically corrupt the unstable elements in our Party and spread various unhealthy emotions in order to hinder the implementation of the general line. This is something we must be vigilant about. Only by strengthening ideological work can we effectively eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology within the Party, overcome various erroneous tendencies within the Party that violate the general line; and only then can we consolidate the Party's unity and solidarity, and truly ensure the implementation of the general line. Comrade Malenkov said: "Ideological work is the primary responsibility of the Party, and neglecting this work may cause irreparable losses to the interests of the Party and the state." ("Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the 19th Party Congress")
    In studying the general line, we must clearly recognize that our Party is already the ruling party, and any phenomenon within the Party that violates the principle of the Party's unified leadership will affect the implementation of the general line during the transition period. Vigorously strengthening the Party's leading role and adhering to the principle of the Party's unified leadership are one of the decisive conditions for realizing the general line, and one of the main guarantees for our great motherland to smoothly transition to socialism.

    贯彻总路线必须坚持党的统一领导的原则
    许邦仪
    我们党已经在全国人民面前明确提出了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。为了实现党的总路线，党的领导作用在今天就愈益重要。新的历史时期和新的历史任务，迫切要求党的组织不断提高领导工作水平，更严格地坚持党的统一领导的原则。
    党的领导的统一性和集体性是列宁、斯大林建党学说中的一条重要原则。我们党依据列宁、斯大林的建党思想，从来就是坚持党的统一领导的。在我们党的党章总纲中这样规定：“中国共产党是按民主的集中制组织起来的，是以自觉的、一切党员都要履行的纪律联结起来的统一的战斗组织。中国共产党的力量，在于自己的坚强团结，意志统一，行动一致。在党内不容许有离开党的纲领和党章的行为，不能容许有破坏党纪、向党闹独立性、小组织活动及阳奉阴违的两面行为。中国共产党必须经常注意清除自己队伍中破坏党的纲领和党章、党纪而不能改正的人出党。”在党中央的指示文件中，在毛泽东同志的有关著作中，都曾反复强调党的统一意志、统一纪律和集中领导的重要性。这是我们党领导中国革命取得胜利的决定性条件之一。
    今天我们党已经成为领导全国政权的执政的党；我们国家已经进入大规模有计划的经济建设的新时期，我们所面临的任务是艰巨的，在实际工作中我们将会碰到很多不熟悉的新东西，也将不可避免地遭遇许多困难；在社会主义工业化和社会主义改造过程中，我们还须从事各种形式的严重斗争。因此，在今天的形势下，我们必须更加强调党的统一领导，才能团结全党贯彻过渡时期的总路线，避免右的或“左”的错误。
    坚持党的统一领导的原则，必须坚决反对和抵制分散主义。很多事实说明：分散主义是国家建设工作中的一种祸害。各级组织中有一些业务部门，往往过分强调本部门的工作与垂直系统的领导，各自独立为政地向下级分配任务，没有统一安排，不分轻重缓急，不分主要次要，以致形成“人人是上级、事事是中心”，结果影响中心任务的完成。不久以前，各地在检查工作中所揭露出来的“五多”现象，就是这种分散主义的产物。还有某些部门的个别领导同志不把有关党的政策及人民的切身利益的重大问题提请党的组织讨论，不向上级党委请示，就自以为是地独断独行，结果犯了严重错误。
    犯有分散主义毛病的同志，往往不能正确处理个人与党的关系问题，也不能正确处理下级与上级、局部与整体的关系问题。他们错误地把个人与党的组织平列起来，甚至超出于党的组织之上；他们也错误地把下级组织与上级组织平列起来，而不看做是被领导与领导的关系；他们同样错误地把局部与整体分割开来，甚至企图使整体利益服从局部利益。正由于思想方法上的片面性和思想意识上的个人主义，他们在实际工作中就必然会产生分散主义的错误。
    犯分散主义毛病的同志，往往又忽视“党是无产阶级阶级组织的最高形式”的原理，他们错误地把政权组织或群众组织跟党平列起来，而没有认识到党是一切群众组织和政权组织的领导核心。党要指导并监督这些组织的工作，以保证国家总路线的切实执行。
    分散主义无疑地是与党的统一领导的原则不相容的，是与列宁主义不相容的。它是贯彻总路线的思想敌人之一。在党的组织中存在分散主义，就会削弱党的力量，就不能贯彻党的路线与政策。
    要克服分散主义，必须坚持党的统一领导的原则，严格执行党章中关于“党员个人服从所属党的组织，少数服从多数，下级组织服从上级组织，部分组织统一服从中央”的规定。
  　这里特别需要提出来的一点，是全党统一服从中央的领导。党的中央是党的首脑和心脏，是全党的指挥部。党的中央集中着全党最优秀、最有经验的领导者，党的全部智慧都集中在党的中央委员会。目前我们更需要将全国一切可能统一的和必须统一的权力统一于中央的领导之下，防止任何权力分散的现象。在党中央的意志下统一行动，这是贯彻总路线的保证。
    在国家建设事业中，坚持党的统一领导的原则，克服分散主义，还应当强调一切按照国家计划来办事。国家计划是在党中央的统一意志下制定出来的。它是全体人民的长远利益和最高利益的集中表现，也是全国人民的行动纲领，破坏国家的计划也就破坏了党的领导的统一性。正由于此，在我们党内就应大大提倡照顾大局，服从整体的精神，反对那种狭隘的本位主义的倾向。比如说，我们国家第一个五年建设计划，是以发展重工业为中心，其中又以苏联政府帮助我国的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程建设为重点。我们必须抓住这个有决定意义的主要环节，集中大批优秀的干部和巨量的资金以及各种建设力量，支援这一百四十一项工程的建设。如果有人不按照国家计划来办事，闹分散主义和本位主义，片面强调本部门工作的重要，只要求党和国家给以更多的优秀干部，分配更多的资金；而不愿抽走更多的、更好的干部去加强别的更重要的部门，这样，势必对国家建设事业造成恶果，推迟国家建设的进程。这一些人虽然在口头上说拥护国家总路线，实际上却妨碍国家总路线的贯彻实现。毛泽东同志在“整顿党的作风”一文中对本位主义者作了极中肯的批判。他指出：“必须反对只顾自己不顾别人的本位主义的倾向。谁要是对别人的困难不管，别人要调他所属的干部不给，或以坏的送人，‘以邻为壑’，全不为别部、别地、别人想一想，这样的人就叫做本位主义者，这就是完全失掉了共产主义的精神。”
    为了坚持党的统一领导的原则，就要进一步发扬党内民主，认真健全党委制，贯彻党的集体领导。
    党的统一领导并不取消党内民主，党的集中制是建筑在民主基础之上的。如果党内民主遭到破坏，那就不可能名副其实地实现党的统一领导。党的集中制与党的民主制，二者是辩证的关系。党内民主的实质，就是提高党员群众的积极性，巩固党的纪律和统一。在目前，发扬党内民主，发挥党员高度的主动性和创造性，提高党员对党的事业的责任心，对于巩固党的统一，完成国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，更有着特殊重要的意义。我们知道，党的一切成就，都是依靠党员和群众的集体力量。因此，党在任何时候都要求自己的党员重视党的集体领导，反对盲目崇拜个人的唯心观点。不可能设想，我们国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，不依靠集体的力量和智慧就可以实现。
    发扬党内民主，保证党的领导的集体性，必须认真健全党委制。所有重要的工作计划、指示、决定等等，都应经过党的委员会集体讨论通过。任何个人或少数几个人都不允许随便决定重要问题。在任何一个党组织里，无论领导者有多大的本领和高深的学问，都不能代替集体的智慧和经验。只有采取集体领导、集思广益的方法，才可以有效地发挥党员干部的主动性和积极性。实际生活已经充分证明：任何个人或少数几个人随便决定问题，就可能造成重大的错误。正如斯大林同志所说：“个人的决定总是或几乎总是片面的。在每个委员会里，在每个集体组织里，都有发表值得重视的意见的人。在每个委员会里，在每个集体组织里，都有能发表错误意见的人。根据三次革命的经验，我们知道：在一百个未经过集体审查和集体修改的个人决定中，差不多有九十个是片面的。”（斯大林：“与德国作家路德维希的谈话”）
    我们有这样一些领导者，他们往往违反集体领导的原则。有个别党委书记往往把自己置身于党的委员会之上，不受党的监督，不向党的委员会报告工作，不接受别人批评；有的党委委员不关心党组织的全部工作，只愿意个人“独当一面”，对于工作中的一些重大问题，也不提交党委会讨论就擅自决定；还有某些党的委员会放松对政权部门工作、群众团体工作的统一领导，借口不懂业务，听任这些部门“各自为政”；而某些业务部门的领导人员，认为党委不懂业务，就个人包办某一部门的工作；这些都是破坏党委制，违反集体领导原则的表现。
    我们必须认识到，在过渡时期，继续加强党对各个部门及每个共产党员的监督（不管这个部门有多大的“特殊性”，也不管这个党员有多高的职位），是保证贯彻总路线的关键之一。党必须监督任何一个部门和任何一个党员，看他是不是按照总路线去工作，是不是脱离了甚至违反了总路线。只要与总路线有一点脱节，党就必须加以纠正。经验证明，哪里没有或缺乏党的监督，那里就会离开总路线，就要犯右倾的或“左”倾的错误。
    有人认为：“强调党的统一领导，事情就不大好办”。这是不正确的。国家的建设工作是复杂的，头绪纷繁的，需要各方面互相配合，步调一致。事实是统一了，事情就比较好办一些；越不统一，事情就越不好办。
    “强调党的统一领导，会不会妨碍党员干部的自动性和创造性？”不会的。共产党员应该按照党的总路线，在党的统一领导下去发挥自动性和创造性。这种自动性和积极性，党在任何时候都是鼓励与支持的。党章中就有规定：“凡在工作中，表现自己是完全忠于党与人民的事业，是遵守党和革命政府纪律的模范，在实现党的纲领、党的政策和中央及上级组织的决议中富于创造性，出色地完成党的任务，取得人民群众真诚拥护的党员与党的组织，得给予奖励。”如果离开党的领导来强调自动性和积极性，那就是错误的。党的统一领导并不是提倡盲目服从；相反，是要进一步发扬党内民主，使每个党员都可以把自己的智慧贡献给党。因此，坚持党的统一领导的原则与发挥党员的自动性和创造性，是并不矛盾的。
    “实行集体领导，个人可以轻松一些；出了岔子，可以大家负责。”这种看法也是不对的。实行集体领导，并不是无人负责。相反，是加强个人对集体所负的责任。凡是经过集体讨论通过的决议，每人都应保证切实执行。在工作中出了岔子，犯了错误，就要追究责任。因此，如果认为实行集体领导后，个人就可以推掉一些责任，那就是对集体领导的误解或曲解。
    必须指出，我们一方面强调党的统一领导，另一方面也不忽视在统一领导下分工负责的重要性。统一领导并不取消适当的分工和个人负责。例如在国营厂矿中实行厂长负责制，这是社会主义的近代化工业的生产过程本身所需要的。这种一长制和资本主义企业中的专横霸道的独裁制根本不同，它是和管理民主化相结合的。这种一长制也不等于脱离党的监督，它和在企业的党组织中的党委的集体领导制是并不矛盾的。
    为了坚持党的统一领导的原则，还必须加强思想工作。要不断提高党员干部的社会主义觉悟，反对侵入到党内来的资产阶级思想；要和一切脱离国家总路线，脱离党的监督，破坏党的统一领导的倾向作坚决的斗争。在对资本主义工商业逐步进行社会主义的改造的期间，工人阶级与资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，将不可避免地反映到党内的思想斗争中来。形形色色的分散主义，一切违反或破坏党的集中统一的倾向，都是资产阶级个人主义和自由主义在党内的反映。在过渡时期，资产阶级正是以这种个人主义和自由主义作为武器，企图从思想上腐蚀我们党内不坚定的分子，传播各种不健康的情绪，以阻挠总路线的贯彻。这是我们必须提高警惕的。只有加强思想工作，才能有效地清除党内资产阶级思想的影响，克服党内各种违反总路线的错误倾向；也才能巩固党的统一团结，确实保证总路线的贯彻。马林科夫同志说：“思想工作是党的首要职责，不重视这种工作就可能给党和国家的利益造成无法弥补的损失。”（“在第十九次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”）
    在学习总路线中，我们必须明确认识：我们党已经是执政的党，在党内任何违反党的统一领导的原则的现象，都会影响过渡时期总路线的贯彻。竭力加强党的领导作用，坚持党的统一领导的原则，是实现总路线的决定性的条件之一，是我们伟大的祖国顺利地过渡到社会主义的主要保证之一。
