Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, February 27th: According to TASS, the Vienna branch of the Austrian Communist Party held a cadre meeting on February 23rd and 24th. The Chairman of the Austrian Communist Party, Koplenig, delivered a speech on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

Koplenig refuted the claim spread by the Austrian ruling parties that the Soviet government's position obstructed the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty. He said: The policy embodied by Molotov at the Berlin conference, his proposals for arms reduction, the proposal to conclude an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe, the reconstruction of a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany, and the proposals on the Austrian question are all in line with the interests and aspirations of the Austrian people. The Austrian people do not want another Anschluss, nor do they want to see German troops (this time wearing the uniforms of the "European Army") once again enter Austria, using Austria as their bridgehead to attack its neighbors. … We want Austria to become a bastion of peace, not a bridgehead for a new war.

Koplenig pointed out that the Austrian government's refusal to immediately sign a peace treaty based on Molotov's proposals violates Austria's interests and serves the interests of aggressive American imperialism. The government adopted this position under the direct pressure of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. Dulles has made it very clear that the main obstacle to the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty is the United States' attempt to drag Austria into the Western countries' aggressive plans.

Koplenig said: German militarism is a deadly enemy of an independent, democratic, and free Austria. He continued: The Austrian government's refusal to accept Molotov's proposal to postpone the withdrawal of Allied occupation forces from Austria until the conclusion of a German peace treaty helped the Western countries obstruct the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty in Berlin.

Koplenig said: If the Austrian government takes into account the changes in the situation caused by the failure of the American policy of strength and implements a pragmatic policy, it is possible to reach a common understanding on the Austrian issue. In other words, Austria must get rid of American control and strictly maintain neutrality.

Koplenig finally called on all peace-loving men and women in Austria to strengthen the struggle against those who are hostile to mutual understanding, and to strive for Austria to pursue a new policy that can achieve the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty.

    奥共主席就四国外长会议结果发表演说
    指出苏联关于奥地利问题的建议符合奥地利人民的利益
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十六日讯：奥地利共产党维也纳支部于二月二十三日和二十四日举行干部会议。奥地利共产党主席柯普勒尼希就柏林四国外长会议的结果发表了演说。
    柯普勒尼希驳斥了奥地利执政党派所散布的，所谓苏联政府的立场阻挠了缔结对奥和约的说法。他说：莫洛托夫在柏林会议上所体现的政策、他所提出的裁减军备的建议、缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议，重建一个统一、民主、和平的德国以及关于奥地利问题的建议，都是符合于奥地利人民的利益和愿望的。奥地利人民不希望又来一次德奥合并，不希望看到德国的军队（这一次穿着“欧洲军”的制服）又一次开进奥地利，把奥地利当作他们的桥头堡去攻打它的邻国。……我们希望奥地利成为一个和平的堡垒，而不成为新战争的桥头堡。
    柯普勒尼希指出：奥地利政府拒绝立即签订以莫洛托夫的建议为基础的和约，这违反奥地利的利益，而符合于侵略成性的美帝国主义的利益。政府是在美国国务卿杜勒斯的直接压力下采取这种立场的。杜勒斯已经使人看得很清楚：缔结对奥和约的主要障碍是美国想把奥地利拖入西方国家的侵略计划的企图。
    柯普勒尼希说：德国军国主义是一个独立、民主和自由的奥地利的死敌。他接着说：奥地利政府拒绝接受莫洛托夫提出的延期撤退盟国驻奥占领军直到对德和约缔结时为止的建议，帮助了西方国家在柏林阻挠缔结对奥和约。
    柯普勒尼希说：如果奥地利政府考虑到美国实力政策的失败所造成的局势的变化，并执行实事求是的政策，在奥地利问题上达成共同的谅解是可能的。换句话说，就是要奥地利摆脱美国的控制，严格保守中立。
    柯普勒尼希最后号召奥地利所有爱好和平的男女加强斗争，反对敌视互相谅解的人，争取奥地利奉行一种可以实现缔结对奥和约的新政策。
