Xinhua News Agency, February 24th:

    Rain and snow conditions since last winter indicate that East China, Central South, and Northwest China have experienced abundant precipitation. In contrast, the Southwest, Northeast, and areas east of the Taihang Mountains in North China have seen little rain and snow. Drought prevention and resistance are crucial considerations for these regions to ensure successful spring planting.
    From last winter to January of this year, most areas of East China, Central South, and Northwest China have received more rain and snow than in previous years during the same period. Precipitation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has reached about 200 millimeters, approximately twice the normal rainfall. The mountainous areas of Fujian and Zhejiang have experienced particularly heavy rain and snow this winter and spring, with precipitation reaching 350 millimeters. The Central South region had the most rain and snow in the country last winter. Precipitation in the upper reaches of the Huai River ranged from about 100 to 150 millimeters. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River received about 200 millimeters, with particularly abundant rainfall in the Hunan and Hubei basins. Most areas of Jiangxi and Hunan provinces received more than twice the normal rain and snow. Precipitation in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces generally reached about 200 millimeters. The Northwest region also experienced more rain and snow this winter and spring. The Qilian Mountains area of Gansu Province received about 20 millimeters. The Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province received about 30 to 50 millimeters. The Hanzhong Basin generally reached about twice the normal rainfall, with some areas experiencing three times the normal amount. From January 19th to 26th this year, the Northwest, Central South, and parts of East China experienced snowfall again. In the major winter wheat producing areas of the Northwest, such as Longdong in Gansu Province and the Guanzhong Plain in Shaanxi Province, the snowfall was significant, and over 37 million mu of winter wheat are generally growing well. In mid-February this year, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces successively experienced snowfall again. The snow loosened the soil, facilitating spring plowing. Nearly 40 million mu of wheat and rapeseed in the Huaibei Plain and along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province are growing even more vigorously.
    The Southwest, Northeast, and areas east of the Taihang Mountains in North China have experienced little rain and snow since last winter. Precipitation in the Sichuan Basin has been about 50 millimeters, and about 50 millimeters on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The central plains of the Northeast have received the least snowfall, with most areas receiving less than 10 millimeters, and some areas experiencing almost no snow for three months. The Rehe area has also received very little snow. These areas have generally received less than half the normal rainfall for the same period in previous years. In North China, areas east of the Taihang Mountains have generally experienced little rain and snow. The central part of Hebei Province has received about 25 millimeters, and some areas in the east have experienced almost no snow for three months. Compared with normal years, the eastern part of Hebei Province has also received less than half the normal rainfall. In January this year, most areas of the Southwest experienced snowfall; from February 14th to 16th, parts of northern Sichuan Province and northern Guizhou Province experienced another snowfall. However, due to the lack of rain and snow in winter, winter water paddies, ponds, and weirs are generally short of water, and river, lake, and reservoir water levels are lower than in previous years, which is quite unfavorable for spring plowing and rice transplanting. In mid-February, most areas of the Northeast experienced snowfall, but due to the lack of rain and snow since winter, drought is still prevalent in many areas. Currently, the Northeast Administrative Committee and the North China Administrative Committee have instructed all localities to strictly prevent spring drought.

    冬季雨雪充足便利春耕
    西南、东北、华北东部雨雪稀少要严防春旱
    【新华社二十四日讯】去冬以来各地雨雪情况显示：华东、中南和西北等地雨雪丰沛。西南、东北和华北的太行山以东地区，雨雪稀少，防旱、抗旱是这些地区在保证春耕播种中需要注意的问题之一。
    去年冬季到今年一月间，华东、中南和西北等大部地区，雨雪量都比历年同时期为多。长江下游地区降水量达二百公厘左右。约为常年降水量的一倍左右。闽浙山地去冬今春雨雪尤多，降水量达三百五十公厘。中南地区去年冬季雨雪量为全国最多的地方。淮河上游降水量约在一百公厘到一百五十公厘左右。长江中游降水量约在二百公厘左右，其中湖南、湖北盆地特别充足；江西、湖南两省大部地区达常年雨雪量一倍以上。广东、广西两省降水量一般也在二百公厘左右。西北地区去冬今春雨雪量也较多。其中甘肃省祁连山一带达二十公厘左右。陕西省关中地区约在三十到五十公厘。汉中盆地一般可达常年降水量的一倍左右，个别地区有常年三倍之多的雨雪量。今年一月十九日到二十六日间，西北区、中南区和华东部分地区又都下了雪。西北主要冬麦产区的甘肃省陇东地区和陕西省关中平原，雪下得较大，三千七百多万亩冬麦普遍生长良好。今年二月中旬，江苏省、安徽省、山东省、河南省、陕西省再次先后降雪。雪后土地松软，便利春耕；安徽省淮北平原和长江沿岸近四千万亩小麦和油菜，生长得更加茂盛。
    西南区、东北区和华北太行山以东地区，去冬以来雨雪稀少。四川盆地降水量在五十公厘左右。云贵高原上在五十公厘左右。东北以中部平原降雪最少，大部地区不足十公厘，个别地区有三个月几乎没有下雪。热河一带降雪也很少。这些地区多不及往年同时期雨雪量的一半。华北地区在太行山以东，雨雪普遍稀少。河北省中部约为二十五公厘左右，东部某些地方也有三个月几乎没有下雪。和常年相比，河北省东部地区雨雪量也不及往年的一半。今年一月间，西南大部地区下了雪；二月十四日到十六日，四川省北部和贵州省北部部分地区又下了一次雪。但由于冬季雨雪稀少，冬水田、塘、堰还普遍缺水，江、河、湖、泊水位都较往年低落，对春耕插秧相当不利。二月中旬，东北大部地区虽普遍降雪，但由于冬季以来雨雪稀少，仍多有干旱现象。目前，东北行政委员会和华北行政委员会都已指示各地严密预防春旱。
