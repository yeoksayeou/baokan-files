    Using Technology to Promote Agricultural Production and Mutual Aid and Cooperative Movement
    East China Agricultural Technology Conference Determines Future Work Guidelines

    The East China Administrative Committee's Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy recently convened the East China Agricultural Technology Conference. The conference summarized the achievements of agricultural scientific research in the East China region over the past four years. In accordance with the General Line, it discussed and formulated an outline of experimental research work plans for 1954 and the next four years.

    Over the past four years, agricultural scientific research workers in East China, under the specific leadership of local Party committees and people's governments, have undergone ideological remolding, accepted advanced Soviet scientific theories and advanced experience, and have made great achievements in scientific research. The Jiangsu Provincial Rice Crop Experiment Station successfully conducted dry direct seeding experiments with rice last year, yielding 858 jin of rice per mu, bringing new hope for mechanized large-scale rice production in rice-wheat double-cropping areas. The East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, by breaking with conservative thinking and giving play to its creative spirit, successfully trial-produced crystal violet vaccine for hog cholera, which not only has a low cost, but also surpasses the quality level of capitalist countries. When studying how to prevent wheat bunt, the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute went deep into the countryside, repeatedly investigating, experimenting, and analyzing, and finally achieved success, basically eliminating the most serious wheat bunt in Shandong Province. Last year, various localities adopted the method of comprehensive work teams, going deep into various places to summarize the production experience of the masses, scientifically analyze and improve it, which not only combined scientific research with production practice, but also enriched the content of scientific research. These achievements have played a significant role in increasing the production of grain, cotton, and other industrial raw materials, and in developing animal husbandry and horticulture.

    The conference discussed and formulated an outline of agricultural scientific research work plans for 1954 and the next four years. It pointed out that in the future, agricultural scientific research work in East China should implement the national General Line, and in accordance with the requirements of agricultural production and the development of the mutual aid and cooperative movement, and the regional nature of agricultural production, study the key technical problems that urgently need to be solved in agricultural production during the socialist transformation of agriculture, and focus on the production technology of agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned mechanized farms with larger areas, in order to promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperative movement and the socialist transformation of agriculture. In terms of research content, the focus should be on increasing grain and cotton production, and appropriately studying the improvement and upgrading of oil crops, industrial raw material crops, animal husbandry, and horticulture production technologies. In order to do these tasks well, the conference requested that agricultural scientific research workers first earnestly study the General Line, and earnestly study the advanced Soviet Michurin biological science theory. In terms of working methods, it is necessary to develop the enthusiasm, creativity, and collective research spirit of agricultural scientific workers, and prevent scattered and isolated research on problems. Research work must be combined with extension work, constantly summarizing the production experience of the masses, raising it to a scientific level, and then promoting it among the masses. In the future, agricultural science research institutes and farms in various provinces should strengthen the business guidance and inspection of agricultural experimental special zones and county farms, and should strengthen the reporting system of the work of scientific research departments, and gradually establish a responsibility system and review system, in order to better complete the task of agricultural scientific research during the national transition period.

    The conference finally commended twenty-nine successful scientific research works.

    用技术促进农业生产和互助合作运动
    华东区农业技术会议确定今后工作方针
    华东行政委员会农林水利局最近召开华东区农业技术会议，总结了四年来华东区农业科学研究工作的成就，并按照总路线讨论制订了一九五四年及今后四年试验研究工作计划纲要。
    四年来华东农业科学研究工作者在各地党委和人民政府的具体领导下，经过思想改造，接受了苏联先进科学理论与先进经验，在科学研究工作上取得了很大成就。江苏省稻作试验场去年进行水稻旱直播试验成功，每亩收稻子八百五十八斤，为稻麦两熟地区水稻进行机械化大面积生产带来了新的希望。华东农业科学研究所由于打破保守思想，发挥了创造精神，猪瘟结晶紫疫苗试制成功，不但成本低，并在质量上超过了资本主义国家水平。山东省农业科学研究所在研究如何防治小麦腥黑穗病时，曾深入农村，反复调查、试验、分析，终于得到成功，使山东全省最严重的小麦腥黑穗病基本消灭。去年各地采用了综合工作组的方式，深入各地总结群众生产经验，加以科学分析提高，不但使科学研究和生产实际相结合，并更加丰富了科学研究的内容。这些成就在增产粮食、棉花和其他工业原料及发展畜牧、园艺生产方面已起了重大作用。
    会议讨论和制订了一九五四年及今后四年农业科学研究工作计划纲要，指出今后华东的农业科学研究工作应贯彻国家总路线，根据农业生产和互助合作运动发展的要求及农业生产的区域性，研究在农业的社会主义改造过程中，农业生产上迫切需要解决的关键性的技术问题，并有重点地研究农业生产合作社及国营机械化农场较大面积的生产技术，以促进互助合作运动的发展及对农业的社会主义改造。在研究内容方面，以粮棉增产为中心，并适当地研究油料作物、工业原料作物、畜牧、园艺生产技术的改进和提高。为做好这些工作，会议要求农业科学研究工作者首先要认真学习总路线，认真学习苏联先进的米丘林生物科学理论。在工作方法上要发扬农业科学工作者的积极性、创造性和集体研究精神，防止分散的、孤立的钻研问题。研究工作必须与推广工作相结合，不断总结群众的生产经验，提高到科学水平，再在群众中推广。今后各省农业科学研究所、农场应加强对农业试验性质的专区、县农场的业务指导与检查，并应加强科学研究部门工作的汇报制度，逐步建立责任制和审查制度，以更好地完成国家过渡时期农业科学研究工作的任务。
    会议最后并表扬了二十九项有成就的科学研究工作。
