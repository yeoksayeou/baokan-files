    The General Election Movement in Urban Beijing
    Li Xianyao
    The grassroots election work in Beijing, after conducting typical experiments in the urban and suburban areas from June last year, has been completed in areas with a total population of about 1.7 million in the seven urban districts and individual villages in the suburbs by January this year. The number of voters participating in the election accounted for more than 98 percent of the total number of voters. Among the 1,200 people's representatives elected, workers accounted for about 33 percent; cadres of democratic parties, organs, and organizations accounted for about 19 percent; workers in culture, education, and health care accounted for about 15 percent; private industrialists and businessmen accounted for about 10 percent; family members of employees and independent laborers accounted for about 21 percent; and religious professionals accounted for about 2 percent. Ethnic minorities, whose total population accounts for more than 7 percent of the total number of citizens, accounted for more than 10 percent of the total number of representatives. Women accounted for about 26 percent of the representatives. All representatives were elected with extremely high vote counts. The proportion of voters participating in the election demonstrates the extremely high patriotic enthusiasm and high political consciousness of the people in the capital. The strengthening of the working-class composition among the elected representatives provides more favorable conditions and organizational guarantees for the grassroots political power in urban areas to realize the general line of the state during the transition period.
    The grassroots elections in Beijing have achieved full development of democracy. This is particularly evident in the work of nominating representative candidates. During the typical experiments last summer, voters sat around under the trees in the courtyards, enthusiastically discussing representative candidates, sometimes until the evening dew soaked through their clothes. When the urban elections were fully launched last winter, voters went to visit representative candidates in groups of three or five, braving the north wind, as happily as visiting relatives during the Spring Festival; the democratic parties, people's organizations, and voter representatives surrounded the stove, repeatedly discussing and proposing joint lists of representative candidates, sometimes until late at night. The nomination of representative candidates adopted a method that combined mass deliberation and nomination with consultation among all parties. First, voter groups deliberated, discussed, and visited representative candidates. After the voters' opinions were relatively concentrated, the district committees of the Chinese Communist Party, the local organizations of the democratic parties and people's organizations, and representatives of the voter groups conducted consultations in the electoral districts based on the voters' deliberations, and proposed a preliminary joint list of representative candidates. Then, it was submitted to the voters for discussion. Finally, the election committee determined the official list of representative candidates based on the opinions of the majority of voters. In the work of nominating representative candidates, because democracy was fully developed and voters freely expressed their opinions, not only was the people's awareness of being masters of their own affairs further enhanced, but also voters became familiar with the situation of each representative candidate. During the voting, some illiterate old ladies heard the substitute writer read the names of the official representative candidates and said with a smile, "These are the ones we discussed, I approve of them all!"
    Because Beijing's general election was combined with the publicity of the state's general line during the transition period, voters selected their representatives with the highest standards. For cadres, they mainly looked at whether they had completed the work entrusted to them by the people; for workers, they mainly looked at whether they had achieved good results in production; and for private industrialists and businessmen, they mainly looked at whether they had adopted a positive attitude towards socialist transformation. Voters placed their yearning for and expectations of socialism on the people's representatives.
    Beijing has a democratic tradition. The "May Fourth" Movement and the "December 9th" Movement both originated here. The people of Beijing also have many memories of elections. During the period of the Northern Warlords, Cao Kun bought the "Piglet Parliament" with silver dollar checks; Yuan Shikai surrounded the parliament with plainclothes police, coercing the deputies to recast their votes three times, "electing" him as president. The people also remember the ugly farce of the "Chiang-Kai Shek National Assembly" period, when bureaucrats, gentry, hooligans, and secret agents shouted on the streets, "One vote, one towel." The people regarded that kind of election as a complete disaster. Since Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army came to Beijing, the people of Beijing have begun to enjoy true democratic rights. Before the general election, there were more than 15,000 people's representatives directly and indirectly elected by the people in the district and township (town) grassroots political power in Beijing. They were all active supporters and promoters of various social reforms and production. The district and township (town) people's representative conferences composed of them have all exercised the functions and powers of the people's congress and elected the grassroots people's government. The people's political power has done many beneficial things for the people in the past few years. The people's government has used its greatest strength to develop production, because this is the most fundamental way to improve the people's lives. The number of industrial employees in the city increased by three-quarters in 1953 compared with 1949. In the 1953 fiscal budget of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, construction expenses such as economic, cultural, educational, and health care accounted for more than 81 percent of the total expenditure; while in the 1947 local expenditure budget of the puppet Beiping Municipal Government, administrative, security, and police expenses alone accounted for 49 percent of the total expenditure. The people love their own political power, care about their own political power, and enthusiastically participate in election activities, not only because they know the meaning of being masters of their own affairs, but also deeply understand that this democratic right is hard-won. People passing through Tiananmen Square can still faintly see the slogans "Oppose Civil War, Oppose Hunger" written on the stone railings; in the History Museum, the noose with which Li Dazhao, one of the pioneers of China's democratic movement, was executed has not completely rotted. Seeing these, the voters attach even greater importance to their electoral rights and want to use this right to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and create a happier life. Comrade Wu Yunduo, the Chinese Paul Korchagin living in Beijing, said before voting: "On the road to striving for happiness, every step is sprinkled with the blood of heroes. I cherish our democratic rights a hundred times and give my trust to those who are most trustworthy."
    Because the people of Beijing understand the significance of the general election, everyone is willing to do what they can for the general election. A surveyor from the Fourth Telephone Bureau tested the telephone in every polling station on the voting day. He did this to ensure the smooth running of the telephone during the election. An Ahong of a mosque in Niujie publicized the election law to the Muslims gathered for prayer every "Juma" (Muslim Friday prayer). A ventriloquist from Tianqiao voluntarily performed ventriloquism for the children in the temporary childcare station set up by the general election working group. A student from the 32nd Municipal Middle School showed self-made lantern slides to the children so that women could participate in the voters' meeting with peace of mind.
    The voting day was the coldest day in Beijing since the beginning of winter last year. In the morning, before the streetlights were extinguished in the morning mist, the polling stations were filled with many voters waiting to vote. Every household was decorated with red double happiness characters and couplets, and the sound of firecrackers and gongs and drums could be heard even in the most secluded hutongs. Many of the people standing in the morning mist had not slept well all night. A female voter in Chongwen District—Fu Lin, the wife of a worker—gave birth to seven children before liberation, and none of them survived in the years of suffering. One child died of fright because the puppet Baozhang forced Fu Lin to pay "sanitation donations" and beat her. After liberation, Fu Lin's husband was elected as a member of the Chongwen District People's Government, and the family's life improved. Just a few days before the vote, she gave birth to a nine-pound boy in the hospital. Listening to the child's sweet breathing, she thought of the past and could not sleep peacefully. After dawn, she cast a sacred vote for the child's happiness in the mobile ballot box.
    Workers went to the polling stations with their new production achievements to vote. In order to welcome the general election, the employees of the People's Printing Factory worked hard in production and overfulfilled the original plan by 11 percent in half a month, and the waste rate was reduced by 24 percent compared with the original plan. The first branch of the Chaoyang Electric Machinery Factory completed the order for distribution boards in advance as a gift to the general election. Qi Baishi, a 93-year-old Chinese painter, and Hao Jianxiu, a national textile industry labor model who had just turned 18, cast their sacred votes. Mei Lanfang, a famous Peking opera actor, rushed back to Beijing from Tianjin the day before the vote. Zhang Zhonghou, a national railway labor model, wore sixteen shiny medals when he voted, and he regarded this day as the most sacred day.
    After the voting on January 24, the grassroots election work in the urban area of Beijing was successfully concluded. The grassroots elections in the six suburban districts have been fully launched after the Spring Festival. After the city completes all the elections by the end of March, the people's representatives will follow the people's instructions, be with the people, and work hard to build a better capital.

    北京市城区的普选运动
    黎先耀
    北京市的基层选举工作，从去年六月在城区和郊区进行典型试验之后，到今年一月为止，市内七个区和郊区个别村庄共约一百七十多万人口的地区已经完成。参加选举的选民占选民总数的百分之九十八强。当选的一千二百名人民代表中，工人约占百分之三十三；各民主党派、机关、团体的干部占百分之十九；文教医务工作者约占百分之十五；私营工商业者约占百分之十；职工家属及独立劳动者等约占百分之二十一；宗教职业者约占百分之二。人口总数占全体市民百分之七强的少数民族，在代表总数中约占百分之十强。代表中妇女约占百分之二十六。所有代表都以极高的票数当选。选民参加选举人数的比例，说明了首都人民极其高涨的爱国主义热情和高度的政治觉悟。当选代表中工人阶级成份的加强，为城区基层政权实现国家过渡时期的总路线提供了更为有利的条件和组织上的保证。
    北京市的基层选举，做到了充分发扬民主。这特别表现在提出代表候选人的工作中。去年夏天在作典型试验时，选民们围坐在院子里的树下，热烈讨论代表候选人，有时一直讨论到晚露透凉了身子。去年冬天城区选举全面展开时，选民们三五成群，冒着北风，像春节串门一样高兴地去访问代表候选人；各民主党派、各人民团体和选民代表们围着炉火，反复协商提出代表候选人的联合名单，有时一直协商到深夜。代表候选人的提出，是采取了由群众酝酿提名与各方面协商相结合的办法，就是先由选民小组酝酿、讨论和访问代表候选人，等到选民意见相当集中以后，再由中共区委、各民主党派、人民团体的地方组织和选民小组的代表，在选民酝酿的基础上，按选区进行协商，提出代表候选人的初步联合名单。然后把它交给选民讨论。最后由选举委员会根据大多数选民的意见，确定代表候选人的正式名单。在代表候选人提名的工作上，因为充分发扬了民主，选民们完全自由地表达了自己的意见，因而不但进一步提高了人民当家做主的觉悟，而且使选民熟知了每一个代表候选人的情况。在投票时，有的不识字的老太太听到代书人念着正式代表候选人的名字，就笑嘻嘻地说：“这些人就是我们讨论过的那几个，我都赞成！”
    北京市的普选，由于结合了国家过渡时期总路线的宣传，因而选民们都以最高的标准来选择自己的代表。对于干部，主要是看他是否完成了人民委托他所负担的工作；对于工人，主要是看他在生产上是否取得了良好的成绩；对私营工商业者，主要看他对社会主义改造是否采取了积极的态度。选民们把对社会主义的向往和期望，寄托在人民代表的身上。
    北京有着民主的传统，“五四”运动和“一二九”运动都是在这里发源。北京人民对于选举也有许多的记忆。在北洋军阀时代，曹锟用银元支票买下了“猪仔议会”；袁世凯用便衣警察包围议院，胁迫议员们重投三次票，“选”他当上了总统。人民也还记得“蒋记国民大会”时期官僚、士绅、流氓、特务沿街叫喊“一张选票一块毛巾”的丑剧。人民把那种选举看成十足的灾难。自从毛主席和人民解放军来到北京，北京人民才开始享有真正的民主权利。普选之前，北京市的区、乡（镇）基层政权中，由人民直接和间接选举出来的人民代表，就有一万五千人以上。他们都是在各项社会改革和生产中的积极拥护者和推动者。由他们所组成的区、乡
  （镇）人民代表会议都已代行了人民代表大会职权，选举了基层人民政府。人民的政权几年来为人民做了许多有益的工作。人民政府用最大的力量来发展生产，因为这是改善人民生活最根本的方法。全市工业职工人数，一九五三年和一九四九年比较，增加了四分之三。北京市人民政府一九五三年度财政预算中，经济、文教、卫生等建设费占总支出的百分之八十一以上；而一九四七年伪北平市政府地方岁出预算中，仅行政、保安、警察费用就占了总支出的百分之四十九。人民热爱自己的政权，关怀自己的政权，热烈参加选举活动，不仅是因为知道了当家做主的意义，而且深刻地懂得这种民主权利的来之不易。人们走过天安门前，还可以隐约看出写在石栏上的“反内战、反饥饿”的标语；在历史博物馆中，我国民主运动先驱者之一李大钊同志就义的绞索还没有完全腐烂。看到这些，选民们就更加重视自己的选举权利，要用这种权利来进一步巩固人民民主专政和创造更加幸福的生活。住在北京的中国保尔·柯察金吴运铎同志在投票前说：“在争取幸福的道路上，每一步都洒着英雄们的鲜血。我百倍地珍视我们的民主权利，把我的信任交给那些最值得信任的人。”
    北京人民因为懂得了普选的意义，大家都愿意为普选做一些自己能做的事情。电话四局的一个测量员，在投票日试测了每一个选举站的电话。他这样作是为了保证在选举中电话的灵通。牛街有一个清真寺的阿訇，在每次“主麻”（回民聚礼日）时，都要向聚礼的回民宣传选举法。天桥一个口技艺人自动给普选工作组设立的临时托儿站的孩子们表演口技。市立三十二中学的一个学生，给孩子们放映自制的幻灯画片，好让妇女们安心参加选民会。
    投票那天，是去年入冬以来北京最冷的一天。早晨，路灯在晨雾中还没有熄灭，投票站就站满了许多等待投票的选民。家家门口都贴着红色的双喜字和对联，鞭炮和锣鼓声在最僻静的胡同里都可以听到。站在晨雾中的人们，有许多人整夜没有睡好。崇文区一个女选民——工人的妻子傅林，解放前生了七个孩子，在苦难的年月里，没有一个能活下来。有一个孩子，是因为伪保长逼傅林缴“卫生捐”，揪打她，而被吓得病死了。解放后傅林的丈夫当选了崇文区人民政府委员，家里生活也好了。就在投票的前几天，她在医院里生了一个九磅重的男孩子。她听着孩子甜蜜的呼吸，想到过去，无论如何也不能安睡。等到天亮后，她在流动票箱内为孩子的幸福投下了神圣的一票。
    工人们带着自己新的生产成就到选举站投票。人民印刷厂职工为了迎接普选，努力生产，在半个月中超额完成了原订计划百分之十一，废品率比原计划降低百分之二十四。朝阳电机厂第一分厂提前完成了配电盘的订货，作为对普选的献礼。九十三岁的国画家齐白石和刚满十八周岁的全国纺织工业劳动模范郝建秀投下了神圣的一票。京剧名演员梅兰芳在投票前一天从天津赶回北京。全国铁路劳动模范张忠厚在投票时带上了十六枚擦得发亮的奖章，他把这一天看作是最神圣的日子。
    一月二十四日举行投票之后，北京市城区基层选举工作胜利结束了。郊区六个区的基层选举已在春节后全面展开。全市在三月底前全部完成选举之后，人民代表将遵照人民的嘱托，和人民在一起，为建设更加美好的首都而努力。
