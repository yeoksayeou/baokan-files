    The scale of capital construction in the Northeast China electric power industry system this year is larger than in previous years. The main projects currently underway or about to begin in the Northeast China electric power industry system include: the installation of several giant thermal power generators and one hydroelectric generator; the continued construction of the high-pressure, high-temperature thermal power plant that began last year, whose main factory building covers an area of 150,000 square meters; and the construction of a larger new-type thermal power plant in a certain location. Among them, two giant thermal power generators will be installed and completed in September and October this year. After these two generators start operating, they can generate 650 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which can supply electricity for smelting more than 42 million tons of steel; or supply all the power needed for eight large spinning mills with 150,000 spindles. The various projects undertaken by the Northeast China electric power industry this year are mostly projects within the 141 key projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction. The technology is advanced, the equipment is highly mechanized and automated, and the entire design closely coordinates the development of other industrial construction. For example, after the two high-pressure, high-temperature thermal power plants are completed, they can not only generate electricity, but also supply steam and hot water, coordinating with the construction of other industrial systems in the surrounding area and meeting their future production needs.
    All the thermal power generators and hydroelectric generators used in various projects of the electric power system this year are the latest products from the Soviet Union. The coal, water, wind, and oil used are all controlled by special automatic devices, and workers only need to operate the buttons. As the amount of electricity used increases or decreases, the generator will automatically adjust the voltage; if an accident occurs, it will automatically send out an alarm; at the same time, many important parts are equipped with two sets of automatic equipment, and if one set fails, the other will automatically take over. The new thermal power plant not only has very high work efficiency, and the manpower required is three-quarters less than that of ordinary power plants, but also liberates workers from backward and simple working conditions and heavy physical labor.
    Currently, the installation of two thermal power generators has begun. The thermal power plant built last year is undergoing winter construction.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of these large-scale and technically complex projects, the Northeast Electric Power Administration had made preparations from top to bottom as early as last year. Most or all of the equipment for the generators planned to be installed this year has arrived. A large construction team is rapidly gathering. In order to adapt to the particularly complex technical requirements of capital construction in the electric power system, the Northeast Electric Power Administration has trained more than 1,000 technical workers of various types, including boiler and turbine installers, in the past year. At present, a large number of new workers are receiving winter training. Other building materials such as wood and sand are also being actively prepared. The Northeast Thermal Power Generation Engineering Company, which is undertaking most of this year's projects, is continuously convening meetings of responsible cadres from various engineering construction units to study the specific issues in various preparation work and construction, so as to ensure that the projects start on time.

    东北区今年电业建设规模巨大
    东北电力工业系统今年的基本建设比往年规模更大。东北电力工业系统目前已在进行和即将进行的主要工程是：安装数台巨型的火力发电机和一台水轮发电机；继续修建去年开工的、光主要厂房建筑面积就达十五万平方公尺的高压高温热电站；另外还将在某地兴建规模更大的新型热电站。其中有两台巨型火力发电机在今年九、十月间即可安装完成。这两台发电机开始运转后，每年所发电量可达六亿五千万度，可供冶炼四千二百余万吨钢的用电；或者供给八个十五万纱锭的大纱厂全部动力的需要。东北电力工业今年进行的各项工程，大都属于苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一项重点工程中的项目，技术先进，设备机械化、自动化程度极高，在整个设计上也周密地配合了其他工业建设的发展。例如两个高压高温热电站建成后，不但可以发电，还可以供应蒸汽和热水，配合周围其他工业系统的建设和满足它们将来的生产需要。
    今年电业系统各项工程所有的火力发电机和水轮发电机，全都是苏联的最新产品，所用煤、水、风、油，全有特殊的自动装置来控制，工人只要操纵电钮就行。随着用电量的大小，发电机就会自动调整电压；出了事故，它又会自己发出警报；同时许多重要部分还装有两套自动设备，如果一套发生故障，另一套就会自动代替工作。新的热电站不但工作效率很高，所用人力可比一般发电厂减少四分之三，而且使工人从设备落后、简陋的劳动条件下和繁重的体力劳动中解放出来。
    目前，有两台火力发电机已开始进行安装。去年兴建的热电站正在进行冬季施工。
    为了保证这些规模巨大、技术复杂的工程顺利进行，东北电业管理局早在去年就自上而下地作了准备工作。今年计划安装的各台发电机的设备大都已全部到达或大部到达。庞大的施工队伍正在迅速集结。为适应电业系统基本建设技术要求特别复杂这一特点，东北电业管理局去年一年已培养了一千余名安装锅炉、透平机的各种技术工人。目前并有大批新工人在受冬季训练。其他如木材、砂石等建筑材料，都在积极准备中。承担今年大部分工程的东北火力发电工程公司，正连续召集各工程施工单位的负责干部开会，研究各项准备工作和施工当中的具体问题，保证各项工程按时开工。
