The steel industry, under the Central Heavy Industry Ministry's Steel Industry Administration, exceeded its production plan for five major products in January. The completion rate of the production plan for major products is as follows: Iron ore 110.99%, metallurgical coke 103.4%, pig iron 105.1%, steel 106.4%, and steel products 113.9%. Compared with the same period last year, the factories and mines that comprehensively completed the major product plan in January this year accounted for 91.5% of the total number of factories and mines producing major products, while in January last year, it was only 29.2%. What is particularly outstanding is that large enterprises that failed to complete the major product plan in January last year, such as Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and 101 Steel Plant, all completed it this January. In January, the production balance rate of the main production workshops of the factories and mines under the Central Heavy Industry Ministry's Steel Industry Administration has reached 0.95 or more, and some workshops, such as the coking workshops of Benxi Iron and Steel Company and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, the ironmaking workshops of Longyan Iron Mine, and the steel rolling workshops of Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant and Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, can basically complete the work plan on a daily basis, and have begun to reverse the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end in previous years.

All factories and mines have made progress in professional production. All factories and mines have shortened the repair time by a total of 143 hours and 7 minutes in open-hearth furnace repairs. According to statistics as of January 25, temporary shutdowns of steel rolling in various factories and mines decreased by 27% compared with the same period in December last year. The tunneling work of Longyan Iron Mine also changed the situation of failing to complete the task in the same period last year this January.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, February 8th: Twenty-seven larger factories and mines in Chongqing have completed or exceeded the state production plan for January this year. Among them, the planned completion of the steel and textile industrial systems is the best, and all large factories and mines have exceeded the production plan for January.

The production plan for the first month of this year for various factories and mines in Chongqing is generally higher than the production plan for December last year. In implementing this year's production plan, all factories and mines have paid attention to strengthening planning management and carried out education for employees to comprehensively complete the plan. As early as December last year, 101 Steel Plant and 610 Textile Factory, etc., mobilized workers to discuss the production plans for the first quarter and the first month of this year. The workers of 101 Steel Plant, in conjunction with the study of the general line, launched a labor competition to ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of the production plan for the first hour, the first day, the first week, and the first month of this year. Therefore, the plant completed the plan for sixteen kinds of products, and the quality of the products was also significantly improved, among which the quality of steel rails reached 99.24%, and the quality of steelmaking pig iron also reached 100%. By January 25, the plant's cost was 21% lower than the planned target, and profits were turned over as scheduled according to the plan.

    钢铁工业一月份主要产品计划超额完成
    重庆二十七个较大厂矿完成一月份计划
    【本报讯】中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属厂矿一月份五种主要产品都超额完成了生产计划。主要产品完成生产计划的情况为：铁矿石一一○·九九，冶金焦一○三·四，生铁一○五·一，钢一○六·四，钢材一一三·九。与去年同期比较，今年一月份全面完成了主要产品计划的厂矿，占生产主要产品厂矿总数的百分之九十一点五，而去年一月份仅达百分之二十九点二。特别突出的是去年一月份未完成主要产品计划的较大企业如本溪钢铁公司、太原钢铁厂、石景山钢铁厂和一○一钢铁厂等单位，今年一月份都完成了。一月份，中央重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属厂矿主要生产车间的生产均衡率，都已达到零点九五以上，并且有一部分车间如本溪钢铁公司和太原钢铁厂的炼焦车间、龙烟铁矿的炼铁车间和唐山钢铁厂与上海第三钢铁厂的轧钢车间，基本上都能逐日完成作业计划，开始扭转了往年前松后紧的现象。
    各厂矿在专业生产方面都有进步。各厂矿在平炉检修工作中共缩短了检修时间一百四十三小时零七分；到一月二十五日的统计，各厂矿轧钢临时停工，较去年十二月同期减少了百分之二十七。龙烟铁矿的掘进工作今年一月份也改变了去年同期完不成任务的情况。
    【新华社重庆八日电】重庆市有二十七个较大的厂矿完成或超额完成了今年一月份的国家生产计划。其中钢铁和纺织工业系统的计划完成得最好，所有大型厂矿都超额完成了一月份的生产计划。
    重庆市各厂矿今年第一个月的生产计划，一般都比去年十二月份的生产计划高。在执行今年的生产计划中，各厂矿都注意了加强计划管理工作，并向职工进行全面完成计划的教育。早在去年十二月份，一零一钢铁厂和六一零纺织厂等，就发动工人讨论了今年第一季度和第一个月的生产计划。一零一钢铁厂的职工并结合总路线的学习，开展了保证全面均衡地完成今年第一小时、第一天、第一个周、第一个月的生产计划的劳动竞赛。因此，该厂十六种产品都完成了计划，产品的质量也有显著提高，其中钢轨的质量达到百分之九十九点二四，炼钢生铁的质量也达到百分之百。到一月二十五日，该厂的成本比计划指标降低了百分之二十一，利润也做到了按计划如期上缴。
