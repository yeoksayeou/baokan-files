Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd. The Guangdong Provincial Branch and Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the China People's Relief Association's relief funds of RMB 1 billion and 700,000 catties of rice for compatriots affected by the major fire in the Sham Shui Po wooden house area of Hong Kong and Kowloon at the end of last December have all been distributed. A total of 58,708 disaster victims received grain and funds from the motherland. A total of 50 disaster victims and families who were injured or died in the fire received preferential relief grain and funds. Among them, one family member of the deceased received HK$400 and 50 catties of white rice, and six households each received HK$200 and 50 catties of white rice. In addition, each of the 43 injured people received HK$100 and 30 catties of white rice.

The disaster-stricken compatriots who received the relief grain and funds were very grateful for the meticulous care of the people of the motherland. Chen Ying, a woman who had suffered three fires, said: I have suffered three major fires, and each time I received relief from the people of the motherland in the most difficult times. I will never forget the kindness of the people of the motherland. Ye Mei, a disaster victim who lost her only son in the fire, was moved to tears when she received the "special preferential" grain and funds. She said that she thought everything was over when her son died, but now she knows that many people care and sympathize with her, and she no longer feels lonely. The motherland has given her the strength and confidence to live on.

    九龙遭受火灾同胞五万多人
    领到祖国人民的救济粮款
    【新华社广州三日电】中国人民救济总会广东省分会和广州市分会救济去年十二月底香港九龙深水埗木屋区遭受大火灾同胞的人民币一十亿元及大米七十万斤，已全部发放完毕。领得祖国粮款的灾胞共有五万八千七百零八人。因失火伤、亡而领到优恤粮款的灾胞、家属共五十人。其中死者家属一户领到港币四百元和白米五十斤，六户各领到港币二百元和白米五十斤。此外，伤者四十三人每人都领到港币一百元和白米三十斤。
    领到救济粮款的受灾同胞，对于祖国人民无微不至的关怀非常感激。曾经先后三次遭受火灾的妇女陈英说：我三次遭到大火，每次都是在最困难的时候得到祖国人民的救济，我永远都不会忘记祖国人民的恩情。在此次大火中丧失了唯一的儿子的灾民叶梅，为她领到“特别优恤”粮款感动地流下了眼泪。她说，她以为儿子死了，一切都完了，现在知道有很多人在关怀和同情着她，已不再感到孤独了，祖国给了她活下去的力量和信心。
