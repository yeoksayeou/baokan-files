    Fushun City's district-level grassroots political power organizations, established through universal suffrage and based on the system of People's Congresses, are actively implementing the policy of serving production, leading to significant improvements in their work. Currently, the first People's Congresses have been convened in all districts of Fushun City. The People's Congresses of each district have fully promoted the spirit of democracy, widely soliciting proposals from voters before the meetings. Over 800 district-level People's Representatives throughout the city have carefully reviewed the work of the People's Government at the district People's Congresses.

    In the five industrial and mining districts of Fushun City, an average of over 90% of the residents are workers and their families. In the past, the district People's Governments were not clear enough about the policy of serving production. At the recent People's Congresses, each district, based on the representatives' opinions, decided that in the future, the work of the mining district People's Governments should adopt various effective measures to implement the policy of serving industrial production. To cooperate with the production increase and economy drive of various factories and mines, each district has organized cadres to go deep into the streets and workers' residential areas to inspect and rectify workers' family mutual aid groups, and to organize new workers' family mutual aid groups, in order to guarantee and promote production. Recently, workers' family mutual aid groups in various streets have widely launched competitions. Their slogans are: Do a good job in housework, so that workers can eat well, rest well, be healthy, have high attendance rates, and produce well. Under the impetus and influence of their families, the workers' production enthusiasm is even more full, and attendance rates have generally increased. The attendance rate of workers in many mutual aid groups has reached 100%. Some workers' family members also encouraged their husbands to find solutions. Sui Yushi, a technician at the Victory Mine, after encouragement and help from his wife, Wang Sujie, researched a rationalization proposal to increase coal transportation volume, improving production.

    The People's Congresses convened in each suburban district after the general election all focused on discussing the development of mutual aid and cooperation. In the past, the leadership of each district in the mutual aid and cooperation movement was insufficient, with only slightly more than 40% of farm households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Many proposals and speeches by People's Representatives at the meetings pointed out this shortcoming. Based on these opinions, the People's Congresses of each suburban district made resolutions to strengthen the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to the preliminary plans of each district, the number of mutual aid teams in the suburbs of the city this year will increase by half compared to last year, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives and credit cooperatives will more than double. Currently, each suburban district is carrying out rectification work on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and is transferring and training a large number of key personnel to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    抚顺市各区人民代表大会
    积极贯彻为生产服务的方针
    抚顺市各区由普选产生的人民代表大会制的基层政权组织，积极贯彻为生产服务的方针，使工作有了很大改进。目前，抚顺市各区已普遍召开了第一次人民代表大会。各区的人民代表大会都充分发扬了民主精神，会前向选民广泛地征集了提案，全市八百多名区人民代表在区人民代表大会上认真地检查了人民政府的工作。
    抚顺市五个工矿区的居民，平均百分之九十以上是工人和工人家属。过去区人民政府对于为生产服务的方针不够明确。在最近召开的人民代表大会上，各区根据代表们的意见，决定今后矿区人民政府的工作应该采取各种有效措施，贯彻为工业生产服务的方针。为了配合各厂矿单位的增产节约运动，各区已组织干部深入街道和工人住宅区，检查和整顿工人家属互助组，组织新的工人家属互助组，以保证和推动生产。最近各街道的工人家属互助组已广泛展开了竞赛。她们的口号是：搞好家务，让工人吃得好、休息好、身体好、出勤率高、生产好。工人们在家属的推动影响下，生产情绪更加饱满，出勤率普遍提高。许多互助组里的工人出勤率达到百分之百。有些职工家属并鼓励丈夫找到了窍门。胜利矿技术员隋雨时经过他的妻子王素洁的鼓励和帮助，研究出一项增加运煤量的合理化建议，提高了生产。
    各郊区在普选后召开的人民代表大会，都着重讨论了发展互助合作的问题。各区过去对互助合作运动领导不够，参加互助合作组织的农户仅占总农户的百分之四十多。许多提案和人民代表在会上的发言都指出了这一缺点。各郊区的人民代表大会根据这些意见，作出了加强领导互助合作运动的决议。根据各区的初步计划，今年市郊各区的互助组将比去年增加一半，农业生产合作社和信贷合作社将增加一倍以上。目前各郊区正进行互助合作组织的整顿工作，并抽调和训练大批骨干，加强对互助合作组织的领导。　（新华社）
