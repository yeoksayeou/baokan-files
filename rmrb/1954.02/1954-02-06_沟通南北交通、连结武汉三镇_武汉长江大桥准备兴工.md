Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, February 5th: The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which the Chinese people have long awaited, is being actively prepared for construction. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will connect the two major north-south railway trunk lines, the Beijing-Hankou and Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railways, thereby connecting the Xianggui (Hunan-Guangxi) Railway, the Zhegan (Zhejiang-Jiangxi) Railway, the Longhai Railway in the north, and other trunk lines. Once this large iron bridge is completed, the Yangtze River, historically known as a natural barrier, will be transformed in Wuhan from a land obstacle to north-south transportation into a magnificent scenery outside the train window. The three towns of Wuhan will also be connected, becoming even more prosperous.

    The entire Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project includes the Yangtze River Bridge project spanning the Wuchang and Hanyang banks, the Han River Railway Bridge and the Han River Highway Bridge project spanning the Hankou and Hanyang banks, as well as the railway connecting line and overpass project within the approximately 14-kilometer section from Hankou Railway Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway to Wuchang Railway Station on the Yuehan Railway. The scale and technical complexity of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are unprecedented in the history of bridge construction in China and are rarely seen in world bridge engineering. According to the preliminary design, the main bridge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will be over one thousand meters long. It will be a dual-purpose railway and highway bridge, with a wide highway bridge above for vehicles and pedestrians, and a double-track railway bridge below for trains. The bridge body will be built on the narrowest part of the Yangtze River between Turtle Mountain and Snake Mountain within the urban area of Wuhan. To bear the heavy transportation tasks, the height and span of the bridge are also unprecedented in China. The entire bridge structure, from the bottom of the bridge pier to the top of the bridge deck, is equivalent in height to a twenty-story skyscraper. Whether during the flood season or the dry season, ships traveling up the Yangtze River can freely pass through here. Once the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is completed, it will dwarf China's famous Yellow River Iron Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Qiantang River Iron Bridge.

    The surveying and drilling work for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge began in March 1950. The surveying, drilling, and preliminary design of the bridge were carried out by well-known Chinese bridge experts and workers with the assistance and guidance of Soviet experts. To do a good job in the preliminary design of the bridge, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government specially established the Wuhan Bridge Design Team and convened meetings of domestic bridge experts, professors, and relevant units three times in 1950, 1951, and 1953 to conduct research. After the preliminary design was completed in May 1953, it was submitted to a specially established appraisal committee of twenty-five well-known Soviet experts and professors for thorough technical appraisal. Finally, the preliminary design of the bridge was revised based on the appraisal conclusions. The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will cultivate a group of bridge specialists for New China and lay the foundation for China's bridge cause.

    The Han River Railway Bridge project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge commenced in November 1953. The construction of the main bridge will officially begin in the fourth quarter of 1955. A series of extensive preparatory work before the construction of the main bridge is now being actively carried out. This includes technical design, factory and mechanized site layout, ordering and transporting a large amount of equipment and machinery, and gathering construction forces, all of which must be completed before the official construction period. Due to the wide and deep Yangtze and Han Rivers and the long duration of floods, mechanized and semi-mechanized construction methods will be used for the entire project, from constructing the bridge foundation and pouring concrete bridge piers to installing steel beams. In April 1953, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau was established in Wuhan City. Thousands of working cadres and engineering personnel in bridge, construction, railway, and civil engineering, including construction workers of more than fifty trades, have been transferred from railway bureaus and related units in Guangzhou, Liuzhou, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to support the construction project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Currently, building construction projects are actively underway. More than ten types of modern machinery such as pile drivers and cranes, various transportation vehicles, and ships are continuously arriving at the Han River Railway Bridge construction site. Larger-scale engineering preparation work is also about to begin.

    沟通南北交通、连结武汉三镇
    武汉长江大桥准备兴工
    【新华社武汉五日电】我国人民盼望已久的、横跨长江中游的武汉长江大桥正在积极准备兴建。武汉长江大桥将使纵贯我国南北的京汉、粤汉两大铁路干线连接起来，从而使南方的湘桂路、浙赣路和北方的陇海路以及其他的干线等也贯通起来。这座大铁桥建成后，历史上被称为天堑的长江，在武汉就将从南北交通的陆上障碍变为火车窗外的壮丽风景，武汉三镇也将连结起来，更趋繁荣。
    整个武汉长江大桥工程包括横跨武昌、汉阳两岸的长江大桥工程，横跨汉口、汉阳两岸的汉水铁桥、汉水公路桥工程，以及从京汉铁路汉口车站到粤汉铁路武昌车站约十四公里地段内的铁路联络线和跨线桥工程。武汉长江大桥规模的巨大和技术上复杂的程度，在我国桥梁建筑史上都是空前的，就是在世界桥梁工程上也是不多见的。武汉长江大桥正桥工程，按照初步设计，全长一千多公尺。它将是一个铁路、公路两用的桥梁，上面是宽阔的公路桥，通行汽车和行人；下面是双轨的铁路桥，往来火车。大桥的桥身将建筑在武汉市区内龟山、蛇山间最窄的江面上。为了担负重大的运输任务，大桥的高度和跨度在我国也都是空前的。整个的桥梁建筑物，从桥墩最底端算起，直到桥面最顶端，其高度相当于二十层的摩天大楼。不管是洪水季节或枯水季节，上溯长江的船舶，都可以自由地从这里通过。武汉长江大桥建成后，将使我国著名的京汉路黄河大铁桥和钱塘江铁桥为之逊色。
    武汉长江大桥的测量钻探工作是从一九五零年三月开始的，大桥的测量钻探和初步设计都是由我国著名的桥梁专家和职工在苏联专家的帮助和指导下进行的。为了作好大桥的初步设计，中央人民政府铁道部曾专门成立了武汉大桥设计组，并在一九五零年、一九五一年和一九五三年三次召集国内桥梁专家、教授和有关单位举行会议，进行研究。初步设计在一九五三年五月完成之后，又送请苏联政府特设的以二十五位苏联著名的专家教授组成的鉴定委员会在技术上进行缜密鉴定。最后，大桥初步设计根据鉴定结论作了修正。武汉长江大桥的兴建，将为新中国培养出一批桥梁专门人材，为中国的桥梁事业奠定基础。
    武汉长江大桥的汉水铁桥工程已在一九五三年十一月开工，大桥正桥将在一九五五年第四季度正式施工，现在大桥正桥工程施工前的一系列浩繁的准备工作正在积极进行。包括技术设计、工厂化和机械化的工地布置，庞大的器材机具的订购和运输，以及建筑力量的集结等，都要在正式施工前的期间内完成。由于长江、汉水面宽水深、洪水持续期长，全部工程从构筑桥梁基础、浇灌混凝土桥墩到安装钢梁等，都将采用机械化和半机械化的施工方法。一九五三年四月，武汉长江大桥工程局在武汉市成立。数以千计的工作干部和桥梁、建筑、线路、土木等工程人员，包括有五十多个工种的建筑工人，纷纷从广州、柳州、郑州、上海、天津等铁路局和有关单位调集拢来，支援武汉长江大桥的修建工程。目前房屋建筑工程已在积极兴工。打桩、起重等十多种现代化机械，各种运输车辆和船舶等，正在源源地到达汉水铁桥工地。更大规模的工程准备工作也即将展开。
