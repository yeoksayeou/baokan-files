Xinhua News Agency, Guisui, February 27th: The First Session of the Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Suiyuan Province was held in Guisui City from January 11th to 17th. In addition to listening to the report by Ulanhu, Chairman of the People's Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and concurrently Chairman of the People's Government of Suiyuan Province, on the general line and general task during the transitional period of the state, the conference focused on discussing the proposal of the CPC Central Committee Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau on merging Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, and unanimously adopted the important resolution to merge Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, abolish the administrative establishment of Suiyuan Province, and unify the leadership under the People's Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Since all 405 representatives from all ethnic groups and all circles who attended the meeting personally experienced the existence of problems such as the unreasonable coexistence of banners and counties in the form of political power and agricultural and pastoral disputes left over from the history of the Suiyuan area, which caused many difficulties to further strengthen national unity and further develop various construction undertakings, when Su Qianyi, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-bureau, reported on the proposal to merge Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, the audience burst into prolonged applause to express their warm support for the proposal. In their speeches, representatives from all ethnic groups and all circles unanimously believed that since the liberation of Suiyuan Province, the great ethnic policy of Chairman Mao has been implemented, fundamentally eliminating the inequality between ethnic groups left over by the reactionary ruling class of the old society, and establishing the Ulanqab League and the Ikh Zhao League Mongolian Autonomous Regions, as well as the Guisui City and Baotou City Hui Autonomous Regions. At the same time, it has extensively united the people of all ethnic groups and all circles, carried out a series of social reforms such as land reform, and conducted patriotic education and internationalist education for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. These fundamental measures have played an important role in raising the awareness and production enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups and in the restoration and development of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production in the province, thereby providing the necessary conditions for the merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia. Therefore, in the discussion, representatives from all ethnic groups and all circles unanimously believed that the merger of Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia is conducive to further strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups, to mobilizing the people of all ethnic groups to actively participate in the construction of the Baotou heavy industry base and other construction projects, and to further developing agricultural and animal husbandry production and rationally adjusting the boundaries of banners and counties. The proposal and its adoption are in line with the fundamental and long-term interests of the people of Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, and all ethnic groups in the country.

The meeting also resolved to change the original Jining and Shanba Special Regions into Pingdiquan and Hetao Administrative Regions. These two administrative regions are primary-level political powers with the Han nationality as the main body under the leadership of the People's Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is in line with the spirit of the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy. The meeting was filled with the spirit of national unity and building the motherland from beginning to end, and the representatives unanimously expressed that they would unite the people of all ethnic groups to strive to build the motherland into a great socialist country.

    绥远省一届三次各界人民代表会议
    决议绥远与内蒙古合并
    【新华社归绥二十七日电】绥远省第一届第三次各界人民代表会议于一月十一日到十七日在归绥市举行。这次会议除听取了内蒙古自治区人民政府兼绥远省人民政府主席乌兰夫关于国家过渡时期总路线总任务的传达报告外，着重讨论了中共中央蒙绥分局关于绥远和内蒙古合并的建议，并一致通过了绥远、内蒙古合并，撤销绥远省建制，统一由内蒙古自治区人民政府领导的重要决议。
    由于到会的四百零五名各族各界代表都亲身体验到，绥远地区历史上遗留下来的不合理的旗县并存的政权形式和农牧纠纷等问题的存在，对进一步加强民族团结和进一步发展各项建设事业，都有不少困难，当中共中央蒙绥分局副书记苏谦益代表中共中央蒙绥分局报告了关于绥远和内蒙古合并的建议后，全场即报以经久不息的掌声，表示热烈拥护这个建议。各族各界代表在发言中一致认为：绥远省解放几年来，由于贯彻了毛主席的伟大民族政策，已将过去旧社会反动统治阶级遗留下来的民族之间的不平等根本消除了，并已建立了乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟蒙族自治区和归绥市、包头市回民自治区；同时广泛地团结了各族各界人民，进行了土地改革等一系列社会改革工作和抗美援朝的爱国主义教育与国际主义教育。这些带有根本性的措施，对提高各族人民的觉悟程度和生产积极性，对全省工业、农业和畜牧业生产的恢复与发展都起了重要作用，从而对绥远和内蒙古的合并，提供了应有的条件。所以各族各界代表在讨论中，一致认为绥远和内蒙古的合并，有利于进一步加强各民族团结，有利于动员各族人民积极参加包头重工业基地建设及其他各项建设，有利于农牧业生产的进一步发展和旗县界限的合理调整。这个建议的提出和通过，是符合于内蒙古和绥远以及全国各族人民的根本和长远利益的。
    会议并决议将原集宁、陕坝两专区改为平地泉和河套两行政区，这两个行政区都是在内蒙古自治区人民政府领导下的以汉族为主体的一级政权，这是符合民族区域自治实施纲要精神的。会议从始到终充满了民族团结、建设祖国的精神，代表们一致表示要团结各族人民为建设祖国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
