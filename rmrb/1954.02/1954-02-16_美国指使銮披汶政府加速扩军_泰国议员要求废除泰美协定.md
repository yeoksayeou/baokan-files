Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 12th: Reports from Bangkok: While actively participating in the Indochina War, the United States is instigating the Thai Phibunsongkhram regime to accelerate its military expansion.

According to Thai newspapers, the Phibunsongkhram regime is preparing to implement a plan in February aimed at doubling its military strength by establishing so-called "volunteer corps." It is planned to forcibly conscript 100,000 young people nationwide into the "volunteer corps" between 1954 and 1955 for military training. To suppress resistance to the forced conscription of the "volunteer corps," the Phibunsongkhram regime stipulates that anyone who opposes or mocks participation in the "volunteer corps" will be subject to fines and imprisonment. According to reports, the equipment needed for this plan is supplied by the United States.

The Phibunsongkhram regime's plan to expand its army is being carried out according to U.S. instructions. According to United Press, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Donovan requested instructions from Washington authorities in January and then returned to his post in Bangkok with "suggestions for increasing the Thai army." Upon returning to Bangkok, he also guaranteed that the United States "will give more military assistance to Thai forces."

The United States will also send a group of "special training officers" to Thailand to implement a plan to further militarize the police. The Phibunsongkhram regime has therefore decided to establish large-scale "police training camps" starting in 1954.

The United States is also paying close attention to the expansion of Thailand's air force and navy. A "delegation" of twenty-eight U.S. Air Force officers arrived in Thailand in early February to first investigate the situation of the Thai Air Force. The United States recently gave the Phibunsongkhram regime four warships as "aid" and sent U.S. warships to Thailand to participate in the so-called "first Thai-U.S. naval joint operation exercise."

Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: Bangkok News: On February 5th, Thai parliamentarian Niang Yan Niralai requested in parliament that the Phibunsongkhram government abolish an unequal Thai-U.S. agreement signed in 1925. The agreement stipulates that Americans entering Thailand do not need to apply for visas, while Thais going to the United States do.

Thai Foreign Minister Narathip admitted that this provision of the Thai-U.S. agreement is unequal, but he said that the Thai authorities will maintain the original decision.

### 美国指使銮披汶政府加速扩军  泰国议员要求废除泰美协定

    美国指使銮披汶政府加速扩军
    泰国议员要求废除泰美协定
    【新华社广州十二日电】曼谷消息：美国在积极参与印度支那战争的同时，正指使泰国銮披汶政权加速扩充军队。 
    据泰国报纸刊载：銮披汶政权准备在二月份开始实施一项目的在于加倍扩军的建立所谓“志愿队”的计划，预定在一九五四年和一九五五年间在全国范围内强迫征集十万青年编入“志愿队”，实施军事训练。为了镇压对强迫征集“志愿队”的反抗，銮披汶政权规定：任何反对或嘲笑参加“志愿队”的人将受罚款和监禁的处分。据消息说：这一计划所需的军备都由美国供给。
    銮披汶政权扩充军队的计划，是按照美国的指示行事的。据合众社透露，美国驻泰国大使杜诺万一月间向华盛顿当局请示后，携带了“增加泰国军队的建议”返曼谷任所。他在回到曼谷时又曾提出保证：美国“将以更多的军事援助给予泰国部队”。
    美国还将派遣一批“特别训练官”到泰国去实施一项使警察进一步军事化的计划。銮披汶政权因此决定了在一九五四年度开始设立大规模的“警察训练营”。
    美国对扩充泰国的空军和海军也很注意。一个由二十八个美国空军军官组成的“代表团”二月初到泰国去，首先调查泰国空军的情况。美国最近还给銮披汶政权以军舰四艘的“援助”，并派遣了美国军舰到泰国参加所谓“第一次泰美海军联合作战演习”。
    【新华社十五日讯】曼谷消息：泰国议员娘眼妮叻二月五日在议会上要求銮披汶政府废除一项在一九二五年签订的不平等的泰美协定。该协定规定美国人进入泰国不必办理签证手续，而泰国人到美国去却需要签证。
    泰国外交部部长那拉底承认泰美协定的这个规定是不平等的，但他说，泰国当局仍将保持原有的决定。
