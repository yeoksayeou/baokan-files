    Xinhua News Agency, 19th: In commemoration of "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," the All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth and forwarded it to the youth of colonial and oppressed countries. The telegram reads as follows:

To the World Federation of Democratic Youth and our young friends in colonial and oppressed countries:

    On this February 21st, World Youth "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," Chinese youth extend warm and high respects to the World Federation of Democratic Youth and all youth striving for national independence and opposing colonialism. Chinese youth are watching with concern the heroic struggles of youth in colonial and oppressed countries for peace, national independence, and their own rights, and are encouraged by every achievement these countries' youth have made in their struggles. We firmly believe that your struggle for freedom and independence will surely be victorious, and no force can stop the victorious advance of the youth and people of oppressed nations.

    The aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism continues to intensify the enslavement of colonial peoples, create international tensions, and expand its aggressive conspiracies. Chinese youth deeply sympathize with the current situation of colonial youth, and we will devote all our enthusiasm and wisdom to the socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of our motherland, in order to defend peace in Asia and the world, and to support the just struggles of youth and people in oppressed countries. We once again express our willingness to unite closely with the youth of the world, to strive together to ease international tensions, safeguard national independence, and strive for the cessation of current wars of aggression!

                  All-China Democratic Youth Federation

    【新华社十九日讯】中华全国民主青年联合会为纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”，致电世界民主青年联盟并转殖民地、被压迫国家的青年。电文如下：世界民主青年联盟并转殖民地、被压迫国家的青年朋友：
    值此二月二十一日世界青年“反对殖民制度斗争日”，中国青年向世界民主青年联盟及一切争取民族独立、反对殖民制度的青年致以热烈崇高的敬礼。中国青年以关切的心情，注视着殖民地、被压迫国家青年争取和平、民族独立与切身权利的英勇斗争，并为这些国家的青年在斗争中所获得的每一个成就而鼓舞。我们坚信：你们争取自由独立的斗争，一定会获得胜利，没有任何力量能够阻挡被压迫民族青年与人民胜利前进。
    以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团今天仍然继续加紧奴役殖民地人民，制造国际紧张局势，扩大侵略阴谋。中国青年异常同情殖民地青年当前的处境，我们将以全部热情与智慧致力于祖国的社会主义工业化与社会主义改造事业，以保卫亚洲与世界和平，支援被压迫国家青年与人民的正义斗争。我们再一次表示：我们愿与全世界青年紧密团结，为缓和国际紧张局势，维护民族独立，争取停止现行侵略战争而共同奋斗！
