    Xinhua News Agency, Laos Dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency, in early February, the Lao People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale offensive, liberating the very rich Nam Ou River basin in northern Laos. For the past eight years, the people of this area have never ceased their struggle. They established their own government and armed forces, and once liberated the Nam Bo area in the spring of 1953.
    During their occupation, the French aggressors committed heinous crimes: burning the residents' grain, destroying fishing boats, and frantically slaughtering the people. But these acts of terror only deepened the people's anger and hatred. When the Lao People's Liberation Army launched an offensive against the French military strongholds in the area, the panicked enemy also planned to drive the local residents to Luang Prabang. But people fled into the jungle in droves; when the Lao People's Liberation Army arrived, they came out of hiding and happily returned to their hometowns.
    When the victorious Lao People's Liberation Army entered the villages, very moving scenes occurred. Gray-haired old people saw the soldiers of the Lao People's Liberation Army, and tears streamed down their cheeks. They said to the soldiers: A few months ago, the invaders destroyed all our fishing boats and burned dozens of granaries. But they cannot conquer the people. The people of the Nam Ou River basin have been waiting for you. Children sang and danced with the soldiers. They said: We hate the French aggressors. They stole our fish and oranges from the garden, they brutally abused our parents, and burned our books.
    Many people volunteered to follow the Lao People's Liberation Army to pursue the fleeing enemy. People everywhere are husking rice to supply their troops, and launching a production increase competition. The newly liberated areas are filled with joy.

    寮国解放军受到南乌江流域人民热烈欢迎
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社寮国讯：二月初，寮国人民解放军发动大规模的攻势，解放了寮国北部非常富庶的南乌江流域。过去八年来，这个地区的人民一直未停止过斗争，他们建立了自己的政府和武装，在一九五三年春季曾一度解放了南博地区。
    法国侵略者在占领期间曾犯下了滔天的罪行：烧毁居民的谷物，毁坏了渔船，又疯狂的屠杀人民。但是这些恐怖行为只有加深人民的愤怒和仇恨。当寮国人民解放军对这个地区的法军据点发动攻势时，慌忙逃跑的敌军还打算把当地居民赶到琅勃剌邦去。但是人们成批成批地逃进丛林；寮国人民解放军来了，他们就从躲藏的地方出来，欢天喜地的回到自己的故乡。
    当胜利的寮国人民解放军进入村庄时，出现了非常动人的场面。白发苍苍的老年人看到寮国人民解放军的战士时，眼泪从他们的面颊上流了下来。他们向战士们说：几个月前，侵略者破坏了我们的全部渔船，烧毁了几十个谷仓。但是他们征服不了人民，南乌江流域的人民一直在盼望你们。儿童们和战士们一道唱歌、跳舞。他们说：我们憎恨法国侵略者。他们抢走了我们的鱼和花园中的橘子，他们野蛮地虐待我们的父母，烧掉我们的书本。
    有不少人自愿跟着寮国人民解放军去追击残敌。各处人民都在舂米供应给自己的部队，并展开了增产竞赛。新解放地区到处喜气洋洋。
