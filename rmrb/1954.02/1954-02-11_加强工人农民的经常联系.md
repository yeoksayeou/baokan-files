　　Strengthen the Frequent Contact Between Workers and Peasants

　　Around the Spring Festival this year, large-scale, mass activities to strengthen worker-peasant ties have unfolded across the country. Workers and peasants visited each other, held various forums and get-togethers, and visited factories and rural areas, respectively. Many workers also established correspondence and other regular contact methods with peasants. Through these activities, workers have gained a better understanding of the production and living conditions of peasants, and vice versa; their daily contact has been further strengthened, and their enthusiasm for production has been greatly enhanced.

　　Now the worker-peasant get-together activities are continuing. Some workers who returned to their hometowns have returned to the factories, and many peasants who visited factories and workers who visited rural areas have returned to their posts, beginning to use various means to convey the results of their visits and get-togethers to workers and peasants. We should seize this opportunity to formulate some practical and feasible methods to regularize the activities of strengthening worker-peasant ties, consolidate the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to accept the leadership of the working class and support the national industrialization construction, and the enthusiasm of the working masses to play a model role in national construction and help the socialist transformation of agriculture, with a certain system, and implement it into daily actions. As everyone knows, constantly strengthening the worker-peasant alliance is a reliable guarantee for our socialist construction cause that is underway. With the development of the national construction cause, industry requires more and more support from agriculture, and agriculture requires more and more assistance from industry. The relationship between workers and peasants is becoming increasingly close, and the demands of both sides are gradually increasing. Therefore, many new problems will inevitably arise and be exposed. For example, due to the needs of capital construction, it is necessary to purchase a portion of the peasants' land; due to the development of agricultural production, industry is required to supply more new means of production; due to the improvement of the lives of workers and peasants, peasants require workers to supply more and better industrial products, and workers require peasants to supply more grain and non-staple foods, etc. We should take all necessary measures to solve these problems in a timely manner and promote the development of the national construction cause; and strengthening the frequent contact between workers and peasants, so that workers and peasants can fully understand each other, and be able to work together with one heart, is an extremely effective measure to solve these problems.

　　The purpose of strengthening the frequent contact between workers and peasants is to enable workers and peasants to know each other's opinions and requirements at any time, to be constantly encouraged by each other's creative labor, and to solve various relationship issues involving the daily interests of workers and peasants in a timely manner, so as to promote the continuous progress of industrial and agricultural production. Under the current conditions in our country, economic cooperation is the solid foundation of the worker-peasant alliance. Only by continuously developing industrial and agricultural production can the material and cultural demands of workers and peasants be gradually met, and the worker-peasant alliance be increasingly consolidated. Therefore, the Party organizations and administrative aspects in industrial and mining enterprises, transportation departments, state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and rural areas must focus on this fundamental purpose and lead the activities of frequent contact between workers and peasants. Many regions have already created good experiences in this regard. For example, some of the methods adopted by the Nanjing Electric Porcelain Factory and the Nanjing Light Bulb Factory are practical and feasible. They send workers to visit peasants, take photos of some model deeds of peasants and exhibit them in factories, and invite representatives who visit rural areas to report their feelings to workers; they regularly hold worker-peasant get-togethers, report the situation of industrial production to the peasants participating in the get-togethers, and invite peasant representatives to visit the factories; on the principle of not hindering production, when peasants suffer from natural disasters, they help peasants with the factory's equipment and technology; they solve some relationship issues between workers and peasants in a timely manner, etc. Through these activities, workers understand the situation of peasants and rural areas, and peasants understand the situation of workers and industrial production. This effectively improves the socialist consciousness of workers and peasants, encourages the production enthusiasm of workers and peasants, and strengthens the relationship between workers and peasants. Similar measures, which do not cost much money or require much effort, are easy to achieve as long as the leadership truly understands its important significance and regularly gives it sufficient attention and conducts necessary organizational and political work. It should be pointed out that industry is concentrated, workers are organized, and the strength of the factory is relatively abundant. Therefore, in order to strengthen the frequent contact between workers and peasants, the factory should assume more responsibility and take an active and positive attitude to contact and unite the nearby peasants. Of course, the peasants near the factory, especially those who have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, should also try to take the initiative to contact the factory and workers and provide necessary assistance.

　　In order to establish frequent contact between workers and peasants, each enterprise unit should determine different priorities and practices according to the nature of the enterprise. Some departments, such as railway, highway, and shipping departments, directly serve the vast number of peasants, and some of its measures often involve the specific interests of peasants along the land and water lines. The staff and workers of these departments should pay special attention to their service attitude when dealing with peasant passengers and give more consideration to peasant passengers. In the construction of equipment, the interests of peasants should be fully taken into account, and no trouble should be caused to peasants, causing resentment among peasants. Some departments, such as farm tool factories and textile factories, produce means of production and living materials directly needed by peasants. The staff and workers of these departments should hold forums with peasants in a planned way or conduct individual visits to peasants to investigate and study their needs so as to carry out production according to their requirements. Some departments, such as state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in small towns and rural areas, work with and serve peasants. Only by adapting to the requirements of peasants as much as possible and obtaining the help of peasants can they complete their tasks well. The staff and workers of these departments should regularly hold typical investigation meetings, establish and improve systems such as "Customer Opinion Books" and "Out-of-Stock Registration Books" in order to understand the needs of peasants in a timely manner, improve their own management, and transfer the opinions of peasants to the production departments, so as to realize the role of influencing and promoting production. Some departments, such as factories and mines conducting capital construction, are most likely to have problems in purchasing land from peasants; the leaders and the broad masses of staff and workers of these departments must implement the principle of ensuring the land needed for national construction while taking care of the vital interests of peasants, implement the policy of saving land, strictly compress the land use plan, and do their best to avoid purchasing land that can be purchased or not, and not purchase land too early if construction is not carried out for the time being, and make full use of available wasteland, and use less or no land and good farmland in densely populated areas. For the land that must be purchased, we must do a good job of propaganda and education for the peasants concerned, so that they will consciously and voluntarily obey the long-term interests of the people and the interests of the country, and be responsible for helping them solve production, life and relocation problems. As long as these tasks are done well, not only will it not cause opposition from peasants, but it will also get help from peasants and establish a good relationship with peasants. Some departments, such as heavy industry factories and mines, do not produce means of production and living materials directly needed by peasants, but they can and should use visits, exhibitions and other methods to educate peasants about industrialization, so that peasants can see the superiority of large-scale industrial production with their own eyes, understand the importance of developing heavy industry for the country and for peasants, and thus consciously support the great cause of socialist industrialization. At the same time, within the scope that does not affect the production of factories and mines, we can draw out a certain amount of strength and take the method of fixing areas as much as possible to help peasants technically and materially, such as supporting peasants with certain technologies and equipment to overcome natural disasters, repairing new farm tools for peasants, and so on.

　　Of course, giving peasants some direct material assistance by workers is only one aspect of the leading role and exemplary role that the working masses should play in the worker-peasant alliance. There is also a more important aspect, that is, the working masses should influence peasants with their own selfless labor enthusiasm, high socialist consciousness and selfless spirit, guide peasants to take the socialist road, and educate peasants to get rid of the influence of capitalism in their daily actions. Gao Fushan, chairman of the trade union of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, often helps with the work of the village where he lives, gives Party lectures to the rural branch, gives policy lectures to rural cadres, and helps peasants develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, he is loved by the peasants in the whole village and was elected as a people's representative in the general election. Generally speaking, workers have higher political consciousness and cultural level than peasants. As long as they consciously assume the glorious responsibility of helping peasants regularly, it will play a great role in accelerating the country's socialist transformation of agriculture.

　　The primary task of peasants in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is to strive to support the country's socialist industrialization construction, actively participate in the socialist transformation of agriculture, and try to make their own production and management conform to the country's plan. Peasants must produce more grain and various cash crop raw materials in order to meet the needs of national industrialization construction in order to obtain more and more assistance from industry. However, peasants must actively participate in production, credit, and supply and marketing mutual aid and cooperation organizations in order to be sure to increase grain and cash crop production. The working masses welcome peasants to take the socialist road. The broad masses of workers encourage peasants to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and are determined to improve production and help peasants organize in worker-peasant get-together activities, which is a clear example. Of course, it is also very necessary and possible for peasants to give workers some direct assistance within the possible scope, for example, participating in the construction work of some equipment and roads of industrial and mining enterprises, helping workers living in villages solve difficulties in life, and organizing workers' families to participate in possible agricultural production. The rural Party branch is a fortress for the working class to lead peasants forward. Strengthening the education of the worker-peasant alliance and organizing activities for worker-peasant contact should become its regular task.

　　This worker-peasant get-together activity was mainly carried out in large industrial and mining enterprises and cities by famous industrial labor models and peasants participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Of course, this is very necessary. It can create an atmosphere of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and have a huge and universal impact. However, some small factories, grass-roots state-owned stores and cooperatives should also carry out this work. Those who have not done it in the past should take various possible methods to make up for it before the Lantern Festival. It is absolutely necessary to do more work for peasants participating in mutual aid and cooperation, but individual peasants must never be ignored; individual peasants must be absorbed to participate in the activities of organizing worker-peasant get-togethers and peasants visiting factories, so as to influence and educate the broad masses of individual peasants. It is right that all regions have organized extensive worker-peasant get-togethers, visits and tours; but in areas where worker-peasant relations problems have occurred in the past, the Party and government organizations of factories and mines and rural areas should also come forward, seize one or two typical examples, and seriously solve them with the spirit of self-criticism on both sides, in order to educate the broad masses of workers and peasants and establish a good start for solving various problems in a timely and regular manner. All industrial and mining enterprises should, on the basis of the universal improvement of workers and peasants' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance, start to establish some regular resident work systems, use grass-roots political power and people's congresses to solve the problems occurring between workers and peasants in a timely manner, and establish fixed contacts between workers and peasants. As long as both workers and peasants have a deep understanding of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and they all feel an urgent need to establish regular contact between workers and peasants, they will come up with many methods. Party committees at all levels should pay attention to summarizing and promoting various effective methods created by the worker-peasant masses and conscientiously lead this work.

    加强工人农民的经常联系
    今年春节前后，全国各地展开了大规模的、群众性的加强工农联系的活动。工人和农民互相访问，举行各种座谈会和联欢会，分别参观工厂和农村，许多工人还和农民建立了通信关系和其他经常联系的办法。通过这些活动，工人对于农民、农民对于工人的生产和生活状况是更加了解了，他们之间的日常联系是进一步加强了，他们的生产积极性是大大提高了。
    现在工农联欢的活动正在继续进行中。有的回乡工人已返回工厂，许多到工厂访问的农民和到农村访问的工人也回到自己的岗位，开始运用各种方式，向工人、农民传达访问和联欢的结果。我们应该抓紧这个时机，定出一些切实可行的办法，使加强工农联系的活动经常化，把广大农民的接受工人阶级的领导、支持国家工业化建设的热情，把工人群众的在国家建设中起模范作用和帮助农业的社会主义改造的热情，用一定的制度巩固下来，并贯彻到日常行动中去。大家知道，时时刻刻加强工农联盟，是我们正在进行的社会主义建设事业的可靠保证。随着国家建设事业的发展，工业要求农业给予越来越多的支持，农业要求工业给予越来越多的援助，工农关系日益密切了，双方的要求逐渐提高了，因此，许多新的问题，就必然陆续产生和暴露出来。例如，由于基本建设的需要，必须征购农民一部分土地；由于农业生产的发展，要求工业供给更多新的生产资料；由于工人、农民生活的改善，农民要求工人供应更多更好的工业品，工人要求农民供应更多的粮食、副食品，等等。我们应该采取各种必要的措施，及时解决这些问题，促进国家建设事业的发展；而加强工人农民的经常性的联系，使工人和农民能够完全了解，能够和衷共济，则是解决这些问题的极为有效的措施。
    加强工人农民的经常性联系的目的，是使工农双方随时知道对方的意见和要求，经常从对方的创造性劳动中得到应有的鼓舞，及时解决各种涉及工农日常利益的关系问题，以推动工农业生产的不断前进。在我国目前条件下，经济合作是工农联盟的坚实基础，只有不断发展工农业生产，才能使工人和农民的物质和文化要求逐步得到满足，使工农联盟日益巩固。因此，工矿企业、交通部门、国营商业、合作社和农村中党的组织与行政方面，必须围绕这个根本的目的，领导工人、农民的经常性联系的活动。许多地区在这方面早已创造了良好的经验。例如，国营南京电瓷厂和南京灯泡厂采取的一些办法，就是切实可行的。它们派工人访问农民，把农民中的一些模范事迹拍成照片到工厂展览，并请访问农村的代表向工人报告自己的感想；经常举行工农联欢会，向参加联欢会的农民报告工业生产的情况，并邀请农民代表到工厂参观；在不妨碍生产的原则下，在农民遭受自然灾害的时候，以工厂的设备和技术帮助农民；及时解决工人和农民间发生的一些关系问题，等等。通过这些活动，工人懂得了农民和农村的情况，农民懂得了工人和工业生产的情况，这就有效地提高了工人、农民的社会主义觉悟，鼓舞了工人、农民的生产热情，密切了工人和农民的关系。类似这样的措施，既不必花多少钱，也不必费很大气力，只要领导方面真正懂得了它的重要意义，经常给以足够的注意，进行必要的组织工作和政治工作，是很容易作到的。应该指出：工业是集中的，工人是有组织的，工厂方面的力量是比较充裕的，因此，为了加强工农的经常性的联系，工厂应该担负更多的责任，以主动的积极的态度，去联系和团结附近的农民。当然，工厂附近的农民，特别是参加了互助合作组织的农民，也应该尽量主动地和工厂、工人取得联系，并给以必要的帮助。
    为了建立工农的经常的联系，各个企业单位应该根据企业的性质，确定不同的重点和作法。有些部门，例如铁路、公路和航运部门，直接为广大农民服务，它的某些措施又经常涉及水陆沿线农民的具体利益。这些部门的职工，在对待农民乘客方面，应该特别注意自己的服务态度，给农民乘客以更多的照顾。在修建设备方面，应该充分照顾农民的利益，不要给农民增加麻烦，引起农民的反感。有些部门，例如农具厂、纺织厂，生产农民直接需用的生产资料和生活资料。这些部门的职工，应该有计划地和农民举行座谈会或对农民进行个别访问，调查研究他们的需要，以便根据他们的要求进行生产。有些部门，例如小城镇和农村中的国营商店和供销合作社，工作对象和服务对象都是农民，只有尽量适应农民的要求，取得农民的帮助，才能很好地完成自己的任务。这些部门的职工，应该经常举办典型调查会，建立和健全“顾客意见簿”、“缺货登记簿”等制度，以便及时了解农民的需要，改善自己的经营管理，并把农民的意见转达给生产部门，实现影响和推进生产的作用。有些部门，例如进行基本建设的厂矿，在征购农民土地方面，最容易发生问题；这些部门的领导者和广大职工，必须贯彻既保证国家建设所需土地，又照顾农民切身利益的原则，实行节约用地的方针，严格压缩用地计划，作到可购可不购者尽量不购，暂时尚不施工者不要过早征购，尽量利用可资利用的荒地，不用或少用人烟稠密地区的土地和良田。对于必须征购的土地，就要对有关农民作好宣传教育工作，使之自觉自愿地服从人民长远利益和国家的利益，并负责帮助他们解决生产、生活和迁移问题。只要作好这些工作，就不但不会引起农民的反对，还会得到农民的帮助，和农民建立起良好的关系。有些部门，例如重工业厂矿，并不生产农民直接需用的生产资料和生活资料，但是可以和应该运用参观、展览等方式，对农民进行工业化的教育，使农民亲眼看到大工业生产的优越性，懂得发展重工业对于国家和对于农民的重要意义，从而自觉地支持社会主义工业化的伟大事业。同时，还可以在不影响厂矿生产的范围内，抽出一定的力量，尽可能采取固定地区的办法，在技术上和物质上帮助农民，如以某些技术、设备支援农民战胜自然灾害，替农民修理新式农具，等等。
    当然，由工人给予农民某些直接的物质援助，这只是工人群众在工农联盟中应该发挥的领导作用和模范作用的一个方面。还有一个更重要的方面，即工人群众应该以自己的奋不顾身的劳动热情，高度的社会主义觉悟和大公无私的精神，在日常行动中影响农民，引导农民走社会主义的道路，教育农民摆脱资本主义的影响。鞍山钢铁公司总厂工会主席高福山同志经常帮助所住村庄的工作，给农村支部讲党课，给农村干部讲政策，帮助农民发展互助合作运动，因而得到全村农民的爱护，在普选中被选为人民代表。一般地说，工人的政治觉悟和文化水平都比农民高，他们只要自觉地担负起经常帮助农民的光荣责任，对加速国家对农业的社会主义改造的工作，将会起很大的作用。
    农民在巩固工农联盟中的首要任务，就是努力支援国家的社会主义工业化的建设，积极参加对农业的社会主义改造事业，尽量使自己的生产和经营符合国家的计划。农民要从工业方面取得越来越多的援助，就必须多多生产粮食和各种经济作物原料，以适应国家工业化建设的需要。但农民必须积极参加生产的、信用的、供销的互助合作组织，才能有把握地增产粮食和经济作物。工人群众是欢迎农民走社会主义道路的，广大工人群众在工农联欢活动中，鼓舞农民积极参加互助合作组织，决心提高生产帮助农民组织起来，就是显明的例证。当然，农民在可能的范围内，给予工人某些直接的帮助，例如，参加工矿企业某些设备、道路的修建工作，帮助住村工人解决生活方面的困难，组织工人家属参加可能的农业生产，也是十分必要和可能的。农村党支部是工人阶级领导农民前进的堡垒，加强工农联盟的教育和组织工农联系的活动，应该成为它经常注意的任务。
    这次工农联欢的活动，主要是在大的工矿企业和城市，由著名的工业劳动模范和参加互助合作组织的农民进行的。当然，这是十分必要的，它可以造成加强工农联盟的空气，发生巨大普遍的影响。但一些小的工厂、基层国营商店和合作社，同样应该进行这一工作。过去没有作的，应该采取各种可能的方法，在元宵节前进行补课。向参加互助合作的农民多作一些工作，这是完全必要的，但绝不可忽略单干农民；在组织工农联欢和农民参观工厂的活动中，必须吸收单干农民参加，以便影响和教育广大个体农民。各地组织了广泛的工农联欢、访问、参观，这是对的；但过去发生过工农关系问题的地区，还应该由厂矿企业和农村的党政组织出面，抓紧一、二典型事例，双方均以自我批评的精神，认真加以解决，以教育广大工人和农民，树立一个及时地、经常地解决各种问题的良好的开端。各个工矿企业应该在工人、农民普遍提高对工农联盟认识的基础上，着手建立一些经常性的居民工作制度，运用基层政权和人民代表大会，及时解决工农间发生的问题，建立工农的固定联系。只要工农双方对于加强工农联盟都有了深刻的认识，对于建立工农间的经常联系都感到了迫切的需要，他们是会想出许多办法来的。各地党委应该注意总结和推广工农群众创造的各种有效的办法，认真领导这一工作。
