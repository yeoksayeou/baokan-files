Beijing's Suburban Spring Festival Literary and Art Activities

The Spring Festival literary and art activities in more than 300 townships in the capital's suburbs were unprecedentedly active this year, with many literary and art programs publicizing the general line and the general election.

The hundreds of literary and art programs performed in the suburbs by ten professional literary and art troupes and school literary performance teams in Beijing were generally popular among farmers. The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe and the Central Broadcasting Ballad Music Troupe performed in the Haidian District in the western suburbs, and farmers from the eastern suburbs also came to watch. When a literary performance team composed of more than 50 students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts performed in Datun Township, there were more than 5,000 spectators in one performance. Farmers from villages more than a dozen miles away came in nearly a hundred carts to see the show. After watching the one-act plays "People Strive for Higher Positions," "Before the Wheat Harvest," and "Grain" performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the members of the newly established Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liutun Township held discussions on the stories in the plays. Wang Yongfu, a member who was wavering after joining the cooperative, also strengthened his thinking. Many members expressed that they must run the cooperative well and take the socialist road. Each professional literary and art troupe held forums with farmers at the end of each performance. Literary and art enthusiasts among the capital's workers also actively went to the countryside to perform for farmer brothers during the Spring Festival. The Changchun Workers' Amateur Troupe of the Qianmen District printing industry newly rehearsed the Ping opera "The Group Leader and the Son-in-Law," which is about the socialist transformation of agriculture, and performed it at the Shucun First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haidian District. Some factories also showed new movies to farmers.

The farmers' mass literary and art activities were also more active than in previous years, and many farmers' amateur troupes rushed to rehearse literary and art programs publicizing the general line and the general election. The nine township farmers' amateur troupes in Nanyuan District also held a literary and art festival during the Spring Festival. The Nanyuan Town Farmers' Amateur Literary and Art Group's performances of storytelling and singing "Learning to Work," "Racing Dance," and "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance" were warmly welcomed by the audience. The Jixian Township Farmers' Amateur Troupe also adapted children's games into the "Palm Dance" for performance. After watching the Ping opera "The Group Leader and the Son-in-Law," Zhu Jinsheng, a self-employed farmer, voluntarily asked to join the mutual aid group. Wang Yuzhen and Zhu Fu of Datun Township in the eastern suburbs adapted the real people and events of the local area into the drama "Selling Surplus Grain by Cart," which was performed by the township farmers' amateur troupe and had a very good effect. Old grandmothers in the countryside who hadn't seen a play for many years also saw new dramas this Spring Festival.

The six film projection teams in Beijing are now continuing to tour various townships to show films about publicizing agricultural collectivization.

East China Writers Visit the Countryside

In order to enable literary works to reflect the thoughts and feelings of farmers under the general line propaganda and education in a timely manner, and to help writers better study the general line, the East China Writers Association organized some writers to visit the countryside for a short period in December last year. Thirteen people, including writers Huang Yuan, Tang Tao, Wei Jinzhi, Wang Xiyan, Shi Ling, Bai Deyi, Ha Hua, and Ren Jun, participated in this visit. They were divided into four groups to visit the rural areas of Songjiang, Wujiang, Wuxian in Jiangsu Province and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province. All visits have now been completed.

Although the visit was short, the writers felt that they had new inspirations and gains in creation and study, and expressed that they would write their observations into sketches, reports, or short poems to quickly reflect the current rural reality. So far, Wei Jinzhi's "A Dangerous Plan," Tang Tao's "Don't Take the Old Road," and Shi Ling's "Lu Hongbao and Her Little Girl" and other works have been published in the January issue of this year's "Literary and Art Monthly."

Performing for Soldiers

The Drama Team of the North China Military Region Art Troupe recently rehearsed three small dramas, including "People Strive for Higher Positions," and performed eleven shows for the troops stationed in Beijing from the Spring Festival, publicizing the general line to the soldiers. The actors of the drama team actively invested in this work. Tian Hua played Zhang Guirong in "Women's Representative," and Lin Wei, Shi Yan, and others participated in the performances of "Grass Seedlings Compete to Grow" and "People Strive for Higher Positions." The Art Troupe's Music, Dance, and Acrobatics Team launched activities for half a month from the Spring Festival, mainly performing for troops stationed in Beijing and wounded and sick soldiers, and participated in the military and martyrs' families' New Year's Eve celebration held at the Cultural Palace. Recently, they will perform for workers and residents in Dongdan District. Their programs include songs, dances, acrobatics, and Quyi, including the group's newly created song "The General Line is a Lighthouse."

    组织文化艺术工作者广泛宣传总路线
    北京郊区的春节文艺活动
    首都郊区三百多个乡今年春节期间的文艺活动空前活跃，演出了许多宣传总路线和普选的文艺节目。
    北京十个专业文艺团体和学校文艺演出队这次到郊区演出的上百个文艺节目，一般都是农民所喜爱的。中国杂技团和中央广播说唱音乐团在西郊海淀区演出，东郊区的农民也赶来观看。中央美术学院五十多名学生组成的文艺演出队在大屯乡演出时，一场的观众就有五千多人，附近十几里外村庄的农民们赶来近百辆大车看戏。六屯乡新成立的光明农业生产合作社社员们，看了北京人民艺术剧院演出的“人往高处走”、“麦收之前”、“粮食”等独幕话剧后，对剧中故事进行了漫谈讨论，入社后动摇不定的社员王永福思想也坚定了，许多社员表示一定要办好合作社，走社会主义的路。各专业文艺团体每在一个地方演出结束时，都和农民举行座谈会。首都工人中的文艺爱好者也在春节期间积极下乡为农民兄弟演出。前门区印刷业的长春工人业余剧团新排演以农业的社会主义改造为内容的评剧“组长和女婿”，到海淀区树村第一农业生产合作社演出。有的工厂还给农民放映了新电影。
    农民的群众性文艺活动也比往年更加活跃，许多农民业余剧团赶排了宣传总路线和普选的文艺节目。南苑区九个乡农民业余剧团在春节期间还举行了文艺会演。南苑镇农民业余文艺组演出说唱“学做活”、“赛跑舞”、“采茶扑蝶舞”都受到观众热烈欢迎。集贤乡农民业余剧团还将孩子们的游戏编成“巴掌舞”演出。单干户朱金胜看了“组长和女婿”评剧后，自动要求参加互助组。东郊区大屯乡王玉珍和朱福把当地真人真事编的“小车卖余粮”话剧，由乡农民业余剧团演出，效果很好。农村里多少年没看过戏的老大娘，今年春节也都看到了新戏剧。
    北京市的六个电影放映队现在还继续在各乡巡回放映有关宣传农业集体化的影片。

    华东的作家们到农村访问
    华东作家协会为了使文学作品能及时反映总路线宣传教育下的农民的思想感情，并帮助作家们更好地进行总路线学习，在去年十二月间组织了一部分作家到农村作短期访问。参加这次访问的，有作家黄源、唐弢、魏金枝、王西彦、石灵、白得易、哈华、任钧等十三人，分成四个组，分别访问江苏省松江、吴江、吴县和浙江省嘉兴四县的农村。现在都已访问完毕。
    这次访问，时间虽短，但作家们都感到在创作和学习上，都有新的启发和收获，并且表示要将自己所看到的写成速写报告或短诗，来迅速地反映当前的农村现实生活。到目前止，已有魏金枝的“一个危险的计划”、唐弢的“不走老路”和石灵的“陆红宝和她的小姑娘”等作品在今年“文艺月报”一月号上发表。
    为战士们演出
    华北军区文工团戏剧队最近排练了“人往高处走”等三个小型话剧，从春节起为驻京部队演出了十一场，向战士宣传总路线。戏剧队的演员都积极地投入了这项工作，田华在“妇女代表”中扮演张桂容，林韦、石岩等分别参加了“草苗争长”和“人往高处走”的演出。文工团的音乐舞蹈杂技队，从春节起展开活动半个月，主要为驻京部队和伤病员表演，并参加了在文化宫举行的军、烈属联欢，最近，将为工人和东单区居民演出。他们的节目包括歌、舞、杂技和曲艺，就中有该团新创作的歌曲“总路线是灯塔”等。
