Zhejiang Province will comprehensively and evenly develop agricultural and sideline production this year to better serve the country's socialist industrialization.

Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, based on the needs of national construction and local specific conditions, determined the development plan for agricultural production in Zhejiang Province in 1954. It stipulates that grain production remains the primary task on the agricultural production front, requiring a 10% increase compared to last year. Production targets for industrial raw materials such as silkworm cocoons, jute, cotton, ramie, sugarcane, and sun-cured tobacco; local specialties such as tea and oranges; oil crops such as rapeseed and oil tea; animal husbandry production such as cattle, pigs, and sheep; aquatic product production such as marine fish, freshwater fish, and shellfish algae; and vegetable production have also been set at varying degrees of increase. The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government carefully considered the relationship between the coordinated development of various agricultural and sideline productions when formulating this plan. For example, while planning to develop the number of pigs raised, it also planned to develop feed production accordingly, generally requiring each county to be self-sufficient in feed. In addition, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government also preliminarily divided the production areas of various economic crops such as silkworm cocoons, tea, jute, cotton, and oil tea according to local natural and transportation conditions, so as to rationally use land and promote the planned development of various economic crops. In order to achieve the above tasks, mutual aid and cooperation movements will be vigorously developed in rural areas of Zhejiang Province this year, state-owned agricultural enterprises will be further consolidated and developed, and a series of measures will be taken to actively prevent natural disasters and improve agricultural production technology.

Zhejiang Province is a comprehensive agricultural region. It faces the sea in the east, with a coastline of more than 1,200 miles and many harbors, making it the main marine fishing ground in the country. The land has plains, mountains, hills, and lakes, suitable for the development of various agricultural and sideline productions. Therefore, although the province's grain production is very abundant, it only accounts for 47.2% of the total value of agricultural production, while other industrial raw materials, local specialties, animal husbandry, aquatic products, and forestry production account for 52.8% of the total value of agricultural production. Among them, the production of silkworm cocoons, tea, jute, aquatic products, oranges, and hogs all enjoy a national reputation in terms of output or quality.

Xinhua News Agency: Furthermore, farmers in the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, which are high-yield grain areas in Zhejiang Province, are actively participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, preparing to produce more grain and industrial raw materials to support industrial construction. As of mid-February, according to incomplete statistics, 45 agricultural production cooperatives have been newly established with approval, more than 3,200 new mutual aid teams have been organized, more than 33,000 individual farmers have recently joined mutual aid teams, and more than 2,300 mutual aid teams that had disbanded have been restored. The number of organized farming households has increased by about 5% compared to before. The original 31 agricultural production cooperatives have also generally absorbed one or two dozen new members.

The Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas include ten counties in the Jiaxing Special District and Hang County and the suburbs of Hangzhou City. They are located in the plain and river network area on the south bank of Taihu Lake and the north bank of the Qiantang River. The land is fertile, the products are abundant, and the production potential is great. The 10 million mu of land and lakes managed by the 3 million farmers in these areas can produce enough grain to feed the people of ten cities like Hangzhou for one year. They also produce large amounts of freshwater fish, cotton, hemp, and silk for the industrial production and people's lives in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other cities. Therefore, it is said to be the "land of fish and rice."

### 浙江省今年将全面发展农副业生产  杭州、嘉兴、湖州地区农民踊跃参加互助合作组织

    浙江省今年将全面发展农副业生产
    杭州、嘉兴、湖州地区农民踊跃参加互助合作组织
    今年浙江省的农副业生产将全面均衡地发展，以便更好地为国家的社会主义工业化服务。
    最近，浙江省人民政府根据国家建设的需要和当地的具体条件，确定了一九五四年浙江省农业生产的发展计划。其中规定：粮食生产仍是农业生产战线上的首要任务，要求比去年增产百分之十。对蚕桑、络麻、棉花、苎麻、糖蔗、晒烟等工业原料，茶叶、柑橘等土特产品，油菜、油茶等油料作物，耕牛、猪、羊等畜牧业生产，海洋鱼、淡水鱼、贝藻类等水产业生产以及蔬菜生产，也都规定了程度不同的增产指标。浙江省人民政府在制订这一计划时，曾缜密地考虑了各种农副业生产相互配合发展的关系。例如：在规划发展猪的饲养头数的同时，也规划了相应地发展饲料生产，原则上要求各县饲料自给自足。此外，浙江省人民政府还根据各地自然、交通等条件，初步划分了蚕桑、茶叶、络麻、棉花、油茶等各种经济作物的生产地区，从而可以合理使用土地，促使各种经济作物有计划地发展。为实现上述任务，今年浙江省农村中将大力发展互助合作运动，进一步巩固和发展国营农业企业，并采取积极防止自然灾害、改进农业生产技术及其他一系列的措施。
    浙江省是一个综合性农业地区。东面靠海，海岸线长达一千二百多里，港湾很多，是全国主要的海洋渔场。陆上有平原、山岳、丘陵和湖沼，适于各种农副业生产的发展。因此，全省粮食生产虽然很丰富，但仅占农业生产总值的百分之四十七点二，其他工业原料、土特产、畜牧业、水产业和林业生产等，占农业生产总值的百分之五十二点八。其中蚕桑、茶叶、络麻、水产、柑橘、毛猪等生产，在产量或质量上，都具有全国的声誉。
    又讯：浙江省粮食高产区杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）地区农民踊跃参加互助合作组织，准备生产更多的粮食和工业原料支援工业建设。到二月中旬止，据不完全统计，经批准正在新办的农业生产合作社已有四十五个，新组织的互助组有三千二百多个，三万三千多户单干农民新近参加了互助组，并有二千三百多个散伙的互助组重新恢复。组织起来的农户较前增加百分之五左右。原有的三十一个农业生产合作社也普遍吸收了一二十户新社员。
    杭、嘉、湖地区包括嘉兴专区的十个县和杭县、杭州市郊区，位于太湖南岸和钱塘江北岸的平原水网地带，土地肥沃，物产富庶，生产潜在力很大。这些地区三百万农民经营的一千万亩土地、湖荡，每年生产的粮食可供像杭州那样的十个城市人民食用一年，每年还出产大量的淡水鱼、棉、麻和蚕丝供应上海、杭州等城市工业生产和人民生活的需要，因此有“鱼米之乡”的说法。（新华社）
