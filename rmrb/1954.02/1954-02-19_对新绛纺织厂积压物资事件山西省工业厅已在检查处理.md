Regarding the Accumulated Materials Incident at Xinjiang Textile Factory, Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry is Inspecting and Handling It

Letter from the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Department of Industry: On October 7th of last year, the People's Daily published a letter from reader Chang Fuxing et al. criticizing the Xinjiang Textile Factory for not cherishing state property and for accumulating a large amount of materials. We are now informing you of the situation regarding our inspection and handling of this incident:

The Xinjiang Textile Factory was newly built in 1951. During the construction and installation of machinery, due to the factory's poor planning, blind procurement, and our insufficient inspection, serious accumulation of materials occurred. As of the end of June last year, the factory's production reserve funds accounted for approximately one-half of the working capital, and the accumulation of materials accounted for more than one-third of the working capital. As a result, the factory had difficulties in capital turnover, which affected production. At the same time, the factory's warehouse management system was chaotic, materials were discarded everywhere, and maintenance and storage work was poorly done, which affected the life of the machine parts. In order to solve these problems at the factory, in addition to the main accumulated materials worth 1,160 million yuan that our department recovered and allocated to other units for use, we have also ordered the factory to utilize the remaining special materials and scattered materials as much as possible, and to transfer those that are not suitable for use to other units.

The reasons for the accumulation of equipment, in addition to our department's lack of regular and in-depth inspections, are mainly due to the factory's lack of awareness of cherishing state property and its irresponsible and careless attitude towards work. In order to further overcome these shortcomings, we have sent special personnel to the factory to conduct inspections.

### 对新绛纺织厂积压物资事件山西省工业厅已在检查处理

    对新绛纺织厂积压物资事件山西省工业厅已在检查处理
    山西省人民政府工业厅来信：去年十月七日人民日报刊登读者常复兴等批评新绛纺织厂不爱护国家财产和大量积压物资的来信，现在把我们检查和处理这一事件的情况告诉你们：
    新绛纺织厂系一九五一年新建的。在建厂安装机器过程中，由于该厂计划不周，盲目采购，再加我们检查不够，造成严重的器材积压现象。如按去年六月底计算，该厂生产储备资金约占流动资金的二分之一，材料积压则占流动资金三分之一强。因而厂内资金周转困难，影响了生产。同时该厂仓库管理制度混乱，资材随地弃置，维护保管工作做得很差，影响了机件寿命。我们为了解决该厂这些问题，除由本厅向该厂收回价值十一亿六千余万元的主要积压材料调拨给其他单位使用外，并已责成该厂将其余专用料和零星料尽可能加以利用，确实不适合使用的再调给其他单位。
    造成积压器材的原因，除我厅缺乏经常、深入检查外，主要由于该厂缺乏爱护国家财产的观念，对工作采取不负责任的态度和粗枝大叶的作风。为了进一步克服这些缺点，我们已派专人前往该厂进行检查。
