    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 26th: In order to welcome the World Peace Council's suggestion to hold a global gathering on easing international tensions this year, the Japan Peace Protection Committee has established a liaison mechanism. It has widely distributed to people and social figures from all walks of life in Japan the "Letter to Organizations and Individuals Hoping to Ease International Tensions" passed by the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council and an open letter signed by all Japanese directors of the World Peace Council. It is also soliciting opinions on how to ease international tensions and oppose Japan's rearmament. The Japan Peace Protection Committee has decided to strengthen its ties with peace forces around the world by selecting representatives from Japan to attend this global gathering for the defense of peace. It will also make striving for major powers to resolve international disputes through consultation the basic policy of the committee's work. These activities have now received a wide response. The Japan Peace Protection Committee receives positive replies from people in all fields every day, and many groups that have never participated in or rarely participated in the peace movement have passed resolutions or expressed their intention to send representatives to participate in the global gathering for the defense of peace.
    At the same time, since the Japanese People's Peace Congress was held in Tokyo last December, the peace movement across Japan has become more widespread and deepened.
    After returning to their respective regions, the representatives from Hokkaido and many places in Honshu who attended the Japanese People's Peace Congress held gatherings to convey the situation and resolutions of the congress. They also adopted concrete measures to further unite more people to launch a movement against rearmament and promote the idea of ​​resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. After conveying the situation of the congress, Kyoto City invited Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the Japan Peace Protection Committee, to give a report on foreign travel. On January 24, under the auspices of the Kyoto Regional Council of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the city held a peace conference, which achieved great success. The peace movement in the Kyoto region is now penetrating into rural areas, publicizing the issue of defending peace to the vast number of farmers. At the same time, in order to implement the resolutions of the Japanese People's Peace Congress, the people of Chiba Prefecture have launched a signature campaign throughout the prefecture to demand the removal of military bases and oppose the revision of the Peace Constitution.
    In Shikoku, the representatives from Kochi Prefecture who attended the Japanese People's Peace Congress held report meetings not only in Kochi City, but also in towns and villages throughout the prefecture. Yamaguchi Prefecture has launched a signature campaign to support the Peace Constitution. Okayama Prefecture began publishing the "Peace News" in January this year to promote the peace movement in the prefecture.
    The people of Kyushu are rapidly carrying out the preparatory work for the establishment of a pan-Kyushu peace united front organization - the Kyushu Peace Conference. On January 30, a preparatory meeting for the Kyushu Peace Conference, widely attended by people from all walks of life, was held in Kumamoto City. In Kagoshima Prefecture, a signature campaign is underway to support the Peace Constitution.

    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会为迎接世界和平理事会建议将在今年举行的关于缓和国际紧张局势的世界性集会，已经设立了一个联络机构，向日本各界人民和社会人士广泛地印发了世界和平理事会维也纳会议所通过的“告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书”，和由世界和平理事会全体日本理事签名的公开信，并征询如何缓和国际紧张局势和反对日本重整军备的意见。日本拥护和平委员会决定通过推选日本出席这次保卫和平的世界性集会的代表的工作，来加强与世界各国和平力量的联系，并以争取大国协商解决国际争端为委员会工作的基本方针。现在，这些活动已得到广泛的响应。日本拥护和平委员会每天都接到各方面人士积极的回答，许多一直未参加或很少参加和平运动的团体已通过决议或表示要派遣代表参加保卫和平的世界性集会。

    在四国，高知县出席日本人民和平大会的代表除在高知市举行了报告大会外，并在县内各町、村普遍举行了报告会。山口县已经展开了拥护和平宪法的签名运动。冈山县从今年一月开始发行了“和平报”，以推动该县的和平运动。
