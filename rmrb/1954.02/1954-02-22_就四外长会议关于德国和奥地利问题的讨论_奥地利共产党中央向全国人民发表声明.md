Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, February 20th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party issued a statement to the people of the whole country regarding the discussion of the German and Austrian questions at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Meeting.

The statement said: "The key to all discussions at the Berlin Conference is the question of whether German militarism should be revived? ... Molotov's proposal aimed to prevent the revival of German militarism. These proposals were rejected by Dulles, who insisted on building a strong German army commanded by Adenauer and Hitler's generals. This is why no agreement was reached on the German question in Berlin.

"The Austrian peace treaty was also not signed for the same reason. In order to implement his war plan, Dulles attempted to re-consolidate German militarism and once again open the way for German militarism to come to Austria. ... The Soviet Union is working to prevent the revival of German militarism. This is not only in the interests of the Soviet Union, but also in the interests of the people of all countries, including the German people, and it is equally in the vital interests of our people."

The statement refuted the claim that Molotov was preventing the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty and that he wanted to prolong the occupation of Austria, pointing out: "The intention of Molotov's proposal is very clear: to ensure Austria's security and prevent new aggression by German militarism, which Dulles is attempting to restore. Therefore, the Austrian peace treaty must stipulate that Austria shall not participate in any military alliance and prevent the establishment of foreign bases on its territory. Allied forces should remain on Austrian territory until there is no longer a threat of a resurgence of new German militarism."

The statement also pointed out that Molotov simultaneously proposed the conclusion of the Austrian peace treaty, thereby guaranteeing Austria the withdrawal of foreign troops from Vienna, the dissolution of the Allied Control Council, the resolution of the Soviet-acquired assets issue, and the complete autonomy of Austria. These proposals were rejected by Dulles and the Austrian government acting in accordance with Dulles' policies.

The statement concluded by saying that Austria needs to implement a clearly defined policy of neutrality, and first needs to follow a firm line of preventing the threat of German militarism. Only in this way can Austria be on an equal footing with all countries in Europe.

    就四外长会议关于德国和奥地利问题的讨论
    奥地利共产党中央向全国人民发表声明
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十日讯：奥地利共产党中央委员会就柏林四国外长会议关于德国和奥地利问题的讨论向全国人民发表声明。
    声明说：“柏林会议上的一切讨论的关键是这样一个问题：德国军国主义应该复活吗？……莫洛托夫的建议的目的是防止德国军国主义复活。这些建议都被坚持建立一支由阿登纳和希特勒的将军们指挥的强大德国军队的杜勒斯拒绝了。这就是在柏林没有就德国问题获致协议的原因。
    “对奥和约也因为同样的原因没有签字。杜勒斯为了实行他的战争计划，企图重新巩固德国军国主义并再度为德国军国主义开辟到奥地利来的道路。……苏联努力防止德国军国主义复活。这不仅符合于苏联的利益，也符合于包括德国人民在内的一切国家人民的利益，这同样也符合于我国人民的切身利益。”
    声明驳斥了说莫洛托夫阻止缔结对奥和约、说他希望延长对奥地利的占领的说法，指出：“莫洛托夫建议的意图很清楚，就是：保障奥地利的安全，防止杜勒斯所企图恢复的德国军国主义的新侵略。因此，对奥和约必须规定奥地利不得参加任何军事同盟，并防止在它的领土上建立外国基地。盟国部队应该留驻在奥地利领土上，一直到没有新德国军国主义再起的威胁时为止。”
    声明并指出，莫洛托夫同时建议缔结对奥和约，从而向奥地利保证自维也纳撤退外国军队、解散盟国管制委员会、解决苏联接管的资产问题和让奥地利完全自主。这些建议都被杜勒斯和根据杜勒斯的政策行事的奥地利政府拒绝了。
    声明最后说，奥地利需要实行一个明确规定的中立政策，首先需要遵循防止德国军国主义威胁的坚定的方针路线。只有这样，奥地利才能和欧洲一切国家处于平等地位。
