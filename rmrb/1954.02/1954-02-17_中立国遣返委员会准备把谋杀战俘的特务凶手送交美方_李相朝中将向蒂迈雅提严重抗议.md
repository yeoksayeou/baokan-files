Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 14th: Li Sang-cho, Lieutenant General, representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, lodged a severe protest with the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Thimayya, on the 13th regarding the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's preparation to hand over seventeen special agent murderers of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who requested repatriation to the US side. The full text of the protest is as follows:
    To Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission:

    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has arrested seventeen criminals who murdered prisoners of war and had prepared or already begun to try them. It is universally known that these seventeen criminals are all executioners instigated by the United Nations forces to murder our captured personnel. Their crimes are obvious and the evidence is conclusive, and they must not be treated lightly. However, since January 23, 1954, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been unable to prevent the various obstructions and sabotage by the United Nations forces, with the result that trials have not yet begun for most of the aforementioned criminals, and those trials that have begun have been interrupted, which cannot but be deeply regretted.

    The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has not only failed to fulfill its solemn responsibility of punishing the murderers, but has recently completely succumbed to the threats of the United Nations forces and is preparing to hand over all seventeen criminals to the United Nations forces. This practice cannot but seriously damage the neutral position of the neutral nations and the reputation of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission itself. This action is completely contrary to human justice and fraught with serious consequences. Therefore, I must lodge a severe protest against your completely erroneous and unjust decision. I solemnly request the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take measures to continue to detain these seventeen murderers and to make a just judgment based on their undeniable evidence of guilt. Any other disposition of them is illegal and is resolutely unacceptable to our side.

    Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Lieutenant General of the Korean People's Army
    Li Sang-cho

    中立国遣返委员会准备把谋杀战俘的特务凶手送交美方
    李相朝中将向蒂迈雅提严重抗议
    【新华社开城十四日电】　朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝中将十三日就中立国遣返委员会准备把谋杀要求遣返的朝中战俘的十七名特务凶手交还给美方一事，向中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅提出严重抗议。抗议的全文如下：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将：
    中立国遣返委员会已经拘捕了十七名杀害战俘的罪犯，并曾准备或已开始对他们进行审判。尽人皆知，这十七名罪犯都是联合国军所指使的谋杀我方被俘人员的刽子手，他们的罪恶昭彰、证据确凿，决不能予以轻饶。但是自一九五四年一月二十三日以来，中立国遣返委员会却一直未能制止联合国军方面的种种阻挠与破坏，以致对上述大部分凶犯迄今尚未开始审判，而已经开始的审判也被中断，这不能不令人感到十分遗憾。
    中立国遣返委员会不仅未能履行其惩办杀人凶犯的庄严责任，最近更完全屈服于联合国军方面的威胁之下，准备将上述十七名凶犯全部送交联合国军。这种做法不能不严重地损害中立国家的立场和中立国遣返委员会本身的声誉。这一行动是完全违背人类的正义并且充满着严重的后果的。因此，我必须对你这个完全错误的违背正义的决定提出严重抗议。我郑重地要求中立国遣返委员会执行人采取措施，继续看押这十七名杀人凶犯，并根据他们无可抵赖的罪证作严正的裁判。对他们任何其他的处理都是非法的，也是我方坚决不能同意的。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表  朝鲜人民军中将  李相朝
    一九五四年二月十三日
