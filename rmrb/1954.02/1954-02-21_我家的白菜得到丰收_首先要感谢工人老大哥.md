    My Family's Cabbage Harvested Well
    First, Thanks to the Worker Elder Brothers
    A letter from Liao Ziyi, a farmer from Hongshi Township, Ninth District, Hengyang County, Hunan Province (written by Hong Bao on his behalf): Many farmers in our village make a living by growing vegetables, but the Chinese cabbage they grow is damaged by flea beetles every year, resulting in significant losses. As a result, more than ten households, including He Daikun in our village, were unwilling to grow Chinese cabbage. In 1952, the government lent our township 1,050 jin of "666" insecticide powder. I thought that this kind of powder could kill pests in the rice fields, and it must also be able to kill the flea beetles on the Chinese cabbage, so I borrowed three jin. After planting the cabbage in October, the flea beetles began to cause damage in less than a month. I sprinkled the powder on the cabbage, and when I went to check it the next day, the flea beetles were all killed. This year, the more than 500 Chinese cabbage plants I planted grew very well and were not damaged at all. The large ones weighed more than six jin each, and the small ones also weighed five jin, totaling more than 2,000 jin. This was the first time I had such a good harvest of cabbage. Many people thought I had learned some kind of magical method, but what method do I have? It's all thanks to the worker elder brothers for manufacturing the "666" insecticide powder, which helped me eliminate the pests. The worker elder brothers and we farmers are as close as flesh and blood. In the future, I will definitely work hard to produce and increase the harvest of vegetables to supply the worker elder brothers, so that they can produce more machines, fertilizers, and pesticides to help us farmers continuously increase production and work together for the industrialization of our country.

    我家的白菜得到丰收
    首先要感谢工人老大哥
    湖南省衡阳县九区洪市乡农民廖自乙来信（洪保代笔）：我们村里很多农民以种菜为业，但种的苞心白菜年年要被猿叶虫吃坏，损失很大。因此，我村贺代坤等十多户就都不愿意种苞心白菜了。一九五二年，政府贷给我们乡一千零五十斤“六六六”杀虫药粉。我想这种药粉能杀死禾田里的害虫，也一定能杀死苞心白菜上的猿叶虫，就贷了三斤。十月种上白菜后，没有一个月，猿叶虫就开始为害。我把药粉撒在白菜上，到第二天去看时，猿叶虫都被杀死了。这一年，我种的五百多棵苞心白菜都长得很好，没有受到一点损害，大的每棵有六斤多，小的也有五斤，总共收了二千多斤。我种白菜第一次得到这样的丰收。很多人以为我学到了什么奇方妙法，其实我有什么方法，还不是多亏工人老大哥制造了“六六六”药粉，帮助我消灭了虫害。工人老大哥和我们农民是骨肉兄弟。我今后一定努力生产，提高蔬菜的收获量，供给工人老大哥，让他们生产更多的机器、肥料和农药，帮助我们农民不断提高产量，共同为我们国家的工业化而努力。
