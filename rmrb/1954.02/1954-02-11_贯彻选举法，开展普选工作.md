    Implement the Electoral Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work
    Shanxi Province Deploys Universal Suffrage Work in Batches
    Universal suffrage work has been deployed in batches in the vast cities and countryside of Shanxi Province. The first batch of areas in the province to conduct grassroots elections includes 62 counties such as Daning, Pu County, Shouyang, and Tianzhen, as well as 1,448 townships, towns, and urban districts under the jurisdiction of Yangquan and Changzhi cities. The universal suffrage work in these grassroots units has been generally launched successively in January. Generally, it is carried out in two batches, and some in three batches. Currently, Fanshi, Hongdong, and other counties have begun population surveys and voter registration.
    In October of last year, Shanxi Province completed the trial of universal suffrage in 234 grassroots units throughout the province. In December of last year, Taiyuan City successfully completed universal suffrage in various grassroots units. By this point, Shanxi Province has gained experience in conducting universal suffrage in urban and rural areas, creating favorable conditions for the full-scale deployment of universal suffrage.
    Before this grassroots election, all localities formulated grassroots election plans. According to incomplete statistics from 21 counties including Daning, a total of 1,378 cadres participating in the grassroots election were trained. The Provincial People's Government also plans to transfer more than 300 cadres to go deep into 18 counties to assist in the work.

    Guangzhou City Comprehensively Conducts Grassroots Election Work
    Grassroots election work in various districts of Guangzhou City is in full swing. The people of Guangzhou, who have been educated on the general line of the state during the transition period, are enthusiastically welcoming the universal suffrage.
    After the joint meeting of people's representatives from all walks of life in Guangzhou City and various districts closed on January 14, a large-scale universal suffrage propaganda campaign was launched throughout Guangzhou. Propaganda teams composed of the masses often performed universal suffrage propaganda operas on the streets. Nearly 20,000 universal suffrage work cadres and mass activists who have received universal suffrage work training have been going deep into the streets and households in recent days to publicize the Electoral Law. Report meetings on universal suffrage were held by the system in factories, enterprises, government agencies, organizations, and schools, with the secretaries of the district committees of the Communist Party of China or the responsible cadres of the respective units giving reports on the universal suffrage work. Zhu Guang, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou City and Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Election Committee, personally made a mobilization report on universal suffrage to the cadres of various units stationed in Guangzhou by the Central Government and the Central and South China region, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government system, and various agencies in Guangzhou City. After listening to the report, many workers, cadres, and residents also held group discussions. According to incomplete statistics, as of January 26, the number of people in the city who have received universal suffrage education is about 70% of the total population of Guangzhou City. In the extensive universal suffrage propaganda and education, people from all walks of life received profound democratic and patriotic education, and many factories set off a surge of active production to welcome the universal suffrage.
    On the basis of widespread propaganda, Guangzhou City also comprehensively carried out population surveys and voter registration. People from all walks of life enthusiastically supported and assisted in this work. When conducting population surveys and voter registration, each district was able to pay attention to the principle of facilitating the masses, adopting methods of setting up registration stations, mobile registration, and door-to-door registration, which the masses felt very satisfied with. Voters who received their voter registration certificates were deeply proud of enjoying the glorious right to vote. (Nan)
