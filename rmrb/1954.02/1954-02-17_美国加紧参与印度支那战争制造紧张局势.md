Xinhua News Agency, February 16th: As the United States intensifies its involvement in the Indochina War, maintaining and creating tension in the Far East, Harold Stassen, Director of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration, has also rushed to the Far East to carry out activities.

International News Service says that Stassen's trip to the Far East is one of a series of actions taken by the United States to formulate a "new look" policy toward Asia.

After arriving in Tokyo on the 14th, Stassen left for Seoul on the 15th and is preparing to go to Taiwan and Indochina immediately. Indochina is the main target of Stassen's "visit." According to United Press, Stassen's "visit" to Indochina is "obviously" related to the United States' increasing aid to the "distressed French Union forces." He will "collect first-hand material on exactly what is needed there (Indochina)." United Press said: "Stassen is one of the most determined figures in the (Eisenhower) administration to advocate increased aid to Indochina." He said in an interview with United Press reporters in January that he favored maintaining the amount of "aid" to Indochina at $785 million in the next fiscal year. He recently further stated that the Eisenhower government may request "at least this amount."

In Japan, Stassen is again using "aid" to urge Yoshida to step up rearmament. International News Service revealed on the 14th that Stassen will conduct an investigation to determine how much responsibility Japan can assume as a "reliable military ally of the United States" in light of "public unwillingness to rearm," "constitutional prohibition of rearmament," and "unstable economic conditions." At the same time, Stassen also wants to carry out activities in Seoul for the US plan to trap Yoshida and Syngman Rhee, two puppets, with a sum of "aid." United Press quoted "American sources" in Seoul as saying, "It is expected that Stassen will also warn South Korea not to resist Japanese goods when its government uses Foreign Operations Administration money to purchase reconstruction materials. The United States is eager to use this money to do two things—to help Korea and to help Japan.”

### 美国加紧参与印度支那战争制造紧张局势

    美国加紧参与印度支那战争制造紧张局势
    【新华社十六日讯】　正当美国加紧参与印度支那战争，在远东保持并制造紧张局势的时候，美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生日前也从美国赶到远东来进行活动。
    国际新闻社说，史塔生的远东之行，是美国为了制订对亚洲的“新面貌”政策而采取的一系列行动之一。
    史塔生十四日到达东京后，已于十五日转往汉城，并准备随即前往台湾和印度支那。印度支那是史塔生“访问”的主要对象。据合众社透露，史塔生的“访问”印度支那，“很明显”地和美国增加对“处境窘迫的法兰西联邦军队的援助一事有关”。他将“收集关于那边（印度支那）究竟需要些什么的第一手材料”。合众社说：“史塔生是（艾森豪威尔）政府中主张增加对印度支那援助最坚决的人物之一”。他在一月间接见合众社记者时曾表示，他赞成下一会计年度中对印度支那的“援助”能维持七亿八千五百万美元的数额。最近他又进一步表示，艾森豪威尔政府可能要求“至少是这个数目”。
    在日本，史塔生又在拿着“援助”催促吉田加紧重整军备。国际新闻社十四日即已透露，史塔生将进行调查，以确定日本在“群众不愿意重新武装”、“宪法禁止重新武装”和“不稳定的经济情况”之下，“作为美国的可靠的军事同盟国，可以担负多少责任”。同时，史塔生还要在汉城为美国用一笔“援”款套住吉田和李承晚这两个傀儡的计划进行活动，合众社引汉城的“美国人士”透露，“预料史塔生也会警告南朝鲜，在它的政府用援外事务管理署的钱购买复兴物资的时候不要抵制日本货物。美国急于想用这笔钱来做两件事——既帮助了朝鲜，又帮助了日本。”
