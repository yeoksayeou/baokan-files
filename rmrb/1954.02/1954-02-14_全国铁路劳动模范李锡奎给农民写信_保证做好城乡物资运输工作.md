    National Railway Labor Model Li Xikui Writes Letter to Farmers
    Guaranteeing Good Urban-Rural Materials Transportation Work

    Dear farmer brothers:

    With the development of the construction of the motherland, our railway transportation work has achieved great victories in recent years. We transport steel from Anshan, coal from Fushun, iron from Benxi, wood from Yichun and the Greater Khingan Range, and grain from the countryside, along with other construction materials and materials needed for people's lives, to all parts of the country. When we see the large amount of grain being transported, we think of your patriotic actions in actively selling surplus grain to the state for national industrialization. The railway workers in our unit have all expressed their determination to actively do a good job in urban and rural material transportation work and serve industrial construction and agricultural production. Last year, through the efforts of all the employees of our Shenyang Railway Bureau, the bureau loaded an additional 48,000 train cars for the country in one year, increasing production and saving 96.1 billion yuan in wealth. This year, we guarantee to further improve our work and complete the work task, which is 30 percent higher than last year.

    Last year, I visited the Soviet Union and saw that the Soviet collective farms used machines for production, and the farmers lived happy and joyful lives. Their happiness did not come from nowhere. They went through long-term hard work, and with the help of machines produced by the working-class brothers, they improved production and obtained a prosperous life. I believe that the Chinese farmer brothers will actively participate in mutual assistance and cooperation, improve production, and strive for socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation, and strive to live a happy life like Soviet farmers as soon as possible.

    Congratulations on your greater achievements in production and mutual assistance and cooperation in 1954.

                 National Railway Labor Model Li Xikui

    全国铁路劳动模范李锡奎给农民写信
    保证做好城乡物资运输工作亲爱的农民兄弟们：
    随着祖国建设的发展，几年来咱们铁路运输工作取得了很大的胜利。我们把鞍山的钢、抚顺的煤、本溪的铁、伊春和兴安岭的木材和来自农村的粮食等建设物资和人民生活所需要的物资运送到各地去。当我们看到在调运途中的大量粮食时，就想起了你们为了国家工业化而积极把余粮卖给国家的爱国行动。我们单位的铁路职工都表示要积极做好城乡物资运输工作，为工业建设和农业生产服务。去年经过我们沈阳铁路分局全体职工的努力，全局一年为国家多装了四万八千车，增产节约九百六十一亿元的财富。今年我们保证进一步做好工作，完成比去年提高了百分之三十的工作任务。
    去年我曾到苏联参观，看到苏联集体农庄使用机器生产，农民都过着幸福愉快的生活。他们的幸福不是凭空得来的。他们经过了长期的艰苦努力，在工人老大哥生产的机器帮助下，才提高了生产，得到了富裕的生活。我相信：中国农民弟兄们一定会积极参加互助合作，提高生产，为社会主义工业化、农业合作化而努力，争取更快地过和苏联农民一样的幸福生活。
    祝贺你们在一九五四年中在生产和互助合作中有更大的成就。
                全国铁路劳动模范  李锡奎
