To meet the people's growing need for non-staple food, the Songjiang Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company began constructing two "ice cap warehouses" in Jiamusi and Hegang in mid-December last year. These cities have concentrated factories and mines, a large demand for non-staple food, and inconvenient transportation. Each "ice cap warehouse" has a floor area of 600 square meters and can store 60 tons of non-staple food. It is expected that they will all be completed by late February this year.

The "ice cap warehouse" is built according to the advanced experience created by scientists of the Bulychev Institute of Refrigeration of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The warehouse is built with ice all around, above and below. The upper cover of the warehouse is made of more than two feet thick of coal cinder, rice husk and clay, which are wetted and frozen. In the hot summer, the insulation layer inside the upper cover can disperse the heat of the sun. The bottom of the warehouse is covered with natural ice and frozen sawdust soaked in water. The surroundings of the warehouse are built with sawdust bricks, and ice-salt bags are set in the warehouse to eliminate the temperature brought in by people and things. The warehouse built in this way is not only low in cost (only one-tenth the value of a refrigerator), but also strong and durable. An "ice cap warehouse" can be used for more than fifteen years.

With the "ice cap warehouse", the temperature inside the warehouse can be kept at minus two to six degrees Celsius in the hot summer. Various perishable non-staple foods such as fish, meat, and eggs can be stored for more than two months and still maintain their original freshness and taste. Therefore, it can gradually solve the problem of supply falling short of demand caused by the decentralized production and concentrated consumption of some seasonal foods that cannot be stored for a long time.

    佳木斯鹤岗修建“冰盖仓库”
    中国土产公司松江省公司，为了满足人民日益增长的副食品需要，去年十二月中旬开始，在工厂矿山集中，副食品需用量大而交通又不大便利的佳木斯、鹤岗两市修建两座“冰盖仓库”，每个“冰盖仓库”的底面积有六百平方公尺，能贮藏六十吨副食品，预计在今年二月下旬即可全部竣工。
    “冰盖仓库”是根据苏联科学院所属布鲁契夫冷冻研究院科学家科雷洛夫所创造的先进经验修建的。仓库的四周、上下都是用冰造的。仓库的上盖是用二尺多厚的煤碴、稻壳和粘土等经过浸湿冻成的。在炎热的夏天，上盖内的绝缘层能够分散掉太阳光的热度；库底是铺上天然冰和加水浸湿的锯沫冷冻的；库的四围是用锯沫砖砌的，库内并设有冰盐袋，可以排除人和东西带进去的温度。这样建筑的仓库，不仅成本低（仅等于冷冻机十分之一的价值），而且坚固耐久，一个“冰盖仓库”，可以使用十五年以上。
    有了“冰盖仓库”，在炎热的夏天里，库内可以经常保持零下二度到六度的冷度，各种鱼、肉、蛋等易腐烂的副食品，可以藏贮两个月以上，仍然能保持它原有的鲜度和味道。因此，它就可以逐步地解决某些季节性食品因生产分散、消费集中又不能长期贮存而引起的供不应求的问题。
