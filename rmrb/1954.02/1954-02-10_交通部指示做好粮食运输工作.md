    Ministry of Communications Directs Efforts to Improve Grain Transportation Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] To better fulfill and over fulfill this year's grain transportation tasks, the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government recently issued "Instructions on Strengthening and Improving Grain Transportation Work," requiring transportation departments at all levels to improve the quality of grain transportation and improve current transportation work.
    National transportation departments at all levels achieved great results in completing last year's arduous grain transportation tasks. Last year, grain transportation ranked first in all transportation aspects, whether in river, sea, or road transport. River and sea transportation completed a total of 2.45 million tons of grain transportation throughout the year, playing a certain role in the national grain allocation and resolving grain supply in disaster areas and grain-deficient regions. Responsible cadres of Party and government leading organs and relevant departments personally grasped the allocation work and generally established grain allocation committees; employees of transportation departments at all levels overcame various difficulties and actively completed grain transportation tasks; through grain transportation, transportation departments at all levels continuously improved their work and generally improved loading and unloading efficiency. However, there were still many shortcomings and problems in last year's transportation work, the most serious of which was poor transportation quality, resulting in huge losses of grain. In the Yangtze River grain transport alone, more than 1,000 tons were soaked in water from April to September last year. The main reason for the grain loss was that some transportation departments did not pay enough attention to grain transportation and failed to conduct serious political and ideological education for employees, resulting in a lack of a sense of responsibility and a lack of the idea of cherishing state property among some staff. Secondly, poor loading and unloading operation technology and equipment increased the loss of grain during transportation. To improve the current grain transportation work, the Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government first pointed out in the instructions that since grain is an important material for stabilizing the market, consolidating national defense, ensuring economic construction and the worker-peasant alliance, especially after farmers in various regions sell large quantities of grain to the state, the national grain allocation volume is increasing, so doing a good job in this allocation work is an important task for transportation departments to specifically implement the general line of the state's transition period. In order to strengthen the work responsibility of employees in the processes of loading and unloading, transportation, and storage, and to overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible, the Ministry of Communications instructed transportation departments at all levels to closely contact the grain departments, do a good job in the allocation and connection of transportation tools, improve the utilization rate of equipment; effectively improve and enrich the necessary equipment; improve the operating methods of loading, unloading, and storage; simplify grain transfer, handover, and other transportation procedures, establish necessary systems, and clearly define the scope of responsibilities. At the same time, it is necessary to continue to improve enterprise management and improve local transportation work. In the instructions, the Ministry of Communications required its subordinate departments to check and summarize last year's grain transportation work, and give appropriate commendation or rewards to units that safely and quickly completed the task; those who caused serious accidents of responsibility and caused significant losses to the country should be strictly inspected and given disciplinary sanctions. The Central Ministry of Communications called on transportation departments at all levels to mobilize all employees to improve transportation quality and strive to better fulfill and over fulfill this year's grain transportation tasks.

    交通部指示做好粮食运输工作
    【本报讯】为了更好地完成与超额完成今年的粮食运输任务，中央人民政府交通部最近发出“为加强和改进粮食运输工作的指示”，要求各级运输部门提高粮食运输质量，改进目前的运输工作。
    全国各级交通运输部门在完成去年艰巨的粮食运输任务中，曾获得了很大的成绩。去年无论在河、海运输以及公路运输方面，粮食运输在各项运输中均占了第一位。河、海全年完成的粮食运输任务计达二百四十五万吨，对于全国粮食调运和解决灾区与缺粮地区的粮食供应起了一定的作用。各级党、政领导机关和有关部门的负责干部亲自掌握调拨工作，普遍地成立了粮食调运委员会；各级交通运输部门的职工，克服各种困难，积极完成粮食运输任务；通过粮食运输，各级交通运输部门并不断地改进了工作，普遍提高了装卸效率。但是，去年在运输工作中还存在不少的缺点和问题，其中最严重的是运输质量差，造成了粮食的巨大损失。仅在长江中运输的粮食，去年四月至九月就有一千余吨被水浸湿。造成粮食损失的主要原因，是某些交通运输部门对粮食运输重视不够，对职工未能认真进行政治思想教育，以致某些工作人员工作责任心差，缺乏爱护国家财产的思想。其次是装卸操作技术和设备不良，增加了粮食运输过程中的途耗亏斤。为此，中央人民政府交通部为了改进目前粮食运输工作，在指示中首先指出：由于粮食是稳定市场、巩固国防、保证经济建设和工农联盟的重要物资，特别在各地农民把大批粮食卖给国家后，全国粮食调运量日益扩大，因此做好这一调运工作，是交通运输部门具体贯彻国家过渡时期总路线的一项重要任务。为了加强职工在装卸、运输、仓储等过程中的工作责任心，克服各种无人负责现象，交通部指示各级交通运输部门应与粮食部门密切联系，做好运输工具调配、衔接等工作，提高设备运用率；切实改善和充实必需的设备；改进装运、装卸、仓储等操作方法；简化粮食中转、交接等运输手续，建立必要的制度，明确划分责任范围。同时必须继续改进企业经营管理，改善地方交通工作。交通部在指示中要求所属各部门对去年的粮运工作加以检查和总结，对于安全、迅速完成任务的单位予以适当的表扬或奖励；对于造成严重的责任事故并使国家遭受重大损失者，严格进行检查并给予纪律处分。中央交通部号召各级交通运输部门动员全体职工提高运输质量，争取更好地完成与超额完成今年粮食运输任务。
