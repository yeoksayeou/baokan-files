Xinhua News Agency, January 31st:

Beijing and Moscow began operating direct passenger trains today. At 6:05 PM, the brand-new green train, adorned with the flags of China and the Soviet Union, departed from Beijing for Moscow for the first time amidst the strains of the "Moscow-Beijing" melody played by the band and the applause of the send-off crowd. Beijing and Moscow are 9,050 kilometers apart, and now it only takes 215 hours (less than nine days and nights) to reach the destination. In the past, changing trains in Manzhouli would take 14 hours. Now, with the direct train, the stopover is only two hours, and there will be two round trips per week. This will not only make travel between the people of China and the Soviet Union more convenient, but also facilitate travel between the people of China and the people of the ten countries participating in the Moscow International Railway Transport Agreement. The opening of the Beijing-Moscow direct passenger train will undoubtedly further promote cultural and economic exchanges between China and the Soviet Union, as well as the other nine fraternal countries.

At 5 PM, the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government solemnly held the inauguration ceremony at Beijing Railway Station. The attendees included Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government; Vice Ministers Lü Zhengcao, Wu Jingtian, Shi Zhiren, Wang Shitai, Zhao Jianmin; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Xiuquan; Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Zheren; Vice Mayor of Beijing Zhang Youyu; Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Qian Junrui; Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union Wang Xuezeng, Secretary-General Xiao Hongqi; Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Railways Gao Dengbang, Deputy Director Chen Chong, and the directors of the Transportation Bureau, the Joint Transport Bureau, the Locomotive Bureau, the Rolling Stock Bureau, the Passenger Department, the Freight Planning Department, and the Director of the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, as well as more than 400 railway workers.

Academician Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China, other officials from the Soviet Embassy, Soviet experts working in the Ministry of Railways, and Mr. Stepenov, Director of the Beijing Branch of the Intourist Joint-Stock Company, were also invited to attend the inauguration ceremony.

This train is different from ordinary Chinese trains. All seven carriages, including sleeping cars, dining cars, and baggage cars, are made of metal. The carriages are slightly longer and wider than Chinese train carriages. The facilities inside the carriages are very comfortable, comprehensive, and exquisite. In addition to the general amenities, the sleeper compartments have loudspeakers, thermometers, and electric clocks. Besides the equipment for providing boiling water and cooking, each carriage has an independent heating system, which can adjust the temperature of each carriage according to the needs of passengers and keep it warm at all times. Even in temperatures of minus forty or fifty degrees, the carriages can be as warm as spring. The rooms and corridors are covered with beautiful carpets, and the windows have various colorful velvet curtains. The train has excellent ventilation and dust removal equipment. The safety equipment on the train is also state-of-the-art. The Chinese and Soviet crew members working on the Beijing-Moscow direct train are all excellent railway workers.

Soviet and Chinese passengers on this train expressed that they would feel very comfortable and happy traveling on such a passenger train.

    北京—莫斯科直达客车正式通车
    铁道部长滕代远和尤金大使参加通车典礼
    【新华社三十一日讯】北京、莫斯科之间，今天已对开直达旅客列车。下午六时零五分，悬挂着中、苏两国国旗的崭新绿色列车，在乐队高奏“莫斯科—北京”和欢送群众的掌声中，首次从北京开往莫斯科。北京和莫斯科相距九千零五十公里，现在只需要二百十五小时（还不到九昼夜）就可以到达。过去在满洲里等车换乘要花费十四小时，现在有了直达列车，只需停留两小时，并且每周要对开两次。这样，不仅我国人民和苏联之间的往来更加便利，而且我国人民和参加莫斯科国际联运协定的十个国家的人民之间的往来，也更加便利了。北京、莫斯科直达旅客列车的通车，无疑将进一步促进我国和苏联以及其他九个兄弟国家之间的文化和经济交流。
    下午五时，中央人民政府铁道部在北京车站隆重举行了通车典礼。参加典礼的有中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远，副部长吕正操、武竞天、石志仁、王世泰、赵健民，外交部副部长伍修权，对外贸易部副部长李哲人，北京市人民政府副市长张友渔，中苏友好协会总干事钱俊瑞，中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席王学增、秘书长萧洪启，铁道部办公厅主任高登榜、副主任陈冲和事务局局长、联运局局长、机务局局长、车辆局局长、旅客处处长、货运计划处处长及第一机械工业部机车车辆制造局局长等和铁路系统职工共四百多人。
    苏联驻我国大使尤金院士和苏联大使馆其他官员以及在铁道部工作的苏联专家和全苏股份有限公司国际旅行社北京分社社长斯切伯诺夫等，也应邀参加了通车典礼。
    这趟列车和我国平常的列车不同。包括卧车、餐车和行李车的七节车厢全部是金属制造的。车厢较我国列车车厢稍长稍宽。车厢里的设备很舒适周全，而且十分精致。卧铺间里除了一般设备外还有扩音器、寒暑表、电钟。每节车厢除了都有供给开水和作饭的设备以外，还有独立的暖房，这种暖房可以使每节车厢都根据旅客需要调节温度，并且经常保持温暖，即使在零下四五十度，车厢里也可以温暖如春。房间里和走廊上都铺着漂亮的地毯，窗上有各种彩色的丝绒窗幔。车上有优良的通风设备和除尘设备。列车上的安全设备也是最新式的。在北京、莫斯科直达列车上工作的中苏乘务员都是优秀的铁道工作者。
    乘这次列车的苏联和我国乘客，都表示乘这样的客车，定会感到非常舒适和愉快。
