Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 15th: According to a report by the German News Agency (DTS) in Berlin on February 15th, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, delivered a radio address on February 13th. In the name of all peace-loving people in Germany, he urged the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin to continue its efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the German question.

Bolz said that the attitude of the Western powers' foreign ministers towards the Soviet Union's constructive and practical proposals for resolving the German question showed that they were clearly not interested in peacefully resolving the German question according to the wishes of the German people. The Western foreign ministers ignored the basic rights of the German people and obstructed any understanding on this issue. They stubbornly insisted on pursuing a policy of including West Germany in the American war bloc through the Bonn and Paris Treaties, treaties which would make the reunification of Germany impossible. Bolz pointed out that in order to facilitate the implementation of this policy, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles adopted the method of slandering and defaming the German Democratic Republic.

Bolz called for a peaceful solution to the German question so that Germany could finally obtain a peace treaty and be unified into a peace-loving and independent country. Bolz stated that, in order to achieve this goal faster and more easily, the government of the German Democratic Republic, now as in the past, still advocates allowing representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the Four Power Conference discussions on the German question.

    民主德国副总理兼外长博尔茨发表演说
    要求外长会议继续努力和平解决德国问题
    【新华社十六日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林十五日讯：德意志民主共和国副总理兼外交部部长博尔茨于二月十三日发表广播演说，他以全德爱好和平的人民的名义，要求柏林四国外长会议继续努力，以求和平解决德国问题。
    博尔茨说，西方国家外长们对待苏联解决德国问题的富有建设性而切实可行的建议的态度表明，他们对于按照德国人民的要求和平解决德国问题显然不感兴趣。西方国家的外长们无视德国人民的基本权利，阻挠在这个问题上达成任何谅解。他们顽固地坚持奉行通过波恩和巴黎条约把西德包括进美国的战争集团的政策，这些条约将使重新统一德国成为不可能。博尔茨指出，为了便于执行这个政策，美国国务卿杜勒斯采用了对德意志民主共和国进行诽谤和诋毁的方法。
    博尔茨要求和平解决德国问题以便使德国最后能得到一个和约并能统一在一个爱好和平和独立的国家中。博尔茨表示，为了更快和更容易地达到这个目标，德意志民主共和国政府现在像过去一样，仍然主张让德意志民主共和国和西德的代表参加四大国会议关于德国问题的讨论。
