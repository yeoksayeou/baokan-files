Implement the Election Law and Carry Out Universal Suffrage Work

    Sichuan Province Launches Second Phase of Grassroots Elections in Over 7,000 Basic Units
    The second phase of grassroots elections in Sichuan Province has been launched on a large scale in over 7,200 townships, towns, and urban basic units. After completing this phase of universal suffrage, areas with a population of 59 million in the province will establish grassroots political power based on the system of people's congresses. After studying the general line, the broad masses of people in the province have become even more politically enthusiastic. Voters have proposed to "select the best from the best, choose the good from the good, and elect representatives with socialist ideas to guide us in the transition to a socialist society." Currently, areas such as Wanxian and Nanchong have completed the work of population surveys and voter qualification reviews.
    Before the launch of the second phase of the universal suffrage movement, all counties in Sichuan Province held expanded cadre meetings, trained cadres, and summarized the experiences of the first phase of universal suffrage. Nanchong, Daxian, Wanxian, Mianyang and other four special districts trained a total of more than 47,000 cadres. The Sichuan Provincial Election Committee also issued instructions requiring all localities to closely integrate election work with the ongoing rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production, and to link socialist and patriotic propaganda education with the education on consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, so that the people truly understand the relationship between universal suffrage and the implementation of the general line, and more earnestly elect their own representatives.

      Guizhou Province Completes Second Phase of Grassroots Elections in Over 1,000 Townships
    The second phase of grassroots election work in Guizhou Province has basically ended in 1,207 township-level basic units. Thus far, ethnic groups accounting for 40 percent of the province's total population have exercised their civil rights and elected people they are satisfied with and need to manage state affairs.
    The second phase of grassroots universal suffrage in Guizhou Province began in early October of last year. Most areas paid attention to absorbing the experience of the first phase of grassroots elections and closely integrated universal suffrage with production. The areas included in the second phase of grassroots elections included more than 300 townships and towns where ethnic minorities lived in concentrated or mixed communities. These areas generally relied on minority cadres and united prestigious leaders among the various ethnic minorities to carry out universal suffrage. Yunding Township in the Gaopo Miao Autonomous Region of Guizhu County, led by Miao cadres, organized a propaganda team of more than 150 people to carry out in-depth universal suffrage propaganda, so that people of all ethnic groups were universally educated on universal suffrage. Changzhai Township in Langdai County united prestigious figures among the ethnic minorities and used them to carry out propaganda to the masses, who actively participated in the universal suffrage movement. In the universal suffrage movement in Ge Yi Township of the Taijiang Miao Autonomous Region and Yitou Township of the Zhenning Buyi Autonomous Region, the universal suffrage work groups enthusiastically and patiently cultivated ethnic minority cadres according to the characteristics of the ethnic groups, making them consciously invest in the universal suffrage movement and become the main force in promoting the universal suffrage movement. During the second phase of grassroots election work, in some areas with poor mass base, landlord class elements and counter-revolutionaries attempted to sabotage the election. However, they were promptly exposed by the masses, and the universal suffrage people's court gave these saboteurs the punishment they deserved, thereby ensuring the smooth progress of the election work and further consolidating the rural people's democratic dictatorship.
    At present, the third phase of grassroots election work in Guizhou Province has begun in some areas, and most other areas will be launched in the first and middle ten days of February. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Rehe Province Closely Integrates Rural Universal Suffrage Work with Propaganda on the General Line
    Rehe Province closely integrates rural universal suffrage work with propaganda on the general line. In villages that have undergone universal suffrage, the newly elected village cadres and village people's representatives are actively publicizing and implementing the general line. Many villages have held people's congresses and formulated plans to sell grain to support national construction. After the universal suffrage in most villages in the Shuangfeng Temple District of Chengde County, the newly elected cadres publicized the benefits of taking the socialist road to the farmers and explained in detail the use of the state's grain purchases. Farmers throughout the district were extremely enthusiastic about selling grain. After selling grain, many farmers actively purchased agricultural means of production such as hoeing machines, waterwheels, rubber-tired carts, small iron carts, fertilizer powder, and livestock to develop agricultural production. Ninety of the 117 seasonal mutual aid teams in the district requested to be upgraded to year-round mutual aid teams.
    In the 1,900 villages in the province that are undergoing universal suffrage, many people who have been active in publicizing the general line and purchasing grain have been warmly supported by the masses and elected as village cadres or village people's representatives. When Qidaoquanzi Village in Chaoyang County conducted elections, the voters put forward the slogan "Elect those who can lead us on the new road." The 29 people's representatives elected were all good cadres, good mutual aid team leaders, and activists in publicizing and implementing the general line who have always worked actively. In villages that have not yet undergone universal suffrage, many village cadres are also actively studying the general line and working hard to win the trust of the voters. Peng Shuxuan, the village chief of Dongdi Village in Lingyuan County, used to have a style of substituting his own decisions for those of others, and the masses had many opinions about him. However, Peng Shuxuan was afraid of being defeated and was unwilling to examine himself. After studying the general line, he earnestly examined his shortcomings, corrected his undemocratic style, and took the initiative to help the finance and grain committee complete the grain purchase work. The masses said: Village Chief Peng is determined to correct his problems and has contributed to publicizing the major affairs of the country, so let's still elect him. (Xinhua News Agency)

    贯彻选举法，开展普选工作
    四川省七千多个基层单位展开第二期基层选举
    四川省第二期基层选举已在七千二百多个乡、镇及城市基层单位中大规模展开。全省在完成这期普选以后，将有五千九百万人口的地区建立起人民代表大会制的基层政权。全省广大人民经过总路线的学习，政治热情更加高涨，选民们提出要“花中选花，好中选好，选出有社会主义思想的人当代表，引导我们过渡到社会主义社会去”。目前万县、南充等地区，已结束人口调查和选民资格审查的工作。
    四川省各县在第二期普选运动展开以前，都召开了扩大干部会议，训练干部，总结第一期普选的经验。南充、达县、万县、绵阳等四个专区共训练了干部四万七千多人。四川省选举委员会并发出指示，要求各地将选举工作与正在开展的农村互助合作运动和农业生产密切结合进行，并把社会主义、爱国主义的宣传教育和巩固人民民主专政的教育联系起来，使人民群众真正了解普选与贯彻总路线的关系，更加认真地选举自己的代表。（新华社）
      贵州省一千多个乡镇完成第二期基层选举
    贵州省第二期基层选举工作已在一千二百零七个乡、镇基层单位基本结束。至此，占全省总人口百分之四十的各族人民已行使了他们的公民权利，选出了自己满意和必要的人来管理国家事务。
    贵州省第二期基层普选是在去年十月上旬展开的。绝大部分地区都注意吸收了第一期基层选举的经验，密切结合生产进行普选。在第二期基层选举的地区，包括有三百多个少数民族聚居和杂居的乡、镇。这些地区一般都认真地依靠了少数民族干部，团结各少数民族中有威望的领袖人物来进行普选。贵筑县高坡苗族自治区云顶乡以苗族干部为主，组织了一百五十多人的宣传队伍，深入展开普选宣传，使各族人民普遍受到了普选的教育。郎岱县长寨乡团结了少数民族中有威望的人物，并通过他们向群众进行宣传，群众都积极参加普选运动。台江县苗族自治区革一乡和镇宁县扁担山布依族自治区矣头乡在普选运动中，普选工作组按照民族特点，热情耐心地培养了民族干部，使他们自觉地投入普选运动，成为推动普选运动的主要力量。在第二期基层选举工作中，有一些群众基础较差的地区，地主阶级分子和反革命分子曾企图破坏选举。但都及时被群众揭发出来，普选人民法庭并给予这些破坏分子以应得的惩处，从而保障了选举工作的顺利进行，并进一步巩固了农村人民民主专政。
    目前，贵州省第三期基层选举工作已在部分地区开始，其他大部分地区将在二月上、中旬普遍展开。　（据新华社讯）
    热河省农村普选工作与宣传总路线密切结合进行
    热河省农村普选工作和宣传总路线密切结合进行。经过普选的村庄，新当选的村干部和村人民代表，正在积极地宣传和贯彻总路线。许多村都召开人民代表大会，制订了卖粮支援国家建设的计划。承德县双峰寺区多数村普选后，新选的干部向农民宣传了走社会主义道路的好处，并详细讲解国家买粮的用处，全区农民卖粮极为踊跃。许多农民卖粮以后又积极购买铲?机、水车、胶皮轮大车、小铁车、肥田粉、牲畜等生产资料，发展农业生产。全区一百一十七个季节性互助组有九十个要求提高为常年互助组。
    全省正在进行普选的一千九百个村庄中，许多在宣传总路线和购粮等工作中表现积极的人都受到群众热烈拥护，被选为村干部或村人民代表。朝阳县七道泉子村进行选举时，选民们提出了“选能领咱们走新道路的人”的口号。选出的二十九名人民代表都是一贯积极工作的好干部、好互助组长和宣传贯彻总路线的积极分子。在还没有进行普选的村庄，许多村干部也正在积极学习总路线，努力工作，争取选民的信任。凌源县东地村村长彭树轩过去有包办代替作风，群众对他有很多意见，但彭树轩怕落选一直不愿检讨。学习总路线后，他认真检讨了自己的缺点，改正了不民主的作风，并主动帮助财粮委员完成购粮工作。群众说：彭村长改毛病有决心，宣传国家大事立了功，咱们还是选他。
