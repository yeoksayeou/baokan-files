Foziling Reservoir Hydropower Station Actively Under Construction
Electric Workers in Shenyang and Harbin Rush to Produce Equipment for the Power Station

[This newspaper report] The first hydropower station on the Huai River, the Foziling Reservoir Hydropower Station, is under active construction.

According to the design, this massive hydropower station will be equipped with five turbine generators with a total capacity of 8,000 kilowatts. After the reservoir is completed, the water volume of the Pi River impounded in the reservoir will flow through the penstock as needed, driving turbine-type water wheels, which directly drive the generators. This will allow for an annual electricity generation of more than 40 million kilowatt-hours.

The two penstocks installed in piers seventeen and eighteen, weighing 170 tons, were manufactured by the East China Steel Construction Factory. After completing the manufacturing task last November, the factory selected forty-one outstanding technical cadres and workers to come to the Foziling construction site to perform cold work such as electric welding, laying out, and assembly. The Shanghai Boiler Factory, entrusted by the East China Industrial Department Supply and Marketing Bureau, also sent two technical cadres to provide guidance. The workers' enthusiastic labor, coupled with the assistance of Foziling crane workers, completed forty days of cold work in thirty-five days. On January 8, the installation of the penstock in pier eighteen officially began.

The power station's turbine generators are manufactured by electric factories in Shenyang and Harbin. Currently, the turbine, transformer, and other components have begun to be shipped from the Northeast to the Foziling construction site.

According to the plan, the foundation work for the 8,000-kilowatt capacity generator will be completed this year, and two generators with a total capacity of 2,000 kilowatts will be installed; next year, power lines will be erected to Hefei. The state will use extremely cheap electricity to open a large-scale bamboo and wood processing plant in Foziling. This plant will not only use machines to process standard doors, windows, and other household wood products, but also use machines to process bamboo materials for weaving thermos bottle shells, and will organize about 5,000 or more farmers in the form of handicraft cooperatives to carry out handicraft production.

Workers at state-owned electric factories in Shenyang and Harbin are rushing to manufacture power generation equipment for the Foziling Reservoir Power Station.

Manufacturing power generation equipment for this type of power station is an arduous task. However, in the increased production and economy campaign, the workers actively studied advanced Soviet experience, not only overcoming the difficulties of incomplete equipment, increasing work efficiency by one to three times, but also creating China's first automatic speed regulator and automatic high-voltage switchgear. In order to improve the components, the engineers in charge of the design work also actively studied and applied advanced Soviet experience, and repeatedly conducted precise comparisons, calculations, and research with the workers. With the close cooperation and selfless labor of workers and technicians, they finally completed all the tasks for the water turbine seven days ahead of schedule. The manufacturing work of the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory for the turbine generator is expected to be completed in March.

    佛子岭水库水力发电站积极进行建设
    沈阳、哈尔滨电工工人赶制发电站的发电设备
   【本报讯】淮河上第一座水力发电站——佛子岭水库水力发电站，正在积极进行建设。
    根据设计，这座巨大的水力发电站，安置五部容量共八千瓩的水轮发电机。水库完成后，被拦蓄在水库里的渒河水量，就按照需要流经导水管，发动涡轮式的水轮，直接带动发电机。在常年可生产电量四千余万度。
    安在十七、十八号垛内的两套导水管，重达一百七十吨，由华东钢铁建筑厂制造。该厂在去年十一月完成了制造任务后，就选派了四十一个优秀的技术干部和工人等，来到佛子岭工地进行电焊、放样、装配等冷作工。上海锅炉厂也受华东工业部供销局的委托，派了两位技术干部前来指导。工人们热情的劳动，加上佛子岭起重工的协助，以三十五天时间，完成了四十天的冷作工。一月八日，正式开始安装十八号垛内的导水管。
    发电站的水轮发电机是由沈阳、哈尔滨电工工厂制造的。现水轮机及变压器等机件，已开始从东北向佛子岭工地起运。
    按照计划，今年内将做好八千瓩容量发电机的基础工程，安装好两部共两千瓩容量的发电机；明年电线将架到合肥。国家将利用极便宜的电力，在佛子岭开办规模较大的竹木加工厂，这座工厂不但用机器加工标准门窗及其他家用木器；而且还用机器加工编制水瓶壳子的竹料，并将以手工业合作社的方式，组织约五千以上的农民，进行手工业生产。
    沈阳、哈尔滨两地国营电工工厂工人正在赶制佛子岭水库发电站赶制发电设备。
    制造这种发电站的发电设备，是一项艰巨的任务。但工人们在增产节约竞赛运动中，积极学习了苏联先进经验，不仅克服了设备不完备的困难，使工作效率提高一倍到三倍以上，并且创造了新中国第一台自动调速器和自动高压开关柜。为了改进机件，担任设计工作的工程师们也积极学习和运用了苏联先进经验，并和工人们三番五次地进行精密的比较、计算和研究。在工人和技术人员的密切配合和忘我的劳动下，终于提早七天完成了水轮机的全部任务。哈尔滨电机厂水轮发电机的制造工作，预计三月间可全部完成。
