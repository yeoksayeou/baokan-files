    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 24th: The call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to all voters to reclaim virgin and wasteland in the eastern and southeastern regions to increase agricultural production has been enthusiastically responded to throughout the country. More than five thousand young people in Moscow have volunteered to participate in the reclamation work. Workers at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory have recently submitted more than seventy applications requesting to go to rural areas in the Kazakh Republic and other regions. These include fitter Rozanov, lathe operator Savilov, and assembler Avochinkov, among others. They issued a written appeal to the working people of Moscow, hoping that more workers would go to the countryside to reclaim land. Foreman Tarachinko and fitter Revil, and dozens of other workers from the Moscow Small Engine Factory, have also submitted applications. In a letter to the Communist Youth League members and young workers of the factory, they said: We assure the Party and the government that we will work excellently and do our best to turn the wasteland into fertile land in the shortest possible time. The Communist Youth League organizations in Kyiv have received 1,500 applications in recent days requesting to work in Siberia and Kazakhstan. More than 160 Communist Youth League members in Kursk Oblast and the city of Kursk have applied to go to the countryside. Many collective farmers and machine tractor station workers have also expressed their willingness to participate in the reclamation work. In the Kuban region, nearly one thousand people have applied to go to Siberia and the Kazakh Republic. Working people in the Labinsky District of Kuban have formed two tractor teams to set off. Thirty agronomists and engineers from the district have also applied to work in the reclamation areas.
