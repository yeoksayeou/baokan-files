    The Central South Administrative Committee
    Announces Interim Provisions on Handling Letters and Visits from the People
    On February 12th, the Central South Administrative Committee issued several interim provisions regarding the handling of letters and visits from the people. These provisions aim to ensure that government agencies and state-owned enterprises at all levels in the region conscientiously and responsibly handle letters and visits from the people promptly, further strengthen the ties between the People's Government and the people, and promote the people's political enthusiasm and bottom-up criticism.
    To ensure that the criticisms, suggestions, appeals, requests, etc., raised by the people are handled promptly by relevant departments, the Central South Administrative Committee has made several detailed provisions regarding the division of labor and coordination in handling letters and visits: Suggestions, inquiries, requests, etc., from the people shall be handled by the competent departments according to their nature; if the nature of the matter is such that it cannot be handled by a single department, it shall be handled by the general office of the government at the same level; matters related to labor employment and labor disputes shall be handled by the labor departments; matters related to social welfare, etc., shall be handled by the civil affairs departments; reports of illegal incidents shall be handled by the procuratorial organs and courts. If a matter involves multiple aspects, it shall be handled by one department primarily, in conjunction with relevant departments, or by the secretary-general of the government (or equivalent) convening relevant departments for consultation; matters involving leading cadres shall be handled by the higher-level organs, and matters involving higher-level leading cadres shall be handled by organs two levels higher; matters involving two regions shall also be handled by the higher-level organs or jointly by the two regions. In addition, there are many specific provisions regarding handling responsibilities, procedures, requests for instructions, and reports.
    To ensure that the issues raised in the people's letters and visits can be resolved quickly, the Central South Administrative Committee specifically stipulates that processing times exceeding one week must be approved by the head of the department, and processing times exceeding one month must provide reasons to the superior agency that assigned the task and to the person who wrote the letter.
    The Central South Administrative Committee also stipulates that government agencies and state-owned enterprises above the provincial (municipal) level must establish people's complaint reception rooms where necessary, and assign dedicated personnel to receive visiting people at any time. Records of the reception and conversation must be signed by the visitor. The people's governments of special districts and counties can jointly establish reception rooms with their subordinate procuratorial and supervisory organs. Commissioners and county heads may experiment with periodically receiving people. If people request to meet with the heads of various departments, the heads of the departments should schedule an interview or appoint a representative to interview them, and the issues raised should be handled in accordance with the regulations for handling letters from the people.
    In view of the continuous improvement of the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people and the surge in the number of letters and visits; and because the people do not know the nature and scope of authority of the various government departments in detail, they often copy and submit multiple letters, and the government departments in the past had unclear division of labor in handling letters and visits, and the handling procedures were not detailed, affecting the handling effect. For this reason, in addition to the above provisions, the Central South Administrative Committee also requires that all departments that receive a large number of letters from the people or receive a large number of visits from the people must set up full-time personnel to handle the work of handling letters and visits, and in general, they must also designate special personnel to manage it concurrently. The secretaries-general of the people's governments at all levels or equivalent personnel must be responsible for leading this work, regularly convene subordinate departments to conduct inspections and summaries, and report to the chairman (or commissioner, county head) and the higher-level government. Important letters must be personally reviewed by the chairman (or commissioner, county head).

    中南行政委员会
    发布关于处理人民来信来访工作暂行规定
    中南行政委员会在二月十二日发布了关于处理人民来信来访工作的若干暂行规定。这个规定在于保证全区各级政府机关和国家企业部门对人民来信来访能认真负责地迅速处理，进一步密切人民政府和人民群众的联系，发扬人民的政治热情和自下而上的批评。
    为使人民提出的批评、建议、申诉、请求等能得到有关部门的及时处理，中南行政委员会对处理来信来访工作的分工和联系作了若干详细的规定：凡人民的建议、询问、请求等，按其性质由主管部门处理，其性质不是一个部门能处理的，由同级政府办公厅处理；有关劳动就业，劳资争议问题由劳动部门处理；有关社会福利等问题由民政部门处理；检举违法事件的由检察机关、法院处理。问题涉及多方面的，须由一个部门为主会同有关部门处理，或由政府秘书长（或相当人员）邀集有关部门协商处理；涉及负责人的由上一级机关处理，涉及上级负责人的由上两级机关处理；涉及两个地区的也由上级机关处理或两地会同处理。此外，关于处理职责、程序、请示、报告等方面，也有许多具体的规定。
    为使人民来信来访中所提出的问题，能够迅速处理，中南行政委员会特规定：处理时间须在一周以上的须经该部门首长批准；一月以上的须向上级交办机关和来信人申述理由。
    中南行政委员会还规定：省（市）级以上的政府机关和国家企业部门凡有必要的都须设立人民检举接待室，派专人随时接待来访的人民群众。接待谈话须有来访人签押的笔录。专区和县的人民政府可和所属检察、监察机关联合设立接待室。专员、县长可试行定期接待人民的办法。凡人民要求会见各部门首长的，各部门首长应约期接谈或指派代表接谈，对所提问题应按处理人民来信规定处理。
    鉴于广大人民政治热情不断提高，来信来访的数量激增；又由于人民群众对政府各部门性质和职权范围知道得不详细，往往一信复写多投，而政府各部门过去对处理来信来访的分工不明，办理手续不详，影响了处理的效果。为此，中南行政委员会除作上述规定外，并要求凡收到人民来信或接待人民来访数量很多的部门，须设置处理来信来访工作的专职人员，一般的也须指定专人兼管。各级人民政府的秘书长或相当人员，须负责领导这个工作，定期召集所属部门进行检查总结，向主席（或专员、县长）和上级政府报告。重要的来信须由主席（或专员、县长）亲自批阅。
