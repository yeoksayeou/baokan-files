Zhang Fu and the Combine
By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

The First Appearance of the Combine

Zhang Fu is one of the first combine operators in our country's coal mining industry. He returned to the Datong Coal Mine from the "Combine Driver Training Class" in April 1952. In the autumn of that year, two "Donbas-I" type combines manufactured in the Soviet Union in 1952, carrying the friendship of the Soviet people, appeared at the Datong Coal Mine.

Zhang Fu and the drivers in his class received enthusiastic help from Soviet expert Comrade Denisov and successfully tested the combine coal mining on November 3, 1953.

When people walked into the working face where the combine was operating, they saw a huge "monster" attacking a long, seemingly endless coal wall. It opened its big mouth and devoured the hard coal seam, separating the entire block of coal from the seam. These coal blocks were then automatically crushed into various sizes by the machine parts and sent into the coal loading machine, then automatically ran into the electric chute. In this way, tons and tons of coal were transported out like flowing water. The entire process from cutting coal to crushing coal to loading coal was operated by only one driver.

People still remember in the movie "Donbas Miners," the girls sang: "It's outdated, my lover, to go down the mine with a shovel. Quickly learn the combine, and then propose to me." The girls were singing about this combine. And the old honored miner Nie Daolian said in the mine: "The coal cutter has added twenty years to my life, and in the future, the combine will add another ten years to my life." What moved the old miner was this combine. The appearance of the combine has pushed the Soviet coal mining work into a new era. And now, such a new era has also begun in our coal mining industry.

The appearance of the combine at the Datong Coal Mine brought unprecedented miracles to production. One combine can produce five hundred tons of coal a day, which is equivalent to the work of hundreds of people in a day.

When the combine first arrived at the mine, people were filled with novelty, admiration, and excitement, and the leading cadres were especially attentive to it. Everyone loved the combine's high efficiency, high output, and its continuous production. However, how to make full use of the combine's efficiency to further advance the motherland's coal mining industry? Many people didn't think about it much. Only Zhang Fu, he was fascinated by the combine, thinking about it all day long.

Combine Left Unattended

When the Soviet experts left the Datong Coal Mine, some leading personnel, in order to "shift to capital construction," withdrew cadres and technicians, which was the first difficulty encountered in promoting combine coal mining. At this time, new geological conditions were encountered, the coal seam was uneven and contained many stone edges, and sometimes the combine would stop moving.

The drivers who had received preliminary training only knew how to operate but didn't know how to repair. When the combine broke down, they panicked, and no one knew what to do. The combine hit the stones, sparking. The leaders above didn't know, and those below who knew couldn't do anything about it. The drivers continued to operate the broken combine as usual. As a result, it broke eighteen teeth in one day and a total of one hundred or so in a month.

The combine is a product of high technology. It works in the coal mine like flowing water; if a problem occurs in one place, the water cannot flow smoothly. For example, if an accident occurred with the electric chute, the coal produced by the combine could not be transported out, so it had to stop; the workers who drilled holes and set off explosives and those who supported the roof had to rest; and the entire working face had to stop working. The combine required a coal car every twenty seconds, but the coal cars were not supplied in time; sometimes it took two or three hours for one to arrive. When the coal cars didn't come, a series of problems followed. Encountering these difficulties, the combine, which originally devoured coal like mud, now seemed like an old cow pulling a broken cart. Accidents occurred one after another, and it couldn't work for even one or two hours a day, couldn't advance twenty meters, and the daily coal output was less than one-third of the coal produced by the coal cutter.

Unable to produce coal, people's interest also declined. When the combine was mentioned, they shook their heads. "Such a big thing, it's good, but it can't produce coal." "If this thing breaks, we can't be responsible, it's really untouchable!" But Zhang Fu didn't agree with them. He was like a family member whose loved one was seriously ill, constantly looking for the mine manager, the engineer, and the district chief to find a solution. At first, people thought Zhang Fu's enthusiasm was valuable, but as time went on, some cadres became impatient: "Why are you so anxious! Solve it yourself, and if you can't solve it, forget it, it's better to use the coal cutter." Seeing the cadres so indifferent to the combine, some drivers started to complain: "No one cares about us!"

But Zhang Fu didn't waver. He knew that as long as the combine produced coal, everyone's views would change. He thought that if he worked harder, he could solve the problem, often working from morning until twelve o'clock at night. Sometimes, when it wasn't his shift, if other drivers couldn't get it started, he would go down the mine to drive it for one shift.

The Combine Ended Up in the Auditorium

The leading comrades of the Datong Coal Mine Bureau heard the various opinions and decided to take a look at the combine. Some leading comrades said after seeing it: "This thing is just complicated, and the current conditions are not available. What kind of foundation does the Soviet Union have? What kind of foundation do we have? We can't let the combine occupy the latrine and not defecate!"

These words were like a bucket of cold water poured on Zhang Fu's head. But he wasn't discouraged. He remembered that when he started experimenting with the coal cutter, there were also people who opposed it, and it wasn't smooth sailing either...

The drivers all heard the leading comrades' words. Some drivers blamed Zhang Fu for insisting on working it hard. Because the inability to produce coal affected the drivers' income, some drivers complained: "If he wants to do it, let him do it! Don't listen to him."

Soon, a leading comrade from the North China Coal Mine Administration came, and Zhang Fu thought there was hope this time. But that leading comrade shook his head as soon as he went down the mine: "This thing really can't be done." He said without considering it: "Stop it for a while!"

The combine was moved up from the mine and coldly left in the auditorium.

In fact, these problems weren't really unsolvable. Soviet experts had commented on the Datong Coal Mine, believing that the coal seam here was the most stable, almost horizontal, and most suitable for combine mechanized mining. From the perspective of coal mines across the country, the conditions at Datong Mine should be said to be very good.

Unforgettable Days

Some people may have already forgotten the combine, but Zhang Fu still often visited the unattended combine.

Every day, he gently wiped off the dust on it and gently wiped away the water that people carelessly splashed on it.

Zhang Fu linked himself to the combine. Looking at the combine, he often thought about the past:

In that dark, low, and humid coal hole, relying on two hands and a spine, carrying hundreds of pounds of coal, crawling in and out. One winter, his cousin carried coal in the mine, sweating all over from exhaustion. When he reached the mine entrance, the piercing cold wind drilled into his pores. How could the burlap sack on his body block such wind! He collapsed while warming himself by the fire. After he died, his uncle and aunt, with no one to support them, also died.

Some miners may be lucky enough to live past forty, but unbearable asthma, lung disease, disability... all followed.

After liberation, the lives of miners are getting better day by day. Miners pushing coal carts in the mine no longer had to carry coal on their backs like animals. Winches and electric chutes were installed in the mine, and even pushing carts didn't require people to do it anymore. Not long after, there were coal cutters, and the era of digging coal by hand was gone forever. People said: "This is like going to paradise!"

But the Soviet elder brother said: "You haven't gotten rid of shovels and steel picks yet, and heavy manual labor hasn't been completely liberated." The Soviet elder brother immediately sent something that would lead coal miners to a truly happy road—the combine, which was an unimaginably ingenious thing! It truly mechanized the entire coal mining process...

Zhang Fu was a person who had personally experienced those painful days. He saw this bright road, so how could he lightly let it go!

The Combine Moves Again

One day, Deputy Mine Manager Lin, who had actively supported Zhang Fu at the mine, passed by the Datong Coal Mine. He heard about the combine and encouraged Zhang Fu: "Every new thing has to go through a difficult and tortuous road, and you should still persevere. You are a Communist Party member, and for the interests of the Party and the people, you can't be afraid of being rebuffed."

Zhang Fu was considering how to get the combine moving again when Qin Shizhu, a technician from the Coal Mine Management Bureau, happened to come to the Datong Coal Mine. As soon as he saw that the combine drivers were all working as odd jobs, he asked Zhang Fu what was going on. Zhang Fu told him in detail about the process of using the combine, and he said, "I'll help you write a letter."

About twenty days later, he told Zhang Fu that Vice Minister Song Zhichun of the Coal Mine Bureau had brought a reply. He also said that the Ministry of Fuel Industry also supported Zhang Fu's opinion. Zhang Fu was overjoyed. A few days later, Vice Chairman Zhao of the National Committee of the Coal Mine Workers' Union of China also came, talked with Zhang Fu, and discussed with him the significance of using the combine. He said that not only Datong Coal Mine should use the combine, but many coal mines in China will use the combine in the future. China must take the Soviet road, the socialist road, and must use machines to replace manual labor. Afterwards, meetings were held in the Mining Bureau building for three consecutive days. After this, like in the beginning, people were talking about the combine again.

After listening to Vice Chairman Zhao's words, Zhang Fu became clearer in his mind and more energetic. Without waiting for an order, he grabbed his safety lamp and, running and jumping, went down the mine with a steel pick. He ran to the working face he had previously identified and used the steel pick to clear the eighty-meter-long working face to see if it would work. He was still a little worried and pulled Qin Shizhu to help him take a look before he felt relieved.

With the support of the leadership, all problems were easily solved: the organizational leadership problems, operation regulation problems, wage problems, and the unity problems of the drivers, which had not been solved for a long time in the past, were solved one after another. This made Zhang Fu think that every good wish in the new society would be realized. The remaining question was how to lead everyone well. The drivers' technical level wasn't high, so a technical learning upsurge had to be launched so that everyone could become a genuine combine driver. The drivers believed Zhang Fu's words more than ever before and closely united around him. Everyone bought a copy of "Donbas Coal Mining Combine," and every Friday Zhang Fu gave everyone technical lessons. Since then, the combine has begun to exert its power again, and the production situation has greatly improved. Last September, they created a new national record of 13,254 tons of monthly output, and now they are moving towards a new record of 15,000 tons.

Now, you can see the combine drivers wearing shining mine lamps, happily going down the mine to work every day. The uniform crushing sound of the combine is constantly resounding in the mine, and the electric chute is filled with dark, shiny coal blocks, like an endless black stream, constantly flowing past, sending one coal car after another up the mine. In the labor upsurge of accelerating socialist industrialization, Zhang Fu and the workers of Datong Coal Mine are contributing great strength. (Attached Picture)

    张富和康拜因
    本报记者　金雨困
    康拜因第一次出现
    张富是我国第一批采煤康拜因手之一。当他从“康拜因司机训练班”回到大同煤矿的时候，正是一九五二年的四月。那年秋天，苏联一九五二年出厂的两台“顿巴斯—一”型的康拜因带着苏联人民的友谊，在大同煤矿出现了。
    张富和司机班的工人，得到了苏联专家捷尼索夫同志热情的帮助，在一九五三年十一月三日，把康拜因采煤试验成功了。
    人们一走进康拜因工作的掌子面，就看见一个庞大的“怪物”，在那里向一道长长的望不到头的煤壁进攻。它张着大嘴啃食着坚硬的煤层，把一整块的煤和煤层分割开来。这些煤块又自动地被机件破碎成大小不等的煤块，送进装煤机，然后自动地跑进了电溜子。就这样，成吨成吨的煤就像流水一样被输送出去。从割煤到碎煤到装煤的整个过程，只要一个司机操纵。
    人们还记得在“顿巴斯矿工”的电影里，姑娘们唱着：“过时了，我的情人，拿铁铲下矿井。快学会康拜因，然后向我求婚”。姑娘们歌唱的就是这个康拜因。还有那老荣誉矿工聂道连在矿井里说的：“截煤机给我增加了二十年生命，今后康拜因又将给我增加十多年寿命。”老矿工所感动的就是这个康拜因。康拜因的出现，把苏联煤矿工作推进了一个新时代。而现在，这样的新时代也在我们的煤矿工业中开始了。
    康拜因在大同煤矿的出现，给生产上带来了从未有过的奇迹。一部康拜因一天能出五百来吨煤，顶几百个人一天的工作量。
    康拜因初到矿上，人们充满了新奇、羡慕和兴奋的情绪，领导干部对它更是爱护备至。人人都喜爱康拜因的效率高，产量多，和它的连续不断的生产。但是，怎样才能更充分地发挥康拜因的效率，从而把祖国的煤矿工业推向前进一步？不少人却想得很少。只有张富，他见了康拜因，就像着了迷，一天到黑想着康拜因的事。
    没人管的康拜因
    当苏联专家一离开大同煤矿，有些领导人员为了“转向基本建设”，就抽走了干部和技术人员，这是推行康拜因采煤工作遇到的第一个困难。就在这时，又碰上了地质上新的情况，煤层凹凸不平，还夹带着许多石棱，有时康拜因开着开着就不动了。
    经过初步训练的司机们，只知道怎么操纵，但不会修理，康拜因出了毛病，他们就着慌了，谁也不知道该怎么办。康拜因碰上了石头，轧得直冒火星。上面的人不知道，下面的人知道也没有办法。司机们还是照常开着这台坏了的康拜因工作。这样，它一天碰掉了十八个牙齿，一个月总得碰掉一百来个。
    康拜因是高度技术的产物。它在煤矿里工作，就像流水一样，一个地方发生故障，水就不能畅通。例如电溜子出了事故，康拜因出的煤运不出去，它就只好停止；打眼放炮和支柱的工人只好休息；整个掌子面也就要停止工作了。康拜因要求二十秒钟来一个车皮，可是车皮供应不上；两三个钟头也来不了一趟。车皮不来，一连串的问题又跟着来了。碰到了这些困难，本来啃煤如啃泥的康拜因，现在也有些像老牛破车了。事故接二连三地发生，一天干不上一两个钟头，进不了二十公尺，每天出的煤还不到截煤机出产的煤的三分之一。
    出不了煤，人们的兴趣也随着低落了。提起康拜因来就摇头。“这么大的玩意儿，好是好，就是出不了煤。”“这玩意儿弄坏了可负不了责，真是惹不得！”可是张富不和他们相同，他就像家中有亲人得了什么重病一样，整天找矿长，找工程师，找区长想解决办法。起先，人们还觉得张富热情可贵，日子久了，有些干部就有些不耐烦起来：“干吗这么着急呀！你们自己解决去，如果解决不了，就算了吧，不如还是使截煤机。”看见干部对康拜因这样冷淡，有的司机也就乱吵吵起来：“我们没有人管了！”
    但张富并不动摇，他知道只要康拜因出了煤，大家的看法就会改变的。他以为自己多干点就能解决问题，常常从早晨起来干到晚上十二点。有时不该班的时候，别的司机开不动了，他也下井去开它一班。
    康拜因在大礼堂里呆起来了
    大同煤矿矿务局领导同志听到众说纷纭，就决定去看看康拜因。有的领导同志看了后说：“这玩意儿就是复杂，目前各种条件都不具备。人家苏联是什么基础？咱们是什么基础？不能老让康拜因占了毛厕不拉屎呢！”
    这些话，像一盆凉水浇在张富的头上。但他并不灰心。他想起开始试验截煤机的时候，也是有人反对，也不是平平安安的呀……。
    领导同志的话，司机们都听见了。有的司机就埋怨张富不该硬干。由于出不了煤影响了司机们的收入，有个别的司机就埋怨说：“他要干就让他去干吧！不听他的。”
    不久，华北煤矿管理局的一位领导同志来了，张富以为这次有希望了。可是那位领导同志一下井就摇头：“这玩意儿确实不能干”，他考虑也没有考虑就说：“停些日子再说吧！”
    康拜因就这样从井里移上来，冷冷清清地搁置在大礼堂里。
    事实上这些问题并不是真是没有办法的。苏联专家曾给大同煤矿下过评语，认为这里煤层最稳定，几乎接近水平状态，最适宜康拜因机械化开采。从全国煤矿来说，大同矿具备的条件应该说是很好的。
    难忘的日子
    有些人也许早把康拜因忘记了，只有张富还是经常去探望这个没人管的康拜因。
    每天每天，他把落在上面的灰尘轻轻地抹掉，把人家不留意泼上的水轻轻地擦去。
    张富把自己和康拜因连在一起了，看着康拜因，他常常想着过去：
    在那黑黝黝的低矮潮湿的煤洞里，凭着两只手和一条脊梁，背着成百斤的煤，爬进爬出。有一年冬天，他的姨弟在井下背煤，累得满身淌汗，到了井口，刺骨的寒风往毛孔里钻。身上披的麻袋那能挡得住这样的风呀！他在火旁烤着烤着，就倒下去了。他一死，姨父、姨母没人扶养，也跟着死去了。
    有的矿工也许侥幸能活过四十岁，但是难挨的气喘、肺病、残废……，都跟踪而来了。
    解放了，矿工的生活一天天地在变好。矿工在井下推着煤车，不再像牲口一样用背脊驮着煤。井下安装了绞车和电溜子，连推车也用不着人来干了。隔不多时，又有了截煤机，用手刨煤的时代也一去不复回了。人们说：“这下子可到了天堂！”
    但是，苏联老大哥说：“你们现在还没有撩掉铁铲钢镐，沉重的体力劳动还没有彻底解放。”苏联老大哥马上送来了把煤矿工人引向真正幸福道路的东西——康拜因，这是想也想不到的巧妙的东西呀！它把采煤过程真正的全部机械化了……。
    张富是亲身经历过那些痛苦日子的人，他看到了这条光明大道，那能轻轻地放过呢！
    康拜因又动起来了
    有一天，曾在矿上积极支持过张富的林副矿长路过大同煤矿，他听到了康拜因的事，鼓励张富说：“什么新的事情，都要经过艰难曲折的道路，你还是应该坚持下去。你是个共产党员，为了党和人民的利益，就不能怕碰钉子。”
    张富正在考虑怎样叫康拜因再动起来的时候，恰巧煤矿管理总局技术员秦世柱来到了大同煤矿。他一看见康拜因的司机们都当了杂工，就问张富是怎么回事，张富把使用康拜因的经过详细地告诉了他，他说：“我帮你写个信吧。”
    隔了二十来天，他告诉张富：煤矿总局宋之春副局长捎来了回信。还说：中央燃料工业部也支持张富的意见。这可把张富乐坏了。不几日，中国煤矿工会全国委员会赵副主席也来了，找张富谈了话，和他谈了使用康拜因的意义。他说：不仅大同煤矿要使用康拜因，将来中国许多煤矿都要用康拜因。中国要走苏联的路，要走社会主义的路，一定要用机器来代替人工。接着，矿务局的大楼内接连开了三天会。这以后，又像开始一样，人们纷纷地谈着康拜因了。
    张富听了赵副主席的话，心里更清楚了，劲儿也更大了。他没等到命令，就连奔带跳地背上安全灯，找了一把钢镐跑下井去了。他跑到早先看好的掌子面上，拿钢镐把八十公尺长的掌子面都刨了一遍，看看究竟行不行。他还不大放心，又把秦世柱拉去帮着看看，他这才放心了。
    领导方面一支持，什么问题都容易解决：过去长期解决不了的掌子面的组织领导问题、操作规程问题、工资问题和司机们的团结问题，都一个跟着一个地解决了。这使张富想到在新社会里每一个好的愿望总会实现的。剩下的问题，就是怎样把大家带好。司机们的技术水平还不高，要掀起一个学习技术的热潮，使大家成为一个名符其实的康拜因司机。司机们比过去任何时候都更相信张富的话了，紧紧团结在他的周围。每个人买了一本“顿巴斯采煤康拜因”，逢星期五张富就给大家上技术课。从此，康拜因又开始发挥它的威力了，生产情况大大好转。去年九月，创造了月产一万三千二百五十四吨的全国新纪录，现在，他们又在向一万五千吨的新纪录迈进。
    现在，可以看到，每天康拜因司机们带着闪亮的矿灯，愉快地下井工作。康拜因均匀的碎煤声在井下不断地响着，电溜子里乌亮亮的煤块装得满满地，像一条无穷尽的黑色的溪流，不断地流过去，一车皮一车皮地送上井去。在加速社会主义工业化的劳动热潮中，张富和大同煤矿的工人一起，正在贡献出伟大的力量。（附图片）
