    For Our Better Days
    Told by Xi Bingzhen, a farmer from Laiguangying Township, Eastern District of Beijing

    Comrade, you're asking me about buying 500,000 yuan of government bonds? That’s really a small matter. The effort I’m putting in for the country now is nothing compared to the benefits the country has given my family in recent years!

    When the Japanese devils were here, my son Liu Chongshan was an apprentice in the city. The family had no choice, so I went out to cook for people. After the Japanese devils left, my son couldn't continue his apprenticeship because of illness, but he didn't dare return to the countryside to farm either. At that time, we were afraid of the Kuomintang conscripting soldiers! He didn't come home to farm until just before liberation. During that period, we always lived a hard life of lacking food and clothing.

    After liberation, the state distributed land and grain, and our family finally had a bit of a foundation. Afterward, the government led us to organize ourselves, taught us new technologies, and life has been getting better year after year.

    Some people don't understand how my family could buy so many government bonds. Someone in Anjiazhen Township said, "I heard that there's a widow in Laiguangying who bought 500,000 yuan of government bonds. Where did she get so much money?" Comrade, let me help you do the math.

    In the spring of 1952, we joined the mutual aid team. In 1951, before joining the mutual aid team, the government called on us to grow cotton, but we didn't understand the techniques and didn't dare to grow it ourselves. This year, after joining the mutual aid team, everyone helped us plant 0.786 mu of cotton, and our income increased. After the autumn harvest, besides buying pigs, we had extra money and partnered with others to buy a cotton gin powered by a horse.

    The winter before last, when planting wheat, the government called for close planting, and our mutual aid team followed the advice. Last year, when planting corn, the government called for wide ridges with close planting and phased fertilization, and we followed those instructions too. When planting millet, we also responded to the government's call to use white arsenic to poison the soil and control mole crickets. When we added it all up in the fall, we harvested so much more grain! The year before last, we harvested 260-270 jin of grain per mu, but last year, we harvested about 300 jin per mu. Our 11.5 mu of land yielded a total of more than 3,400 jin of grain. When selling surplus grain to support our worker comrades, our family sold 1,000 jin of grain and earned about 800,000 yuan. We also sold 248 jin of seed cotton from one mu of cotton, which was more than 740,000 yuan. We spent 575,000 yuan to buy a little donkey, and our family finally had livestock! We also bought two pigs and 49 chi of cloth. Using the money from selling surplus grain, plus some cotton money, we deposited 900,000 yuan at the credit cooperative all at once. We never deposited money there in the past!

    When the township cadres saw that I wanted to buy 500,000 yuan of government bonds, they even advised me to buy less, saying that it shouldn't affect production and life. I told them, "We're not scraping this money from our teeth to buy government bonds. When we sold the surplus grain, we had already planned and set aside enough grain for our family of four to eat. Our chickens lay eggs, which is enough for our family to eat vegetables. As for clothes, we don't need to add any new ones this year. For production, our donkey has already joined the cooperative, and the 400,000 yuan we had on deposit at the credit cooperative has also been invested in the cooperative to buy fertilizer. This 500,000 yuan is just sitting there idle. Why shouldn't I support national construction!"

    Comrade, my idea for buying government bonds is this: the country spends a lot of money on construction. Chairman Mao is managing this household for us, leading us in construction, isn't it all for us to live better lives! I don't plan to lend out that 500,000 yuan and take the capitalist road. I'm buying government bonds with it so that our worker comrades can build machines for us. In the future, farming will be easier, and we'll harvest even more grain. Besides, in a few years, when industrial construction is successful, things will be even cheaper, and won't I be able to buy even more cheap things! (Recorded by Long Chun)

    为了咱们的好日子
    北京市东郊区来广营乡农民席冰贞讲
    同志，你要问我买五十万元公债的事儿？那可实在是件小事。如今我给国家出这么点力，可是国家这几年给我们家的好处有多大呢！
    日本鬼子在的时候，我儿子刘崇善在城里当学徒，家里没办法，我出去给人家做饭。日本鬼子走了，我儿子因为有病不当学徒了，可是也不敢回乡下种地。那会儿怕国民党抓兵啊！快解放了，他才回家种地。那一阵子，过的总是缺吃少穿的苦日子。
    解放后，国家分给地，分给粮食，咱们家里才有了点家底。过后，政府领导咱们组织起来，教咱们新技术，生活可就一年一年好起来了。
    有些人不知道我们家怎么能买这么多公债。安家坟乡有人说：“听说来广营有个寡妇，买了五十万元公债，她那儿来的这么多钱啊？”同志，你就帮我算算账吧。
    一九五二年春天，咱们参加了互助组。在一九五一年没有参加互助组，政府号召种棉花，咱们不懂种棉花的道儿，自己不敢种。这年参加了互助组，大伙帮助种了七分八厘六的棉花，收入就多了。秋后，除了买猪，还有余钱和人家搭伙买了架马拉弹花机。
    前年冬天种小麦，政府号召密植，咱们互助组就加密了。去年种玉米的时候，政府号召宽垅密植、分期施肥，咱们就照着办。种谷子，咱们也响应政府号召，使白砒霜毒谷治蝼蛄。到秋后一合计，打的粮食可多啦！前年一亩地打二百六、七十斤粮，去年一亩合着打三百来斤。咱们十一亩半地，合着打三千四百多斤粮。卖余粮的时候，为了支援工人老大哥，咱们家卖了一千斤粮食，得了八十来万元。还有一亩棉花，卖了二百四十八斤籽棉，就是七十四万多元。花五十七万五千元买了头小毛驴，咱们家也有了牲口！另外买了两口猪，买了四十九尺布。把卖余粮的钱，加上点棉花钱，在信用合作社一下子就存了九十万元，过去咱们那里存过钱啊！
    乡干部见我要买五十万元公债，还劝我少买点，说不要影响生产和生活。我就跟他们说：“咱们买公债可不是由牙齿上刮。咱们家四口人吃的粮食，在卖余粮的时候，早就合计好，留够了；小鸡下蛋，就够咱们家吃菜的；穿的，一年也不用添。生产上，咱们那头毛驴已经入了社，在信用合作社里活期存的四十万元也向社里投资买了肥料。这五十万元放那儿也是闲着，干么不让我支援国家建设！”
    同志，我买公债就是本着这么个主意：国家搞建设，花钱是多的。毛主席给咱们当这份家，领导咱们搞建设，还不是为了咱们过好日子！我那五十万块钱，又不打算放给人家，走资本主义的道儿。我把它买公债，让工人老大哥给咱们造机器，以后咱们种地就轻省了，打的粮食还要多。再说，过几年工业建设搞好了，东西更便宜，我还不是能买更多便宜东西！　（龙春记）
