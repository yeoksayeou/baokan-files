Broadcast Gymnastics for the Body
Zhang Huatang

Starting from December 1, 1951, the Central People's Broadcasting Station and other local radio stations have successively launched broadcast gymnastics programs. The facts of the past two years have proven that broadcast gymnastics has great benefits for the body. People who regularly do broadcast gymnastics feel that their physical fitness has improved, their appetite has increased, they feel much more energetic, and their work efficiency has also improved. Xu Guanghua from the Minfeng Paper Mill in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, said: "Since doing broadcast gymnastics, I have a better appetite than before." Model worker Qiu Dabao said: "If I don't do the exercises for a day, it feels like I haven't done something." Dai Zujian, from Chongqing Telecommunications Factory No. 1, said: "Broadcast gymnastics has made me healthy, and now I can work energetically and persistently." More than 95% of the more than 400 male and female employees of the East Repair Machine Factory of Tangshan Qixin Cement Company participated in broadcast gymnastics, and they generally reported that their bodies were stronger than before and their production efficiency had increased. A worker in the second workshop of Jiangnan No. 31 Factory in the Central and Southern District said: "Before, I felt tired after working for a long time, but now I feel much more energetic." Some workers said: "After doing the exercises, I eat more and sleep better."

In May of last year, the East China Sports Commission, the East China Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Sports Association jointly sent people to the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory to select 30 workers with relatively poor physical fitness from the spinning workshop for a typical broadcast gymnastics experiment. Among the 30 participants, 23 were female workers and 7 were male workers. Beforehand, doctors conducted physical examinations on them, and they generally had symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, indigestion, insomnia, and back pain. After a month of broadcast gymnastics, many people's illnesses gradually eased, some became stronger, more energetic, and more motivated to work. The female workers' weight increased by an average of 1.7 catties per person, and their vital capacity increased by an average of 179 milliliters. The male workers' weight increased by an average of 3.09 catties per person, and their vital capacity increased by an average of 374 milliliters. Therefore, broadcast gymnastics has become a popular sports activity for all employees in this factory.

Broadcast gymnastics not only has the function of exercising physical strength and enhancing physical fitness, but also cultivates people's basic and auxiliary exercises for other sports (such as track and field, ball sports, apparatus gymnastics, swimming, water skiing, etc.); and because its movements are relatively gentle, it can also be used as a warm-up and cool-down exercise for other sports. Broadcast gymnastics is a simple and easy-to-do exercise that can be done in the morning, noon, or evening; it can be done collectively or individually; it can be done in a square or indoors. Physical laborers who regularly do gymnastics can correct certain deformities caused by certain operations; intellectual laborers who can regularly do gymnastics can make their bodies, limbs, joints, and muscles frequently exercised, increase vitality, promote blood circulation, eliminate the degeneration of certain parts of the body caused by long-term lack of exercise, correct bad postures such as hunching over, and improve their health.

    广播体操对身体的好处
    张华堂
    从一九五一年十二月一日开始，中央人民广播电台以及其他各地广播电台，都先后举办了广播体操节目。两年以来的事实证明，广播体操对身体有很大的好处。凡是经常做广播体操的人，都感到体质增强了，饭量增加了，精神好多了，工作效率也提高了。浙江省嘉兴市民丰造纸厂许光华说：“做广播体操以来，吃饭比以前香了。”劳动模范仇大宝说：“一天不做操，就好像有什么事没有做似的。”重庆电信一厂戴祖鉴同志说：“广播体操使我身体健康起来，现在我能精神饱满、持久地工作了。”唐山启新洋灰公司东修机厂四百多个男女职工，百分之九十五以上都参加了广播体操，他们普遍反映身体比以前壮了，生产效率提高了。中南区江○三一工厂第二车间有一个工人说：“以前工作久了，就感到疲倦，现在精神饱满多了。”有的工人说：“做了体操，饭也吃得多，觉也睡得好。”
    去年五月，华东体育运动委员会与青年团华东工委、上海市体育会筹备会等单位，曾共同派人到国营上海第五棉纺织厂，选择细纱间三十个体质较差的工人，作广播体操典型试验。参加试验的三十人中，女工占二十三人，男工为七人。事先，医生对他们进行了体格检查，一般都有头晕、头痛、消化不良、失眠、腰酸背痛等现象。经过一个月的广播体操，许多人的病都慢慢减轻了，有的体力增强，精神饱满，工作有劲了。女工的体重平均每人增加一点七市斤，肺活量平均增加一七九毫升。男工体重平均每人增加三点零九市斤，肺活量平均增加了三百七十四毫升。因此，广播体操已经成为这个厂子里全体职工普遍的体育活动了。
    广播体操不但具有锻炼体力、增强体质的功能，还能培养人们进行其他各项体育运动（如田径运动、球类运动、器械体操、游泳、滑水等）的基本练习和补助运动；又因为它的动作比较和缓，还可以作为进行其他各种运动的准备运动和整理运动。广播体操是一种简而易行的运动，既可在早晨做，也可在中午或晚上做；既可集体做，也可以单独做；既可在广场上做，也可以在室内做。体力劳动者经常做体操，可以矫正某些操作所造成的身体的畸形发展；脑力劳动者如能经常做体操，可以使躯体、四肢、关节、肌肉经常受到锻炼，增加活力，旺盛血行，消除身体某些部分的组织因长期不锻炼而产生的衰退现象，矫正弯腰曲背的不良姿势，改善自己的健康情况。
