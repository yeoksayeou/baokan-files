    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department

    January Output Sets Highest Record Since Furnace Construction

    The entire staff of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's electric furnace steelmaking department, through practical actions in launching a labor competition, ensured that the first quarter production this year would not be lower than the fourth quarter of last year, and comprehensively overfulfilled the January production plan six days ahead of schedule. The steelmaking output in January exceeded the highest monthly output of last year by 9.3%, and set the highest monthly output record since the electric furnace steelmaking department was built. In January, output exceeded the planned target by 126.2%; the qualified rate of steel ingots reached 99.79%, an increase of 1.79% over the state plan; and the cost was reduced by approximately 6% compared to the state plan. The full-month attendance rate reached 97.1%, and ten groups achieved full attendance. The daily equilibrium rate reached 100%. The electric furnace operation rate increased by 9.63% compared to December of last year, and the average smelting time per furnace was shortened by 48 minutes compared to December of last year. Since New Year's Day, the staff has created eleven new records for shortening smelting time and two new records for daily output throughout the month.

    一月份产量创建炉以来最高纪录
    太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部全体职工以开展劳动竞赛的实际行动，保证今年第一季度生产不低于去年第四季度的水平，提前六天全面超额完成了一月份的生产计划。一月份炼钢的产量超过了去年最高月份产量百分之九点三，并创电炉炼钢部建炉以来的月产量最高纪录。一月份产量超额完成计划百分之一百二十六点二；钢锭合格品率达到百分之九十九点七九，比国家计划提高了百分之一点七九；成本比国家计划降低百分之六左右。全月出勤率达到百分之九十七点一，并出现了十个全勤小组，日均衡率达到百分之百。电炉作业率比去年十二月份提高百分之九点六三，平均每炉冶炼时间比去年十二月份缩短了四十八分钟。自元旦起，职工们全月还创造了十一次缩短冶炼时间新纪录和两次日产新纪录。
