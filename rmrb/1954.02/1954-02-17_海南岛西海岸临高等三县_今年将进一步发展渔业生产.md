    Hainan Island's West Coast, Lingao, Danxian, and Yaxian Counties
    This Year to Further Develop Fishery Production
    Lingao, Danxian, and Yaxian Counties on the west coast of Hainan Island have established specialized organizations to lead fishery production and have determined that this year's fishery production will increase by 15.7% based on last year's bumper harvest. To ensure the completion of the increased production task, Lingao and other three counties will actively and steadily develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations for fishery production. The state will issue fishery production loans in these three counties, establish supply and marketing cooperatives, and carry out basic construction in major fishing ports.
      Last year, fishermen in Lingao, Danxian, and Yaxian counties reported increased production in both deep-sea and shallow-sea operations. According to statistics from the Hainan District Aquatic Products Department, fishermen in the three counties of Lingao, etc., caught more than 466,000 dan of red fish, hemp fish, pomfret, red bone fish, squid, dried shrimp, sea cucumber, etc., an increase of more than 20% compared with 1952. Among them, trawler operations increased production by 30% to 50%. In Danxian's Ganchong Port, fishing boats with a load of more than 300 dan obtained an average of 750 dan of fish products per boat, creating a new fishing record in many years. The three purchasing stations established by the Hainan District Aquatic Products Enterprise Company in Yaxian and Danxian counties purchased a total of 56,700 dan of fresh fish, seafood, and salted fish last year, an increase of more than four times compared with 1952. In addition to increasing the supply of fish products to various counties and ethnic minorities in the mountainous areas of Hainan Island, the company also supplied a large number of valuable seafood such as squid, sea cucumber, and dried shrimp to cities such as Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shanghai, and Anshan. With the brisk sales of fish products, the lives of fishermen have also greatly improved. Fishermen in Ganchong Port in Danxian alone built 20 new brick and tile houses and five new trawler fishing boats after last year's bumper harvest. (Xinhua News Agency)

    海南岛西海岸临高等三县
    今年将进一步发展渔业生产
    海南岛西海岸临高、儋县、崖县已成立专门领导渔业生产的机构，并确定今年渔业在去年丰收的基础上增产百分之十五点七。为保证增产任务的完成，临高等三县将积极稳步地发展渔业生产互助合作组织，国家将在这三个县发放渔业生产贷款，建立供销合作社，并在主要渔港进行基本建设。
      去年，临高、儋县、崖县三县渔民进行深海和浅海作业都告增产。据海南区水产部门统计，去年临高等三县渔民捕获的红鱼、麻鱼、仓鱼、红骨鱼、鱿鱼、虾米、海参等达四十六万六千多担，比一九五二年增产百分之二十以上。其中拖风船作业增产百分之三十到五十。儋县干冲港载重三百多担的渔船，平均每船获得鱼产七百五十担，创造了多年来捕鱼的新纪录。海南区水产企业公司在崖县和儋县设立的三个收购站，去年共收购鲜鱼、海味、咸鱼五万六千七百市担，比一九五二年增加了四倍多。该公司除对海南岛各县和山区的少数民族增加了鱼货供应外，还把大量鱿鱼、海参、虾米等珍贵海味供应广州、武汉、上海、鞍山等城市。随着鱼货的畅销，渔民生活也大大改善。仅儋县干冲港渔民就在去年丰收后新建二十座砖瓦房屋，新造拖风作业渔船五艘。　（新华社）
