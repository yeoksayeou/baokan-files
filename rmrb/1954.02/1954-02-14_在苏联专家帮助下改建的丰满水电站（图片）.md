In the four years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet Union has given our country sincere and selfless assistance, enabling the rapid recovery and development of our economic construction. This fully demonstrates the internationalist spirit of the great socialist country. The Fengman Hydropower Station, our country's first large-scale hydropower station, was rebuilt with the sincere and selfless help and guidance of Soviet experts. Soviet experts helped us use advanced design, construction technology and equipment to transform this originally backward and incomplete hydropower station into a completely new large-scale hydropower station. Two turbine generators that had never been overhauled were restored to normal power generation, and the latest turbine generators and fully automated operating devices were reinstalled. During the construction and installation process, Soviet experts put forward more than 730 suggestions and advanced experiences, improved construction methods and management methods, and trained a large number of technical talents, laying a solid foundation for China's hydropower construction. This hydropower station not only undertakes important power supply tasks in the Northeast power grid, but also plays a huge role in flood control, irrigation, and navigation upstream and downstream of the Songhua River.

    在苏联专家帮助下改建的丰满水电站
    在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订以来的四年中，苏联给予我国真诚无私的援助，使我国经济建设得到了迅速的恢复和发展，这充分表现了伟大社会主义国家的国际主义精神。我国第一座大型水电站——丰满水电站就是在苏联专家的真诚无私的帮助和指导下改建成的。苏联专实帮助我们用先进的设计、施工技术和装备，把这座原来落后的、残缺不全的水电站改建成一座完全新型的大水电站了。原来从未检修过的两台水轮发电机恢复了正常发电，且重新安装了最新型的涡轮发电机和全部自动化的操作装置。在施工和安装过程中，苏联专家提出各种建议和先进经验七百三十余件，改进施工方法和管理方法，培养了大批的技术人才，为我国水力发电建设事业打下了坚实的基础。这个水电站不仅在东北电力网中担负起重要的供电任务，而且对于松花江下游的防洪、灌溉和上下游的通航等起着巨大的作用。
