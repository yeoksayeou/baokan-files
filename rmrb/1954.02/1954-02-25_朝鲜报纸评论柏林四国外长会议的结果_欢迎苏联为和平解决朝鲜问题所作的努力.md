    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 23rd: Pyongyang newspapers published editorials on the 22nd, commenting on the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    "Labor News" published an editorial entitled "The Path to Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue and Easing International Tensions," stating: The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference reached an agreement to convene a conference in Geneva with the participation of representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the People's Republic of China, and other relevant countries, in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and discuss the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. The Korean people, together with all peace-loving people around the world, warmly support this agreement of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. This is because the agreement is conducive to consolidating peace and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and is a step forward in stopping the bloody war in Indochina, restoring peace, and easing international tensions. The editorial pointed out that the achievement of this agreement by the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is the result of the Soviet Union's consistent adherence to a peaceful policy, its firm stance, and its sincere efforts.

    The editorial said: "The question now is to ensure that the resolution of the issues that have been agreed upon is in accordance with the wishes of the people concerned, and that they themselves decide their own destiny. Regarding the Korean issue, the key lies in: completely withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, not allowing other countries to interfere in our internal affairs, and resolving the Korean issue by the Korean people themselves."

    The editorial in "Democratic Korea" pointed out, after analyzing the different positions of the Soviet Union and the three Western countries at the Berlin Conference: Although the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach agreements on a series of important issues such as the German issue and the Austrian issue, it reached an agreement on convening the Geneva Conference to discuss the Korean issue and the Indochina issue, and reached a certain agreement on the issue of arms reduction. As Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out at the closing meeting, the Geneva Conference proposed by the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will help the final settlement of the Korean issue, and therefore this agreement is beneficial to consolidating peace and peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

    The editorial concluded by saying: We must further heighten our vigilance against international reactionary forces, and continue to struggle to further resolve the issues that this Four Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to resolve and the issues that have been agreed upon, and to further ease international tensions.

    朝鲜报纸评论柏林四国外长会议的结果
    欢迎苏联为和平解决朝鲜问题所作的努力
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】平壤各报在二十二日发表社论，评论柏林四国外长会议的结果。
    “劳动新闻”以“和平解决朝鲜问题与缓和国际紧张局势的道路”为题，发表社论说：柏林四国外长会议取得协议，决定在日内瓦召开苏、美、法、英、中华人民共和国和有关各国代表参加的会议，以便和平解决朝鲜问题和讨论印度支那的和平问题。朝鲜人民和全世界善良的人们一起，热烈地支持四国外长会议的这项协议。因为这个协议有利于巩固和平与朝鲜问题的和平解决，对于在印度支那停止流血战争、恢复和平与缓和国际紧张局势是前进了一步的。社论指出：四国外长会议这项协议的达成，是苏联始终如一地执行和平政策的坚定立场和诚挚努力的结果。
    社论说：“今后的问题在于保证已经达成协议的问题的解决符合于有关人民的意愿，并由他们自己决定自己的命运。关于朝鲜问题，关键在于：从朝鲜完全撤退一切外国军队，不容许别国干涉我国内政，朝鲜问题由朝鲜人民自己解决。”
    “民主朝鲜报”的社论在分析苏联和西方三国在柏林会议上的不同立场后指出：柏林四国外长会议虽然未能对德国问题和奥地利问题等一系列的重要问题达成协议，但是对于召开讨论朝鲜问题和印度支那问题的日内瓦会议达成了协议，并对裁减军备问题达成了一定的协议。正如苏联外长莫洛托夫在闭幕会议上所指出的那样，四国外长会议所建议召开的日内瓦会议将对朝鲜问题的最后解决有所帮助，因而这种协议对巩固和平以及和平解决朝鲜问题是有利的。
    社论最后说：我们要进一步提高对国际反动势力的警惕，为了进一步解决这次四国外长会议未能解决的问题和已达成协议的问题，并为了进一步缓和国际紧张局势而继续奋斗。
