Hunan, Lianyuan County
Kailishan Coalfield Begins Drilling
    In order to supply coking coal for the needs of the Central China Steel Company, exploration work at the Kailishan Coalfield in Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, is being actively carried out. The Kailishan Coalfield has very rich reserves and excellent coal quality, making it a rare source of coking coal south of the Yangtze River. In 1952, the Industry Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government sent personnel to complete regional topographic surveys and conduct trench and well exploration. Currently, relevant departments have organized forces to begin drilling. To coordinate with the development of the drilling project, the construction of the highway between the Kailishan area and the Lianshui River, as well as the future Xiangqian Railway, began on January 20th. The Lianyuan County People's Government is mobilizing local farmers to actively assist in this project.

    湖南涟源县
    ?笠山煤田开始钻探
    为了供应华中钢铁公司炼焦的需要，湖南省涟源县?笠山煤田的勘探工作正在积极进行。?笠山煤田的蕴藏量非常丰富，煤质也很好，是长江以南稀有的炼焦煤。一九五二年，湖南省人民政府工业厅曾派人到那里完成了地区地形的测绘，进行了槽探和井探。目前，有关部门已组织力量开始进行钻探。配合钻探工程的开展，?笠山地区与涟水及未来的湘黔路之间的公路修筑工程，已于一月二十日开始动工，涟源县人民政府正在动员当地农民积极协助这一工程。
