    Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference Continues Discussions on the Austrian State Treaty
    Molotov Advocates Continued Discussion of Soviet Proposals
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 17th] (TASS, February 16th) The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference held a meeting on February 16th at the former Allied Control Council building to continue discussing the third item on the agenda, "The Question of the Austrian State Treaty," chaired by Bidault.
    As is known, at the meeting on February 14th, the head of the Austrian government delegation, Figl, said that regarding the Soviet delegation's proposals to include Supplementary Clause 4(b) and to amend Article 33 in the treaty, he could not state the Austrian government's position because he had not received instructions from his government.
    At the meeting on the 16th, Figl was the first to speak. He said that he could not accept the Soviet proposals. The Austrian government had authorized him to formally declare that the Austrian government could not agree to any further changes to the draft treaty that had already been agreed upon here. In explaining the Austrian government's attitude towards the measures proposed by the Soviet Union to prevent a new Anschluss between Germany and Austria, Figl said that the Austrian government was "fully aware" of the tragic consequences that the 1938 Anschluss brought to Austria and all of Europe. He assured that Austria would not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory.
    Eden then spoke. He was satisfied with the Austrian government's response to the Soviet proposals. He did not discuss the substance of the Soviet proposals at all, but only expressed the hope that the Soviet delegation would withdraw these proposals.
    After Eden's speech, Molotov spoke. Molotov first pointed out that it was entirely possible to sign the Austrian State Treaty at the Berlin Conference. The Soviet proposals for the Austrian State Treaty could be considered to be largely agreed upon, and he suggested discussing the two amendments to the treaty proposed by the Soviet delegation. This would not require redrafting the entire treaty, as only two clauses were in dispute: Clause 4(b) and Article 33. If we study and arrive at wording for the above clauses that is acceptable to everyone, the passage of the treaty would no longer be delayed.
    Molotov said: We have heard here that Dulles also supports the view that Austria can be neutral and should not participate in any military blocs. Therefore, the Soviet government's proposal regarding Clause 4(b) is not inconsistent with the position taken by Dulles. On the other hand, the Austrian government itself has made an important statement on this issue, saying that Austria will not participate in military blocs. Therefore, the Soviet proposal clearly does not violate the Austrian government's position.
    Referring to Figl's statement that Austria would not allow foreign military bases to be established on its territory, Molotov said: We welcome this statement by the Austrian government and hope that it is precisely for this reason that the Soviet proposal to include Clause 4(b), which stipulates the prohibition of the establishment of foreign military bases on Austrian territory, can be accepted.
    Molotov then spoke about the Soviet amendment to Article 33. According to this, the governments of the four countries, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, would have the right to temporarily postpone the withdrawal of their troops from Austria after the Austrian State Treaty came into effect until the conclusion of a German peace treaty. Molotov pointed out that this amendment was a temporary measure because, as the Soviet delegation hoped, the four countries on which the conclusion of a German peace treaty depended would not unduly delay the completion of this task.
    Molotov further pointed out that the Soviet government proposed the amendment to Article 33 because some people are currently promoting the plan to establish a "European Defense Community." If it were not for this plan, if it were not for the plan to revive German militarism, and if there were no threat of a German-Austrian Anschluss, the Soviet Union would not have made these two proposals. Molotov said that Figl said that there was no danger of a German-Austrian Anschluss at all because the Austrian government did not want it. Historical experience has shown that events such as the German-Austrian Anschluss do not depend solely on Austria's wishes. We must anticipate that the forces eager to revive German militarism in West Germany and use it to realize a new plan for a German-Austrian Anschluss are becoming increasingly rampant.
    Molotov continued, saying that the Soviet delegation was not attached to every word of its drafted Article 33. As long as everyone is willing to negotiate, it is possible to find the right wording for this article so that it conforms to the interests of safeguarding peace and conforms to Austria's own interests, while accurately determining and limiting the authority of foreign troops temporarily remaining in Austrian territory, so that it fully conforms to the economic, cultural, and political interests of the Austrian state, and minimizes this temporary restriction on Austria. Molotov concluded that the Soviet proposals were in Austria's national interest. This proposal does not affect Austria's cultural, economic, and political relations with other countries in any way. It only restricts Austria in one aspect, namely the temporary stationing of foreign troops on Austrian territory and Austria's inability to conclude agreements of a military nature with other countries. If a calm assessment of the situation is made, the Austrian government can reach this clear and rational conclusion. There is no reason for the Austrian government to refuse to accept the appropriate proposals put forward by the Soviet government in response to the actions of other governments.
    Dulles then spoke. He attempted to shift the responsibility for the failure to conclude the Austrian State Treaty onto the Soviet government. Dulles tried hard to create the impression that there was nothing in the international environment to suggest the need to take measures to prevent a German-Austrian Anschluss.
    Bidault then spoke, also attempting to find some reason to refuse to accept the Soviet proposals. Bidault acknowledged that the Soviet delegation was justified in seeking to prevent a German-Austrian Anschluss, but said that other clauses in the draft treaty could achieve this goal.
    Figl then spoke. He attempted to prove that it was not contradictory for the Austrian government to state on the one hand that Austria would not join any military alliance, and on the other hand to refuse to include this obligation in the text of the treaty.
    Eden then spoke. He attempted to cast doubt on whether the policy of re-militarizing West Germany and the plan to establish a "European Defense Community" would pose a real threat of a German-Austrian Anschluss. He finally said that the British delegation could not accept the Soviet proposals for Clauses 4(b) and 33 of the treaty.
    Molotov spoke again. He replied to Dulles that, in 1954 as in previous years, the responsibility for obstructing the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty did not lie with the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the main point of the Soviet proposal was very clear. The Soviet Union is vigilant about the plan to establish a "European Defense Community." In view of this, the Soviet government believes it is necessary to hope that the governments of France, Britain, and the United States will no longer insist on this treaty (referring to the Treaty of Paris) and will not ratify it. Doing so would be beneficial to the three countries themselves, to the Soviet Union, to Austria, to Europe, and to all peace-loving people in the world.
    Molotov refuted the assertion that there was no connection between the question of the Austrian State Treaty and the question of the German peace treaty, which Bidault had particularly emphasized. He said that Articles 3 and 4 of the Austrian State Treaty stipulated the prohibition of a German-Austrian Anschluss and that Germany should recognize Austria's independence, and Article 27 stipulated that Austria should cooperate with the four countries to prevent Germany from further expanding its armed forces beyond its territory. Molotov replied to Eden's assertion that there was a contradiction between the Soviet Union's opposition to the establishment of military bases on foreign territory and the Soviet proposal for the temporary stationing of foreign troops in Austria, saying that we believe that military bases on the territory of other countries disrupt international relations, undermine peace, and undermine the sovereignty of the countries where the bases are located. The Soviet proposals regarding Austria are completely different. The purpose of having some troops remain in Austria is to prevent new aggression from occurring and to prevent a German-Austrian Anschluss from happening.
    Molotov then proposed amending point five of the Soviet proposals, re-drafting it as follows:
    "5. Due to the delay in the conclusion of a German peace treaty, the governments of the four countries, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, have the right to temporarily postpone the withdrawal of their troops from their respective zones of occupation in Austria after the Austrian State Treaty comes into effect. At the same time, the four governments consider it necessary to re-examine the timeframe for the withdrawal of the four countries' troops from Austrian territory no later than 1955."
    Dulles then spoke. He merely asserted arbitrarily that the Soviet amendments did not add anything new to the Soviet proposals. Bidault and Eden also opposed the Soviet amendments.
    Figl said that the Austrian government could not agree to a treaty that stipulated that the timeframe for withdrawing troops should be studied.
    Molotov then said that the Soviet delegation was asking the Austrian delegation to study the proposals made by the Soviet Union at this meeting, or to propose its own amendments to these proposals. He said that the Soviet delegation was doing everything in its power to enable the Austrian State Treaty to be signed in Berlin within these few days. The Soviet delegation has put forward the most minimal proposals and is also prepared to study amendments to its own proposals. If these proposals are rejected, then the responsibility for the failure to conclude the Austrian State Treaty in the near future lies with those who reject the Soviet proposals.
    Then, Chairman Bidault said that no agreement had been reached on the third item on the agenda at today's meeting.
    At the end of the meeting, Molotov suggested that a closed meeting be held on the morning of the 17th to continue discussing the first item on the agenda, and that a regular meeting be held in the afternoon to continue discussing the second item on the agenda, and that the Austrian question be discussed further on the 18th, to which there was no objection.

    四国外长会议继续讨论关于对奥和约问题
    莫洛托夫主张继续讨论苏联建议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社十六日讯：四国外长会议十六日在前盟国管制委员会大厦举行会议，继续讨论第三项议程“关于对奥和约问题”，由皮杜尔任主席。
    大家知道，在二月十四日的会议上，奥地利政府代表团团长费格尔说，关于苏联代表团提出在和约中列入补充条款第四条乙款和对第三十三条进行修正的建议，他不能表明奥地利政府的态度，因为他没有得到他的政府的指示。
    在十六日的会议上，费格尔第一个发言。他说，他不能接受苏联的建议。奥地利政府授权他正式宣布，奥地利政府不能同意在此间已经达成协议的和约草案之外再作任何更改。费格尔在说明奥地利政府对于苏联所建议的防止德奥新的合并的措施的态度时说，奥地利政府“十分了解”一九三八年的德奥合并给奥地利和全欧洲带来的悲惨后果。他保证奥地利将不允许在它的领土上建立外国军事基地。
    艾登接着发言。他对奥地利政府对苏联建议的答复感到满意。他根本不谈苏联建议的实质，只表示希望苏联代表团撤销这些建议。
    在艾登发言后，莫洛托夫发言。莫洛托夫首先指出，在柏林会议上签订对奥和约是十分可能的。苏联建议对奥和约可以认为大体上已获协议，并建议讨论苏联代表团提出的对和约的两项修正。这无须重新草拟整个条约，因为在争执中的只有两个条款：第四条乙款和第三十三条。如果我们研究并得出大家都能接受的上述条款的措辞，条约的通过就不会再拖延下去了。
    莫洛托夫说：我们在这里听到杜勒斯也支持奥地利可以中立化、而且不应参加任何军事集团的看法。因此，苏联政府关于第四条乙款的建议和杜勒斯采取的立场是不矛盾的。另一方面，奥地利政府本身已经就这个问题发表重要声明说，奥地利不会参加军事集团。因此，苏联的建议显然是不违反奥地利政府的立场的。
    谈到费格尔所说奥地利不会允许外国在它的领土上建立军事基地时，莫洛托夫说：我们欢迎奥地利政府的这个声明，而且希望：正是因为这个原因，苏联提出的关于把规定禁止在奥地利领土上建立外国军事基地的第四条乙款列入条约的建议可以被人接受。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到苏联对第三十三条提出的修正。根据这一点，美英法苏四国政府在对奥和约生效后有权暂时延期撤回四国在奥地利的军队，直到对德和约缔结为止。莫洛托夫指出：这条修正是一个暂时的措施，因为，如苏联代表团所希望的，缔结对德和约所依赖的四个国家不会长期拖延这个任务的完成。
    莫洛托夫进一步指出，苏联政府提出对第三十三条的修正，是由于今天有人正在推行建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划。如果没有这个计划，如果没有复活德国军国主义的计划，没有德奥合并的威胁，苏联就不会提出这两项建议。莫洛托夫说，费格尔说根本没有德奥合并的危险，因为奥地利政府不希望这样。历史经验证明，像德奥合并一类的事件不是仅仅取决于奥地利的愿望的。我们必须预计到，急于想在西德复活德国军国主义并利用它来实现新的德奥合并计划的势力正日益猖獗。
    莫洛托夫接着说，苏联代表团并不拘泥于它所拟定的第三十三条的每个字。只要大家愿意协商，就可以设法使这一条的措辞确当，以使它符合保障和平的利益和符合奥地利本身的利益，同时确切地决定和限定暂时留在奥地利境内的外国军队的职权，使之完全符合奥地利国家的经济、文化和政治利益，并使奥地利暂时受到的这种限制减到最小的程度。莫洛托夫得出结论说，苏联的建议是符合奥地利的民族利益的。这个建议丝毫没有涉及到奥地利与其他国家之间的文化、经济与政治关系。它只在一个方面对奥地利有所限制，即外国军队暂时留驻在奥地利领土上和奥地利不得和其他国家缔结军事性质的协定。如果对局势作一个冷静的估计，奥地利政府就可以得到这一明确的、合理的结论。奥地利政府没有理由拒绝接受苏联政府针对别国政府的行动所提出来的适当建议。
    杜勒斯接着发言。他企图将对奥和约的拖延不能缔结的责任推卸在苏联政府身上。杜勒斯竭力想造成一种印象，仿佛在国际环境中并没有什么东西说明有必要采取措施来防止德奥合并。
    皮杜尔接着发言，他也企图找出某种理由来拒绝接受苏联的建议。皮杜尔承认苏联代表团力求防止德奥合并是有理由的，但他说，和约草案中别的条款就可达到这一目的。
    费格尔接着发言。他企图证明：奥地利政府一方面表示奥地利将不参加任何军事同盟，而另一方面又拒绝把这项义务列入和约本文，这是不矛盾的。
    艾登接着发言。他企图叫人怀疑使西德重新军国主义化的政策和建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划是否会产生德奥合并的实际威胁。他最后说，英国代表团不能接受苏联对和约第四条乙款和第三十三条的建议。
    莫洛托夫再次发言。他答复杜勒斯说，在一九五四年正如在往年一样，阻挠缔结对奥和约的责任不在苏联。他指出，苏联建议的主旨是很明显的。苏联警惕着建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划。鉴于这一点，苏联政府认为有必要希望法、英、美三国政府不再坚持这个条约（指巴黎条约），不要批准它。这样做就既有利于三国本身，也有利于苏联，有利于奥地利，有利于欧洲和全世界全体爱好和平的人民。
    莫洛托夫驳斥了认为对奥和约问题和对德和约问题之间毫无关系的说法，皮杜尔就是特别强调这一点的。他说，对奥和约第三条和第四条就规定禁止德奥合并和德国应承认奥地利的独立，第二十七条规定奥地利与四国合作，以防止德国再向领土之外扩张其武装力量。莫洛托夫答复艾登所谓苏联反对在外国领土上建立军事基地和苏联建议外国军队暂时留驻奥地利之间有矛盾的说法说，我们认为在别的国家领土上的军事基地扰乱了国际关系，破坏和平，破坏基地所在国的主权。至于苏联关于奥地利的建议完全是另外一回事。若干军队留在奥地利境内的目的是为了防止发生新的侵略和不让德奥合并发生。
    莫洛托夫接着对苏联的建议第五点提出修正，重新拟订如下：
    “五、由于缔结对德和约的拖延，美国、英国、法国和苏联四国政府有权在对奥和约生效后暂时延期从奥地利的各自占领区撤退其军队。同时，四国政府认为必须不迟于一九五五年的时候重新研究四国军队撤出奥地利领土的期限问题。”
    杜勒斯接着发言。他仅仅武断地说什么苏联的修正案并没有替苏联的建议增添什么新东西。皮杜尔和艾登也反对苏联的修正案。
    费格尔说，奥地利政府不能同意一个规定撤退军队的期限要研究的和约。
    莫洛托夫接着说，苏联代表团请奥地利代表团研究苏联在这次会上提出的建议，或对这些建议提出自己的修正。他说，苏联代表团在尽自己能力所及，使这几天内能在柏林签订对奥和约。苏联代表团提出了最起码的建议，并且还准备研究对自己的建议的修正。如果这种建议受到拒绝，那末对奥和约不能在最近期内缔结的责任就在那些拒绝苏联建议的人身上。
    接着，主席皮杜尔说，今天会上没有就第三项议程达成协议。
      会议结束时，莫洛托夫建议，在十七日上午举行秘密会议继续讨论第一项议程，下午再开例会继续讨论第二项议程，十八日继续讨论奥地利问题，大家没有异议。
