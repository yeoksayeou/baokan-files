    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 11th: Workers from enterprises in the German Democratic Republic and the democratic sector of Berlin held meetings to discuss the Soviet delegation's proposals at the Berlin Conference on the 10th regarding "Ensuring European Security" and the draft "All-European Treaty on Ensuring Collective Security in Europe." The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, and Deputy Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht, spoke at these workers' meetings respectively.

    Grotewohl delivered a speech at the meeting of the working people of the "October 7th Machine Factory" in Berlin. Grotewohl emphasized that only by abolishing the Bonn and Paris Treaties would it be possible to peacefully resolve the German question, and that resolving the German question is primarily a matter for the German people themselves. Grotewohl exposed the hypocritical face of the Western countries and Bonn in demanding so-called "free elections." He pointed out that the preconditions for genuinely free and democratic elections are: the Germans themselves reach an agreement, organize an all-German government, abandon West German remilitarization, and abolish the Bonn and Paris Treaties. Grotewohl concluded by pointing out that the German people are deeply concerned with the implementation of the proposals made by Molotov at the Berlin Conference and welcome the Soviet delegation's proposal to hold an all-German referendum to clarify whether the German people prefer the Bonn and Paris Treaties or a peace treaty.

    Ulbricht delivered a speech on the 10th at a meeting at the state-owned Siemens-Brania factory in Berlin. When discussing the preconditions for the peaceful reunification of Germany and genuinely free elections, Ulbricht pointed out that the Bonn and Paris Treaties must first be abolished, occupying forces withdrawn from Germany, and democratic freedoms established in West Germany. He said that the German people do not want to repeat Hitler-style elections that once led to war. If the German people take their destiny into their own hands, then Germany will embark on the path of peaceful and democratic development. Ulbricht welcomed the Soviet delegation's proposals on the 10th regarding "Ensuring European Security" and emphasized the significance of this proposal for easing international tensions and establishing peaceful cooperation in Europe. A resolution was passed at the meeting, stating that the workers of the Siemens-Brania factory support Molotov's proposals.

    格罗提渥和乌布利希向柏林工人发表演说
    拥护莫洛托夫外长关于德国问题的建议
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林十一日讯：德意志民主共和国和柏林民主区各企业的工人举行集会，讨论苏联代表团于十日在柏林会议上提出的“关于保障欧洲安全”的建议和“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案。德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥和副总理瓦尔特·乌布利希分别在这些工人集会上发言。
    格罗提渥在柏林“十·七机器制造厂”劳动人民的会议上发表了演说。格罗提渥着重指出，只有废除波恩和巴黎条约，才有可能和平解决德国问题，而解决德国问题首先是德国人民自己的事情。格罗提渥揭露了西方国家和波恩要求进行所谓“自由选举”的伪善面貌。他指出，真正自由民主选举的先决条件是：德国人自己达成协议，组织全德政府，放弃西德重新军国主义化以及废除波恩和巴黎条约。格罗提渥最后指出：德国人民深深关心实现莫洛托夫在柏林会议上提出的建议，并欢迎苏联代表团主张进行全德公民投票以弄清楚德国人民究竟喜欢波恩和巴黎条约还是喜欢和约这一建议。
    乌布利希十日在柏林国营西门子—勃拉尼亚工厂的会议上发表演说。乌布利希在谈到和平统一德国和进行真正自由选举的先决条件时指出，首先必须废除波恩和巴黎条约，从德国撤退占领军，并在西德确立民主自由。他说，德国人民不愿重复曾导致战争的希特勒式的选举。如果德国人民把自己的命运掌握在自己的手中，那么德国就会走上和平民主发展的道路。乌布利希欢迎苏联代表团十日提出的“关于保障欧洲安全”的建议，并着重指出这个建议对缓和国际紧张局势及在欧洲建立和平合作的意义。会上通过了一项决议，表示西门子—勃拉尼亚工厂的工人们拥护莫洛托夫的建议。
