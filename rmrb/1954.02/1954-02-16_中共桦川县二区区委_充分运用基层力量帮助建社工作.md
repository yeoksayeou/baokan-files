The Second District Committee of the CCP in Huachuan County
Fully Utilizes Grassroots Forces to Assist in the Establishment of Cooperatives

The Second District Committee of the CCP in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, pays attention to fully utilizing grassroots forces to lead the work of establishing cooperatives, overcoming the shortage of leadership, and enabling the work of establishing cooperatives to make normal progress.

The farmers in the second district of Huachuan, seeing the production achievements of the eleven old cooperatives in 1953 and receiving education on the general line last winter and this spring, have a high enthusiasm for organizing. There are thirty larger mutual aid groups in the district that are requesting to become cooperatives, and after review, twenty-three groups have already met the requirements. The characteristics of these new cooperatives are: a good foundation for mass organization, a relatively high level of ideological awareness, a relatively mature ideological preparation for establishing cooperatives, and a large number of core members in the cooperatives.

In the process of establishing new cooperatives, the more prominent problem is that the leadership of district and village cadres cannot keep up with the demands of the masses. Many cooperatives encounter specific problems that require the help of district and village cadres, but very few district and village cadres can actually help them. Because the District Committee did not pay enough attention to the work of training cadres to lead agricultural producers' cooperatives in 1953, only three District Committee members now understand the work of establishing cooperatives. Other district cadres, because they do not understand the business of establishing cooperatives, still avoid the work of establishing cooperatives. Many village cadres do not dare to lead because they do not understand it themselves. The deputy village chief of Longsheng Village replied to the masses who requested to establish a cooperative: "Although our group has been working for more than three years, I still do not have the experience of establishing a cooperative, so wait another year. If you really agree to do it, then figure it out yourselves." As a result, the members of two large groups discussed it themselves first, and then he was forced to come forward and lead. After village cadre Pan Yuejin of Daziying Village led the masses to establish a cooperative, he felt that he lacked experience and was afraid of causing trouble, so he held a meeting to mobilize the masses to disband, but the masses did not agree. The masses described the situation where the leadership of district and village cadres could not keep up with the demands of the masses as "the locomotive is banging loudly against the train cars."

In order to reverse this passive leadership situation, in addition to actively organizing district cadres to study the business of establishing cooperatives, the District Committee also pays attention to giving play to the strength of village cadres, old cooperative cadres, and cooperative members. Their methods are:

First, strengthen the leadership of the village branch. The District Committee believes that although the cooperative is currently being piloted at the district level, the village branch must play its leading role. The practice of some branch committee members who believe that the cooperative is being piloted by the district and do not ask about the work of establishing the cooperative is wrong. The District Committee emphasized that village branch committees and party members must seriously study and explore the experience of establishing cooperatives, and the District Committee clearly stipulates that the responsibility of the village branch is: at the beginning of the establishment of the cooperative, the village branch should first study whether the conditions are met, and then study with the District Committee. For those with slightly poorer conditions, the village branch should study how to provide assistance and create conditions for establishing a cooperative. Branch party members should also clearly divide their work and conduct specific leadership for each cooperative. The Party branch should study the situation in the cooperative to ensure that the cooperative is well-led. After clearly explaining the tasks of the village branch, the village branches have paid attention to the work of establishing cooperatives.

Second, according to the needs and living conditions of the twenty-three new cooperatives, they are divided into seven mutual aid points, and experienced cadres from the old cooperatives are sent to the new cooperatives to introduce experience, solve difficult problems, and assist the District Committee in the work of establishing cooperatives. According to recent statistics, the eleven old cooperative cadres have made twenty-two reports to the new cooperatives, and the core members of the new cooperatives have made more than twenty special visits to the old cooperatives, so that specific issues such as investment have been basically resolved. After inspection by the District Committee, the specific problems that the core members of the new cooperatives have solved after the visit are correct, and the masses are also satisfied. Tang Fengming, the director of a new cooperative, said: "Comrade Gao Wenxue (director of the old cooperative) reported to our village, and our cooperative members especially like to listen. Every sentence he said is what we have thought about but have not figured out." "The investment methods he introduced, combined with the principles learned in the county, do not confuse me when dealing with problems."

Third, widely give play to the propaganda role of ordinary old cooperative members, and use winter training and other opportunities to spread the experience of establishing cooperatives anytime and anywhere, and introduce their own experiences of joining the cooperative, in order to resolve the ideological concerns of new cooperative members and the general public. For example, the winter training class for militiamen in Daziying Village has people from various villages and cooperatives, and these people exchanged experience in establishing cooperatives in the winter training class. Some people raised questions such as how to bear the cost of fodder for small foals, and Su Wenhai and other old cooperative members in the militia gave satisfactory answers based on their own cooperative's handling of these issues in 1953. The militiamen are proud to introduce their own experiences, not only talking about experience, but also introducing their own ideological concerns and transformation process when they joined the cooperative, helping to enlighten others. In addition, the District Committee also mobilized the masses to pay attention to spreading the experience of establishing cooperatives during the Spring Festival, using various literary and artistic activities and visiting relatives and friends, which also played a role in the ideological preparation for establishing cooperatives.

The District Committee particularly emphasized preparing for production while establishing cooperatives. Among the newly established cooperatives, fourteen cooperatives have already formulated production increase plans and invested in production. Other cooperatives can also complete all the work of establishing cooperatives in February and invest in production. (Li Xuezhong)

### 中共桦川县二区区委  充分运用基层力量帮助建社工作

    中共桦川县二区区委
    充分运用基层力量帮助建社工作
    中共松江省桦川县二区区委注意充分运用基层力量，领导建社工作，克服了领导力量不足的现象，使建社工作获得正常的进展。
    桦川二区的农民，因为看到了一九五三年十一个老社的生产成绩，又在去冬今春受到了总路线的教育，要求组织起来的热情很高。全区要求转社的有三十个较大的互助组，经审查有二十三个组已经具备了条件。这些新社的特点是：群众组织基础好，思想觉悟较高，建社的思想酝酿也比较成熟，社里的骨干分子也较多。
    在新社建立的过程中，比较突出的问题，就是区、村干部的领导赶不上群众的要求。许多社碰到了具体问题，就需要区、村干部帮助，但是区、村干部能够确实帮助他们的却很少。区委由于在一九五三年对培养领导农业生产合作社干部的工作注意不够，现在只有三个区委懂得建社工作。其他区干部因为不懂建社业务，对建社工作仍是躲着走。村干部有不少人因为自己不懂，也不敢领导。隆胜村副村长回答要求办社的群众说：“咱们组虽然搞了三年多，可是我还没有办社的经验，再等一年吧。你们实在同意搞，就自己去核计吧。”结果两个大型组的组员自己先商量好了，他才被迫出头领导。达子营村干部潘月金领导群众建立社后，感到自己缺乏经验，怕惹麻烦，又开会动员群众散伙，但是群众都不同意。群众形容区、村干部领导赶不上群众要求的情况说：“火车头叫火车皮冲得噹噹乱响。”
    为了扭转这种领导被动的局面，区委除了积极组织区干部学习办社业务外，并注意发挥村干部、老社干部及社员的力量。他们的办法是：
    第一、加强村支部的领导。区委认为，目前合作社虽是区级试办，但村支部必须发挥它的领导作用。有的支部委员认为社是区里试办，对建社工作不加过问的作法是错误的。区委强调指出，村支委和党员都必须认真学习和摸索办社的经验，区委并明确规定村支部的责任是：在建社开始时，村支部应该首先研究是否够条件，然后再和区委一同研究。对条件稍差的，村支部应研究如何进行帮助，创造办社条件。支部党员并应明确分工，对各社进行具体领导。党支部应该研究社里的情况，保证把社领导好。这样明确讲清楚村支部的任务后，村支部都对建社工作注意起来了。
    第二、按二十三个新社的需要和居住情况，划成七个互助点，由老社有经验的干部到新社介绍经验，解决疑难问题，帮助区委进行建社工作。据最近统计，十一个老社干部到新社先后已做二十二次报告，新社骨干分子到老社进行专题访问的有二十多次，使投资等的具体问题基本得到解决。经区委检查，新社骨干分子经过访问后，回社解决了的具体问题，都是正确的，群众也都满意。一个新社的主任唐风明说：“高文学（老社主任）同志到我屯报告，我们社员特别爱听，说的句句是我们心里想而没有想通的事。”“他介绍的投资办法，加上在县里学的原则，两下一结合，处理问题时就不发矇了。”
    第三、广泛发挥一般老社员的宣传作用，利用冬训和其他的机会，随时随地传播建社经验，介绍自己参加社的经过，以解决新社员和一般群众存在的思想顾虑。如达子营民兵冬训班里就有各村各社的人，这些人在冬训班里就交换建社的经验。有的人提出小马崽如何负担草料等的问题，民兵里的老社员粟文海等，就按他们自己社一九五三年处理这些问题的经过作了完满的解答。民兵们都以介绍自己的经验为荣，不但谈经验，还介绍他们自己入社时的思想顾虑及转变过程，帮助启发其他的人。此外，区委并发动群众，注意在春节期间，利用各种文艺活动和亲友串门的机会，传播建社的经验，对建社的思想酝酿工作也起了作用。
    区委特别强调一边建社，一边进行生产准备。现在新建成的社中，已经有十四个社订出增产计划，投入生产。其他各社也可在二月里完成全部建社工作，投入生产。　（李学忠）
