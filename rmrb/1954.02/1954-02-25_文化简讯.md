    Hunan Province Establishes Forestry Technical School
    To meet the needs of Hunan Province's growing forestry industry, the Forestry Technical School, sponsored by the Hunan Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry, was established in Changsha on February 18th. This school was formed by merging the forestry departments of the original five agricultural schools in Changsha, Jinshi, Anjiang, Lingling, and Chenxian. This term has more than 440 students. In order to provide for teaching practice needs, a nursery and a forest botanical specimen garden have also been established.
    Southern and western Hunan are famous forest areas in southern China. Last year, more than 920 million trees of various types were planted, covering an area of more than 1.5 million mu. Over the past three years, a large number of high-quality timbers have been harvested here from the timber supporting national industrial construction from all over the country. From last October to the end of January this year, one million cubic meters of timber were harvested.
