Xinhua News Agency, February 7th: The People's Liberation Army (PLA) units and organizations stationed in Beijing are extensively carrying out activities to support the government and cherish the people during the Spring Festival.

Prior to the Spring Festival, all units universally conducted education on supporting the government and cherishing the people, inspected the state of mass discipline and the implementation of government policies and regulations, and expressed their gratitude and respect to the local people's governments and the people by holding joint military-civilian symposiums with the local people. Units directly under the Central People's Government's People's Revolutionary Military Commission inspected their compliance with mass discipline over the four years since entering the city and separately invited representatives of local residents to hold symposiums to solicit their opinions on the troops. Public Security Forces stationed in Beijing organized mass discipline inspection teams to go deep into the local residents to solicit opinions. People's Navy units and organizations stationed in Beijing held symposiums with representatives from local people's governments and people's organizations. Units directly under the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a symposium on January 29 with the responsible persons of the local people's government, people's organizations, and other fourteen units to humbly solicit their opinions.

During the Spring Festival, PLA units stationed in Beijing extensively organized joint military-civilian festivities and publicized the general line of the state during the transition period to local residents. The Political Department directly under the Military Commission plans to organize three film evenings and three joint celebration meetings over six days from February 6th to 11th to comfort the families of martyrs, military dependents, and citizens in the local area. The Political Department of the Public Security Forces held a Spring Festival gathering to support the government and cherish the people in the Dongsi District of Beijing on February 5th. At the meeting, the representative of the Political Department of the Public Security Forces, on behalf of the troops stationed in Dongsi District, presented the Dongsi District People's Government with a silk banner inscribed with "Party, government, army, and people unite as one, and strive to realize the general line." A certain unit of the People's Air Force stationed in Beijing sent seventy representatives, who beat drums and gongs on the morning of February 3 to congratulate the local people's government and the people on the Spring Festival. A certain unit of the North China Military Region also performed "Luo Shengjiao" for the people in the Haidian District.
