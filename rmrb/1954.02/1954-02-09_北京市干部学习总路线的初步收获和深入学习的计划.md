The Theoretical Education Section of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

    Approximately 70,000 on-the-job cadres from Beijing's government agencies, factories, and enterprises began studying the Party's general line for the transition period in late October of last year. After late November, they carried out a more systematic study by unit. To guide this study, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized eight reports. The Party committees at all levels conveyed and organized discussions conscientiously. The responsible comrades of the Party committees and administrations of various units also attached great importance to this study. At the beginning of the study, they generally gave mobilization reports to the cadres. Some department heads gave reports based on the work of their departments and the cadres' ideological situations. At the same time, to help everyone understand the actual situation of China's economic construction, many units also organized visits to factories, agricultural producers' cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and joint state-private enterprises, and screened films, and invited labor models, cooperative chairmen, and factory directors to give reports. Therefore, everyone's enthusiasm for learning was high, and they could generally adhere to the learning system. Many cadres also made personal study plans and took serious study notes.
    Through this period of study, cadres have initially understood the basic content of the general line, clarified the goal and specific path of China's gradual transition to socialism, and corrected the mistaken views that "the socialist society is far away" or "socialism will be suddenly declared one day." As a result, many cadres have further clarified the basic direction of their work and improved their enthusiasm for work and study. Many cadres in industrial and mining enterprises used to know that developing production was to improve the people's livelihood, but now they realize that this is to build a socialist society. Some factory cadres, after realizing the great significance of tapping the potential of existing factories and mines for national industrialization, initially criticized the erroneous idea of "willing to build new factories, unwilling to build old factories, willing to build large factories, unwilling to build small factories." Some engineering and technical personnel have also clarified their role in socialist industrialization, further improved their enthusiasm for learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and actively helped workers learn technology in their actual work. Some cadres who do financial work in factories have corrected the view that "financial work is simply bookkeeping" and are determined to learn economic accounting and strive to run socialist enterprises well. Some cadres in trade and cooperative departments, after realizing the relationship between their work and the general line, criticized the idea of underestimating state-owned commercial work or the erroneous view that cooperative work has no future. Some cadres who do taxation and banking work have clarified the role of their work in national industrialization and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, changed their work attitude, and greatly improved their enthusiasm for work. Many medical workers realize that strengthening learning, earnestly doing treatment and nursing work, and helping patients recover as soon as possible is serving the general line, thereby strengthening their sense of responsibility in their work. Some have examined their conservative thinking and expressed their willingness to teach technology to others and train health personnel for the country. Many cadres clarified the relationship between the general line and their work, criticized the individualistic idea of emphasizing personal interests and not being at ease with their current work, and actively improved their work. Those who were not active in learning in the past also seriously participated in learning.
    Although the past period of study has yielded many gains, it is not systematic and in-depth enough. First, there is a lack of a complete study outline, resulting in more learning from more materials and less learning from fewer materials. The main part of the general line—the country's socialist industrialization—has not been adequately studied in general due to the lack of complete study materials. Second, the work of combining learning with various tasks is not done enough. Some units have begun to check and study problems in their work and policy implementation in the spirit of the general line, but most units have not done so, or have only touched on some work problems piecemeal and scattered, without conducting them in a guided and systematic way. Third, the criticism of "left" and right-leaning ideas that violate the general line, especially the criticism of bourgeois ideology, is not done enough.
    In order to further promote the study of the Party's general line for the transition period by on-the-job cadres in the city, improve the socialist consciousness of cadres, and consciously strive to build our country into a great socialist country, the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has formulated a plan for further studying the general line and convened a city-wide theoretical education work conference. The cadres who attended the meeting first studied the study outline of the Party's general line for the transition period and studied the plan for further studying the general line.
    The meeting decided that cadres throughout the city should spend another three months to further study the general line and stipulated the specific methods for further studying the general line:
    First, all cadres are required to comprehensively and systematically study the basic content of the general line and grasp its spirit and essence. High- and middle-level cadres should carefully read the study outline of the general line section by section, and some higher-level cadres should read relevant works by Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Elementary-level cadres are given a popular explanation of each section of the outline by theoretical instructors. Where possible, visits or film screenings may be appropriately used to increase cadres' perceptual knowledge of economic construction.
    Secondly, regarding connecting with various practical tasks, the Beijing Municipal Committee, referring to the experience of the senior group in the Northwest region, decided that members of the Municipal Committee, comrades participating in the core group of the senior group, and some senior cadres should systematically analyze and study the policies of various tasks in the city under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory and the spirit of the general line, and write special papers. General senior group comrades either write special papers, or participate in the study and discussion of these papers, or make special speeches at discussion meetings. Each unit's senior group should have at least one person give a report to the cadres of the unit on the general line in connection with the work of the unit and the thinking of the cadres. Middle- and elementary-level cadres mainly conduct discussions based on these reports. Each unit should combine this study of the general line with summarizing the work of 1953 and formulating the work plan for 1954, and concretely implement the general line into the work of the department.
    Thirdly, cadres are required to further draw a clear line between the ideology of the working class and the ideology of the bourgeoisie in this study, and criticize erroneous ideas such as "left" or right-leaning that violate the general line, so as to improve the socialist consciousness of cadres. In the process of learning, we must first criticize various arguments that violate the general line and correctly understand the general line. Secondly, we must earnestly criticize various erroneous ideas reflected in the implementation of policies, such as: conservative ideas and tendencies of blind advancement in industrial construction and other construction undertakings; right-leaning or "left"-leaning ideas in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, as well as departmentalism, local views, tendencies of not asking about politics, and decentralization of leadership in work. It is necessary to criticize bourgeois individualism and promote a work style of loving work and hard work. The criticism of bourgeois individualism is generally carried out on the basis of cadres improving their socialist consciousness, by means of seminars on learning gains or by organizing discussions based on reports from leading cadres.
    In order to strengthen ideological leadership over this study, strengthen supervision and leadership over the senior groups, and pay attention to giving play to their guiding role in the learning of middle and elementary groups, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Committee decided to hold special reports on the general line and popular explanations; strengthen the work of the Municipal Committee Propaganda Department's study room so that it can play a greater role in providing learning materials and teaching guidance; and open a special column for cadre theoretical studies in the Beijing Daily to report on learning dynamics and introduce learning experiences. Party committees at all levels should go deep into key points, conduct systematic investigations and studies on the ideological situation of cadres, so as to assist administrative heads in doing a good job in learning guidance that connects with the reality of work and thinking; organize the learning of propagandists, theoretical teachers, and tutors, and strengthen guidance to the discussion meetings of middle-level groups and the lectures of theoretical teachers of elementary groups; and conduct a study test on the general line and make a study summary at the end of the study.

    北京市干部学习总路线的初步收获和深入学习的计划
    中共北京市委宣传部理论教育处
    北京市机关、工厂、企业的在职干部约七万余人，于去年十月下旬开始学习党在过渡时期的总路线，十一月下旬以后又分单元进行了较系统的学习。为了指导这一学习，中共北京市委宣传部先后组织了八次报告，各级党委都认真地作了传达和组织了讨论。各单位的党委和行政的负责同志对这一学习亦很重视，学习开始时一般都向干部作了动员报告，有些部门的负责同志更结合本部门的工作和干部思想情况作了报告。同时为了帮助大家了解我国经济建设的实际情况，许多单位还组织了参观工厂、农业生产合作社、手工业合作社、公私合营工厂，并放映电影，请劳动模范、合作社社长、工厂厂长等作报告。因此，大家的学习情绪很高，一般都能坚持学习制度，许多干部还订了个人学习计划，认真记学习笔记。
    经过这一时期的学习，干部已初步认识了总路线的基本内容，明确了我国逐步过渡到社会主义去的目标和具体道路，纠正了那种认为“社会主义社会遥遥无期”或“突然一天就宣布实行社会主义”的错误看法。因而许多干部进一步明确了自己工作的基本方向，提高了工作和学习的积极性。在工矿企业中的许多干部，过去只知道发展生产是为了改善人民生活，现在认识到这就是在建设社会主义社会。有些工厂干部认识到发挥现有厂矿的潜在力量对国家工业化的重大意义以后，初步批判了“愿搞新厂、不愿搞旧厂，愿搞大工厂、不愿搞小工厂”的错误思想。一些工程技术人员也明确了自己在社会主义工业化中的作用，进一步提高了学习苏联先进经验的积极性，并在实际工作中积极帮助工人学习技术。有些工厂作财务工作的干部纠正了“财务工作就是单纯的管账”的看法，决心学好经济核算，为办好社会主义企业而努力。有些贸易合作部门的干部认识到自己的工作和总路线的关系后，批判了轻视国营商业工作的思想或认为合作社工作没前途的错误看法。有些作税务工作和银行工作的干部明确了自己工作对国家工业化和对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的作用，改变了自己的工作态度，工作的积极性大为提高。不少医务工作者认识到加强学习，认真作好治疗和护理工作，使病人早日恢复健康就是为总路线服务，从而加强了工作的责任心，有的检查了自己的保守思想，表示愿意把技术教给别人，为国家培养卫生人才。许多干部明确了总路线和自己工作的关系，批判了强调个人兴趣不安心现有工作的个人主义想法，积极地改进工作，过去学习不积极的也认真地参加了学习。
    过去一个时期的学习虽然有了不少的收获，但是还不够系统和深入。第一，缺乏一个完整的学习提纲，以致材料多的多学，材料少的少学。总路线的主要部分——国家的社会主义工业化也由于缺乏完整的学习材料，一般学得不够。第二，联系各项工作进行学习作得不够。有些单位已开始根据总路线的精神，检查、研究工作中和在执行政策上的问题，但是多数单位还没有这样作，或者还只是零碎地、分散地接触到一些工作中的问题，而没有有领导有系统地进行。第三，批判违背总路线的“左”、右倾思想，特别是批判资产阶级思想作得不够。
    为了使全市在职干部进一步学好党在过渡时期的总路线，提高干部的社会主义觉悟，自觉地为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，中共北京市委宣传部制订了进一步学习总路线的计划，并召开了全市理论教育工作会议。参加会议的干部首先学习了党在过渡时期总路线的学习提纲，并研究了进一步学习总路线的计划。
    会议决定全市干部再用三个月的时间，进一步学习总路线，并规定了进一步学习总路线的具体办法：
    首先，要求全体干部全面而系统地钻研总路线的基本内容，掌握其精神与实质。高、中级组干部要逐节逐段地精读总路线的学习提纲，其中一些水平较高的干部应阅读若干列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的有关著作。初级组干部由理论教员按照提纲进行逐节逐段的通俗讲解。在可能条件下，可适当采用参观或放映电影等方式，以增加干部对经济建设的感性知识。
    其次，在联系各项实际工作方面，中共北京市委参照西北区高级组学习的经验，决定市委委员、参加高级组核心组的同志和一部分高级组干部在马克思列宁主义理论和总路线精神的指导下，对本市各项工作的方针、政策进行有系统的分析研究，写成专题论文。一般高级组同志或者写专题论文，或者参加对这些论文的研究和讨论，或在讨论会上作专题发言。各单位高级组至少应有一人向本单位干部作一次关于总路线联系本单位工作和干部思想的报告。中、初级组干部主要是根据这些报告进行讨论。各单位应将这次总路线的学习和总结一九五三年工作与制订一九五四年工作计划结合起来，将总路线具体地贯彻到本部门工作中去。
    再次，要求干部在这次学习中，进一步划清工人阶级思想和资产阶级思想的界限，批判违反总路线的“左”倾或右倾等错误思想，以提高干部的社会主义觉悟。在学习过程中，首先要批判各种违反总路线的论点，正确地理解总路线。其次要认真批判在执行政策上反映出来的各种错误思想，例如：在工业建设和其他建设事业中的保守思想和盲目冒进的倾向；在对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业的社会主义改造方面的右倾或“左”倾思想，以及在工作中的本位主义、局部观点、不问政治的倾向和领导上的分散主义。要批判资产阶级个人主义思想，发扬热爱工作和艰苦奋斗的工作作风。对资产阶级个人主义思想的批判一般是在干部提高自己的社会主义觉悟的基础上，采取座谈学习收获或根据领导干部的报告组织讨论的方式进行。
    为了加强对这一学习的思想领导，加强对高级组的监督和领导，注意发挥他们对中、初级组学习的指导作用，市委宣传部决定举办关于总路线的专题报告和通俗讲解的报告；加强市委宣传部学习室的工作，使其在供给学习资料和教学辅导方面发挥更大的作用；并在北京日报辟干部理论学习专栏，报道学习动态，介绍学习心得。各级党委要深入重点，对干部的思想情况进行系统的调查研究，以协助行政负责同志作好联系工作实际和思想实际的学习指导；组织传授员、理论教员、辅导员的学习，加强对中级组讨论会和初级组理论教员讲课的指导；在学习结束时举行总路线的学习测验并作学习总结。
