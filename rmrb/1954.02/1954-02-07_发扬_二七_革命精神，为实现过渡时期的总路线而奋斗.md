    Carry Forward the "February 7th" Revolutionary Spirit and Strive to Realize the General Line of the Transition Period
    February 7th, 1923, was the day when the Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, launched its first political struggle against the imperialist lackey warlords. Today is the 31st anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident. The Chinese working class, united with the people of the whole country, after nearly 30 years of arduous and tortuous struggle, finally overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. On October 1, 1949, they established the People's Republic of China, led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, victoriously ending the first stage of the Chinese revolution—the stage of New Democratic Revolution . Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have entered the second stage of Chinese revolution—the stage of carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation.
    To realize socialism in China, eliminate classes, eliminate the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man, and build our country into a great socialist country, is the ideal that the Chinese working class has long yearned to achieve. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the specific path to realize socialism under the specific historical conditions of China, and this path is the general line of our country during the transition period. In the struggle to realize the general line of the transition period in our country, the working class, as the leading class of China, bears a particularly important responsibility. It will, like in the past in the struggle for people's democratic revolution, carry forward the "February 7th" revolutionary spirit, under the leadership of its own party—the Chinese Communist Party, with its heroic labor and revolutionary consciousness, with its organization, discipline, and the exemplary role of hard work and self-sacrifice, to lead and unite the people of the whole country to advance.
    First of all, the working class must strengthen its own class organization—the trade union, and make it unconditionally obey and accept the leadership of its vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party, so as to become a strong social pillar to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. The organization of the Chinese working class—the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, already has more than ten million members. With the rapid development of our country's industry, the ranks of the working class and trade union organizations will continue to grow; however, without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which is armed with Marxism-Leninism and represents the interests of the Chinese working class and the entire working people, the great cause of the working class cannot advance, and the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce cannot be realized. At the same time, our socialist construction and socialist transformation are being carried out under the circumstances that imperialists and their running dogs are trying to use all opportunities to carry out sabotage. Therefore, the working class must, under the leadership of the Party, continue to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, continue to strengthen the national defense forces and security forces, and must raise revolutionary vigilance to prevent the sabotage of imperialism and its running dogs, in order to defend the security of the motherland and ensure the smooth progress of national construction.
    Secondly, the working class must further consolidate the alliance with the peasants. The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our people's democratic dictatorship. In the past, we relied on it to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. In the future, it will still be the basic force for building socialism and completing socialist transformation. Therefore, the Chinese working class must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, continue to strengthen the work of the worker-peasant alliance. This work is not only reflected in the policies of the Party and the government, but should also be reflected in the strengthening of the daily contact between workers and peasants. Recently, various places have used the Spring Festival period to launch extensive worker-peasant get-together activities. Many peasants have visited factories and mines, and many workers have also gone to the countryside to express their regards to the peasants. Some have communicated with each other, held symposiums, etc. Through these activities, the friendship between each other has been greatly enhanced, some past estrangements and misunderstandings have been eliminated, and the ideological awareness of the worker-peasant alliance has also been improved a step further. Doing so is completely necessary. In the past, the worker-peasant relations in some places were abnormal because the education of the worker-peasant alliance was not regularly carried out for workers and peasants, and various ways were not used to strengthen the daily contact and mutual understanding between workers and peasants. The facts of the Spring Festival worker-peasant get-together activities in various places prove that as long as we pay attention to and effectively strengthen this aspect of work, the worker-peasant relations will become closer and become a huge driving force for promoting the progress of national construction. Now our task is: we must, on this basis, regularize the work of strengthening the daily contact between workers and peasants, institutionalize some good methods created in this worker-peasant get-together activity, and earnestly take the worker-peasant alliance education as a regular and main content of the political and ideological education of employees, and regularly maintain the close unity between employees and the nearby peasant masses, and regularly maintain the relationship of mutual respect, trust and support between workers and peasants.
    Third, the working class must vigorously carry out labor emulation. Emulation is a concrete manifestation of the initiative of the working class in production and construction after becoming the masters of the state and society. It is a reliable guarantee for improving labor productivity, developing production, practicing thrift, accumulating construction funds for the state, and realizing the country's socialist industrialization, and it is a basic method of socialist construction. Stalin said: "In fact, competition is a communist method of building socialism on the basis of the high initiative of millions of working masses. In fact, competition is the lever by which the working class will turn the entire economic and cultural life of the country upside down on a socialist basis." ("Mass Competition and Upsurge of Labor Enthusiasm") During the period of industrial recovery in our country, the labor emulation launched by the working class greatly promoted production. In the first year of our country's Five-Year Construction Plan, the labor emulation launched by the working class also played a great role in completing and overfulfilling the state's plan. We must regularize labor emulation to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state's construction plan every year, every quarter, every month, every week, and every day.
    Fourth, it is necessary to strive to learn from the advanced experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union to improve the cultural and technical level of the working class. If we cannot quickly improve the cultural and technical level of our own working class and learn to master modern technology, then the construction plan of the 141 enterprise projects that the Soviet Union is helping our country to build and expand cannot be built on schedule or ahead of schedule, and the quality of the projects cannot be guaranteed. Even if they are built, their role cannot be fully played. Stalin said: "Despite the fact that you have first-class technology, first-class factories, if you do not have some talents who can control this technology, then your technology will always be just technology. In order for new technology to be effective, there must also be cadres of male and female workers who can command and promote this technology." ("Speech at the First All-Soviet Stakhanovite Workers' Conference") The lack of such "talents who can control this technology" pointed out by Comrade Stalin has become one of the major reasons for the many accidents, low quality, and high costs that have occurred in many of our factories and mines. If we do not solve the problem of the shortage of technical cadres and technical workers with a revolutionary spirit, the more new enterprises are built and expanded, the more serious the lack of technology will become. The most effective and reliable way to learn to master technology is to sincerely learn from the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. This has been fully proven in the experience of the China Changchun Railway, Anshan Iron and Steel, and other factories and mines.
    In order for the Chinese working class to be able to shoulder the above-mentioned major responsibilities in the struggle to realize the general line of the transition period, it must earnestly study the general line to improve its socialist awareness. Chairman Mao taught us: "No matter what you do, if you do not understand the situation of that matter, its nature, its relationship with things outside of it, you will not know the law of that matter, you will not know how to do it, you cannot do that matter well." ("Strategic Issues of China's Revolutionary War") Doing anything requires this, then, doing such a earth-shattering thing as realizing the general line and building socialism requires this even more. Only when we thoroughly understand the general line of the transition period, understand the great significance and role of the various tasks that the working class should shoulder in realizing socialism, can we be more encouraged with courage and confidence, carry forward the "February 7th" revolutionary spirit, spare no effort to endure any hardships, overcome all difficulties, and concentrate all our strength to complete these tasks. At the same time, only by understanding these can we further improve our class consciousness, can we correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism within the class, constantly prevent and overcome the influence of bourgeois ideology on the ranks of the working class, so that in the process of implementing the general line, we can victoriously shoulder the major responsibility of the leading class.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, and with the great selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Chinese working class inherited and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "February 7th" and victoriously completed the historical task of the first stage of the Chinese revolution. In the future, we must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, learn more modestly from the Soviet Union, better unite the people of the whole country, and in today's new situation and new tasks, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "February 7th" and strive to complete the historical task of the second stage of the Chinese revolution and build China into a great socialist country.

### 发扬“二七”革命精神，为实现过渡时期的总路线而奋斗

    发扬“二七”革命精神，为实现过渡时期的总路线而奋斗
    一九二三年二月七日，是中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下第一次展开反对帝国主义走狗军阀的政治斗争的日子，今天是“二七”的三十一周年纪念日。中国工人阶级团结全国人民经过了将近三十年的艰苦、曲折的斗争道路，终于推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，在一九四九年十月一日，建立了以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的中华人民共和国，胜利地结束了中国革命的第一个阶段——新民主主义革命阶段。自从中华人民共和国成立起，我们即进入了中国革命的第二个阶段——进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的阶段。
    在中国实现社会主义，消灭阶级，消灭人剥削人的现象，把我们的国家建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，这是中国工人阶级早就渴望着实现的理想。毛泽东同志指出了在中国具体的历史条件下如何实现社会主义的具体道路，这条道路就是我国过渡时期的总路线。在实现我国过渡时期的总路线的斗争中，作为中国领导阶级的工人阶级负有特别重大的责任。它将要像过去在人民民主革命斗争中一样，发扬“二七”革命精神，在自己的政党——中国共产党的领导下，以自己的英勇劳动和革命觉悟，以自己的组织性、纪律性和艰苦奋斗、自我牺牲的模范作用，来领导和团结全国人民前进。
    首先，工人阶级必须加强自己的阶级组织——工会，并使之无条件地服从和接受自己的先锋队——中国共产党的领导，成为巩固人民民主专政的坚强的社会支柱。我国工人阶级的组织——中国工会已经拥有一千多万会员，随着我国工业的迅速发展，工人阶级的队伍和工会组织还要不断壮大；但是，如果没有以马克思列宁主义武装起来的、代表中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民利益的中国共产党的领导，工人阶级的伟大事业就不能前进，国家的社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业以及资本主义工商业的社会主义改造就不可能实现。同时，我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，是在帝国主义者及其走狗企图利用一切机会来进行破坏的情况下进行的，因此，工人阶级必须在党的领导下继续巩固人民民主专政，继续加强国防力量和保安力量，并须提高革命警惕性，防止帝国主义及其走狗的破坏，以保卫祖国的安全和保障国家建设的顺利进行。
    其次，工人阶级必须进一步巩固和农民的联盟。工农联盟是我国人民民主专政的基础，过去我们依靠着它，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，在今后它仍然是建设社会主义和完成社会主义改造的基本力量。因此，中国工人阶级必须在中国共产党的领导下，继续加强工农联盟的工作。这个工作不但是表现在党和政府的政策上面，也应表现在工人和农民日常联系的加强上面。最近，各地都利用春节期间，展开了广泛的工农联欢活动，许多农民去参观了工厂和矿山，许多工人也到农村去慰问农民，有的则相互通讯、举行座谈会等等，通过这些活动，使得相互之间的友谊大大增进了，过去的某些隔阂和误解消除了，工农联盟的思想觉悟也提高了一步，这样做是完全必要的。过去某些地方工农关系不正常，就是因为没有经常地对工人和农民进行工农联盟的教育，没有运用各种方式加强工农的日常联系和相互了解。各地春节工农联欢活动的事实证明：只要我们注意并切实加强这方面的工作，工农关系就会更加密切起来，并成为推动国家建设事业前进的巨大动力。现在我们的任务是：必须在这一基础上，把加强工农日常联系的工作经常化起来，把此次工农联欢活动中所创造出来的一些良好方法成为制度，把工农联盟教育切实作为职工政治思想教育中的经常的和主要的内容之一，经常保持职工和附近农民群众之间的亲密团结，经常保持工农之间相互尊重、信任和支持的关系。
    第三，工人阶级要大力开展劳动竞赛。竞赛是工人阶级当了国家社会的主人之后，在生产建设上主动性的具体表现。它是提高劳动生产率、发展生产、厉行节约、为国家积累建设资金、实现国家的社会主义工业化的可靠保证，是社会主义建设的基本方法。斯大林说：“实际上竞赛是在千百万劳动群众高度积极性的基础上建设社会主义的共产主义方法。实际上竞赛是这样的杠杆，借助于它，工人阶级要在社会主义基础上把国内整个经济生活和文化生活翻转过来。”（“群众的竞赛和劳动热情的高涨”）在我国工业的恢复时期，工人阶级展开的劳动竞赛对于生产起了很大的推动作用。在我国进入五年建设计划第一年中，工人阶级展开的劳动竞赛对完成和超额完成国家的计划也起了很大的作用。我们必须使劳动竞赛经常化，以保证每一年、每一季、每一月、每一周和每一日的国家建设计划的完成和超额完成。
    第四，就是要努力学习苏联的先进经验和先进的科学技术，以提高工人阶级的文化和技术水平。如果我们不能迅速地提高我们工人阶级自己的文化技术水平，学会掌握现代化的技术，则苏联帮助我国新建、扩建的一百四十一个项目的企业工程建设计划，就不能按期或先期建设起来，并保证工程的质量。即使建设起来，也不能充分地发挥它们的作用。斯大林说：“尽管你有头等技术，头等工厂，但如果你没有一些能够驾驭这技术的人材，那末你的这些技术也始终不过是一些技术而已。为使新技术能够发生效果，就一定还要有能够指挥和推进这种技术的人材，男工女工的干部。”（“在第一次全苏联斯达汉诺夫式工作者会议上的演说”）斯大林同志所指出的这种“能够驾驭这技术的人材”的缺乏问题，已成为当前我们许多厂矿中发生的事故多、质量低、成本高的重大原因之一。如果我们不以革命的精神，解决技术干部和技术工人缺乏的问题，则新建和扩建的新式的企业愈多，技术的缺乏就会越显得厉害。学会掌握技术的最有效最可靠的办法，就是诚心诚意地向苏联学习，贯彻苏联专家的建议。这在中国长春铁路、鞍钢及其他各个厂矿的经验中已完全证明了。
    中国工人阶级要使自己在实现过渡时期总路线的斗争中，能够担负起上述的重大责任，就必须认真地学习总路线，以提高自己的社会主义觉悟程度。毛主席教导我们说：“不论做什么事，不懂得那件事的情形，它的性质，它和它以外的事情的关联，就不知道那件事的规律，就不知道如何去做，就不能做好那件事。”（“中国革命战争的战略问题”）做任何事情都要如此，那么，像实现总路线、建设社会主义这样翻天覆地的大事情，就更必须如此了。只有我们透彻地了解了过渡时期的总路线，了解了工人阶级所应担负的各项任务对于实现社会主义的重大意义和作用，我们才能更加鼓舞起勇气和信心，发扬“二七”革命精神，不惜任何艰苦，克服一切困难，集中一切力量去完成这些任务。同时，也只有了解了这些，我们才能进一步提高自己的阶级觉悟，才能正确地在阶级内部展开批评和自我批评，不断地防止并克服资产阶级思想对工人阶级队伍的影响，使自己在贯彻总路线的过程中，胜利地担负起领导阶级的重大责任。
    中国工人阶级在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，在苏联的伟大的无私的援助下，继承并发扬了“二七”的革命精神，胜利地完成了中国革命第一阶段的历史任务。今后我们要更紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的周围，更虚心地向苏联学习，更好地团结全国人民，在今天新的形势和新的任务下，发扬“二七”的革命精神，为完成中国革命第二阶段的历史任务、把中国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
