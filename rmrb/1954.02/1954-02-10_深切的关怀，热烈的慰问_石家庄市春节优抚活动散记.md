Deep Concern, Warm Condolences
    ——A Record of Spring Festival Activities for Families of Martyrs and Military Personnel in Shijiazhuang

    One
    The morning of the Spring Festival in Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province.

    Streetlights still shone brightly, accompanied by sparse morning stars, and the streets were already crowded with people. Under the streetlights, groups of children were setting off firecrackers, their sharp laughter ringing out from time to time. At this moment, the team organized jointly by the city-level leading organs to express condolences to the families of martyrs and military personnel set off. The number of people increased, and the team grew larger. They emerged from the streets and alleys, went to the homes of the glorious families of martyrs and military personnel, shook hands warmly, expressed sincere condolences, wished them a happy Spring Festival, and sought their opinions on the work of preferential treatment.

    In the past four years, the city-level leading organs have introduced 943 family members of military personnel to factories to participate in the economic construction of the motherland. In 1953, 176 families of martyrs and military personnel participated in mutual aid and cooperative handicraft production, and 608 households received government subsidies of 459,180,000 yuan. The children of 156 families of martyrs and military personnel also received government tuition subsidies. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the People's Government issued another 140 million yuan in material subsidies to help the families of martyrs and military personnel in difficulty celebrate the Spring Festival. Now, this condolence team is once again carrying the wishes of Chairman Mao and the People's Government to visit and express condolences to the glorious families. More than 3,000 condolence cards were sent to the homes of these glorious families, wishing them a happy Spring Festival and encouraging them to "carry forward revolutionary traditions and strive for greater glory."

    As early as seven or eight days ago, the Spring Festival preferential treatment activities here had already begun. The loudspeakers on the streets broadcast the resounding call of the Municipal People's Government, and the masses responded to the call. They donated 260 million yuan in consolation money, which was distributed to the homes of every family of martyrs and military personnel. Stores all put up signs like this: During the Spring Festival, we offer a 5% discount to families of martyrs and military personnel. Citizens, carrying brooms and buckets, poured into the homes of the families of martyrs and military personnel. On the morning of February 1st, I arrived at Yong'an Street in the Second District. Amidst the sound of gongs and drums, people were busy putting up Spring Festival couplets and hanging glory lanterns for the families of martyrs and military personnel. Comrade Ren Shuzhen, a district cadre who accompanied me, introduced that Yong'an Street is a model street for preferential treatment in the city and a model street for patriotic hygiene in the entire North China region. There are 17 preferential treatment groups on the entire street, with 168 participants, who visit the homes of martyrs and military personnel once a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Last year alone, they swept 350 rooms and whitewashed 18 rooms for families of military personnel; as for sweeping snow, fetching water, washing clothes, and taking care of children... that's countless. Liu Luoyi, a 58-year-old doctor, has never charged for seeing patients from the families of martyrs and military personnel; for households in difficulty, he doesn't even charge for medicine. The masses' love for the families of martyrs and military personnel has become a social norm.

    The preferential treatment activities in Shijiazhuang City have a relatively regular and broad mass base. There are 546 preferential treatment groups in the city, with a total of more than 4,200 people. They are divided into condolence groups, sewing groups, water-fetching groups, sweeping groups, letter-writing groups..., and according to the specific situation, they are divided into areas and assigned to each family, visiting the families of martyrs and military personnel once or twice a week to help them with laundry, sweeping, fetching water, or writing letters to their relatives.

    One afternoon before the Spring Festival, I visited the home of Cui Yuzhen. She is a model for preferential treatment and hygiene in the city, a member of the Fourth District People's Government, a member of the Women's Federation, and a model for public security. In the recent grassroots elections, she was elected as a district people's representative with 1,365 votes. At that time, she was busy dismantling and washing quilts and rehearsing plays for several military families on the neighboring street. As soon as I sat down in her house, a chubby child came in clamoring for his mother to make him noodles. This is Cui Yuzhen's second son, only six years old, named Wang Shusen. As soon as he saw a stranger, he stopped clamoring and stared at me with his big eyes.

    "Shusen, this is an uncle from Beijing. Tell uncle, who are our friends?" Cui Yuzhen asked deliberately. "Kim Il-sung. And the Korean people." "Who is fighting the American devils?" "The Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army uncles." "Who is our big brother?" "The Soviet Union." The child looked at my face and answered like this.

    Cui Yuzhen's husband, Wang Menglai, is a Communist Party member and a railway worker. The eldest son, Wang Shumao, is in the fifth grade at the Railway Workers' Children's Primary School. The second son only started school last year. Cui Yuzhen began participating in social work on the "May Day" Labor Day in 1950. At that time, people elected her as the neighborhood leader. Encouraged by her husband, she overcame difficulties in her work and achieved success. In 1952, she and Dai Hua, the health committee member on the street, organized a preferential treatment group of 17 people. They pooled some money and bought some lime to whitewash the houses of eight military families. The number of preferential treatment groups increased, one, two, ... thirteen. Recently, in her propaganda of the general line to the masses, many porters and masons have also participated in the preferential treatment work. They are divided into youth groups, porter groups, mason groups, sewing and washing groups.... Each group is divided into areas and assigned to each family, visiting the military families once a week. If they find that the military families have work that they cannot do, they immediately organize forces to help them do it. Cui Yuzhen herself made 22 pairs of shoes, sewed 30 pairs of soles, dismantled and washed 16 quilts, and made 11 cotton clothes for military families in 1953 alone. In March of last year, they organized a sewing and washing group for military families. Every day, she and Dai Hua went to the nearby garrison, factories, and government offices to solicit work for the military family group. One row of carts after another, filled with clothes and bedding, were pulled out of the factories and government offices and distributed to the homes of the military families. The work that the soldiers needed to do was also given preferential treatment.

    Three

    The care and love of the People's Government and the masses for the families of martyrs and military personnel encourage them to strive for greater glory. Yin Jinlan sent all three of her children to the People's Army, and actively participated in street work, being elected as the street's women's director, health group leader, and newspaper reading group leader. In 1950, her daughter Wang Lianfang was introduced to work at the Shijiazhuang Municipal Local State-Owned Industry Administration Cigarette Factory. Now, Wang Lianfang has joined the Communist Youth League and become the leader of the production team. When she first entered the factory, she could only pack 500 boxes of cigarettes a day, but now she has reached a record of 1,600 boxes. In this factory, I also met the young female worker Yin Huimin, whose brother joined the People's Liberation Army in 1949. After undergoing the test of work, she has joined the Chinese Communist Party and has been promoted to the production team leader of the outsourcing group. After studying the general line in December last year, she led the entire group to overfulfill the state's production tasks every day, and her own daily production record is 2,000, with a quality rate of 100%.

    On the evening of the day before the Spring Festival, I visited the family of Volunteer Army member Yin Xiurong. At that time, her whole family was sitting around a table eating dumplings. A young man in a yellow military uniform stood up to greet me. This was her husband, Chang Bingxin, who had returned to the country on official business before the Spring Festival and took a leave of absence to come home. In 1950, he signed up to join the Volunteer Army, at which time they had only been married for six months. In Korea, he participated in the transportation unit, fighting all the way from the Yalu River to Seoul. After her husband left, Yin Xiurong was introduced to study at the Shijiazhuang Junior Normal School. In the summer of last year, she was introduced to study technology at the Tianjin State-Owned No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory. In six months, she mastered the operating techniques and was able to watch 212 roving spindles. Soon, she will go to work formally at the Shijiazhuang State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory. The couple will transmit news of victory to each other in different positions. (Attached picture)

    深切的关怀，热烈的慰问
    ——石家庄市春节优抚活动散记
    长荣
    一
    河北省石家庄市春节的早晨。
    路灯还伴着稀疏的晨星，放射着光芒，街头上已挤满了人群。路灯下，成群的孩子还在放鞭炮，不时地发出尖脆的笑声。这时候，市级领导机关联合组织的慰问烈、军属的队伍出发了。人数越来越多，队伍越来越大。他们从街头巷尾拥挤出来，走到了光荣的烈、军属的家里，亲切地握手，热烈地慰问，祝他们春节愉快，征求他们对优抚工作的意见。
    在过去四年中，市级领导机关曾介绍了九百四十三个军人家属进了工厂，参加祖国的经济建设工作。一九五三年，一百七十六名烈、军属参加了互助合作的手工业生产，六百零八户享受了政府四亿五千九百一十八万元的补助金，一百五十六个烈、军属的子女，还获得了政府的学费补助金。春节前夕，人民政府又发放了一亿四千万元的实物补助金，帮助困难的烈、军属欢度春节。现在，这支慰问队伍又带着毛主席和人民政府的心意，到光荣人家去慰问了。三千多张慰问片送到了光荣的家庭里，祝他们春节快乐，祝他们“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”。
    早在七、八天前，这里的春节优抚活动就已经开始了。街道的扩音器发出了市人民政府的响亮号召，群众也就响应了人民政府的号召。他们捐献了二亿六千万的慰劳款，分送到了每个烈、军属的家里。商店门口，都挂出了这样的牌子：春节慰问烈、军属，一律九五扣。市民们拿着扫帚，抬着水桶，涌到了烈、军属的家里。二月一日的上午，我到了第二区永安街。在一片锣鼓声中，人们都在忙着给烈、军属贴对联，挂光荣灯。和我同行的区干部任淑珍同志介绍说：永安街是全市优抚模范街，也是全华北区的爱国卫生模范街。全街共有十七个优抚小组，参加者一百六十八人，他们每星期三、六都到烈、军属家去慰问一次。光在去年，他们就给军属扫房子三百五十间，粉刷墙十八间；至于扫雪、打水、洗衣服、看孩子……那就没数了。刘洛义是个五十八岁的医生，给烈、军属看病从来没要过钱；困难户，他连药费也不取。群众对烈、军属的热爱，已经形成了社会风气。
    二
    石家庄市的优抚活动，有着比较经常的、广泛的群众基础。全市有着五百四十六个优抚小组，共四千二百多人。他们分为慰问小组、缝纫小组、打水小组、扫地小组、写信小组……，根据具体情况，分片包干，每礼拜都到烈、军属家去一次到两次，帮助他们洗衣、扫地、打水，或替他们给亲人写信。
    春节前的一天下午，我访问了崔玉珍的家庭。她是市优抚模范和卫生模范，第四区人民政府委员、妇联委员和治安模范。在最近的基层选举中，她又以一千三百六十五票当选为区人民代表。那时，她正在忙着给邻街的几家军属拆洗被子和排演话剧。我刚在她房子里坐下，一个长得胖呼呼的孩子就吵嚷着进来，要妈给她做挂面吃。这是崔玉珍的二儿子，才六岁，叫王树森。一看到生人，他再不吵嚷了，两只大眼睛直盯着我。
   “树森，这是北京来的叔叔。给叔叔说，谁是咱们的朋友？”崔玉珍故意问。“金日成。还有朝鲜人民。”“谁打美国鬼子？”“志愿军和朝鲜人民军叔叔。”“谁是咱们的老大哥？”“苏联。”孩子看了一下我的脸，这样答复。
    崔玉珍的丈夫王梦来，是个共产党员，铁路工人。大儿子王树茂，在铁路职工子弟小学校念五年级。二儿子去年才到学校里读书。崔玉珍在一九五○年的“五一”劳动节开始参加社会工作。那时，人们选她做了闾长。在她丈夫的鼓励下，她克服了工作上的困难，取得了成绩。一九五二年，她和街道上的卫生委员戴花一起，组织了十七人的一个优抚小组。他们自己凑了些钱，买了些石灰，给八家军属刷了房子。优抚小组越来越多了，一个，两个，……十三个。最近在她向群众进行总路线的宣传中，许多搬运工人和泥水工人都参加了优抚工作。他们分成了青年小组、搬运小组、泥水小组、缝洗小组……。各组分片包干，每礼拜到军属家去慰问一次，发现军属家有做不了的活，马上组织力量帮助他们去做。光崔玉珍自己，一九五三年就给军属做鞋二十二双，纳底子三十对，拆洗被子十六床，做棉衣十一件。去年三月间，她们又组织了军属缝纫、洗衣小组。每天，她和戴花一起，替军属小组到附近的驻军、工厂和机关去揽活。一排子车，一排子车的衣服和被褥，从工厂和机关里拉出来，又被分送到军属家里。战士要做的活，还得到了优待。
    三
    人民政府和群众对烈、军属的关怀和热爱，鼓舞着他们争取更大的光荣。殷金兰把自己的三个孩子都送到了人民的军队里，自己积极地参加了街道工作，被选为街道的妇女主任、卫生小组长和读报组长。一九五○年，她的女儿王莲芳被介绍到石家庄市地方国营工业管理局烟厂做工。现在，王莲芳已经加入了青年团，当上了生产小组长。刚进厂时，她每天只能包五百盒烟，现在已达到一千六百盒的纪录。在这个工厂里，我还碰到了年青的女工尹慧敏，她的哥哥一九四九年参加了人民解放军。她经过了工作的考验，已经加入了中国共产党，又被提拔为外包组的生产组长。去年十二月学了总路线以后，她领导全组每天都超额完成了国家的生产任务，她自己每天的生产纪录是两千条，质量达到了百分之百。
    春节的前一天晚上，我访问了志愿军家属尹秀荣。那时，她全家正围着一张桌子吃饺子。一个身着黄色军服的年轻小伙子站起来给我打招呼，这是她的爱人常丙辛，春节前因公返国，请假顺便回家一趟。一九五○年，他报名参加了志愿军，那时，他们才结婚六个月。在朝鲜，他参加了运输部队，从鸭绿江边一直打到了汉城。丈夫走后，尹秀荣就被介绍到石家庄市初级师范念书，去年夏季，又被介绍到天津国营第六棉纺织厂学习技术。在半年中，她就掌握了操作技术，能看二百一十二锭粗纱纱锭。不久，她就要到石家庄国营棉纺织厂去正式上工。夫妇俩将在不同的岗位上相互传送胜利的捷报。（附图片）
