Safeguarding the Smooth Progress of the General Election from the Judicial Aspect
People's Courts in Various Localities Promptly Dispatch People's Tribunals

As the grassroots general election work began in many parts of the country, people's courts in various localities promptly formed and dispatched people's tribunals. They fully guaranteed the broad masses of people the exercise of their solemn democratic rights, legally sanctioned criminals who sabotaged the election, and safeguarded the smooth progress of the election work from the judicial aspect. Since early June last year, counties and cities in Jiangxi Province have selected a group of cadres to devote themselves to the work of the people's tribunals for general elections, organizing them to study relevant documents on general election work, as well as the business knowledge and working methods of the tribunals. Seventy-five people's tribunals for general elections were established in 312 townships and towns in 36 counties. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Court and the Provincial Election Committee cooperated to train 162 cadres from various counties and cities to serve in the tribunals, and 172 people's tribunals for general elections were established in the first batch of grassroots election areas throughout the province. Gansu Province has successively established 132 people's tribunals for general elections, with a total of 478 cadres, who generally concentrated on studying for three to five days in the county. In Tianjin, after the grassroots general election began in July last year, 84 cadres were drawn from the municipal and district people's courts and relevant organs and groups to establish 12 people's tribunals for general elections, with districts as units. People's courts in four counties in Fujian Province, including Fu'an, also combined the "case-clearing" work before the start of the grassroots general election work, reviewing the materials of criminal cases that had been adjudicated, not yet adjudicated, as well as cases involving suspended sentences, parole, control, medical treatment outside prison, etc., to determine whether these criminals had political rights, and then listed them separately and sent them to various places as reference when reviewing the qualifications of voters.

Most local people's tribunals for general elections were announced to be established at the same time as the election committees. Under the unified leadership of the local party and government organs, and in close coordination with the election committees and their dispatched working groups, they carried out the work of the tribunals in conjunction with each specific step of the election work. Therefore, they were able to discover and correctly handle election-related cases in a timely manner, which played a significant role in the smooth progress of the general election work. First of all, the people's tribunals for general elections fully guaranteed the democratic rights of voters and properly handled cases where election rights had been illegally deprived. In the first batch of grassroots elections in Jiangxi Province, people's tribunals in Gao'an and other counties handled 646 cases of appeals regarding voter qualifications, of which 249 were ruled to grant the right to vote. A poor peasant in Zhangxi Township, Gan County, was wrongly classified as a semi-landlord-type rich peasant during the land reform review and was still treated as a landlord class element when reviewing voter qualifications this time. After the people's tribunal for general elections cooperated with relevant departments to clarify the facts, his class status was corrected, and it was legally announced that he should be given the right to vote. He was extremely excited, and the masses unanimously supported it. People's tribunals for general elections in various localities have also seriously dealt with criminals who illegally steal election rights and endanger and sabotage elections. According to materials from various places, although there are fewer cases of endangering and sabotaging elections, their nature is serious. In Jiangxi, Fujian, and other places, it has been found that remnant counter-revolutionary elements and landlord class elements not only try every means to steal election rights but also spread rumors and incite some masses not to participate in election activities, and even try to take the opportunity to seize rural power. In Miaoxia Township, Yongfeng County, Jiangxi Province, unlawful landlord Fu Liangpi used the remaining clan habits in rural areas to attack activists of the farmers' association, attempting to bring another bad element to power. In Fengle Township, Jian'ou County, Fujian Province, bad elements Ning Ji and others secretly gathered, conspiring to take the opportunity of the election to usurp our village power, and instructed bad elements to openly make trouble. Local people's tribunals for general elections have dealt with these cases of sabotaging elections in a timely manner, and some places have also held public trials, which have been unanimously supported by the masses.

Under the principle of mainly serving the general election, the people's tribunals for general elections in various localities have also carried out some necessary judicial construction in conjunction. This mainly includes focusing on rectifying people's mediation organizations, establishing a first-instance jury system, and clearing up some accumulated cases. For example, Chongqing elected 246 jurors in conjunction with the general election. Shenyang elected 794 jurors. Liaodong Province elected 213 fixed jurors and assisted the masses in re-electing and establishing people's mediation organizations in 1,469 villages in 71 districts. These jurors and mediators have played an active role in assisting the court in hearing election-related cases and reflecting illegal acts in the election. For example, juror Liu Fengqi in Shenyang reported the crime of counter-revolutionary element Su Delin spreading rumors to sabotage the general election. Yang Minbao, a counter-revolutionary element who escaped in Wuwei County, Anhui Province, repeatedly concealed his counter-revolutionary crimes in an attempt to steal election rights, but after jurors Wang Desheng and Ma Liyu presented materials on the spot to question him, he admitted his counter-revolutionary crimes.

However, the people's courts in a few places did not pay enough attention to the people's tribunals for general elections and did not promptly dispatch people's tribunals for general elections when conducting pilot projects for general elections in their localities. Although some cadres were dispatched to establish people's tribunals, due to insufficient preparations beforehand, the cadres were not seriously studied and trained, and the policy boundaries were not clear enough, some problems occurred in hearing cases. In some places, the nature and tasks of the people's tribunals were not publicized in conjunction with the general election work, and the masses did not know what the tribunals were for, and did not appeal or report to the tribunals when problems arose. The People's Tribunal for General Elections in Yong'an County, Fujian, investigated nine people who were wrongly deprived of their political rights, and they did not know how to appeal. Pan Ji'gen, an old peasant in his sixties in Fengle Township, Jian'ou County, did not know that there was a people's tribunal in the area at all. In order to report a bad element who sabotaged the election, he ran to the Commissioner's Office in the scorching sun to accuse him. In some places, the relationship between the people's tribunals for general elections and the election committees was unclear. The cadres of the tribunals mainly participated in the general voter registration and voter qualification review work, and the tribunals did not play their unique role at all. These shortcomings and errors should be promptly checked and corrected.

    从司法方面保障普选工作顺利进行
    各地人民法院及时派出人民法庭
    全国许多地方的人民法院，随着当地基层普选工作的开始，及时组成和派出人民法庭，充分保证了广大人民行使自己的庄严的民主权利，依法制裁了破坏选举的犯罪分子，从司法方面保障了选举工作的顺利进行。江西省各县市从去年六月上旬起，就抽调了一批干部专任普选人民法庭的工作，组织他们学习了有关普选工作的文件及法庭的业务知识和工作方法，在三十六个县的三百一十二个乡、镇中，成立了七十五个普选人民法庭。江苏省人民法院和省选举委员会配合训练了担任法庭工作的各县市干部一百六十二人，在全省第一批基层选举的地区，成立了一百七十二个普选人民法庭。甘肃省先后成立了普选人民法庭一百三十二个，共有干部四百七十八名，一般都在县里集中学习了三至五天。天津市在去年七月基层普选开始以后，就从市、区人民法院及有关机关团体抽调干部八十四人，以区为单位成立了十二个普选人民法庭。福建省福安等四县人民法院，还在基层普选工作开始前，就结合“清案”工作，把刑事已决犯、未决犯以及缓刑、假释、管制、保外执行、保外就医等案犯的材料分别进行了审查，确定这些案犯有无政治权利，然后列单分送各地作为审查选民资格时的参考。
    多数地方的普选人民法庭都与选举委员会同时宣告成立，并在当地党政机关的统一领导下，在与选举委员会及其派出的工作组密切配合下，结合选举工作的每一具体步骤开展法庭的工作，因而能够及时发现和正确处理有关选举的案件，对于普选工作的顺利进行起了很大作用。首先是普选人民法庭充分保障了选民的民主权利，对被非法剥夺了选举权利的案件作了妥善的处理。在江西省第一批基层选举工作中，高安等县人民法庭就处理了有关选民资格申诉的案件六百四十六件，其中判决应给予选举权的有二百四十九件。赣县樟溪乡有一贫农在土地改革复查中被错划为半地主式富农，在这次审查选民资格时仍被当作地主阶级分子。后经普选人民法庭协同有关部门弄清了事实，改正了他的成分，并依法宣布应给他选举权，本人极为兴奋，群众也一致拥护。各地普选人民法庭对于非法窃取选举权和危害与破坏选举的犯罪分子也都作了严肃的处理。根据各地的材料，危害与破坏选举的案件虽然较少，但性质严重。江西、福建等地都曾发现残余反革命分子和地主阶级分子不仅千方百计地企图窃取选举权，而且造谣煽动某些群众不参加选举活动，甚至企图乘机夺取乡村政权。江西省永丰县庙下乡不法地主傅良丕利用农村残留的宗派遗习打击农会积极分子，企图捧另一坏分子上台。福建省建瓯县丰乐乡坏分子宁积高等更秘密集会，阴谋利用选举的机会篡夺我村政权，并指使坏分子公开捣乱。当地普选人民法庭对这些破坏选举的案件都及时作了处理，有的地方还举行了公开审判，得到了群众的一致拥护。
    各地普选人民法庭在主要为普选服务的原则下，还结合进行了一些必要的司法建设。这主要是有重点地整顿了人民调解组织，建立了一审陪审制，并清理了部分积案。如重庆市就结合普选选出了陪审员二百四十六人。沈阳市选出了陪审员七百九十四人。辽东省选出了固定陪审员二百一十三名，并在七十一个区的一千四百六十九个村协助群众改选和建立了人民调解组织。这些陪审员和调解员在协助法庭审理有关选举的案件和反映选举中的违法行为等方面都起了积极的作用。如沈阳市的陪审员刘凤岐检举了反革命分子苏德林造谣破坏普选的罪行。安徽省无为县漏网反革命分子杨民保一再掩盖他的反革命罪行，企图窃取选举权，但经陪审员王德胜和马立玉当场提出材料质问后，他才承认了自己的反革命罪行。
    但是也有少数地方的人民法院对普选人民法庭不够重视，在当地进行普选试点工作时，没有及时派出普选人民法庭。有的虽然派出干部成立了人民法庭，但由于事前的准备工作不充分，干部没有经过认真的学习和训练，政策界限不够明确，在审理案件时发生了一些问题。有的地方没有结合普选工作去进行有关人民法庭的性质和任务的宣传，群众不知道法庭是作什么的，有问题也不向法庭申诉和检举。福建永安县普选人民法庭调查了九个被错误剥夺了政治权利的人，他们都不知道怎样去申诉。建瓯县丰乐乡六十多岁的老农民潘纪珢，根本不知道当地有人民法庭，为了检举一个破坏选举的坏分子，冒着烈日跑到专署去控告。还有一些地方对普选人民法庭和选举委员会的关系混淆不清，法庭的干部主要参加一般的选民登记和选民资格审查工作，法庭根本没有起到它特有的作用。这些缺点和错误应迅速检查纠正。
