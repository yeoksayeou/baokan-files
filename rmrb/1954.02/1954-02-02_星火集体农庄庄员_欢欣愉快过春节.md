Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 1st – Members of the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, are enthusiastically preparing for the Spring Festival. Because this collective farm has fully leveraged the advantages of collective labor and mechanized production, the income of the members has greatly increased. Therefore, the preparations for this year's Spring Festival are particularly thorough. Even before the time for "venerating the Kitchen God," the female members began the ancient custom of "sweeping away the dust" and preparing Spring Festival food – "Dagaao" (glutinous rice cake).

These days, the home of the farm's female tailor, Wen Huazhu, is especially lively. She is busy sewing new Spring Festival outfits in silk, satin, floral cloth, and wool for the members. Female member Lu Dexuan has already made a blue silk skirt to wear for the Spring Festival. Member Sun Jingdao took 1 million yuan from his agricultural income of 15.6 million yuan last year to make a set of serge spring clothes.

The New Year's goods for the members were purchased uniformly by the farm's management committee. The quantity of these goods exceeds the total amount used by all the farmers in the entire village during several Spring Festivals before the establishment of the farm. The nine new member households who joined the farm are also happily welcoming the Spring Festival with the help of the old members. In addition to lending them 3,000 jin of rice, 600 jin of glutinous rice, and 30 cartloads of firewood, the old members also helped them prepare New Year's goods. The new members said with emotion, "The farm not only produces more grain, but even the way members treat each other has changed." The members have also prepared many entertainment programs. Young members have prepared Korean folk dances such as "Spring Dance," "Doraji Ballad Dance," "Han River Water Dance," "Yang San Do Dance," etc., and have also prepared songs about "Growing more grain in the new year." The farm's amateur theater troupe is preparing to stage a play: "Sell the surplus grain to the state for a happier life." The children in the farm's nursery are also preparing to perform the "Pulling the Radish" game. All the members are also preparing to hold a banquet and a cultural evening on the first day of the Lunar New Year to entertain the fifteen military dependents' households in the entire farm.

    星火集体农庄庄员
    欢欣愉快过春节
    【新华社佳木斯一日电】松江省桦川县星火集体农庄的庄员们热烈筹备过春节。这个集体农庄由于充分发挥了集体劳动和机械生产的优越性，庄员收入大大增加，因此，今年春节的准备就格外周全。还没有到“祭灶”时节，女庄员们就按着古老的风俗“扫尘”了，并准备了春节的食品——“打糕”（糯米糕）。
    这些天，农庄女缝纫员文华洙的家里，格外热闹。她应接不暇地为庄员们缝制绸、缎、花布和毛料的春节新装。女庄员卢德铉已做好了春节穿的绸质蓝裙子。庄员孙京道从他去年一千五六百万元的农业收入中，抽出一百万元做了一套哔叽春装。
    庄员的年货是由农庄管理委员会统一购置的。这些年货超过建庄前全庄农民几个春节用的数量。新入庄的九户庄员，在老庄员的帮助下，也都愉快地迎接春节。老庄员们除了借给他们三千斤大米、六百斤糯米和三十车烧柴外，还帮助他们筹办了年货。新庄员感动地说：“农庄不只打粮多，连庄员待人接物都变样了。”庄员们还准备了很多娱乐节目。青年庄员们准备了朝鲜民族舞蹈“春舞”、“多尔江边舞”、“汉江水舞”、“阳山道舞”等，还准备了“新的一年要打更多的粮食”的歌曲。农庄业余剧团准备上演话剧：“为了更幸福的生活，把余粮卖给国家”。农庄托儿所的孩子们也准备出演“拔萝卜”游戏。全体庄员还准备在旧历正月初一那天，举行宴会和文娱晚会，招待全农庄的十五户军属。
