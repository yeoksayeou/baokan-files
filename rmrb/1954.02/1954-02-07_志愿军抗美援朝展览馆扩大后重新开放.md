Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 6th: The Exhibition Hall of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, sponsored by the leading organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, reopened on February 4th after more than two months of processing and expansion. General Yang Dezhi, Deputy Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, General Li Da, Chief of Staff, General Wang Yunrui, Deputy Chief of Staff, General Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department, and staff members of the agency visited again.

    When the exhibition hall opened in October last year, it only had two halls, and the content was not perfect enough. Now, the scale of the exhibition hall has doubled compared to the past. It has six halls, divided into six sections. The first hall is the "Preface Hall" and "Striking at the Aggressors," the second hall is "Artillery in the Victory of War," "Communication Guarantee in the Victory of War," and "Engineering Guarantee in the Victory of War," the third hall is "Material Guarantee in the Victory of War" and "Health and Epidemic Prevention Work in the Victory of War," the fourth hall is "Air Force in the Victory of War," "Warm Support from the People of the Motherland," "Warm Support from the Korean People," "Support from the People of the World," and "Volunteer Army Helps the Korean People," the fifth hall is "Victorious Achievements," and the sixth hall is "Hall of Heroes." In addition to the many physical objects, charts, and hero photos on display in the hall, many electric models have also been added, making the large-scale modern combat scenes of Shangganling, Maliang Mountain, Old Baldy Mountain, and the 1953 summer counterattack vividly presented to visitors.

    The "Preface Hall" is completely newly established. It contains a large model of Pyongyang City after the "August 15th" liberation, showing its peace and prosperity, as well as a comparative model of Wonsan City before and after the war. From the models of these two large cities, people can see the towering crimes of the American aggressors. Another part of the "Preface Hall" displays the solemn statement issued by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai when the American aggressors brought the flames of war to the Yalu River, the joint declaration of various democratic parties, and pictures of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army going to the Korean battlefield.

    Since the opening of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea Exhibition Hall in October last year, more than 20,000 people have visited, including representatives of the Volunteer Army organs and various arms of the troops, representatives of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, representatives of Korean governments at all levels, representatives of the Korean People's Army, and the local Korean people. In the future, the various arms and units of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will systematically select representatives to visit the exhibition hall.

    志愿军抗美援朝展览馆扩大后重新开放
    【新华社平壤六日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关主办的中国人民志愿军抗美援朝展览馆，经过两个多月的加工扩大后，在二月四日重新开放。中国人民志愿军副司令员杨得志将军、参谋长李达将军、副参谋长王蕴瑞将军、政治部副主任张南生将军以及机关工作人员再次前往参观。
    展览馆在去年十月开馆时仅有两座大厅，内容还不够完善。现在，展览馆的规模比过去扩大二倍，它拥有六座大厅，分设六个馆，第一馆是“序馆”和“打击侵略者”，第二馆是“战争胜利中的炮兵”、“战争胜利中的通讯保证”和“战争胜利中的工程保证”，第三馆是“战争胜利中的物资保证”和“战争胜利中的卫生防疫工作”，第四馆是“战争胜利中的空军”、“祖国人民的热烈支援”、“朝鲜人民的热烈支援”、“世界人民的支援”和“志愿军帮助朝鲜人民”，第五馆是“胜利的战果”，第六馆是“英雄馆”。馆内陈列的物品，除增添了许多实物图表和英雄照片外，还增设了许多电动模型，使上甘岭、马良山、老秃山和一九五三年夏季反击战等大规模的现代化的战斗情景，都形象地呈现在参观者面前。
    “序馆”完全是新设的，里面有“八·一五”解放后的和平繁荣的平壤市大模型，有元山市战前和战后情景的对比模型。从这两座大城市的模型上，人们可以看到美国侵略者的滔天罪行。“序馆”的另一部分陈列着当美国侵略者把战火燃烧到鸭绿江边的时候，我国周恩来外长发表的庄严声明、各民主党派联合宣言和中国人民志愿军开赴朝鲜战场的图片。
    中国人民志愿军抗美援朝展览馆从去年十月开馆以来，前往参观的已达两万多人，其中包括志愿军机关、部队各兵种的代表，中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的代表和朝鲜各级政府、朝鲜人民军的代表，以及驻地的朝鲜人民。今后，中国人民志愿军各兵种、各部队将有计划地选派代表陆续赴展览馆参观。
