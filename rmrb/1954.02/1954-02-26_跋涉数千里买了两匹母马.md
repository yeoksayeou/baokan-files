    Traveled Thousands of Miles to Buy Two Mares
    Liao Min of the Finance and Economics Committee of Pan County, Guizhou Province writes: In January of this year, the Huaiyang County Cooperative Union in Henan Province sent four cadres, holding letters of introduction from the Huaiyang County Finance Committee, who traveled thousands of miles, passing through Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi and other provinces, to our Pan County Finance Committee, requesting assistance in purchasing two hundred mares locally. It is said that farmers in the Huaiyang area like to use mares for plowing. The leaders of the cooperative said that "there are many horses in Guizhou, and the price of horses is also very cheap," so they sent them to buy horses. However, the actual situation here is exactly the opposite of what they imagined. We do not produce horses in large quantities here, and there are even fewer mares. The masses are unwilling to sell them in order to breed foals; at the same time, buying horses here is not cheap, and the price is even more expensive when you add the long-distance transportation costs to Huaiyang. As a result, these four cadres only bought two mares and went back.
    I think that the leaders of the Huaiyang County Cooperative Union neither understood the horse production situation in our county, nor did they contact us by letter beforehand, and blindly sent people here, resulting in losses. This kind of bureaucratic style is really unacceptable.

    跋涉数千里买了两匹母马
    贵州省盘县财政经济委员会廖敏来信：河南省淮阳县合作社联合社在今年一月份派了四名干部，拿着淮阳县财委的介绍信，跋涉数千里，经过湖北、湖南、广西等省，来到我们盘县财委，要求协助他们在当地购买二百匹母马。据说，淮阳一带的农民喜欢用母马耕田。合作社领导同志说是“贵州马很多，马价钱也很便宜”，就让他们前来买马了。可是，这里的实际情况恰恰和他们想像的相反。我们这里并不大量产马，母马则更少，群众为了繁殖小马，都不肯出卖；同时，在这儿买马并不便宜，加上运往淮阳的长途运费，价钱就更贵了。结果这四名干部只买了两匹母马回去。
    我认为淮阳县合作社联合社领导同志，既不了解我县产马情况，又不先用信函和我们联系，就盲目派人到这里来，以致造成损失。这种官僚主义作风实在是要不得的。
