The Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region of Qinghai Province is located west of Qinghai Lake, covering an area of 310,000 square kilometers. It borders Xinjiang and Gansu to the northwest and north, separated by the Altun Mountains and Qilian Mountains. To the south, it is connected to the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region, separated by the Kunlun Mountains and Bayan Har Mountains. The rich Qaidam Basin within the autonomous region is a famous natural pasture in China. The high mountains surrounding the autonomous region are covered with snow all year round, and the snowmelt forms countless inland rivers and lakes, irrigating this fertile land.

The Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway runs through the entire region along the southern edge of the basin, closely linking the autonomous region with the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province.

The Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region is an autonomous region equivalent to a special district level, under which are areas such as Dulan, Tianjun, and Alton Quk. The autonomous region has a population of over 20,000, including eight ethnic groups: Mongol, Tibetan, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Tu, Salar, and Uyghur. The Qaidam Basin, surrounded by mountains, has a mild climate and abundant water and grass, making it extremely suitable for developing animal husbandry. The region has more than 850,000 head of livestock, producing large quantities of fur and precious medicinal materials and hides such as deer antlers, musk, rhubarb, bear skins, fox furs, and lynx pelts annually. Parts of the basin are very suitable for agricultural production. The central, western, and northern parts of the basin are still good grasslands that have not been fully utilized. Herds of wild sheep, wild horses, and wild cattle inhabit the vast wilderness. The famous Chaka Salt Lake in the autonomous region is about 60 li long from east to west and 40 li wide from north to south, with readily available salt crystals. The production of natron, borax, saltpeter, and sulfur is also very abundant. Last year, the Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government conducted preliminary surveys here and discovered rich mineral deposits in the deep mountains. However, during the years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the people of all ethnic groups living on this rich land lived in extreme poverty. In the past, the bandit Ma Bufang not only exhausted all means to plunder the property of the people of all ethnic groups, but also provoked and incited mutual killings among them, making it impossible for people and livestock to live in peace. Animal husbandry and agricultural production were severely damaged, and many people were forced to disperse into the deep mountains and valleys, cutting off contact with the outside world.

After the liberation of Qinghai, the people of all ethnic groups in Haixi, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, began to unite and build their new lives. Last March, the Northwest Administrative Committee convened the Friendship Meeting of Kazakh Headmen and the National Unity Conference on the Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang borders in Lanzhou, which united the people of all ethnic groups in the Haixi region unprecedentedly. The Mongol and Tibetan people allocated the Guo Limao grassland, rich in water and grass, to the Kazakh people for residence and grazing. On the basis of the unity of the people of all ethnic groups, the preparatory work for the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region began. In the process of promoting national regional autonomy in the region, 338 cadres of minority ethnic groups such as Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh have been trained. The People's Government has also helped the people of all ethnic groups to restore and develop production. Last year, the total number of livestock in the autonomous region increased by 53 percent compared to 1951. The People's Government also issued various loans and relief funds totaling more than 350 million yuan to help 466 poor herding families establish their livelihoods. The Kazakh people of Alton Quk, after receiving a large number of livestock, grain, and yurts from the People's Government, also began to engage in production. All tribes in the autonomous region have generally established grassland management committees and livestock protection committees to lead herders in protecting grasslands and improving livestock breeding and management methods. In terms of agricultural production, 28 canals were built and repaired throughout the region last year, resulting in an increase in yield per unit area compared to 1952. The people of all ethnic groups also organized themselves to engage in sideline production such as digging rhubarb, extracting alkali, transporting salt, and hunting.

In the past four years, the trade work in the autonomous region has also developed greatly. Now, in addition to establishing a state-owned trading company in Chahan Wusu, the seat of the Autonomous Region People's Government, state-owned trading stores have also been established in Xiangride, Xiligou, Qumalai, Tianjun, and other places, and supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in Balong Banner, Wangjia Banner, Kelugou, and other places. In addition, mobile trade teams are often organized to conduct trade in remote areas, which has significantly improved the lives of the people of all ethnic groups. Now, nearly half of the population in the region can eat fine grains such as rice, flour, and noodles.

    青海省海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区介绍
    新华社记者　侯毅
    青海省海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区位于青海湖的西面，面积有三十一万平方公里。西北和北面隔着阿尔金山、祁连山和新疆、甘肃接界，南面隔着昆仑山、巴颜喀喇山和玉树藏族自治区相连。自治区境内富饶的柴达木盆地，是我国著名的天然牧场。自治区四周的高山，终年覆盖着积雪，雪水汇集成无数的内陆河流与湖泊，灌溉着这块肥沃的土地。
    青（青海）新（新疆）公路沿着盆地的南缘横贯全境，把自治区和青海省农业区紧密地联结起来。
    海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区是个相当于专区级的自治区，辖都兰、天峻和阿尔顿曲克等地区。自治区共有两万多人口，包括蒙、藏、哈萨克、汉、回、土、撒拉、维吾尔等八个民族。柴达木盆地在群山环抱之中，气候温和，境内到处都是水草丰美的天然牧场，对发展畜牧业有极其便利的条件。全区共有各种牲畜八十五万多头，每年可产大量的皮毛，并出产鹿茸、麝香、大黄、熊皮、狐皮、猞猁皮等珍贵的药材和兽皮。盆地的部分地区，很适宜于农业生产。盆地的中部、西部和北部，还是一片未经充分利用过的良好草原。在辽阔的荒草原中，栖息着成群的野羊、野马和野牛。自治区境内著名的茶卡盐池，东西长约六十里，南北宽四十里，池内有现成的盐的结晶体。冰碱、硼砂、硝和硫磺的产量也非常丰富。去年中央人民政府地质部曾在这里进行过初步勘测，发现深山中还蕴藏着丰富的矿藏。但在国民党反动派统治的年代里，居住在这块富饶土地上的各族人民，却过着极端穷困的生活。过去，马匪步芳除想尽各种办法劫夺各族人民的财物外，还挑拨煽惑各族人民互相仇杀，使得人畜得不到安宁，畜牧业和农业生产受到严重破坏，很多人被迫流散到深山野谷里，和外界断绝来往。
    青海解放后，海西各族人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，才开始团结起来建立自己的新生活。去年三月，西北行政委员会在兰州召开的甘、青、新边境哈萨克族头人联谊会和各民族团结会，使海西地区各族人民空前的团结起来。蒙族和藏族人民，把水草丰美的郭里峁草原，划给哈萨克族人民居住和放牧。在各民族人民团结的基础上，海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区的筹备工作才开展起来。全区在推行民族区域自治政权工作中，已培养了蒙、藏、哈萨克族等少数民族干部三百三十八名。人民政府并帮助各族人民进行了恢复和发展生产的工作。去年全自治区的各种牲畜比一九五一年增殖了百分之五十三。人民政府还发放各种贷款和救济款三亿五千多万元，帮助四百六十六户贫苦牧民建立了家务。阿尔顿曲克的哈萨克族人民在得到人民政府救济的大批牲畜、粮食和蒙古包后，也开始进行生产。全自治区的各个部落都普遍成立了草原管理委员会和保畜委员会的组织，领导牧民保护草原和改善牲畜饲养管理方法。在农业生产方面，去年全区共兴修和整修水渠二十八处，使单位面积产量比一九五二年有所提高。各族人民并组织起来进行挖大黄、挖碱、驮盐、打猎等副业生产。
    四年来，自治区的贸易工作也有了很大的发展。现在，全区除在自治区人民政府所在地察汗乌苏设立了国营贸易公司外，并在香日德、希里沟、曲麻莱、天峻等地设立了国营贸易商店，在巴隆旗、王家旗、克鲁沟等地成立了供销合作社，另外，还经常组织流动贸易小组到边远地区进行贸易，因此，使各族人民的生活都有了显著改善。现在全区已有近半数人口能够吃到大米、面粉和挂面等细粮。
