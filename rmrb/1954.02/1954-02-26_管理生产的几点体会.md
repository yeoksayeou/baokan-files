Some Experiences in Production Management
Zhou Chuandian, Deputy Director of the Iron Smelting Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company

Planning is the Foundation for Leading Production

Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant started operations in 1949, it has followed the same old path every year: failing to complete the tasks in the first quarter, rushing to rectify work in the second quarter, carrying out a crash program in the second half of the year, and waiting to write a victory report on completing the tasks at the end of the year. Before the victory report was written, everyone was on tenterhooks; after the victory report was written, everyone immediately relaxed. The leadership repeatedly instructed us to complete the plan in a balanced manner, and people were busy every day, even going to the factory on Sundays for meetings, but where was the key to continuously promoting production? No one had found it.

Through continuous research, we began to grasp planning, and all work revolved around planning.

At the end of 1952, we carefully studied the draft plan for 1953 proposed by the higher authorities for our plant. In the past, studying plans involved haggling; this time, it involved finding problems by discussing how to complete the plan and then finding ways to solve the problems. Advanced workers, shift directors, foremen, and full-time engineers all put forward suggestions or requests to the higher authorities and to the plant. The realization of these suggestions could plug up major loopholes in production. For example, the raw material engineer suggested improving the self-fluxing properties of sintered ore, which greatly promoted the smooth operation of smelting work; the blast furnace foreman proposed improvements to the operation of Blast Furnace No. 1, which helped Blast Furnace No. 1 reverse its unfavorable situation of several years. In this way, everyone realized that the tasks proposed by the higher authorities could be completed.

After the plan was determined, we immediately began production preparation work. For example, the raw material engineer was responsible for preparing the first quarter's production preparation meeting, which made decisions on the allocation of major raw materials; the production planning department was responsible for preparing the first quarter's work plan meeting, which compiled specific plans including output, quality, variety, transportation, and regular maintenance; the full-time engineer was responsible for preparing the first quarter's technical organization measures meeting, which set out a specific schedule for improving technical operations. This series of specialized meetings determined the general policy for the plant's work in the first quarter. For example, the raw material work plan not only provided consumption quantities but also considered which raw materials were suitable for smelting a certain type of pig iron and how much iron a blast furnace could produce, and how a blast furnace could work to complete the plan.

In the first half of January 1953, the whole plant carried out a discussion of the first quarter's production plan. First, we mobilized teams to study the planning materials so that everyone had a general understanding of the raw materials, quality, and various production indicators for the first quarter. After the study, everyone knew how to complete the tasks. Second, the小组 (xiǎozǔ, groups) summarized the work in 1952, mainly summarizing the work in the fourth quarter, and proposed specific measures to improve operations. These measures were generally not required to be many, only a few. For example, because Blast Furnace No. 1 had a heavy production task and insufficient iron output equipment capacity, it proposed the measure of uniform iron output, which ensured the safety of operations in front of the furnace.

The work in the first quarter laid the foundation for the official discussion of the state's annual plan in April. In previous years, production was slack in the first quarter, and when the state plan was discussed in the second quarter, workers complained, "The plan is advanced, but we can't complete the tasks now." When there was a deficit in daily production, people were not very motivated. From January to March 1953, the plan was overfulfilled, and some technical improvements, such as the furnace top distribution – it was already possible to confirm its effect, the morale of the masses was high, so there were conditions to correctly estimate the work for the whole year.

Before discussing the annual plan, the functional departments carefully prepared various indicators that could be achieved, analyzed favorable and unfavorable conditions, and technical organizational measures for the whole year. Through cadre meetings, branch meetings, propagandist meetings, production group meetings, etc., a wide range of deliberations were carried out among the employees. The plant's leadership comrades specifically studied the weak links in the first quarter's production, such as the abnormal production of Blast Furnace No. 2 for more than a month, the unfamiliarity of the workers of the newly opened Blast Furnace No. 8 with new technologies, and the lack of planning in the repair section, and concentrated the main forces to help these places work. As a result, Blast Furnace No. 8 created a more detailed group division of labor system and equipment maintenance system, truly solving the key problems of the furnace. Nearly a thousand rationalization proposals were put forward in the discussion of the plan throughout the plant, thus formulating a plan to guarantee an over-fulfillment of 10.3% of the tasks assigned by the higher authorities for the whole year.

The implementation of the plan requires frequent inspection. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant checks the output, quality, and variety plan every day. The plant director or deputy director mainly relies on two methods to carry out the inspection: first, to go to various sections once or twice a day, and to correct abnormal operations at any time according to the work records and the foreman's temporary reports; second, the shift leader convenes two reporting meetings every day (one hour after the early and night shifts), the plant director or deputy director participates, listens to the work reports of various sections, and promptly decides on instructions for the work and rewards and punishments for each shift. Because the reporters include all sections of the plant, they can understand the work situation of the whole plant, and because the reports are carried out twice a day for each shift, they can play a supervisory role on each shift, which makes the staff improve their sense of responsibility. For example, the shift leader of Team B did not understand the situation of a blast furnace shutdown, and as a result, it was reported by Team C, and he was criticized.

During the inspection, a group deduction system is implemented for those who have made mistakes in their work, so that the reward and punishment system is implemented in daily operations. Because the deduction is related to the workers' wages, this implements the principle of distribution according to work. Also, because the deduction is implemented for the entire group, which is related to the wages and honor of the entire group, this promotes the collective spirit of the group and frequently studies and improves work in order to better achieve the indicators.

The statisticians calculate the completion of the ten-day plan every ten days and publish it. The plans for labor productivity, cost, training, technical organization measures, etc., are checked on a daily basis, and the responsible functional departments report at the administrative regular meetings.

In this way, planning becomes the center of the work of leaders at all levels in the plant.

Continuously Improve and Enhance Technology

Correctly revising and implementing operating procedures can continuously improve, consolidate, and enhance production technology. Our iron smelting procedures were formulated in 1951 and have not been revised for two years, which has limited the development of production. Later, we realized that the iron smelting procedures are only general guiding principles. According to the characteristics of iron smelting production, some specific operating indexes must be changed along with the changes in operating conditions such as raw materials, weather, and the development of production. In 1953, each blast furnace revised the operating procedures every quarter (sometimes every month). The order of revision has gradually formed a system. First, it is proposed by the furnace's technical staff meeting, discussed and passed by the furnace's production meeting, then submitted to the plant's technical committee for review and modification, and finally approved and implemented by the plant director, which guarantees the mass character and correctness of the operating procedures. Summer is the season when rainfall is high and air density is low, which reduces iron production. Because we carefully formulated and implemented summer operating procedures, the output not only did not decrease, but increased.

Advanced production plans are based on technological improvements. The more coke burned in the blast furnace, the more iron is produced. Therefore, burning more coke has become the central issue of technological improvement throughout the plant. According to the advanced experience of Soviet iron smelting, the furnace top distribution must be done well. In the practice of blast furnace operation over the past year, we have basically clarified the impact of the height of the material line, the order of charging, and the single and double charging methods on the smooth operation of the blast furnace. Therefore, we have created a furnace top distribution adjustment method suitable for our plant's equipment and operating conditions, which enables the amount of coke burned to reach the expected number and greatly increases the amount of iron produced per ton of coke. This major achievement can be compared with the three major technical achievements of previous years – the use of sintered ore, the smelting of low-silicon iron, and the use of full air volume.

These technical improvements were initially included in the annual technical organization measures plan.

In addition to the organizational work of the leadership, the strong atmosphere of technical research throughout the plant and the improvement of the technical and theoretical level of the employees have further guaranteed the realization of these technical measures. In order to improve the technical level of the workers, the Iron Smelting Plant held smelting and electromechanical technology training courses, and all workers in the plant participated in the study without exception. In order to improve the level of technicians from workers' backgrounds, the Iron Smelting Plant opened a workers' technical school to systematically teach operation theory. For engineering and technical personnel, a series of production and technical research meetings were held, such as weekly technical meetings to discuss or summarize technical operations, regular meetings of blast furnace technicians to study ways to improve production, and monthly production summary reports, to cultivate and improve the ability of technical personnel to specifically analyze production operations. In order to cultivate new technical cadres, we universally promoted master-apprentice contracts and held technical observation operations. In mid-1952, nearly two-thirds of the new cadres in each blast furnace in the plant mastered the operating technology of the blast furnace. The number of technicians promoted from workers in the old blast furnaces is also increasing day by day. The rapid growth of technical cadres is the driving force for the continuous development of production.

Fully Utilize the Role of New Equipment

The start-up of a new piece of equipment to its normal production is a serious test for the operators. In 1953, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant overhauled one blast furnace, carried out a medium repair of another blast furnace to replace the furnace body bricks, and started up two mechanized and automated blast furnaces. In carrying out these complex new technical tasks, we still have many loopholes and shortcomings that need to be improved in the future, but in general, we have been relatively successful.

The start-up of a new furnace must first solve the problem of technical strength. Three months before the start-up, we transferred personnel from the old furnaces, pre-arranged the technicians and workers into shifts, and determined the cadres and organizations of the groups, and then let them study. The content of the study includes the post responsibility system, the structure and theory of the new equipment, and the actual trial operation. While training the workers, the plant's full-time engineers also formed a furnace opening team and established a responsibility system for furnace opening. For example, the furnace front technician is responsible for the overall furnace front work. He must consider the preparation of spare parts and materials, the training of workers, and the maintenance of equipment very carefully. In addition, each type of work, such as gas and raw materials, has a technically proficient person in charge to guide, which ensures thoroughness in organization and technology.

In the technical operation of start-up and production, we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and adopted the rapid furnace baking method, which reduced the furnace baking time by three-quarters compared to the past. The start-up procedures were also basically formulated according to Soviet technical standards. These procedures were fully studied and discussed in advance.

The above work was arranged on the start-up instruction chart. The effectiveness of these work has shortened the average furnace baking and start-up time by 70%, and reduced the consumption of coke per ton of iron by 46%, providing rich experience for a more complete furnace opening and baking procedure.

Going from start-up to normal production requires more stable and careful work. Veteran worker Wu Dequan studied very well, but burned out an electric cannon head after a few days of operation. Practical operation tells us that mastering this new equipment is not so simple. All kinds of faults that have never been seen or heard of before will appear one after another. We especially focused on grasping the analysis and investigation of accidents. For example, if the electric cannon is not installed with a hook, the mud will be blasted, but the mud cannot be blasted in, and the cannon will be pushed back. The reason is that the operator cannot see the hook, so we installed signals for them and used these specific examples to educate all the workers. In order to enable the new equipment to work more normally, we also systematically established a detailed equipment maintenance system, such as stipulating that the pipe fitter should tighten the electric cannon oil box before each iron output, and the first furnace front worker should clean the electric cannon's distribution panel. Thanks to these efforts, the new equipment quickly reached a normal operating rate. For example, Blast Furnace No. 7 exceeded the design standards on the tenth day after start-up and successively created three new records, and the volume utilization coefficient was better than that of Blast Furnace No. 8.

The start-up and production of Blast Furnace No. 7 and Blast Furnace No. 8 have enabled us to have a complete set of workers and technicians who have basically mastered new technologies, a complete set of new equipment maintenance systems and usage procedures, which prepares more complete conditions for the start-up of Blast Furnace No. 5 and Blast Furnace No. 6 in the future.

    管理生产的几点体会
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂副厂长　周传典
    计划是领导生产的基础
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂从一九四九年开工以来，年年都走着一条老道路：第一季度完不成任务，第二季度急忙去整顿工作，下半年进行突击，年末等着写完成任务的报捷信。报捷信没写之前，谁都捏着一把汗；报捷信写了之后，一下子就松懈起来了。领导上一再指示我们要均衡地完成计划，人们天天忙得满头大汗，星期天也到厂子去开会，但推动生产不断前进的关键在那里？谁也没有找着。
    经过不断的研究，我们开始抓着了计划，一切工作都围绕着计划去进行。
    一九五二年末，我们认真研究了上级对本厂提出的一九五三年的计划草案。过去研究计划是讨价还价，这次则是从讨论如何完成计划当中去找问题，然后寻找解决问题的途径。先进工人、值班主任、工长和专职工程师，都提出了对上级、对本厂的建议或要求，这些建议的实现可以堵塞住生产上的大漏洞，比如原料工程师建议提高烧结矿的自熔性，这就大大促进了冶炼工作的顺行；高炉工长提出了改进一号高炉操作的建议，帮助一号高炉扭转了几年以来情况不好的局面。这样，大家才发现上级提出的任务是可以完成的。
    计划确定之后，就抓紧进行生产准备工作。例如由原料工程师负责准备的第一季度生产准备会议，对主要原材料的分配作出决定；由生产计划科负责准备的第一季度作业计划会议，编制出具体的包括产量、质量、品种、运输、定期检修等计划；由专职工程师负责准备的第一季度技术组织措施会议，订出改进技术操作的具体进度。这一系列的专门会议，决定了全厂第一季度工作的总方针，如原料工作的计划不但提供了消耗数量，而且考虑到冶炼某种生铁适宜于供给何种原料，高炉的产铁量是多少，高炉怎样工作就能完成计划等。
    一九五三年年初的半个月中间，全厂进行了一次讨论第一季度生产计划的工作，首先是动员班组学习计划资料，使大家对一季度的原材料、品质和各种生产指标有了概括的了解，学习之后，每个人对如何完成任务都心里有数了。其次是小组总结一九五二年的工作，主要是总结第四季度的工作，提出改进操作的具体措施，这个措施一般不要求多只要求几条，比如一号高炉小组因为生产任务重，出铁设备能力不足，所以提出铁量均匀这一措施，这就保证了炉前操作的安全。
    第一季度的工作，为四月份正式讨论国家全年计划打下了基础。往年一季度生产松，等到二季度讨论国家计划时，工人都埋怨说：“计划提的先进，就是现在的任务完不成。”在每天的生产量都有亏空的情况下，人们的劲头就不大。一九五三年一至三月都超额完成了计划，有一些技术改进，如炉顶布料等——已可肯定它的效果，群众的情绪很高，因此有条件去正确估计全年的工作。
    讨论全年计划之前，职能科细致地准备了可能达到的各种指标，分析了有利与不利条件和全年的技术组织措施，通过干部会，支部会，宣传员会，生产小组会等等，广泛地在职工中进行酝酿。厂的领导同志具体研究了一季度生产中的薄弱环节，如二号高炉一个多月生产不正常，新开工的八号高炉的工人掌握新技术不熟练，修理工段工作没有计划等，就集中主要力量到这些地方去帮助工作。结果，八号高炉创造出比较细致的小组分工制和设备维护制，真正解决了该炉的关键问题。全厂在讨论计划中提出合理化建议近千件，因而制订了保证全年超额百分之十点三完成上级所给的任务的计划。
    计划的执行需要经常检查。鞍钢炼铁厂每天检查产量、质量和品种计划。厂长或副厂长主要依靠两种方式去进行检查：第一是每天到各个工段去一次或两次，根据作业记录和工长的临时报告，随时纠正不正常的操作；第二是每日由值班长召开两次汇报会议（早班和夜班后一小时内），厂长或副厂长参加，听取各工段的工作报告，及时决定对工作的指示和每班工作的奖惩，因为汇报人员包括全厂的各个工段，可以了解全厂的工作情况，又因为每天两班进行汇报，对各班都可以发挥监督作用，就使得工作人员提高了责任感，比如乙班值班长对一个高炉休风的情况不了解，结果由丙班汇报出来，他便要受到批评。
    检查时，对工作有过失者，实行小组扣分制度，使奖惩制贯彻到日常操作中去，因为扣分关系到工人的工资，这就贯彻了按劳取酬的原则，又由于扣分是实行全组扣分，关系到全组工人的工资和荣誉，这就促使小组发挥了集体主义精神，经常研究改进工作，以便更好地达到指标。
    统计人员每十天计算出旬计划完成情况，把它公布出来。关于劳动生产率、成本、培养训练、技术组织措施等计划，则按日检查，由专管的职能科在行政例会上作报告。
    计划就这样变成厂内各级领导工作的中心。
    不断地改进和提高技术
    正确地修订和执行操作规程，就能使生产技术不断地改进、巩固和提高。我们的炼铁规程是一九五一年制订的，执行了两年也没有修订，结果限制了生产的发展。后来才明白了炼铁规程只是一般的指导原则，根据炼铁生产的特点，随着操作条件例如原料、天气等的变更和生产的发展，有些具体的操作指数必须跟着变更。在一九五三年，各高炉每季度（有时是每月）修订一次操作规程，修订的顺序已逐步形成一种制度，首先由炉的技术员会议提出，经炉的生产会议讨论通过，再拿到厂的技术委员会审查修改，最后由厂长批准施行，这就保证了操作规程的群众性和正确性。夏季雨水多空气密度小，是炼铁减产的季节，由于我们认真制订并实行了夏季操作规程，产量不但没有降低，反而提高了。
    先进的生产计划是建立在技术改进的基础之上的。高炉焦炭烧得多铁才出得多，于是，多烧焦炭就成为全厂技术改进的中心课题了，根据苏联炼铁的先进经验，必须搞好炉顶布料。在一年来高炉操作的实践中，我们基本上弄清了料线的高低，装料的先后，单装与双装等装料方法对高炉顺行的影响，因而我们创造了适用于我厂设备与操作条件的炉顶布料调剂法，使烧焦炭的数量达到预期的数字，而且大大提高了每吨焦炭的出铁量，这个重大成就可以和往年取得的三大技术成就——使用烧结矿，冶炼低矽铁，使用全风量——相并列。
    这些技术改进，最初都是订在年度的技术组织措施计划内的。
    除了领导上的组织工作之外，全厂浓厚的技术研究空气和职工技术理论水平的提高，使这些技术措施的实现更有了保证。为了提高工人的技术水平，炼铁厂举办了冶炼和机电技术学习班，全厂工人无例外地参加了学习。为了提高工人出身的技术员的水平，炼铁厂开办了工人技术学校，系统地讲授操作理论。对于工程技术人员，则通过一系列的生产和技术研究会议，如每周开技术会讨论或总结技术操作，定期召集各高炉技术员会议研究提高生产的途径，按月做出生产总结报告，以培养和提高技术人员具体分析生产操作的能力。为了培养新的技术干部，我们普遍推行了师徒合同，并举行了技术观摩操作。一九五二年中，全厂各高炉有将近三分之二的新干部掌握了高炉的操作技术。在旧的高炉上从工人提升的技术员也一天天增多了。技术干部的迅速成长，是生产不断向前发展的动力。
    充分发挥新设备的作用
    一个新设备的开工到它的正常生产，对操作人员是个严重的考验。鞍钢炼铁厂一九五三年有一座高炉进行大修，另一座高炉进行炉身换砖的中修，两座机械化自动化的高炉开工。在进行这些复杂的新的技术工作中，我们还存在很多漏洞和缺点，需要今后去改进，但总的说来，我们基本上是比较成功的。
    新炉的开工首先得解决技术力量的问题，开工之前三个月，我们就从旧有的炉子上把人员调齐，预先把技术员和工人都分班，并确定了小组的干部和组织，然后让他们去学习，学习的内容包括岗位责任制，新设备的构造和理论，以及实际的试运转。在训练工人的时间，也把厂里的专职工程师组成了开炉小组，建立开工的责任制度，例如炉前技师担负着炉前工作的总责任，备品材料的准备、工人的训练、设备的维护等他都要考虑得很周密。此外瓦斯、原料等每一工种都有一个技术精通的总负责人去指导，这就保证了组织上和技术上的周密性。
    在开工和生产的技术操作上，学习了苏联的先进经验，采取了快速烘炉法，烘炉时间较过去减少了四分之三，开工规程也基本上根据苏联的技术标准制订出来，这些规程事先都经过充分的学习与讨论。
    上述的工作都被排列在开工的指示图表上，这些工作的收效使烘炉开工时间平均缩短了百分之七十，每吨铁消耗焦炭量降低了百分之四十六，给更完满的开炉烘炉规程提供了丰富的经验。
    从开工走向正常生产，需要更稳当更细心的工作。老工人吴德全学习的成绩很好，但操作了几天就把电炮头烧坏一个。实际操作告诉我们，掌握这种新设备不是那样简单，各种各样的故障，从前未见过未听到过的，都会接二连三地出现，我们特别着重地抓紧了事故的分析与追究。比如电炮未安上钩就打泥，结果泥打不进去，反使炮退了回来，它的原因是操作人员看不见挂钩，于是就给他们安上信号，并拿这些具体事例来教育所有的工人。为了使新设备能更正常地进行工作，又有计划地建立了细致的设备维护制度，如规定配管工每次出铁前拧电炮油盒，第一炉前工清扫电炮的配电盘等。由于这些努力，使新设备很快达到了正常的作业率，如七号高炉开工后第十天就超过了设计标准，并陆续创造了三次新纪录，容积利用系数比较八号高炉得到更好的成绩。
    七号高炉和八号高炉的开工生产，使我们已拥有基本掌握新技术的全套工人和技术人员，全套新设备的维护制度和使用规程，这给将来五号高炉和六号高炉的开工准备好更完备的条件。
