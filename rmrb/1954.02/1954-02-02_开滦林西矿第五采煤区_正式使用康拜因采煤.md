    Kailuan Linxi Mine's Fifth Coal Mining District
    Officially Uses Combine Coal Mining

    From December 16th of last year, the 6571 working face in the Fifth Coal Mining District of Kailuan Linxi Mine in Tangshan officially started using the "Combine" (combined coal mining machine) for coal extraction. When the workers first saw the "Combine" extracting coal in their own mine, they happily burst into applause. Some workers said, "In the past, one person could only load thirty tons of coal per shift, and it was exhausting. Now, with the 'Combine,' we can extract up to five hundred tons of coal a day!" The young "Combine" driver, Cong Wenqi, said, "When we use the 'Combine' to extract more coal, we are promoting the progress of the motherland and accelerating the country's socialist industrialization." Before using the "Combine," Linxi Mine made many preparations. In September of last year, a training class for "Combine" workers was established. After twenty-five days of specialized study, nineteen outstanding workers and cadres initially mastered the operating techniques of the "Combine." In the first week before going underground, the Party Secretary and the Mine Director also held continuous meetings with technicians to study various aspects of the use of the "Combine" at the working face, such as labor organization, cycle charts, electromechanical transportation, and work plans.

    开滦林西矿第五采煤区
    正式使用康拜因采煤
    唐山开滦林西矿第五采煤区六五七一掌子从去年十二月十六日起，正式使用“康拜因”（联合采煤机）采煤了。当工人们第一次看到“康拜因”在自己的矿内采出煤时，都高兴得鼓起掌来了。有的工人说：“从前咱们一个人一班才装三十吨煤，还累得够呛；现在有了‘康拜因’，一天最多就能采五百吨煤呢！”年轻的“康拜因”司机从文起说：“我们用‘康拜因’采出更多的煤来，就是推进祖国前进，就是在加速国家的社会主义工业化。”在没有使用“康拜因”前，林西矿就做了很多准备工作。去年九月份开办了一个“康拜因”工作人员训练班，十九名优秀的工人、干部经过二十五天的专门学习，初步掌握了“康拜因”的操纵技术。在下井前的头一个星期，该矿党委书记和矿长又连续召开了技术人员会议，研究了使用“康拜因”的掌子的劳动组织、循环图表、机电运输和工作计划等各方面的问题。　（原化周）
