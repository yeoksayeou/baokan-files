    How the CPC Feixi County Committee Led the Pilot Work of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Yu Ming
    The CPC Feixi County Committee in Anhui Province recently piloted nine agricultural production cooperatives. In the pilot work, the County Committee always adhered to the principle of "active leadership, steady progress," and basically implemented the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. Therefore, the cooperative establishment work proceeded relatively smoothly.

    In the process of leading the cooperative establishment work, the Feixi County Committee grasped the following main links:

    Summarizing experiences and lessons, formulating cooperative establishment plans, and carefully selecting and approving pilot objects
    In the past two years, the Feixi County Committee had successively piloted eight agricultural production cooperatives and achieved certain successes and experiences. However, in the beginning, due to the lack of clear guidelines for establishing cooperatives, there were varying degrees of impatience and recklessness, as well as laissez-faire tendencies, which led to detours in the cooperative establishment work. Before this round of cooperative establishment, the County Committee carefully summarized past experiences and lessons. Based on the foundation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the county and the new situation in which the enthusiasm of the peasant masses for mutual aid and cooperation had greatly increased after the general line education, it cautiously formulated a plan to pilot fifty-seven agricultural production cooperatives in two batches. The first batch piloted nine cooperatives. In terms of specific practices, it accepted past experiences and lessons and stipulated the following: 1. It is necessary to conduct serious investigation and understanding and carefully select, examine, and approve pilot objects according to the three conditions: the masses have the desire to establish cooperatives; there are strong leading cadres; and there is a good foundation for mutual aid. It is necessary to avoid blindly establishing cooperatives and also to prevent those who can establish cooperatives from not doing so. 2. In the pilot cooperatives, it is necessary to thoroughly carry out the general line education, explain the policies, cultivate and utilize backbone elements, conduct in-depth publicity and mobilization, do a good job in ideological preparation, dispel concerns, and truly achieve complete voluntary participation; in terms of the scale of cooperative establishment, it is necessary to control it according to specific conditions such as the leadership ability of the backbone elements and the foundation of mutual aid, and generally pilot it according to the original scale of the mutual aid group to prevent blind expansion. 3. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, hand over the policies to the masses, and solve the specific problems of joining the cooperative through full democratic discussion.

    In the past, the Feixi County Committee had problems due to the lack of careful and meticulous selection of pilot objects. For example, one pilot cooperative had to be suspended midway because the masses did not actually have the desire to establish a cooperative, and it was only discovered after the pilot started that the conditions were not sufficient. This time, the County Committee emphasized that it must conduct in-depth investigation and research and do a good job in preparation. It transferred ten county and district agricultural association cadres to go deep into the mutual aid groups that wanted to establish cooperatives for ten days to get to the bottom of the situation, and also held a special investigation and research meeting. After careful examination, it approved the pilot objects.

    Repeatedly publicizing policies, old cooperatives teaching new cooperatives, cultivating backbone elements, and doing a good job in ideological preparation
    The experience of the Feixi County Committee proves that if the ideological preparation is not mature enough, and people are forced to join the cooperative, it is impossible to consolidate the organization of the cooperative. The Shi Yuankuan cooperative, which was piloted the year before last, collapsed last year, and three-quarters of the members of the Yuanjiacai cooperative withdrew. The main reason was that it violated the principle of voluntary participation in the organization. Therefore, in this leadership of the cooperative establishment work, special attention was paid to grasping this link of publicity work. The methods of repeated education and persuasion and the demonstration method of "old cooperatives teaching new cooperatives" were adopted. Publicity was carried out in the group from the beginning of the investigation of cooperative establishment objects. The specific methods were: further implementing the general line education, and publicizing the principle that "mutual aid groups are stronger than individual work, and cooperatives are better than mutual aid groups" from the perspective of summarizing production, enlightening the masses to establish cooperatives, and cultivating and utilizing backbone elements. Policies were thoroughly publicized through accounting, comparison, and methods such as chatting and explaining, to dispel concerns such as fearing losses after joining the cooperative. A training class for cooperative establishment backbone elements was also held, where representatives of old cooperatives introduced the specific practices of establishing cooperatives according to the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, and the production increase achievements after establishing cooperatives. Then, the cadres led the backbone elements of each cooperative to learn from the experience of the old cooperatives, combine it with their own situation, do detailed accounting, and teach the backbone elements the specific practices of establishing cooperatives. After the backbone elements returned, they assisted the cadres in conducting publicity, going from the group to the family through group member meetings and family meetings, so that everyone understood the specific practices of establishing cooperatives and the spirit of the voluntary participation and mutual benefit policy. Because these methods were adopted, and backbone elements were cultivated and utilized, the publicity of policies was relatively thorough, and complete voluntary participation was achieved, laying an ideological foundation for solving the specific problems of establishing cooperatives. In the past, when establishing cooperatives, many members followed others to join the cooperative, but they were not clear about the benefits of joining the cooperative. They did not do accounting when they joined the cooperative, and when they felt that they were at a disadvantage in the distribution of income, they clamored to withdraw from the cooperative. This time, not only did the general members understand the principle of taking the bright road of socialism by participating in the cooperative, but they also understood the mutual aid and cooperation policy, and recognized the superiority of the cooperative from the production increase examples of the old cooperatives. In addition, they also strengthened their confidence in establishing cooperatives by doing detailed accounting to prove that they would not suffer losses after joining the cooperative. For example, Wang Zhihong of the Xiaofanshang Agricultural Production Cooperative (formerly Cao Zongcang Group) was concerned that his income distribution would be small after joining the cooperative because he had more land and less labor. Although he signed up to join the cooperative, the knot in his heart was not untied. After he participated in the training class and listened to Hu Zizhang Cooperative (old cooperative) introduce the income situation of the cooperative member Jie Muqiao (a household with a lot of land and little labor), he contacted his own situation and did an accounting. His land was assessed to produce about forty-five piculs of rice. Under normal harvest, according to the four-labor-six-land distribution ratio, the land share could get eighteen piculs. He himself could get twelve piculs for labor as he did last year, his wife could get ten piculs for labor slightly weaker than him, and his son could get eight piculs for herding cattle, adding up to forty-eight piculs of rice. Not only would he not suffer losses, but he could also earn three piculs more than before joining the cooperative. Only then was he relieved. When he returned, he also helped Weng Liangzhu do detailed accounting, which also dispelled his concerns about suffering losses.

    Handle affairs according to the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, hand over policies to the masses, and solve specific problems of joining the cooperative through democratic discussion
    When the cooperative establishment work entered the second step, dealing with the assessment of land for shareholding, the distribution ratio of land and labor income, the accumulation of public property, and production investment and other specific issues, the Feixi County Committee, based on past experience, emphasized that it must adhere to the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit. It must be based on the characteristics of collective operation of agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of private property. When dealing with specific issues, it must simultaneously take into account both the private and cooperative nature contained in the cooperative, so as to ensure that all members can obtain reasonable benefits and that it is conducive to the development of production. In terms of methods, it is necessary to master and utilize backbone elements, hand over policies to the masses, and solve problems through full democratic discussion. In this way, the deviations that have occurred in the past in the cooperative establishment work, especially in dealing with various issues of joining the cooperative, can be avoided; and the specific issues of joining the cooperative can be steadily resolved on the basis of ideological mobilization. In the spring of last year, when the county piloted cooperatives, the leaders' grasp of policies was unstable and they lacked reasonable methods, which resulted in serious phenomena of being too high or too low in the assessment of land for shareholding. For example, the land assessment of the Kong Lingfa Cooperative was more than 10% lower than the general harvest, and the land assessment of the Yuanjiacai Cooperative was generally 25% to 30% higher than the general harvest when it expanded last year. The Wang Shouyun Cooperative argued for eight days before resolving the land assessment for shareholding. However, in this cooperative establishment work, because the cadres grasped the principle of taking care of the reasonable interests of all members and being conducive to the development of production, and the method was to first find standard fields (land), appropriately divide grades, and then implement land queuing according to standards, and then report and discuss publicly according to the size of the area, distance, difficulty of cultivation, and water conservancy conditions, and democratically assess the average annual output and convert it into land shares to join the cooperative, the assessment of production for shareholding was generally smoother because the method was fair and reasonable and the masses' ideological preparation was mature. For example, the Xiaofanshang Cooperative, with ten households and one hundred and nineteen acres of land, only took one and a half days to complete the assessment of production for shareholding. In dealing with the issue of the distribution ratio of land and labor income, the Feixi County Committee also took detours in the cooperative establishment work in the spring of last year. At that time, due to insufficient understanding of the transitional nature of agricultural production cooperatives, it subjectively and prematurely decided on a too-large distribution ratio of labor remuneration, and called on all pilot cooperatives to distribute income according to the ratio of seven labor and three land, which resulted in the masses being unwilling to accept it and then changing it to the ratio of six labor and four land. The Feixi County Committee accepted this lesson, and this year, when leading the solution of this problem in the cooperative establishment work, it handled it with the spirit of gradually and steadily increasing labor remuneration under the principle of taking care of both households with more labor and less land and households with less labor and more land not suffering losses. Through democratic discussion, seven of the nine cooperatives distributed income according to the ratio of six labor and four land, and one cooperative distributed income according to the ratio of five and a half labor and four and a half land for general members. Among them, one household had more land and particularly little labor. In order to ensure that it would not reduce its actual income after joining the cooperative, it was allowed to distribute income at a ratio of five labor and five land through democratic discussion. Another cooperative adopted the method of fixed rent and contracted output to distribute income.

    In handling the issues of accumulating public property and production investment, the Feixi County Committee also did a relatively steady job this year. In the cooperative establishment work in the year before last and the spring of last year, cadres formed the coercive order phenomenon of depreciating and joining the cooperative for all cultivated animals and large-scale farm implements when leading and handling this issue because they did not conscientiously implement the principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, which caused some members to suffer losses and planted the roots of the inability of the cooperative organization to consolidate. This time, in the nine pilot cooperatives, the use and remuneration of the cultivated animals and farm implements owned by the members were handled according to the specific situation, according to the principle of neither causing all members to suffer losses nor causing the owners of cultivated animals and farm implements to suffer losses. Through democratic discussion, various different forms were adopted to handle them. Among the nine cooperatives, seven cooperatives had accumulated some public property in the mutual aid group. When this issue was discussed this time, the owners of cultivated animals and large-scale farm implements voluntarily depreciated and joined the cooperative, and the depreciation was carried out at a fair price agreed upon by both parties, and was stipulated to be paid off within one to two years according to the members' repayment ability. One cooperative decided not to depreciate and join the cooperative for cultivated animals and large-scale farm implements for the time being, and solved it by renting them. Another cooperative decided to depreciate and join the cooperative for cultivated animals and large-scale farm implements after the autumn harvest, or the cooperative would buy them publicly, but they would still be privately owned, the cattle would be rented by the cooperative and raised by special personnel, and the large farm implements would be used and repaired publicly, and kept by themselves.

    中共肥西县委是怎样领导试办农业生产合作社工作的
    余明
    中共安徽省肥西县委最近试办了九个农业生产合作社，在试办工作中，县委始终掌握了“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，基本上贯彻了自愿互利的原则，因此，办社工作也进行得比较顺利。
    肥西县委在领导办社工作的过程中，抓住了以下的几个主要环节。
    总结经验教训、订出办社计划、慎重地选择和批准试办对象
    肥西县委在两年来，曾经陆续试办过八个农业生产合作社，取得了一定的成绩和经验，但起初由于办社方针不够明确，也产生了不同程度的急躁冒进和放任自流现象，在办社工作中走过一段弯路。这次办社前，县委认真地总结了以往的经验教训，根据本县互助合作运动的基础和进行总路线教育后，农民群众互助合作的积极性大为提高的新情况，慎重地订出分两批试办五十七个农业生产合作社的计划。第一批先试办了九个社。在具体做法上，接受以往的经验教训，规定了：一、必须经过认真的调查了解，按照：群众有办社要求；有较强的领导骨干；原来互助基础较好等三个条件，慎重地选择、审查、批准试办对象，既不盲目办社，又不使可办者不办。二、在试办社中，要透彻地进行总路线教育，讲明政策，培养和运用骨干分子，深入宣传动员，做好思想酝酿工作，解除顾虑，真正做到完全自愿入社；在办社规模方面，要根据骨干领导能力、互助基础等具体条件来控制，一般按原有互助组规模试办，防止盲目扩大。三、必须坚持自愿互利原则，把政策交给群众，通过充分的民主讨论来解决入社的各项具体问题。
    肥西县委在过去的办社工作中，由于选择试办对象不够慎重细致，曾经出了一些毛病，如有一个试办社，因群众实际上还没有办社要求，开始试办后才发现条件不够，只好中途停办。这次办社，县委强调必须深入调查研究做好准备工作，抽调了县、区农会干部十人，以十天时间，深入要办社的互助组摸底，并专门召开了调查研究会议，经过慎重的审查才批准试办对象。
    反复宣传政策，老社教新社，培养骨干，做好思想酝酿工作
    肥西县委的经验证明：如果思想酝酿不够成熟，勉强入社，就不可能使社的组织巩固。前年试办的史元宽社在去年垮台，袁家才社有四分之三社员退社，主要原因就是违反了组织起来的自愿原则。因此，在此次领导办社工作中，特别注意掌握宣传工作的这一环节。采用了反复教育说服和“老社教新社”的示范方法。从调查办社对象时开始，就在组内进行宣传。具体做法是：进一步贯彻总路线教育，并从总结生产入手宣传“互助组强似单干，合作社比互助组更好”的道理，启发群众办社要求，并培养和运用骨干分子，通过算账、对比，用漫谈、讲解等办法来透彻地宣传政策，解除怕入社吃亏等顾虑。又举办了办社骨干分子训练班，由老社代表介绍按自愿互利原则办社的具体做法和办社后的增产成绩。接着干部就领导各社骨干分子，根据老社经验，结合本身情况，算细账、打谱子，教会骨干分子办社的具体做法。骨干分子回去后，再协助干部进行宣传，通过组员会、家庭会，从组里讲到家里，使大家都领会办社的具体做法和自愿互利政策精神。由于采用了这些办法，培养和运用了骨干分子，因此宣传政策比较透彻，做到了完全自愿入社，打下了解决办社各项具体问题的思想基础。往年办社时，有不少社员是跟着别人入社的，究竟入社后有什么好处却并不清楚，入社时不算账，到收益分配时感到吃亏就吵着要退社。这次办社，一般社员不但认识了参加合作社走社会主义光明大路的道理，而且懂得了互助合作政策，并从老社的增产榜样中，认识了合作社的优越性，此外还通过算细账，证明入社后不会吃亏，因而坚定了办社的信心。如小畈上农业生产合作社（原曹宗仓组）的汪志红，因土地较多，劳动力较少，顾虑入社后收益分配少，虽然报名入社，心里的疙瘩却没有解开，他参加训练班后，听胡子章社（老社）介绍该社社员解慕樵（土地多劳动力少的户）的收入情况后，他就联系本身情况，算了一笔账，他土地评产约四十五石稻谷，一般年成照地四劳六分配收益比例，土地股能得十八石，他自己照去年那样劳动，劳动力能得十二石，他妻子劳动力比他稍弱些能得十石，儿子放牛能得八石，加起来就是四十八石稻谷，不但不吃亏，还能比入社前多收三石，这样他才放心了，回去他还帮翁良珠算了细账，也解除了他怕吃亏的顾虑。
    根据自愿互利原则办事，把政策交给群众，通过民主讨论解决入社各项具体问题
    在办社工作进入第二步骤，处理土地评产入股、土地和劳动力的分配收益比例、积累公共财产、生产投资等各项具体问题时，肥西县委根据以往经验，强调必须坚持自愿互利原则，要根据农业生产合作社在私有财产的基础上集体经营的特点，在处理各项具体问题时，必须同时照顾合作社所包含的私有的和合作的这两方面的性质，做到照顾全体社员都能获得合理利益，并且有利于发展生产。在方法上要掌握和运用骨干分子，把政策交给群众，通过充分的民主讨论来解决问题。这样，就避免了以往在办社工作中特别是在处理入社各项问题上所产生的一些偏向；就能在思想发动的基础上，稳步地解决入社的各项具体问题。该县去年春天试办社时，由于领导干部掌握政策不稳和缺乏合理的方法，以致在处理土地评产入股问题上，曾经产生严重的偏高偏低现象。如孔令法社土地评产要低于一般年成一成多，袁家才社去年扩社时，土地评产普遍比一般年成高二成半到三成，汪守蕴社为土地评产入股，争吵了八天才解决。但在这次办社工作中，由于干部掌握了照顾全体社员都能获得合理利益和有利于发展生产的原则，在方法上是先找出标准田（地）适当划分等级，然后按标准实行土地站队，再按面积大小、位置远近、耕作难易、水利条件等自报公议，民主评定常年产量，折成土地股入社。由于办法公平合理，群众思想酝酿成熟，所以一般评产入股都较顺利。如小畈上社十户，一百十九亩土地，只评一天半就完成了评产入股工作。在处理土地、劳动力的分配收益比例问题上，肥西县委在去年春天的办社工作中也走过弯路，当时由于对农业生产合作社过渡性质认识不足，主观地过急过早地决定劳动力报酬过大的分配收益比例，号召各试办社都按劳七地三比例分配收益，结果因群众不愿接受再改为劳六地四比例分配收益。肥西县委接受了这一教训，今年在办社工作中领导解决这一问题，是在照顾劳动力较多土地较少和劳动力较少土地较多的户都不吃亏的原则下，逐步地稳妥地提高劳动报酬的精神来处理的，九个社分别通过民主讨论，有七个社是按劳六地四比例分配收益的，有一个社是一般社员按劳五点五、地四点五比例分配收益，其中有一户因土地较多劳动力特少，为保证其入社后不减少实际收入，经民主讨论，允许他以劳五地五比例分配收益。还有一个社是采用定租包产的办法分配收益。
    在处理积累公共财产和生产投资的问题上，肥西县委今年做得也比较稳当。在前年和去年春季的办社工作中，干部在领导处理这问题时由于没有认真贯彻自愿互利原则，就形成耕畜、大型农具一律折价入社的强迫命令现象，使一部分社员因此吃亏，种下合作社组织不能巩固的病根。这次在九个试办社里，对于社员所有的耕畜和农具的使用和报酬，是根据具体情况，按既不使全体社员吃亏、又不使耕畜和农具的所有者吃亏的原则，通过民主讨论、采用各种不同的形式来处理的，在九个社中，有七个社原来在互助组时就积累了部分公共财产，这次讨论到这问题时，耕畜及大型农具的所有者又自愿折价入社，就按双方都同意的公正价格来折价，并根据社员的偿还能力，分别规定在一年到两年的时间内还清。有一个社决定耕畜、大型农具暂不折价入社，以租用办法来解决。另一个社决定耕畜和大型农具到秋收后再折价入社，或由社公买，目前仍归私有，耕牛由社租用、专人喂养，大农具公用公修，自行保管。
