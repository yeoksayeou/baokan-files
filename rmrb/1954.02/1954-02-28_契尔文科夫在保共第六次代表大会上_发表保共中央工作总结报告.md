Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, February 25th: The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Vulko Chervenkov, delivered a work summary report of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party at the morning session of the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party on February 25th.

The first part of Chervenkov's report concerned the international situation and Bulgaria's foreign policy. When discussing foreign policy, Chervenkov stated that People's Democratic Bulgaria is inextricably linked to the democratic socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The struggle for peace has always been the primary task of our Party and People's Government. During the period covered by the summary report, the Communist Party and the People's Government devoted all their efforts to consolidating Bulgarian-Soviet friendship. This friendship is the heart and soul of Bulgarian national independence, the foundation of the people's progress, freedom, and happiness, and the basis for the socialist development of our motherland. The Party and the government now and in the future, will support the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy as strongly as they support their own policies, and will support the Soviet Union's efforts to ease international tensions. The Party and the government have consistently worked with the Soviet Union in the struggle against the imperialist warmongers who incite new world wars, for peace and security, and for international cooperation and mutual understanding. When discussing Bulgaria's relations with capitalist countries, Chervenkov said that the Party and the government advocate maintaining normal relations with them and developing trade. He said it must be emphasized again that our government is willing to improve relations with its Western and Southern neighbors. Obstacles hindering the establishment and development of good-neighborly relations and normal trade ties must and should be removed. Chervenkov pointed out that relations with Greece and Yugoslavia have recently improved. Diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Greece are expected to be restored soon. The People's Government is now fighting for peace, and will continue to do so in the future, because the People's Republic of Bulgaria and our people have always advocated peace. Therefore, our country believes that we have the legitimate right to participate in the United Nations. We believe that we should be granted this right, and therefore firmly demand, and will continue to demand, Bulgaria's participation in the United Nations.

Chervenkov said that the Party's tasks in foreign policy are:

	I. Continue to develop and consolidate the friendship with the great Soviet Union, which is the foundation and firm guarantee of our country's freedom, national independence, and socialist development.

	II. Consolidate the fraternal ties and cooperation with the people's democratic countries and the peoples of the democratic camp.

	III. Continue to fight for peace and for the peaceful resolution of international disputes, and vigorously support the Soviet Union's peaceful policy.

	IV. Continue efforts to normalize relations with neighboring capitalist countries and develop business ties with other capitalist countries.

When discussing the domestic situation in Bulgaria and the tasks of the Communist Party, Chervenkov said: The period covered by the summary report is of particularly significant importance in terms of domestic economic development. During this period, there was an unprecedented leap forward in the development of our country's productive forces, and a major step forward towards socialism was taken. Chervenkov cited some materials to prove the comprehensive upsurge of Bulgaria's national economy during the period covered by the summary report. He pointed out that the changes in the ratio between the total output value of industry and the total output value of agriculture are as follows: in 1939, the total output value of industry was 33.8, and the total output value of agriculture was 66.2; in 1948, industry was 50.7, and agriculture was 49.3; in 1952, industry was 66.6, and agriculture was 33.4. Chervenkov continued, the ratio of the total output value of industry and agriculture in 1952 irrefutably proves that our country has changed from a backward agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country. The production of means of production (Department I) accounted for 23 percent of industrial production in 1939, and by 1953, according to preliminary statistics, it accounted for 40.6 percent.

Chervenkov then said that our country is realizing socialist industrialization. The capitalist elements in industry have been almost completely squeezed out. Socialist industry is the only form of industry in Bulgaria. Bulgarian agriculture has fundamentally turned to the road of cooperative transformation. The basic masses of poor and middle peasants, especially the basic masses of poor and middle peasants in various grain-producing areas of the country, have joined agricultural production cooperatives. By 1952, the cultivated area of cooperatives accounted for 60.5 percent of the country's cultivated area, and the number of peasant households participating in cooperatives accounted for 52.3 percent of the country's peasant households. The grain problem has been solved. This problem was solved by relying on agricultural production cooperatives, state farms, and machine tractor stations, from which the state obtained two-thirds of the total grain supply.

The social structure of domestic trade has fundamentally changed. In 1952, state-owned and cooperative trade accounted for 99.3 percent of the country's total commodity circulation, while private trade accounted for only 0.7 percent.

In this way, fundamental changes have taken place in our country's society and culture. The cooperative system (agricultural production cooperatives) has become dominant in rural areas. At this Sixth Congress, our Party announced that the tasks stipulated in the National Economic Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) have been completed. Most of these tasks were completed in four years. These tasks were able to be completed thanks to the constant and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the tireless labor of Bulgarian workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and the correct policies and great organizational role of the Party and the state. The foundation of socialism has been established in Bulgaria. Conditions have been created for our country to rapidly develop along the road of socialism and to greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people. Chervenkov then spoke in detail about the development of Bulgaria's industry, agriculture, trade, transportation, and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people, and also talked about the shortcomings in the development of the national economy and the tasks of eliminating these shortcomings.

Chervenkov made a detailed analysis of the issue of further consolidating Bulgaria's people's democratic system. He said that our people's democratic state is growing and developing day by day, becoming a powerful, dynamic, and peace-loving country. In the history of Bulgaria, there has never been a regime as powerful, as dynamic, and as consolidated as our people's democratic regime today. The more the economic foundation of the state—the ownership of socialist means of production—develops and consolidates, the stronger and more consolidated the state will become. Our experience proves that the people's democratic regime of the working class in alliance with the working peasants successfully fulfills all the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, it can victoriously build socialism. Our experience proves that the people's democratic system is a social and state system with incomparable superiority compared to the capitalist system. The economic-organizational and cultural-educational functions of our country are expanding day by day.

When discussing the increasingly consolidated spiritual and political unity of the working people, Chervenkov said that the entire historical experience of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Communist Party, as well as our own experience, confirms the Marxist-Leninist principle that under the conditions of the transition period from capitalism to socialism, the more the socialist system is consolidated, the more the foundation of capitalist elements is weakened and approaches extinction, then the more intense and frantic the resistance of capitalist elements will be. Therefore, we must wage a long-term and relentless struggle against those enemies who vainly attempt to restore the past with the help of their foreign protectors and vainly attempt to restore capitalism in our country. The more victoriously socialism advances in our country, the more hatred the hostile elements will harbor. Therefore, the struggle to raise vigilance is one of the basic tasks of the Party, the state, and economic and cultural organizations.

Chervenkov said that the main tasks of the Party in domestic policy are:

	I. Organize and guide the people's peaceful construction labor, so that they can complete and over fulfill the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy (1953-1957), and victoriously solve the central task of this plan—to increase the actual income of workers, staff, and peasants, strengthen housing construction, and further develop national education, health care, socialist science, culture, and art, so as to greatly improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

	II. Continue to develop heavy industry, especially the power industry and the coal mining industry, eliminate the phenomenon of insufficient coal and electricity supply in the country, vigorously develop geological exploration work to identify our country's natural resources, ensure the maximum development of the production of consumer goods, strive to improve labor productivity, produce high-quality and diverse goods, strengthen economic accounting and production discipline, eliminate the phenomenon of uneven production, complete production plans on time in accordance with various regulations, and constantly reduce product costs to ensure the continuous reduction of retail prices of goods.

	III. Ensure the further upsurge of agriculture, eliminate the phenomenon that agriculture lags behind the level of industrial development, especially the phenomenon of the backwardness of animal husbandry, and therefore it is necessary to solve the feed problem, ensure the completion of the main tasks of agriculture—continuously improve the income of crops and animal husbandry, increase the number of livestock, so as to ensure that the country's residents can obtain sufficient food, and ensure that the light industry obtains sufficient raw materials; vigorously strengthen agricultural production cooperatives, state farms, and machine tractor stations, improve the material and cultural living standards of the members of agricultural production cooperatives, and enable them to live a prosperous life.

	IV. Ensure the further and comprehensive improvement of state-owned trade and cooperative trade, so as to better and more comprehensively meet the growing needs of the working people.

	V. Practice strict economy in all departments of the national economy and all administrative departments.

	VI. More broadly and fully give play to the creative initiative of the working people, launch socialist emulation, promote the Stakhanovite method of work, and carry out the rationalization proposal movement.

	VII. Further strengthen state discipline, oppose bureaucracy, oppose the attitude of indifference to the people, enhance the sense of responsibility to the state and the people, and complete one's tasks accurately and on time.

	VIII. Vigorously consolidate the social system and state system of people's democracy, promote the spirit of democracy in our entire social life, absorb more working people to manage the state, educate the working people to love the motherland, continue to strengthen Bulgarian-Soviet friendship and international solidarity, and consolidate the growing spiritual and political unity of our working people.

	IX. Continue to strengthen our country's national defense strength, strengthen our motherland's army and security organs, and enhance vigilance against the enemy.

Chervenkov pointed out the firm unity of the Communist Party in the Party section. He said that the inseparable unity of our entire Party, the increasingly close ties between the Party and the people, the growing trust and love of the people for the Party, and the unwavering loyalty of the Party and the people to Bulgarian-Soviet friendship are the foundation of all the achievements that have been obtained. In the early stages of the period covered by the summary report, our Party exposed and crushed the traitorous group headed by Traicho Kostov, which was lurking within the Party. The struggle to annihilate this group tempered our Party, and the vigilance shown by the Party made the Party stronger, more experienced, and more mature, and made the Party more ruthless in treating its own shortcomings. At the time of holding the Sixth Party Congress, the Party has been greatly strengthened and has become a Leninist party. The Party has proven that it is capable; relying on the initiative and unwavering support of the working people, it correctly and victoriously leads the state and the national economy; the Party's cadres and organizations have grown up, and are increasingly strengthened ideologically and politically, becoming experienced, wise, and reliable leaders of the working people.

Chervenkov then talked in detail about carrying out criticism and self-criticism, strengthening Party and state discipline, promoting inner-Party democracy and collective leadership. He also talked about correctly promoting cadres, strengthening the Party organization and the ties with the working people, and ideological work.

In the final part of the report, Chervenkov said that everyone sees that we have achieved great achievements, but there are also some shortcomings and individual mistakes. We must not let victory make us dizzy in any way. We never conceal our shortcomings and mistakes, but fight to correct these shortcomings and mistakes, and must eliminate them to clear the way for greater achievements. Chervenkov finally shouted:

	Long live the invincible Bulgarian Communist Party!
	Long live the Fatherland Front!
	Long live the strong and unbreakable Bulgarian-Soviet friendship!
	Unwaveringly follow the invincible doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, be loyal to the legacy of Georgi Dimitrov, and advance towards new victories!

    契尔文科夫在保共第六次代表大会上
    发表保共中央工作总结报告
    【新华社讯】塔斯社索非亚二十五日讯：保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记伏·契尔文科夫在保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会二十五日上午会议上，作了保加利亚共产党中央委员会工作总结报告。
    契尔文科夫报告的第一部分是国际局势和保加利亚的外交政策。契尔文科夫在谈到外交政策时说：人民民主保加利亚是和以苏联为首的民主社会主义阵营不可分地联系着的。争取和平的斗争一直是我们党和人民政府首要的任务。在总结报告所谈到的时期中，共产党和人民政府用全力巩固了保苏友谊，这种友谊是保加利亚民族独立的心脏和灵魂，是人民进步、自由和幸福的基础，是我们祖国社会主义发展的基础。党和政府现在和将来都要和支持自己的政策一样地竭力支持苏联的和平外交政策，支持苏联对缓和国际紧张局势所作的努力。党和政府一直和苏联协同努力，为反对煽动新的世界大战的帝国主义战争贩子、争取和平和安全、争取国际合作和互相谅解而进行斗争。契尔文科夫在谈到保加利亚和资本主义国家的关系时说，党和政府主张和它们保持正常的关系，主张发展贸易。他说，必须再次着重指出，我们政府愿意改善与西方及南方邻国的关系。必须而且应该消除阻挠着建立和发展善邻关系和正常贸易联系的障碍。契尔文科夫指出，最近，与希腊和南斯拉夫的关系已有改善。保希的外交关系可望于最近恢复。人民政府现在在为和平而斗争，将来也是一样，因为保加利亚人民共和国和我们人民素来是主张和平的。因此我们国家认为我们有参加联合国的合法权利。我们认为我们应得到这种权利，因此坚决要求，并将继续要求让保加利亚参加联合国。
    契尔文科夫说，党在外交政策方面的任务是：
    一、继续不断地发展并巩固与伟大的苏联的友谊，这是我国的自由、民族独立、社会主义发展的基础和坚强的保证。
    二、巩固与人民民主国家、与民主阵营的各国人民兄弟般的联系和合作。
    三、继续为和平、为和平解决国际争端而斗争，大力支持苏联的和平政策。
    四、继续努力，使和资本主义邻国的关系正常化，发展和其他资本主义国家的事务联系。
    契尔文科夫在谈到保加利亚国内情况和共产党的任务时说：在国内经济发展方面，总结报告所谈到的时期是一个意义特别重大的时期。在这个时期中，我国生产力的发展有了空前的跃进，已向社会主义跃进了一大步。契尔文科夫引述了一些材料，证明在总结报告所谈到的时期中保加利亚国民经济的全面高涨。他指出，工业总产值和农业总产值对比的变化的情形是：一九三九年工业总产值为三十三点八，农业总产值为六十六点二，一九四八年工业为五十点七，农业为四十九点三，一九五二年工业为六十六点六，农业为三十三点四。契尔文科夫继称，一九五二年工农业总产值对比的情形无可辩驳地证明了，我国已由落后的农业国变成了工业—农业国。生产资料（第一部类）的生产在一九三九年占工业生产的百分之二十三，到一九五三年，据初步统计已占百分之四十点六。
    契尔文科夫接着说，我国正在实现社会主义工业化。工业中的资本主义因素几乎完全被排挤出去了。社会主义工业是保加利亚的唯一形式的工业。保加利亚的农业已根本转向合作化的改造道路。贫农和中农的基本群众，特别是在全国各个产谷区的贫、中农基本群众，都参加了农业生产合作社。到一九五二年，合作社的耕地面积占全国耕地面积百分之六十点五，参加合作社的农户占全国农户的百分之五十二点三。粮食问题已经解决了。这个问题是依靠农业生产合作社、国营农场、机器拖拉机站解决的，国家从它们那里得到的粮食已占全部粮食供应的三分之二。
    国内贸易的社会结构已经根本改变。在一九五二年，国营和合作社的贸易占全国总商品流通量的百分之九十九点三，而私营贸易只占百分之零点七。
    这样，我国的社会和文化已经发生了根本的变化。合作社制度（农业生产合作社）已在农村中占统治地位。在这次第六次代表大会上，我们党宣布，国民经济五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）所规定的任务已经完成了。其中大部分任务是四年完成的。这些任务之所以能完成，是由于苏联的经常的、无私的援助，是由于保加利亚工人、农民和知识分子的不倦的劳动，是由于党和国家的正确的政策和巨大的组织作用。保加利亚已经建立起了社会主义的基础。已为我国沿着社会主义的道路迅速发展、为大大提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平创造了条件。契尔文科夫接着详尽地谈到保加利亚工业、农业、贸易、交通的发展情况及劳动人民的物质和文化水平的提高情况，并谈到国民经济发展中的缺点和消除这些缺点的任务。
    契尔文科夫就进一步巩固保加利亚的人民民主制度这一问题作了详细的分析。他说，我们的人民民主国家正在日益成长和发展，成为一个强大的、活力充沛的、爱好和平的国家。在保加利亚历史上，从来没有一个政权，像我们今天的人民民主政权这样强大，这样具有活力和这样巩固。国家的经济基础——社会主义生产资料的所有制愈发展和愈巩固，国家就将变得愈壮大和愈巩固。我们的经验证明：和劳动农民结成联盟的工人阶级的人民民主政权，顺利地实现着无产阶级专政的全部职能，也就是说它可以胜利地建成社会主义。我们的经验证明，人民民主制度和资本主义制度比较起来，它是具有不可比拟的优越性的社会和国家制度。我们国家的经济—组织和文化—教育的职能正日益得到扩展。
    契尔文科夫在谈到日益巩固的劳动人民的精神上和政治上的团结一致时说，苏联和苏联共产党的全部历史经验以及我们自己的经验，都证实了马克思列宁主义这一原理，这就是：在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期的条件下，社会主义制度愈巩固，资本主义分子的基础愈削弱和愈接近灭亡，那么资本主义分子的反抗就愈激烈和愈疯狂。因此我们必须和那些妄想在他们外国保护者的帮助下恢复过去的时代、妄想使资本主义在我国复辟的敌人进行长期和无情的斗争。社会主义在我国愈益胜利地前进，敌对分子就愈加仇恨。因此为提高警惕性而斗争是党、国家、经济和文化组织的基本任务之一。
    契尔文科夫说，党在国内政策方面的主要任务是：
    一、组织并指导人民的和平建设劳动，使他们完成和超额完成发展国民经济第二个五年计划（一九五三——一九五七年），并胜利地解决这个计划的中心任务——增加工人、职员和农民的实际收入，加强住宅建筑，进一步发展国民教育、保健事业、社会主义科学、文化和艺术，以大大提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平。
    二、继续发展重工业，特别是电力工业和采煤工业，消除全国煤和电力供应不足的现象，全力发展地质勘探工作，以查明我国的天然资源，保证最大限度地发展消费品的生产，尽力提高劳动生产率，生产质量高、种类多的商品，加强经济核算制和生产纪律，消除生产不均衡的现象，遵照各种规定按时完成生产计划，不断减低产品成本以保证不断减低商品的零售价格。
    三、保证农业进一步高涨，消除农业落后于工业发展水平的现象，特别是饲畜业落后的现象，因而必须解决饲料问题，保证完成农业的主要任务——不断地提高农作物和饲畜业的收入、增加牲畜头数，以保证全国居民能获得足够的粮食，保证轻工业获得足够的原料；全力加强农业生产合作社、国营农场和机器拖拉机站，提高农业生产合作社社员的物质和文化水平，使他们过富裕的生活。
    四、保证进一步全面改善国营贸易和合作社贸易，使之更好、更全面地满足劳动人民不断增长的需求。
    五、国民经济各部门和各行政部门厉行节约。
    六、更广泛更充分地发挥劳动人民的创造性主动性，展开社会主义竞赛，推广斯大哈诺夫式工作方法和开展合理化建议运动。
    七、进一步加强国家纪律，反对官僚主义，反对对人民漠不关心的态度，提高对国家、对人民的责任感，及时准确地完成自己的任务。
    八、全力巩固人民民主的社会制度和国家制度，发扬我们整个社会生活中的民主精神，吸收更多的劳动人民来管理国家，教育劳动人民热爱祖国，继续加强保苏友谊和国际团结，巩固我国劳动人民不断成长的精神上和政治上的团结一致。
    九、继续加强我国的国防力量，加强我们祖国的军队和保安机关，提高对敌人的警惕。
    契尔文科夫在党的部分中指出了共产党的坚强团结一致。他说，我们全党不可分割的团结，党和人民日益紧密的联系，人民对党日益增长的信任和爱戴，党和人民对保苏友谊不可动摇的忠实，是一切已获得的成就的基础。还在总结报告所谈到的时期中的初期，我们的党就揭露并粉碎了潜伏在党内的、以特·科斯托夫为首的叛徒集团。歼灭这一集团的斗争锻炼了我们的党，党所表现出来的警惕使党变得更为强大，更有经验，更加成熟，使党更加无情地来对待自己的缺点。在现在举行第六次党代表大会的时候，党已经大大加强了，成为一个列宁式的政党。党已经证明它是有能力的；依靠着劳动人民的积极性和不可动摇的支持，它正确地和胜利地领导着国家和国民经济；党的干部和组织已经成长起来了，而且在思想和政治上日益加强，成为劳动人民的有经验的、英明的和可信赖的领导者。
    契尔文科夫接着详细谈到了开展批评和自我批评、加强党和国家纪律、发扬党内民主和集体领导的问题。他还谈到正确推选干部、加强党组织和劳动人民的联系以及思想工作等问题。
    契尔文科夫在报告的最后部分中说，大家看到，我们获得了巨大的成就，但是还有着某些缺点，也有个别的错误。我们无论如何不应让胜利冲昏我们的头脑，我们从来不掩饰我们的缺点和错误，而是为改正这些缺点和错误而斗争，必须消除它们，为获得更大的成就扫清道路。契尔文科夫最后高呼：
    战无不胜的保加利亚共产党万岁！
    祖国阵线万岁！
    坚强和牢不可破的保苏友谊万岁！
    毫不动摇地遵循战无不胜的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说，忠于格奥尔基·季米特洛夫的遗训，向新的胜利前进！
