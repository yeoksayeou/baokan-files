    The Hungarian national mixed football team, after arriving in Shanghai on the 22nd, held its first friendly football match with the Huadong mixed football team at the Hongkou Stadium in Shanghai on the 23rd.
    In the afternoon, the stands were filled with over 22,000 sports enthusiasts, soldiers, workers, students, government officials, and citizens from various places. Heads of the Huadong and Shanghai municipal Party and government organs, as well as consuls general from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, India, and other countries stationed in Shanghai, also attended to watch. The "August 1st" football team, the Central Institute of Physical Education football team, the China Railway Sports Association football team, the Naval Sports Team, the Northeast Military Region Sports Team, the Southwest Military Region Sports Team, the Huadong Military Region Sports Delegation, and sports delegations from various provinces and cities in Huadong all came to observe and learn.
    From the start of the match, the competition between the two sides was extremely intense. The Huadong team shot at the goal twice within five minutes, but both were blocked by the opposing goalkeeper. Then, the Hungarian team switched to offense, with their center forward Szojka dribbling the ball along the sideline and closely approaching the Huadong team's goal. Huadong team goalkeeper Zhang Banglun撲 blocked the shot, but as soon as he threw the ball out, Szojka, with an extremely swift movement, seized the opportunity to shoot it into the net. This was the 15th minute after the start of the match. From then on, the competition between the two sides became even more fierce. The Hungarian team shot the ball out of bounds several times, and the Huadong team also launched several fierce attacks, but none were successful. At the end of the first half, the Hungarian team led by one to zero.
    The situation in the second half was even more intense. The Hungarian team used accurate short passes, combined with long shots, to attack the goal more than ten times, but all were cleverly saved by the Huadong team's goalkeeper and defenders. Ten minutes before the end of the match, the Hungarian team's center-back Vadász cleverly took a quick shot, and the ball entered the net from the lower right corner of the Huadong team's goal. The entire audience applauded enthusiastically for the Hungarian team's superb technique. In the last two minutes, the Huadong team conceded another goal. As a result, the Hungarian team won by three to zero.
    At the end of the match, the entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically for this wonderful performance. (Xinhua News Agency)

    匈牙利足球队和华东队在上海举行友谊赛
    匈牙利国家足球混合队在二十二日到达上海后，二十三日和华东足球混合队在上海虹口体育场举行首次足球友谊比赛。
    下午，场内看台上坐满着来自各地的体育爱好者、战士、工人、学生、机关干部和市民共二万二千多人。华东和上海市党政机关首长和苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、印度等国驻上海总领事等也到场观看。“八一”足球队、中央体育学院足球队、中国火车头体育协会足球队、海军体育工作队、东北军区体育工作队、西南军区体育工作队、华东军区体育参观团和华东各省市体育代表团等都前来观摩学习。
    比赛一开始，双方的争夺就显得极其紧张。华东队在五分钟内曾两次射门，都被对方守门员挡回。接着匈牙利队就转入进攻，该队中锋苏查从边线带球紧叩华东队的球门，华东队守门员张邦纶扑出接球，他刚把球掷出，却被苏查以极其迅速的动作，乘势疾射入网，这时是比赛开始后第十五分钟。从此双方争夺更为剧烈，匈牙利队几次射门越界，华东队也猛攻了几次，但各无所获。上半时结束时，匈牙利队以一比零占先。
    下半时比赛情况更为紧张。匈牙利队运用准确的短传，配合远射，攻门达十多次，都被华东队守门员和后卫机智地救出险球。到终场前十分钟，匈牙利队中卫瓦达奇巧妙地急射一球，球从华东队球门右下角入网。全场观众对匈牙利队这一精湛技术报以热烈鼓掌。最后二分钟时华东队又失一球。比赛结果，匈牙利队以三比零获胜。
    比赛结束时，全场观众起立为这场精彩表演热烈鼓掌。　（新华社）
