    The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry Sets This Year's Plan
    To Increase Fuel Industry Production and Strengthen Basic Construction Work
    [By this newspaper] The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has tentatively finalized the production and basic construction plan for 1954. This plan is formulated based on the Party's general line during the transition period and the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan. The various economic and technical indicators stipulated in the plan are all a step higher than in 1953. The concrete implementation of this plan will powerfully guarantee the continuous development of heavy industry and the establishment of new industrial bases, and correspondingly supply the needs of transportation, transportation, and people's lives. This plan was formulated by the workers and staff of the fuel industry system's grassroots factories and mines based on state-controlled figures, which were then accurately calculated, reviewed, summarized, and formulated by the various professional management bureaus.
    In terms of production, the total industrial output value of the fuel industry system in 1954 will increase by 19.12% compared to 1953. Among them, coal will increase by 13.03%, electricity will increase by 14.76%, and oil will increase by 50.88%. Calculated by the output of major products, raw coal will increase by 12.83% compared to 1953, washed coal will increase by 66.35%, power generation will increase by 14.69%, crude oil will increase by 50.66%, gasoline will increase by 50.2%, kerosene will increase by 54.81%, and diesel will increase by 27.5%.
    In the increase production and practice economy campaign in 1953, the fuel industry system continuously unleashed the potential capabilities of enterprises and carried out uninterrupted struggles against the conservative thinking of some factories and mines that emphasized unfavorable factors, adopted backward quotas, and "held back a hand," creating favorable conditions for the formulation of the 1954 plan. For example, the main reason why coal production can be increased this year is by relying on improving the production capacity of existing mines. Fushun and Kailuan alone will increase production by more than 3 million tons this year compared to 1953. The power industry, on the one hand, relies on increasing new equipment, and on the other hand, continues to give play to the potential of existing equipment, carrying out planned unified maintenance, adjusting loads, and solving the problem of power balance. Since the successful eastward transportation of crude oil, the petroleum industry has not only greatly improved the equipment utilization rate of refineries in East China and Northeast China, but will also make the crude oil production of the Yumen Mining Bureau more rational.
    In terms of basic construction, the state's investment in the fuel industry system this year has increased by 32.17% compared to 1953, the vast majority of which is directly used for various industrial constructions. And the investment in various new construction projects in the coal and electricity industries accounts for more than half of the total investment in industrial construction. In the basic construction investment of the petroleum industry, nearly half of the investment will be used for geological drilling and surveying projects; this year, the petroleum system's drilling tasks will increase by 55.2% compared to 1953. After carrying out geological surveys, geological drilling, geological measurements, trenching and detailed investigation, re-examination, and other work in the coal mine industry this year, it is expected that more than one billion tons of buried reserves will be identified.
    This year, the fuel industry system will have five pairs of vertical shafts, four pairs of inclined shafts, more than ten thermal and hydro-power generators, and more than twenty oil wells completed and put into production. At the same time, many reconstruction and expansion projects can be completed. Therefore, the fuel industry's production capacity this year will increase significantly compared to last year. The increase in coal volume is equivalent to 16% of last year's output. The increase in power generation capacity is equivalent to 17.2% of the existing equipment, and the proportion of the increase in crude oil production capacity is even greater. In addition, in terms of hydropower resources, vigorous surveying work will also be carried out on the Yellow River, Xin'an River, northern Yunnan, Han River, Luan River, and other rivers, and technical and economic investigation reports will be made on the Xin'an River, southern Jiangxi, and northern Yunnan rivers.
    These basic construction works are all to prepare the necessary fuel and power for ensuring the needs of various heavy industries and for expanding existing industrial bases and establishing new industrial bases. For example, the vast majority of basic construction work in coal mines is to find, confirm, and develop coking coal and general industrial coal. In order to cooperate with the expansion of a certain industrial base in North China, the power industry is successively installing considerable power generation equipment.
    The various economic and technical indicator plans determined by the fuel industry system this year in terms of production and basic construction have all strictly adhered to the principle of average advanced quotas, and therefore have taken a step higher than in 1953. The degree of mechanization of coal mine production, the proportion of new coal mining methods, the equipment utilization rate of electricity, the various refining rates of petroleum, and the utilization rate of shale have all been improved. The ash content of raw coal, the standard coal consumption rate of electricity, and the plant electricity consumption rate have all been reduced. As a result, production costs will also be greatly reduced. Various cost quotas for basic construction have also been reduced, among which the unit cost of various well diameters and roadways of coal mine vertical shafts has been reduced by 14.91% to 36.6%. The installation cost of power stations, substations, transmission lines, etc. has been reduced by a maximum of 21%. The speed of oil well drilling has increased by 38.3%. The increase in the volume of various projects in the fuel industry in 1954 will greatly exceed the proportion of the increase in national investment.
    On the basis of production development, the fuel industry system will use about 8% of the total investment in the fuel industry this year to build employee housing and health care projects, so that the material and cultural living standards of employees will be appropriately improved with the development of production.

    中央燃料工业部订出今年计划
    提高燃料工业生产、加强基本建设工作
    【本报讯】中央燃料工业部已初步确定一九五四年的生产和基本建设计划。这个计划是根据国家在过渡时期的总路线及第一个五年计划的任务制订出来的。计划中规定的各项经济技术指标，都比一九五三年提高了一步。这个计划的具体实施，将有力地保证重工业的不断发展及新工业基地的建立，并相应地供应交通、运输和人民生活的需要。这个计划是由燃料工业系统各基层厂矿职工根据国家控制数字进行了精确计算，又由各个专业管理总局审核汇总制订出来的。
    生产方面，一九五四年燃料工业系统工业总产值将比一九五三年增长百分之十九点一二。其中煤增长百分之十三点零三，电增长百分之十四点七六，石油增长百分之五十点八八。就各项主要产品产量计算，原煤将较一九五三年提高百分之十二点八三，洗煤提高百分之六十六点三五，发电量提高百分之十四点六九，原油提高百分之五十点六六，汽油提高百分之五十点二，煤油提高百分之五十四点八一，柴油提高百分之二十七点五。
    燃料工业系统在一九五三年增产节约运动中，不断发挥企业的潜在能力，并和某些厂矿强调不利因素，采取落后的定额以及“留一手”等保守思想进行了不间断的斗争，给制订一九五四年计划创造了有利的条件。例如，煤的产量今年所以能提高的主要原因，是依靠提高原有矿井的生产能力，仅抚顺、开滦两个单位，今年就将比一九五三年增产三百万吨以上。电力工业一方面依靠增加新的设备，一方面继续发挥原有设备的潜力，有计划地统一检修，调整负荷，解决电力平衡问题。石油工业自从原油东运成功后，不仅使华东、东北等地炼油厂的设备利用率大大提高，同时也将使玉门矿务局原油生产更加合理。
    在基本建设方面，今年国家对燃料工业系统的投资比一九五三年增加了百分之三十二点一七，其中绝大部分直接用于各项工业建设。而煤、电工业中各项新建工程的投资，又占工业建设总投资的半数以上。石油工业基本建设投资中，将有近半数的投资使用在地质钻探及勘测工程上；石油系统今年的钻探任务比一九五三年将增加百分之五十五点二。煤矿工业今年进行地质调查、地质钻探、地质测量、槽探及精查、复查等工作以后，预计将可查明埋藏量十多亿吨。
    今年燃料工业系统将有五对竖井、四对斜井、十多台火力及水力发电机和二十多口石油井建设完成并投入生产，同时还有不少改建、扩建工程可以竣工，因此，今年燃料工业生产能力将比去年增长不少。煤增长数量，相当于去年产量的百分之十六，发电容量增长的数量，相当于现有设备的百分之十七点二，原油生产能力增长的比重更大。此外，在水力资源方面，还将大力进行黄河、新安江、滇北、汉水、滦河等河流的勘测工作，并将作出新安江、赣南和滇北等河流的技术经济调查报告。
    这些基本建设工作，都是为了保证各种重工业发展的需要，为了扩大原有工业基地和建立新的工业基地所需的燃料动力做好准备。如煤矿方面的基本建设工作，绝大部分都是为了找寻、证实及开发炼焦煤与一般工业用煤。电力工业为了配合华北某工业基地的扩大，正在陆续安装相当大的发电设备。
    燃料工业系统今年在生产和基本建设方面确定的各项经济技术指标计划，都严格掌握了平均先进定额的原则，因此，比一九五三年提高了一步。煤矿生产的机械化程度、新法采煤比重、电的设备利用率、石油的各种炼率和页岩利用率都提高了。原煤灰分、电的标准煤耗和厂用电率都降低了。因之生产成本也将大大降低。基本建设各项成本定额也都降低了，其中煤矿竖井各种井径以及井巷等单位造价降低了百分之十四点九一到百分之三十六点六。发电站、变电站、输电线路等安装费最多的降低了百分之二十一。石油钻井速度提高了百分之三十八点三。一九五四年燃料工业各项工程量的增加将大大超过国家投资增加的比例。
    在生产发展的基础上，燃料工业系统今年将以燃料工业总投资的百分之八左右的资金，修建职工住宅及卫生保健等工程，使职工物质生活和文化生活水平，随着生产的发展适当地提高一步。
