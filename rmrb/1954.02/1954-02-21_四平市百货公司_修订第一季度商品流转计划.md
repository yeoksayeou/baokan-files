Siping City Department Store
Revises First Quarter Commodity Circulation Plan

The entire staff of the Siping City Department Store in Liaoxi Province, based on studying the General Line, discussed the first quarter's commodity circulation plan.

The focus of this plan discussion was on how to effectively carry out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce by state-owned commerce during the transition period, how to meet the needs of the vast rural areas, cooperate with the state's procurement of agricultural products, and ensure the supply of materials to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, during the discussion, everyone carefully and meticulously studied the changes in the needs of urban and rural people, especially the increase in rural purchasing power, and repeatedly supplemented and revised the original plan. For example, for socks, the original plan proposed by the wholesale store was 5,000 dozens, but after discussion by the staff, it was proven that the plan was too small and was revised to 7,000 dozens. The plans for gauze, food, and other items were also revised after studying historical materials and the estimated increase in people's purchasing power this year. The staff has great confidence in completing and exceeding the plan.

Currently, the First and Second Stores have begun to improve retail work. The wholesale store, in coordination with the propaganda and education on grain purchase and the General Line, has formed a mobile commodity exhibition, which tours to various grassroots cooperatives and rural areas. The staff of each store has also enthusiastically launched a labor competition.

    四平市百货公司
    修订第一季度商品流转计划
    辽西省四平市百货公司全体职工，在学习总路线的基础上，讨论了第一季度的商品流转计划。
    这次讨论计划，是以如何做好国营商业在过渡时期对私营工商业的社会主义改造、如何满足广大农村需要、配合国家收购农产品、做好物资供应以巩固工农联盟为中心进行的。因此，在讨论当中，大家都非常认真、周密地研究了城乡人民需要的变化，特别是农村购买力的增长，对原计划进行了反复地补充和修改。如袜子一项，原来批发商店提出的计划是五千打，经过职工讨论，证明计划过小，又修改为七千打；纱布、食品等计划，也都是经过研究了历史材料和今年人民购买力提高的预计情况修订的。职工们对完成与超额完成计划的信心很高。
    目前第一、二商店已着手改善零售工作。批发商店配合购粮和总路线的宣传教育，已组成游动商品展览会，到各基层合作社、农村巡回展览。各商店的职工，并热烈地展开了劳动竞赛。
