Guangdong Province Actively Pilots Agricultural Cooperatives

    In accordance with the spirit of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference held by the CPC South China Sub-bureau last November, various regions in Guangdong Province are actively piloting agricultural production cooperatives, combining this with current production work.

    The province originally planned to pilot more than 160 agricultural production cooperatives this year, but after the publicity of the general line, the farmers' enthusiasm for organizing has greatly increased, and the cadres' understanding of the direction of rural work has also become clearer. Therefore, by the beginning of February, the number of agricultural production cooperatives piloted in the province had increased to 204.

    After the grain purchase work was completed, various regions in Guangdong fully turned to establishing cooperatives. Local Party committees first trained the backbone and activists for establishing cooperatives, and then the backbone and activists used methods such as individual liaison and holding family meetings to conduct preparatory work for establishing cooperatives. In the work of establishing cooperatives in Liantang and Xiecun townships in Maoming County, the method of family meetings was adopted. By recalling comparisons and complaining about the suffering of the small-scale peasant economy, the peasants' awareness was raised, and everyone was willing to join the cooperative.

    Whether the cooperative can truly increase income is the biggest concern of farmers preparing to join the cooperative. In particular, farmers with less labor are more concerned that their income will decrease after joining the cooperative. Therefore, in the process of establishing cooperatives, in addition to conducting education on the two roads, various regions also used the method of carefully calculating accounts to dispel farmers' ideological concerns. After Chao'an County's Chihu Township calculated the income accounts of cooperative members, the masses' confidence in joining the cooperative was strengthened. Xie Kunhe, a poor peasant who was most lacking in labor, also said: "I calculated that I can earn 337 more jin after joining the cooperative." However, some farmers with a lot of labor also considered the issue of the way out for their labor force, fearing that there would be no work for the surplus labor after joining the cooperative. Middle peasant Xie Zao Song said, "It's good, but there is no work to do, unless you embroider flowers in the fields!" Therefore, some villages also conducted detailed calculations of the number of workdays required for land and sideline production. For example, the Xie Yueyi Agricultural Production Cooperative calculated that each labor force could do 111 workdays, with an average wage of 12.5 jin of grain per workday. After calculating these accounts, everyone felt relieved. He Yaoshi, a farmer in Shanghe Village, Yanggang Township, Qujiang County, was happy to calculate accounts for others everywhere. His wife originally opposed joining the cooperative, and scolded He Yaoshi when she saw him: "If you want to join the cooperative, we will separate." After calculating the accounts, she knew that joining the cooperative would not be a loss, and she said to everyone she met, "It turns out that the cooperative is so good, this time you can't drive me away."

    All regions have paid attention to combining the establishment of cooperatives with production. In the process of establishing the Wang Hanguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyang County, they collectively dug pond mud to improve the soil quality of 30 mu of land. Many farmers said enviously: "This is something that not only individual farmers, but even mutual aid teams cannot do." A woman in Ganglie Township, Yangjiang County, who was preparing to join the cooperative, had not yet understood the idea when she first heard everyone say that joining the cooperative could increase production. Later, she saw more than 30 people collectively digging pond mud to improve the soil quality of more than 10 mu of land, and also opening up 10 mu of wasteland. She then said, "Now I understand!" and actively requested to join the cooperative.

    Combining the establishment of cooperatives with production not only encouraged farmers preparing to join cooperatives, but also promoted the development of local mutual aid and cooperation and production work. For example, in the process of establishing cooperatives, Chihu Township in Chao'an County combined this with digging pond mud, which promoted the accumulation of 24,000 dan of pond mud throughout the township. Under the influence of the cooperative, in addition to restoring three mutual aid teams that had disbanded, the township also organized 13 new mutual aid teams, and another four are preparing to be established.

    广东省各地积极试办农业合作社
    广东省各地根据中共华南分局去年十一月召开的互助合作会议的精神，结合当前的生产工作，积极试办农业生产合作社。
    全省原来计划今年试办农业生产合作社一百六十多个，但经过总路线宣传后，农民组织起来的积极性大大提高了，干部对于农村工作的方向的认识也更加明确了，因此，到二月初，全省试办的农业生产合作社已增加到两百零四个。
    广东各地在购粮工作结束后，就全力转向办社。各地党委首先对建社骨干、积极分子进行了训练，然后由骨干、积极分子采取个别串连、召开家庭会议等办法，进行建社的酝酿工作。茂名县莲塘、谢村两乡在办社工作中，采取家庭会议方式，通过回忆对比、诉小农经济的苦，提高了农民的觉悟，做到了人人愿意入社。
    合作社是否能真正增加收入，是准备入社的农民的最大疑虑。特别是劳动力少的农民更耽心入社后收入减少。因此，各地在办社中，除了进行两条道路的教育外，并用算细账的办法，解除农民的思想顾虑。潮安县池湖乡算了合作社社员的收入账后，群众入社的信心就坚定了。最缺乏劳动力的贫农谢坤合也说：“我算起来，入社后可以多收入三百三十七斤。”但是有些劳力多的农民又考虑到劳动力的出路问题，害怕入社后剩余劳力没有工做，中农谢灶松说：“好是好，但无工可做，除非在田里绣花！”因此有些村庄又进行算土地、副业所需工数的细账。如谢岳意农业生产合作社算账结果，每个劳动力可做一百一十一个工，每工平均工资十二斤半谷。算了这些账，大家就放心了。曲江县阳岗乡上何村农民何耀石高兴得到处去替别人算账。他老婆原来是反对入社的，见何耀石就骂：“你要入社，我们就分家”。经过算账后，她知道入社不会吃亏，逢人便说：“原来合作社这样好，这回赶也赶不走我了。”
    各地在办社中都注意了和生产结合。揭阳县汪汉国农业生产合作社在办社过程中，就集体挑塘泥改良三十亩田的土质，许多农民羡慕地说：“这不要说单干农民，就是互助组也办不到。”阳江县岗列乡一个准备入社的妇女，开始听大家说入社能增产，思想还没有通，后来看到三十多人集体挑塘泥，改良了十多亩田的土质，还要开出十亩荒地，她才说：“现在我明白了！”便积极要求入社。
    办社结合生产，不但鼓舞了准备入社的农民，并且也推动了当地互助合作和生产工作的开展。如潮安县池湖乡在办社过程中结合挖塘泥，推动了全乡积下了塘泥二万四千担。在合作社影响下，该乡除恢复了三个已散伙的互助组外，还组织了十三个新的互助组，另外还有四个正在准备成立中。
