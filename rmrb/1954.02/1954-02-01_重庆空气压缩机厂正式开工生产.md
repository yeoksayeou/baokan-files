    Chongqing Air Compressor Factory Officially Starts Production

    [This newspaper dispatch] The first air compressor manufacturing plant in Southwest China—the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory—officially commenced production on January 15th. All employees of the factory held a grand opening ceremony on that day.

    The Chongqing Air Compressor Factory was converted from the former No. 614 Factory of the textile industrial system. The No. 614 Factory mainly manufactured cotton carding machines for the textile industry in the past. In July last year, according to the national construction plan, it was converted into the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory. In order to meet the needs of producing air compressors, necessary adjustments were made to the factory building equipment, installation design, and machine equipment arrangement on the basis of the original No. 614 Factory. Light railways were laid between the main production workshops and auxiliary production workshops to transport semi-finished and finished products produced in each workshop. Some major production workshops were equipped with electric traveling cranes and roof insulation devices, thus providing workers with better working conditions. At the same time, some new machines produced by the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries were purchased and allocated. These machines have high production efficiency, and the safety equipment is also very complete. For example, the Soviet drilling die boring machine has an accuracy of up to one-thousandth of a millimeter, which is equivalent to one-sixtieth of the thickness of a hair. The boring machine itself is also equipped with precision optical inspection equipment, which can directly inspect the accuracy of the processed products when boring machine parts and fixtures without the need to take other tools and fixtures to measure. At present, the design work for trial-producing air compressors has been basically completed, and the manufacturing work of tools and fixtures used for manufacturing various parts of air compressors is actively underway. The castings and forgings of the air compressor samples have also been completed. It is estimated that the first air compressor produced on a trial basis can be test-run by the end of March, and conclusions can be drawn regarding the machine's performance.

    An air compressor is a power mechanical equipment that uses compressed air as a motive power. Its main purpose is to supply various pneumatic tools as motive power. Using compressed air as power has greater advantages in some respects than using steam or electricity as power: for example, compressed air is suitable for long-distance transmission, and the pressure will not decrease; and it is not like electric drills that are prone to heat after being used for a long time, and there is no odor or smoke. Only one diesel engine is needed to drive it, which is of great benefit to reducing production costs and saving industrial electricity. Especially in places where there is no power generation equipment, air compressors have special value for promoting the automation of various construction works. Since liberation, although there are factories in other parts of my country that produce air compressors, the output still cannot meet the growing needs of national construction. The opening of the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory will play a certain role in the country's socialist industrialization.

### 重庆空气压缩机厂正式开工生产

    重庆空气压缩机厂正式开工生产
    【本报讯】西南第一座空气压缩机制造厂——重庆空气压缩机厂已于一月十五日正式开工生产。该厂全体职工于当日举行了隆重的开工典礼大会。
    重庆空气压缩机厂是由原纺织工业系统的六一四厂改建而成的。六一四厂过去主要是为纺织工业制造梳棉机，去年七月，根据国家建设计划，改建为重庆空气压缩机厂。为了适应生产空气压缩机的需要，在原六一四厂的基础上，对厂房建筑设备、安装设计、机器设备排列等方面作了必要的调整，并在各主要生产车间与辅助生产车间之间铺设了轻便铁道，以运输各车间生产出来的半成品与成品。某些主要生产车间则装设了电动行车、与屋顶的隔热装置，因而为工人提供了较好的劳动条件。同时，购置和调拨来部分苏联及人民民主国家出品的新式机器。这些机器都具有高度的生产效能，安全设备也很完善。如苏联钻模搪床，其精度可达到千分之一公厘，即相当于一根头发粗细的六十分之一。搪床本身并装有精密的光学检验设备，在搪制机件、夹具时，可以直接检验加工品的精度，而用不着另拿工具、卡具来测量。目前，试制空气压缩机的设计工作已基本结束，制造空气压缩机各种零件应用的工夹具的制造工作正在积极进行。空气压缩机样品的铸件及锻件也已全部完成，估计在三月底试制的第一台空气压缩机可以试车完毕，作出关于机器性能的结论。
    空气压缩机是利用压缩空气作原动力的一种动力机械设备。它的主要用途是供给各种风动工具做原动力。利用压缩空气作动力，比使用蒸汽或电力作动力，在某些方面有更大的优点：如压缩空气宜于远距离传送，而压力不会降低；又不像电钻用久易于发热，且没有气味和烟雾，使用时只要一个柴油引擎即可带动，对于降低生产成本和节约工业用电都有很大好处，特别是在没有发电设备的地方，空气压缩机对于促进各项建设工作的自动化更有其特殊的价值。解放以来，我国其他地方虽有生产空气压缩机的工厂，但产量还不能适应国家建设日益增长的需要。重庆空气压缩机厂的开工，将对国家社会主义工业化起到一定的作用。
