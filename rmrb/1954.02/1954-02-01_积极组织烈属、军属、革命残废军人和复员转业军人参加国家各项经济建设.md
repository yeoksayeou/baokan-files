Actively Organize Families of Martyrs, Military Dependents, Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers, and Demobilized and Transferred Soldiers to Participate in National Economic Construction

The Second National Civil Affairs Work Conference, after reviewing past work in accordance with the national general line, made important provisions for the future direction and tasks of preferential treatment work. The basic spirit of this provision is to actively organize the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers (hereinafter referred to as families of martyrs and military dependents), disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and various economic construction undertakings (of course, necessary substitute farming work and material assistance should not be neglected either). This is not only the fundamental way to solve their livelihood problems, but it is also closely related to the realization of the state's general line and general tasks during the transition period.

Families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers are a large productive force. Families of martyrs and military dependents have flesh-and-blood ties with the revolutionary ranks; disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers have received direct education and training from the People's Army and the revolutionary war, and many of them are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. They have superior conditions to become active participants in industrial and agricultural production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and various economic construction undertakings. Since its establishment, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has successively absorbed disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers, and the number has reached more than 10,000 to date. When they first joined the factory, most of them had a low level of education and had not received technical training. After several years of work experience, most of them have learned varying degrees of production technology or management skills. Some have taken up positions such as factory director, party committee secretary, and section chief, while others have become production models. On the agricultural production front, many families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers have also become production experts and models, and active participants in promoting mutual aid and cooperation. According to statistics from some old areas in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China in 1953, more than 70 percent of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers have been organized to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. In Handan County, Hebei Province, the proportion of families of martyrs and military dependents joining groups and cooperatives has reached 76.6 percent of the total number of families of martyrs and military dependents. These facts show that as long as we can carry out active education and organization work for the vast number of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, they will be able to move forward in the direction indicated by the general line and play a great role in the development of industrial and agricultural production and the entire socialist construction cause.

However, with the exception of some who have indeed lost their ability to work and cannot produce, there are still many families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers who are able to participate in labor but have not been organized into the production front, have not participated in agricultural mutual aid and cooperation and other great economic construction undertakings; they are still simply relying on substitute farming and material assistance to live. Why does this situation occur? From the perspective of local leading organs and cadres, some have not seen the importance of organizing production, and regard substitute farming and subsidies as the main aspect, or mechanically separate substitute farming and subsidies from organizing production. Some have not seen that with the development of mutual aid and cooperation and the change of the production system, many who were originally not considered labor force can now become labor force under scientific division of labor. The Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong County, Shanxi Province, assigned the old, weak, women and children and the disabled to do light labor in agriculture and sideline occupations, such as raising pigs and grinding tofu, which not only solved their livelihood, but also increased the income of the whole cooperative. Unfortunately, many places have not done this. Another situation is that some leaders lack democratic style and the habit of accepting criticism. When they see that families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers are willing to make suggestions to the leadership, they think that these people are "difficult to lead", so they do not actively organize them. In state-owned enterprises, many people overemphasize education level and technical conditions, and ignore the political advantages and the possibility of cultivation of this group of people, thus refusing to absorb them into work. Some even refuse to accept personnel who voluntarily joined the army before and have now returned after demobilization from their own factories, agencies, and schools. There are few demobilized and transferred soldiers in Guangzhou, which is relatively easy to resettle, but because the Labor Bureau and the Civil Affairs Bureau, Personnel Bureau and other agencies shirk responsibility to each other, it has not been completely resolved. On the side of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, there are indeed some people who have negative ideas of simply relying on substitute farming and subsidies; or have ideas of being meritorious and arrogant, lack the concept of the glory of labor; and are unwilling to go to the production front as pupils and accept the command of others. There is also a small number who originally had shortcomings in ideology and work style in the army, but are unwilling to transform their ideology and work style in new positions. Or they overemphasize personal interests and wishes, picking and choosing new jobs, and have been unable to make up their minds.

Solving this problem requires a two-pronged approach. In local leading organs, especially at the grassroots level and among cadres, universal education should be carried out so that everyone understands that families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers have contributed their efforts and shed their blood for the people in the revolutionary war. They are loyal to the cause of the Party and the people. The victory of the Chinese People's Great Revolution is inseparable from their self-sacrifice. Their loyalty in the revolutionary war will continue to manifest itself as a powerful force in the cause of national construction in the future. Therefore, organizing them to participate in industrial and agricultural production and in grassroots party and government work is not only necessary for solving their livelihood problems, but also necessary for realizing socialism. Therefore, no one is allowed to ignore this work on any pretext or for any reason. It should not be thought that organizing substitute farming and distributing subsidies is the end of the matter.

On the side of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, they should study the general line and the socialist future, raise their class consciousness and political enthusiasm, establish the idea of the glory of labor, overcome the sentiment of being meritorious and arrogant, consciously participate in production, mutual aid and cooperation, and economic construction undertakings, and fulfill their due and possible responsibilities in this great cause. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers should play an exemplary role in this regard. No matter what merits they had in the past, if they still have the ability to work but do not actively participate in labor, they will lose their glory. If they are unwilling to humbly learn from others in new jobs, they will not be able to make greater contributions to the country and the people, nor can they maintain their glory, let alone strive for greater glory.

The process of organizing families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas is also a process of conducting socialist education for them. In the past, due to the lack of this education, some people unconsciously took the wrong path, such as lending money at usurious rates and engaging in speculative business. As long as we conduct good education, make them understand the general line of the Party and the state, recognize the great future of socialism and the glorious responsibilities they should bear, and gradually organize them into mutual aid and cooperation organizations, their erroneous tendencies will surely be overcome. The recent conference of representatives of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers in eight special districts in Jiangsu Province conducted socialist education for more than 3,000 representatives. As a result, some people who had engaged in exploitation and speculation suddenly realized and made painful self-criticisms, gave up this behavior, and decided to participate in mutual aid and cooperation and sell surplus grain to the state. This is a clear example. At the same time, we must also educate farmers and rural cadres so that everyone takes a welcoming attitude towards families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and as far as possible, according to their physical strength and strengths, allocate appropriate work, and carefully cultivate them so that they can exert their strength. For land that should be farmed on behalf of them, mutual aid and cooperation movements should be combined as much as possible to cultivate them carefully so that they can obtain the general harvest of the local area. Some regions have already created successful experiences in this regard, and efforts should be made to promote them.

In cities, in addition to introducing fixed occupations to enterprises, agencies, and production departments, cooperative forms should also be adopted to help them engage in handicrafts with raw materials, sales channels, low capital, and high labor capacity, or simple and easy-to-learn processing industries, developing gradually from small to large. These cooperatives should be mainly run by themselves, rather than the government taking the money and hanging up a signboard of a martyrs' and military dependents' production unit, relying on others to produce, and earning money to support the families of martyrs and military dependents.

Civil affairs departments at all levels must pay attention to the use of preferential treatment funds. According to the work experience over the years, as long as this fund can be used in a focused and concentrated manner and used properly, it will play a great role in helping families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers solve production and livelihood difficulties and improve production morale. The practice of "average distribution and equal distribution" is that the money is spent, but the problem cannot be solved, but instead encourages dependence. It must be resolutely corrected.

The Spring Festival is approaching, and various regions and groups will organize comfort groups to conduct warm condolences to the sea, land, and air forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the schools for disabled revolutionary soldiers, the rehabilitation centers, and various hospitals for the wounded and sick. At the same time, the various general and sub-delegations of the Third Chinese People's Comfort Group to Korea will go to various parts of the country to report to the people and troops, agencies, and schools on the work of this comfort visit. Party and government leading organs at all levels should help the comfort groups do a good job in consoling and conveying reports, and through this condolence and transmission, make the activities of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families during the Spring Festival widely and deeply developed, so as to achieve greater and better results than in the past, in order to boost morale and strengthen our national defense forces.

### 积极组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人参加国家各项经济建设

    积极组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人参加国家各项经济建设
    第二次全国民政工作会议，在依据国家总路线检查了过去的工作以后，对今后优抚工作的方针和任务作了重要的规定。这一规定的基本精神，是积极组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属（以下简称烈属、军属）革命残废军人、复员转业军人参加生产，参加互助合作运动和各项经济建设事业（当然也不能忽视必要的代耕工作和实物补助）。这不仅是解决他们生活问题的根本道路，也是对国家过渡时期总路线总任务的实现有着密切关系的。
    烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人是一支人数众多的生产力量，烈属、军属和革命队伍有着血肉的联系；革命残废军人和复员转业军人受过人民军队的直接教育和革命战争的锻炼，他们之中有很多人是共产党员和青年团员。他们具有成为工、农业生产、互助合作运动和各项经济建设事业的积极分子的优越条件。鞍山钢铁公司从建厂时起就陆续吸收革命残废军人、复员转业军人参加工作，迄今已达一万余名。他们入厂时大多文化程度很低，没有受过技术训练。经过几年工作的锻炼，多数已学会了不同程度的生产技术或管理本领。有的担任了厂长、党委书记、科长等职务，有的成了生产模范。在农业生产战线上，也有不少的烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人成为生产能手和模范，成为推动互助合作的积极分子。华北、东北、西北的部分老区一九五三年统计，已经组织了百分之七十以上的烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人参加互助合作组织。河北省邯郸县烈属、军属入组入社的，已占到烈属、军属总人数的百分之七十六点六。这些事实说明：只要我们能对广大烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人进行积极的教育和组织工作，他们就能够按照总路线所指示的方向前进，在发展工农业生产和整个社会主义建设的事业中发挥很大的作用。
    但是，除了一些确实丧失了劳动力不能生产的以外，现在还有不少的能够参加劳动的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人没有被组织到生产战线上去，没有参加农业互助合作和其他经济建设的伟大事业；他们还在单纯地依靠代耕和实物补助过日子。为什么会发生这种情况呢？从地方领导机关和干部方面说，有的是没有看清组织生产的重要性，把代耕、补助看成了主要的方面，或者把代耕、补助和组织生产机械地割裂开了。有的是没有看到随着互助合作的发展和生产制度的改变，有许多原来不能算作劳动力的，现在在科学的分工之下就可以变成劳动力。山西大同县陈家庄农业生产合作社，把老弱妇孺和残疾者分配去作农、副业方面的轻劳动，如养猪、磨豆腐之类，一方面解决了他们的生活，一方面也使全社增加了收入。可惜许多地方还没有这样作。另外一种情形，是有些领导人缺乏民主作风和接受批评的习惯，看见烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人肯对领导提意见，就认为这批人“难领导”，因而不去积极组织他们。在国家企业部门，则有许多人过分强调文化程度和技术条件，忽视这一批人在政治上的优越条件和培养的可能，因而拒绝吸收他们参加工作。有的甚至连本工厂、本机关、本学校以前自动参军、现在复员归来的人员也不肯接受。广州市复员转业军人本来很少，比较容易安置，但因劳动局和民政局、人事局等机关互相推诿，所以一直得不到完全的解决。在烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人方面确实也有一些人抱有单纯依赖代耕和依赖补助的消极思想；或者有居功自傲的思想，缺乏劳动光荣的观念；不愿意到生产战线上去当小学生，接受别人的指挥。也有一小部分，是原来在部队时在思想作风上就有缺点，但又不愿意到新的岗位去改造自己的思想作风。或者是过分强调个人兴趣和愿望，对新的工作挑来拣去，一直打不定主意。
    解决这一问题要从两方面着手。在地方领导机关尤其是基层单位和干部人员中，应该进行普遍的教育，使大家了解：烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人是在革命战争中为人民群众出过力，流过血的。他们对党和人民的事业是忠实的。中国人民大革命的胜利，是和他们的自我牺牲分不开的。他们过去在革命战争中所表现的忠心，将在今后的国家建设事业中继续表现为强大的力量。因此，组织他们参加工农业生产，参加基层的党政工作，不仅是为解决他们的生活问题所必需，也是为实现社会主义所必需。因而决不允许任何人借口任何理由来忽视这一工作。也不应该以为组织了代耕、发放了补助就算完事。
    在烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人方面，应该进行总路线和社会主义前途的学习，提高阶级觉悟和政治热情，树立劳动光荣的思想，克服居功自傲的情绪，自觉地参加生产、参加互助合作与经济建设事业，在这个伟大事业中尽自己应尽的和能尽的责任。烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人中的共产党员和青年团员在这方面更应起模范作用。不管过去有过何等功劳，如果现在还有劳动力而不积极参加劳动，那就会失掉自己的光荣。不愿意到新的工作岗位上去虚心向别人学习，就不可能再对国家和人民作大的贡献，同样不能保持自己的光荣，更谈不到争取更大的光荣。
    在农村中组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人参加互助合作运动的过程，也是对他们进行社会主义教育的过程。过去由于缺乏这种教育，有一些人就不自觉地走错了道路，如放高利贷、作投机生意等。而只要我们进行了很好的教育，使他们了解了党和国家的总路线，认识了社会主义的远大前途和他们自己应该担负的光荣责任，把他们逐步组织到互助合作组织中，他们那种错误的倾向就一定能够克服。江苏省最近召开八个专区的烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人代表会议，对三千多名代表进行社会主义教育的结果，一些有过剥削、投机行为的人都恍然大悟，沉痛地作了检讨，放弃了这种行为，决心参加互助合作，并将余粮卖给了国家。这就是一个明显的例子。同时，我们也要对农民和农村干部进行教育，使大家对烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人参加互助合作组织采取欢迎的态度，并尽可能依据他们的体力和长处分配给适当的工作，用心加以培养，使他们能发挥力量。对于应该代耕的土地，应尽可能结合互助合作运动，认真耕好，使能获得当地一般收成。有些地区在这方面已经创造了成功的经验，应该设法推广。
    在城市里，除了向企业机关和生产部门介绍固定的职业外，还要采取合作社的形式，扶助他们从事有原料、有销路、用资金少、容劳动力多的手工业，或简单易学的加工工业，由小到大，逐步发展。这种合作社，应该主要由他们自己来办，而不是由政府拿上钱挂上个烈军属生产单位的牌子，靠旁人去生产，赚下钱来养活烈属、军属。
    优抚事业费的使用，各级民政部门必须加以重视。根据历年的工作经验，这笔费用只要能够有重点地集中使用，使用得当，对于帮助烈属、军属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人解决生产、生活困难和提高生产情绪，有很大作用。“平均发放、雨露均沾”的作法，则是钱也花了，问题也不能解决，反而助长依赖思想。必须坚决纠正。
    目前春节将届，各地区、各团体将组织慰问团，向中国人民解放军海、陆、空军各部队，中国人民志愿军、中国人民解放军公安部队、革命残废军人学校、教养院以及各伤病医院进行热烈的慰问。同时，中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团各总分团，将分赴全国各地向人民群众和部队、机关、学校作关于这次慰问工作的报告。各级党、政领导机关应该帮助各慰问团做好慰问和传达报告的工作，并通过这次慰问和传达，使春节时期的拥军优属活动得到广泛和深入的开展，做到比过去的成绩更大更好，借以鼓舞广大人民继续深入抗美援朝运动，做好优抚工作，以鼓励士气，增强我们的国防力量。
