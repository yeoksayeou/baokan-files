Xinhua News Agency, February 25th: The wheat and rapeseed crops in Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces are currently growing quite well. Farmers are strengthening field management to strive for increased production and support national industrial construction.

    In Anhui Province, there has been sufficient rain and snow since last winter and this spring. Most of the 39 million mu of wheat in the province and the rapeseed along the Yangtze River are growing luxuriantly. In the Huaibei area, which produces the most wheat, farmers are actively applying topdressing fertilizer to the wheat fields. According to incomplete statistics from five counties, including Fuyang, more than 900,000 mu of wheat fields have been topdressed. The wheat fields of the Wang Fengde Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhao Ji Township, Taihe County, received an average of 3,000 jin of topdressing fertilizer per mu, double the amount of last year. In the Wuhu area along the Yangtze River, 80% of the wheat fields have been hoed twice. The rapeseed in various places along the Yangtze River has also been hoed once or twice.

    In Zhejiang Province, the area planted with wheat, barley, rapeseed, broad beans, and green manure crops accounts for about 70% of the province's total cultivated land area. Currently, wheat and barley in the Wenzhou area of southern Zhejiang Province are already one chi to one chi five cun tall, while wheat and barley in other areas are also about five cun tall. Rapeseed is growing very well in all areas. Due to farmers actively strengthening field management, wheat and other crops throughout the province have been hoed once or twice, and in some cases three or four times or more. Generally, topdressing fertilizer has also been applied. Farmers are also paying attention to frost prevention and drainage, and have made preparations such as covering with grass, building up soil, and digging ditches.

    In Jiangxi Province, 2 million mu of rapeseed is now in full bloom, and increased production is expected. These rapeseed fields are distributed on the plains along Poyang Lake and along the Gan River and Fu River. In the past, local farmers mostly treated rapeseed as green manure, so cultivation management was very rough. This year, after realizing the significance of the People's Government's call to increase oil production, they actively carried out inter-tillage, weeding, and topdressing fertilizer application, which has resulted in good rapeseed growth.

    In Hunan Province, more than 2.8 million mu of rapeseed is also in bloom and is expected to be harvested in March. In the Tongchun embankment area of Hanshou County on the shore of Dongting Lake, more than 2,000 mu of rapeseed, after farmers drained standing water and thinned seedlings and applied topdressing fertilizer, is now in full bloom, and a bumper harvest is expected. In the 11th Township of the 1st District of Dayong County, more than 2,100 mu of rapeseed has been weeded once and topdressed once or twice, and is growing more robustly than in previous years.

    In Sichuan Province, more than 48 million mu of wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and other crops are showing a thriving scene. On the fertile Chengdu Plain, wheat has begun to joint, and rapeseed and broad beans are flowering and bearing fruit. In the warmer southern regions, wheat has already begun to head. Farmers in various regions are generally applying more fertilizer to wheat and rapeseed. Currently, wheat throughout the province has been fertilized two or three times, and rapeseed has been fertilized two to four times.

### 安徽浙江等省冬季作物生长良好

    安徽浙江等省冬季作物生长良好
    【新华社二十五日讯】安徽、浙江、江西、湖南、四川五省的小麦和油菜等作物，目前生长情况相当良好。农民们正在加强田间管理，争取增产，支援国家工业建设。
    安徽省去冬今春雨雪充足，全省三千九百多万亩小麦和长江沿岸地区的油菜，大多生长茂盛。产麦最多的淮北地区，农民纷纷对麦田施用追肥。据阜阳等五个县的不完全统计，施过追肥的麦田已有九十多万亩。太和县赵集乡王凤德农业生产合作社的麦田，平均每亩施追肥三千斤，比去年增加一倍。长江沿岸的芜湖专区，已有百分之八十的麦田锄过两遍。长江沿岸各地的油菜，也都锄过一遍到两遍。
    浙江省今年小麦、大麦、油菜、蚕豆和绿肥作物的面积，约占全省耕地总面积百分之七十上下，现在南部温州专区一带的小麦和大麦，已高达一尺到一尺五寸，其他地区的小麦和大麦也长到五寸左右。各地油菜都长得很好。由于农民积极加强田间管理，全省小麦及其他作物都锄过一遍到两遍，多的有三、四遍以上；一般的也都施过追肥。农民们并注意到防冻、排水，作了盖草、培土和铲沟等准备工作。
    江西省二百万亩油菜已普遍开花，增产有望。这些油菜田分布在鄱阳湖滨、赣江和抚河两岸的平原上。当地农民过去大多把油菜作为绿肥处理，因而耕作管理很粗糙。今年他们认识到人民政府号召增产油料的意义后，就纷纷进行了中耕锄草和施用追肥，使油菜很好的生长。
    湖南省二百八十多万亩油菜也已开花，预计三月间就可收获。洞庭湖滨的汉寿县同春垸二千多亩油菜，经过农民排除积水和疏苗、追肥后，目前菜花盛开，可望丰收。大庸县第一区第十一乡有二千一百多亩油菜锄过一遍草，施过一两次追肥，比往年生长茁壮。
    四川省四千八百多万亩小麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆等作物，正呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。在肥沃的成都平原上，小麦已开始拔节，油菜、蚕豆正在开花结实。南部地区气候较暖，小麦早已开始抽穗。各地农民普遍对小麦和油菜增施肥料。目前全省小麦已施肥两三次，油菜已施肥二次到四次。
