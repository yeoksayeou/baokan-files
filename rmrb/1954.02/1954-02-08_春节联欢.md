    Spring Festival Celebration
    Zhao Zhongxin
    During the Spring Festival, even the usually quiet Jingshan Park became lively. On the 4th, a constant stream of people flowed through the colorful eastern gate towards Jingshan Park, including soldiers from the capital's air defense forces, workers from the state-owned Factory 546, and students from Beijing Municipal Third Girls' Middle School. These people from different positions in combat, production, and learning were gathering here today for a joyful celebration.
    At noon, the sunlight became warmer, and the people participating in the get-together scattered around, starting free-ranging conversations. On a hillside covered with lush cypress trees, a group of a dozen or so people gathered, including soldiers, workers, and students. Labor model Xiao Liying was enthusiastically telling everyone about their factory's study of the General Line. Huang Tianyu, a platoon leader and meritorious hero from a certain unit's Second Company, and Cui Jinrong, a model student from Girls' Middle School No. 3, were listening attentively. Xiao Liying said, "Take Guo Yongshan, for example. He's an old fitter, and his past thinking was 'work for pay,' not caring about national affairs. He always thought about saving up more money to provide for his old age. After being educated about the General Line, he seemed to have become younger. He told everyone he met: 'Don't look at my age, I still want to see socialism!' When he saw the news in the newspaper about the purchase of economic construction bonds, he took out forty silver dollars that he had saved for many years to buy the bonds. He said to the workers: 'These forty silver dollars were originally for my old age, and I was never willing to use them. Now let them participate in national construction! As long as we have socialism, why should I be afraid of having no support when I get old?'"
    Meritorious hero Huang Tianyu had long wanted to share his feelings. As soon as Xiao Liying finished speaking, he interjected, "Before, my comrades and I also knew that there would be socialism in the future, but when would it come? We weren't sure. Everyone thought we were doing it all for the kids in the nurseries. After studying, oh! It turns out that socialism is not far away. We are all still young, and as long as we work hard, we can definitely catch up. Now, whether we are training or studying, our morale is even higher, and we all feel more hopeful." Huang Tianyu became more and more excited as he spoke: "When we see those buildings around our defense area rising higher and higher from the ground every day, we feel that our responsibility is also growing day by day. We think: The worker comrades are building socialism brick by brick, and we must improve our skills to firmly protect it!"
    Speaking to this point, Huang Tianyu patted Xiao Liying on the shoulder and said, "Old Xiao comrade, you worker comrades should build well! As long as you can build well, we can definitely protect it."
    Huang Tianyu's speech moved the female students. Model student Cui Jinrong said in a kind and touching tone: "The worker uncles are working hard to build the socialist motherland, and the Liberation Army uncles are guarding the socialist construction of the motherland day and night. We young people living in the Mao Zedong era are so happy. If we don't study hard, we will be letting down all the uncles. The study of the General Line has greatly improved the ideological understanding of our classmates. For example, Comrade Yang Guiqin, she used to be isolated, her study spirit was not concentrated, and she often failed exams. After studying the General Line, she suddenly became sad. She said: 'In the past, I was like a rusty piece of iron. The light of the General Line shone on me, and I felt warmth and shame. In the future, I am determined to remove the rust from my body and throw myself into the furnace of socialist construction, to refine myself into a piece of steel useful for socialist construction.' After that, Yang Guiqin became active in her studies, and her life became more active. She asked to act in plays, and she participated in group dances. She passed all her final exams." As Cui Jinrong was about to continue speaking, the loud voice of "The literary and artistic activities of the get-together begin" boomed from the microphone.
    At this time, the sun was already setting, and the wind became even more biting, but these builders and defenders of the motherland, present and future, sang and danced to their hearts' content with fiery hearts. (Attached picture)

    春节联欢
    赵忠信
    春节，幽静的景山也热闹起来了。四日上午，人流不断地通过东边的彩门向景山流去；有首都防空部队的战士，有国营五四六工厂的工人，还有北京市立第三女子中学的学生。这些在战斗、生产、学习等不同岗位上的人们，今天要在这里欢聚了。
    中午，阳光变得和煦起来，参加联欢会的人们散在各处，开始了自由漫谈。在长满翠柏的山坡上围了十几个人，有战士，有工人，也有学生。劳动模范萧立英正在兴高彩烈地向大家介绍他们厂里学习总路线的情形。某部二连排长、大功功臣黄天玉和女三中模范学生崔晋荣正在全神贯注地静听着。萧立英说：“例如郭永山吧，他是个老钳工，过去的思想是‘干活领薪’，不问国家大事。老是想多弄几个钱存起来，可以防老。经过总路线的教育后，他仿佛变得年轻了，他逢人就说：‘别看我上了几岁年纪，我还要看到社会主义哩！’当他看到报纸上公布了购买经济建设公债的消息时，他把自己积蓄多年的四十块银元拿出来购买了公债。他对工人们说：‘这四十块银元，原是我防备养老的，从来舍不得使，现在让它去参加国家建设吧！只要有了社会主义，还怕我老了无靠吗？’”
    大功功臣黄天玉早想说说自己的心情了，萧立英的话音刚落，他就插上去说：“以前，我和战友们也都知道将来会有社会主义，但什么时候才有呢？没准。大家认为现在都是为托儿所的娃娃们干的。一学习，噢！原来社会主义并不远，我们还都年轻，只要努一把力，准能赶得上。现在，大家不论练兵不论学习，情绪更高了，都觉得更有奔头了。”黄天玉越说越兴奋：“当我们看到我们防地周围那一座座楼房，从平地上一天天高起来的时候，我们觉得自己的责任也一天天地大起来，我们想：工人同志们一砖一瓦地建设社会主义，我们就得提高本领牢牢地保住它呀！”
    说到这里，黄天玉拍着萧立英的肩膀说：“老萧同志，你们工人同志就好好建设吧！只要你们能建设好，我们就一定能保得住。”
    黄天玉的发言，激动着女同学们。模范学生崔晋荣用亲切感人的语调说：“工人叔叔们辛辛苦苦地建设社会主义的祖国，解放军叔叔不分昼夜地保卫着祖国的社会主义建设，我们生活在毛泽东时代的青年们，真是太幸福了。我们要不努力学习，真是太对不起各位叔叔了。总路线的学习可大大提高了我们同学们的思想认识。譬如杨桂琴同学，她过去生活孤僻，学习精神不集中，考试时常不及格，学习了总路线后，她突然难过起来。她说：‘过去，我好像一块生了锈的铁块，总路线的光芒照到我的身上，我感到温暖，也感到惭愧。今后我决心要去掉身上的红锈，投身到社会主义建设的熔炉里，把自己炼成一块对社会主义建设有用的钢。’打这以后，杨桂琴学习积极起来了，生活也活跃起来了，她要求演戏，她参加集体舞蹈。期终考试她的成绩都及格了。”崔晋荣还要讲下去时，麦克风里播放出“联欢会开始文娱活动”的宏亮的声音。
    这时，太阳已经偏西，风变得更刺骨了，但是，这些祖国现在和未来的建设者和保卫者们，却怀着火热的心尽情地歌舞起来。（附图片）
