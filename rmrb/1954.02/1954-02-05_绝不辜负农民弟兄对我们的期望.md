    Never Let Down the Hopes of Our Farmer Brothers
    Meng Tai, Head of the First Delegation of the Anshan Workers' Rural Visit Delegation
    In my second daughter's textbook, there is a lesson introducing the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative. She and her little friends knew that I was going to visit the Han En Cooperative this time, so they surrounded me, wanting me to chat with them about it when I got home. When I arrived at the Han En Cooperative, it really lived up to its reputation; no wonder the children cared about it. As soon as the train entered the station, we saw red flags fluttering and colorful flowers waving; the station was filled with the sound of drums and trumpets. As soon as I got off the train, Han En embraced me warmly, and a group of people carried us out of the station.
    Comrade Han En and I have both shaken hands with Chairman Mao. This meeting was particularly warm. Everyone, young and old, male and female, called us "relatives" and "big brothers." Seeing us come out of our rooms bareheaded, they rushed to put hats on us and drape coats over us, constantly asking about our well-being, offering us water and tea, and personally making things for us to eat with their own produce. When we asked them why they were so warm, they all said in unison: "Everything we wear and use is made by you, our worker brothers! If it weren't for you worker brothers making new farm tools, fertilizers, and pesticides, not to mention developing production and improving our lives, we wouldn't even be able to withstand natural disasters, and eating and clothing would be a problem." Niu Guizhi, a seventeen-year-old girl and leader of the women's production team, said well: "Big brother! The new farm tools you make have liberated us from the clumsy plows." She is determined to become a tractor driver and become an agricultural worker; only then will the peasants be truly liberated and agriculture greatly developed. They constantly told us: "Big brother! We put our hopes on you: produce more steel and machinery so that our country can achieve socialist industrialization as soon as possible, and produce tractors as soon as possible to help all of us farmers embark on collectivization." We said: "Our factories need raw materials, and workers need grain. We hope you will produce more good grain." They all patted their chests and guaranteed: "No problem! We will definitely study technology well, develop production, save grain, and fully support national construction, ensuring that you will eat better and better."
    The comrades in our visiting delegation meet and calculate: what methods can we use to ensure that we meet the requirements of our farmer brothers? After thinking about it, there is only one sentence: strive to develop production, fully consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and enable the country to achieve socialist industrialization as soon as possible. Several of us have already figured it out: not only must we continue to carry forward the spirit of research in the past, strive to find tricks, tap potential, put forward more rationalization proposals, and launch socialist labor competitions; but we must also vigorously promote the worker-peasant alliance, so that all workers know that the peasants are our worker brothers, and no one can do without the other; in particular, we must promote the spirit of hard work and thrift of our farmer brothers, and the atmosphere of studying technology and improving farming that is already prevalent in the countryside today. Today's peasants are no longer the peasants of the old era, just as today's workers are no longer crude and uncultured.
    Comrade Han En's quality of resolutely listening to the Party's words and implementing the Party's resolutions, and his style of relying on the masses, being fair and active, is really worth learning from. He united the two ethnic groups in the cooperative—the Han and the Korean—like a family, enabling them to learn from each other's strengths in farming techniques, which became a major reason for improving production. This is more complicated than leading a class, group, or workshop in our factory; but Comrade Han En has done a very good job.
    The peasants' spirit of thrift is very moving to us. Comrade Lü Baofang, a member of our visiting delegation, heard that Comrade Han En had mobilized all the cooperative members to save a grain of grain and collect hemp rope ends—an old woman collected hemp rope ends for a spring, and got seven catties of hemp rope ends, which sold for 12,000 yuan; he thought of the serious waste on the construction site. A kind of wire costs 70,000 yuan per meter, and it used to be thrown around on the construction site. He is determined to go back and mobilize the workers to collect every nail and every board, and never let the waste phenomenon continue.
    In short, our dear brothers—workers and peasants—chatted about family matters this time, gained a better understanding of each other, got the opportunity to learn from each other, and put forward their hopes for each other: the younger brother hopes that the older brother will lead well, and the older brother hopes that the younger brother will fully support. This has increased the enthusiasm and strength of our brothers, and it is more possible to strive for the early realization of socialist society. This proves that the Party's call for us to strengthen the education of the worker-peasant alliance at this time is very correct and very necessary. Let our worker and peasant brothers hold hands tightly and advance together forever.

    绝不辜负农民弟兄对我们的期望
    鞍山工人农村参观访问代表团第一分团团长　孟泰
    我二女儿的课本上，有一课是介绍韩恩农业生产合作社的；她和她的小朋友知道我这次要访问韩恩社，就围着我，要我回家后好好跟她们唠唠。我到韩恩社一看，果然名不虚传，无怪乎小孩子也关心它。火车一进站，我们就看见红旗飘扬，彩花招展；站里鼓号齐鸣。一下车，韩恩就和我热烈拥抱，一群人把我们抬出车站。
    我跟韩恩同志同时握过毛主席的手。这次见面，真是分外亲热，无论男女老幼，都叫我们“亲人”、“大哥”。见我们光着头出房门，都抢着给我们戴帽子、披大衣，整天问寒问暖，送水送茶，把他们生产的东西，亲手做给我们吃。问他们为啥这么亲热，他们异口同声地说：咱们穿的用的，哪一样不是工人老大哥做的！要没有工人老大哥给制造出新式农具、肥田粉、农药，不用说发展生产，改善生活，连天灾都抗不住，吃穿也成问题。十七岁的大姑娘、妇女生产队队长牛桂芝说得好：“大哥！你们制造的新农具，把咱们从笨犁上解放出来了。”她一心一意要当拖拉机手，变成一个农业工人；到那时，农民才算得到了大解放，农业才有了大发展。他们不断地嘱咐我们：“大哥！咱们把希望放在你们身上啦：多出钢铁、机械，使咱们国家早日实现社会主义工业化，早日出拖拉机，帮助咱们全体农民早日走上集体化。”我们说：“咱工厂需要原料，工人需要粮食，希望你们多生产好粮食。”他们都拍着胸保证说：“没问题！一定好好学习技术，发展生产，节约粮食，全力支援国家建设，管保你们越往后越吃得好。”
    我们访问团的同志碰面就核计：用什么办法来保证满足农民弟兄的要求呢？想来想去只有一句话：努力发展生产，全力巩固工农联盟，使国家早日实现社会主义工业化。咱们几个人已经想好了，不但要继续发扬过去那种钻研精神，努力找窍门，挖潜力，多提合理化建议，展开社会主义劳动竞赛；更要大力宣传工农联盟，让所有的工人都知道，农民是咱们工人的亲兄弟，谁也离不开谁；特别要宣传农民兄弟们那种吃苦耐劳、省吃俭用的精神，和今天已经在农村中普遍存在的钻研技术、改进耕作的风气。今天的农民，再不是旧时代的那种农民了，就跟今天的工人再不是大老粗一样。
    韩恩同志那种坚决听党的话、执行党的决议的品质，和依靠群众、公正积极的作风，实在值得我们学习。他使社里的两个民族——汉族和朝鲜族，团结得像一家人一样，使他们在耕作技术上取长补短，成为提高生产的一大原因。这比我们在工厂里领导一个班、组、车间，还要复杂；但韩恩同志搞得很好。
    农民节俭的精神很使我们感动。我们访问团团员吕宝芳同志，听说韩恩同志发动全体社员节约一粒粮食，搜集麻绳头——一个老大娘搜集一春，得到麻绳头七斤，卖了一两万元；他就想起工地上的严重浪费现象。有一种电线，一公尺就值七万元，过去乱丢在工地上。他下决心回去发动工人，搜集一钉一板，决不让浪费现象继续下去。
    总之，咱们亲哥俩——工人和农民这次见面唠扯家常，相互间更加了解，得到互相学习的机会，相互间还提出了对对方的希望：兄弟希望哥哥好好领导，哥哥希望弟弟全力支援。这就增加了咱们哥俩的劲头、力量，更有可能争取社会主义社会早日实现。这证明党号召我们在现时加强工农联盟的教育是十分正确、十分必要的。让咱们工农弟兄紧紧拉着手，永远共同前进。
