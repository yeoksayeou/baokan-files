Xinhua News Agency, 10th. According to Vietnam News Agency: The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army announced on the 9th that the Vietnamese People's Army liberated Kontum City, the capital of Kontum Province in central South Vietnam, on the 7th.

In late January, after suffering a crushing defeat in the northern part of Kontum Province, the French colonialists hurriedly dispatched a large number of European troops to reinforce Kontum Province. However, because the enemy troops in the Tuy Hoa area of Phu Yen Province, southeast of Kontum Province, were contained by the Vietnamese guerrillas, the highway connecting Kontum and Pleiku was under serious threat from the Vietnamese People's Army, and the communication line from Pleiku to An Khe had been cut off, exposing the capital of Kontum Province. At the same time, the capital of Attapu Province in Laos, northwest of Kontum, was liberated by the Lao People's Liberation Army on February 1st, further isolating the enemy forces in Kontum.

On the evening of February 3rd, after the Vietnamese People's Army arrived near the capital of Kontum Province, they removed a French military command stronghold on the evening of the 4th and intercepted an enemy transport convoy from Pleiku on the 6th.

Under these circumstances, the enemy had no choice but to abandon the capital of Kontum Province on the night of the 6th and retreat westward along a mountain road. The Vietnamese People's Army immediately followed and fiercely pursued them. On the morning of the 7th, the vanguard of the People's Army entered Kontum City and was warmly welcomed by the residents.

Because the enemy fled in a hurry, they did not have time to destroy the ammunition depot, and the military equipment and power station in the city were intact.

Xinhua News Agency, 9th. According to Vietnam News Agency on the 8th: The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communique saying that in January, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated nearly 2,000 enemy troops in South Vietnam, removed 54 French strongholds and watchtowers, and forced the enemy to retreat from 18 strongholds and watchtowers.

The communique said that not long ago, the French aggressors were forced to draw ten mobile battalions from South Vietnam to reinforce central South Vietnam and central Laos. The people's armed forces in South Vietnam seized this opportunity to strengthen guerrilla activities.

In January, the people's armed forces in South Vietnam victoriously carried out many battles: they destroyed three French military trains on the Saigon-Nha Trang railway. They launched simultaneous attacks on the enemy's water and land transportation lines in Can Tho Province and Soc Trang Province, sinking one enemy heavy gunboat and one transport ship on the canal, destroying six armored vehicles and five cars, and annihilating about two companies of enemy troops on the transportation lines. In Long Xuyen Province and Xinshi, the people's armed forces in South Vietnam attacked the puppet army's light infantry, annihilating one company of enemy troops. On January 27th, the Vietnamese People's Army removed eleven French strongholds and watchtowers in Go Cong Province; on January 29th, they removed thirteen French strongholds and watchtowers in My Tho Province. At the same time, they also removed the stronghold of Le Xin, which was guarded by a company of enemy troops.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th. According to Vietnam News Agency on the 8th: The Vietnamese People's Army and people's armed forces actively launched attacks and won victories in Bac Ninh and other provinces in North Vietnam, and successfully smashed the enemy's "mopping-up" operations.

On January 30th, the Vietnamese People's Army removed the French stronghold of Tu Son on Highway No. 1 between Bac Ninh and Hanoi, killing and capturing 116 enemy troops and seizing 75 machine guns and rifles. On the same evening, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces removed the French stronghold of Tam Tao, five kilometers from the capital of Bac Ninh Province. Prior to this, on January 28th, the local forces of the People's Army in Bac Ninh Province annihilated a company of enemy troops in Kim Quan, ten kilometers northeast of Hanoi.

On February 1st, the local forces of the People's Army in Hung Yen Province destroyed a large gunboat on the Red River, fully loaded with enemy troops, with mines at Nghi Xuan, eighteen kilometers northwest of the capital of Hung Yen Province, and more than two companies of enemy troops on board were all annihilated.

Another report said that on January 8th, the French colonialists gathered two mobile regiments and many artillery battalions to "mop up" the guerrilla bases in the southwest of Ningjiang County and the south of Qingmian County in Hai Duong Province. After eleven days of fighting, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces victoriously repelled the enemy. According to incomplete statistics, the People's Armed Forces killed two enemy majors, three captains, one lieutenant, and hundreds of European soldiers and puppet troops, and seriously wounded the regimental commander, a colonel, of the enemy's Third Mobile Regiment.

    越南人民军解放昆嵩省省会昆嵩
    人民军上月在南越歼敌两千拔除许多据点
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部在九日宣布，越南人民军七日解放中越南部昆嵩省省会昆嵩。
    一月下旬，法国殖民者在昆嵩省北部遭受惨败后，急忙调遣大批欧洲籍部队增援昆嵩省。但是，由于位于昆嵩省东南的富安省绥和地区的敌军受到越南游击队的牵制，连接昆嵩和波来古的公路受到越南人民军的严重威胁，从波来古到安溪的交通线已被切断，昆嵩省省会便暴露出来。同时，位于昆嵩西北的寮国阿速坡省省会在二月一日被寮国人民解放军解放，因而昆嵩敌军更加孤立。
    二月三日晚，越南人民军抵达昆嵩省省会附近地区后，在四日晚拔除了法军的一个指挥据点，并在六日截击了一支从波来古开来的敌军运输队。
    在这种情况下，敌人不得不在六日夜放弃昆嵩省省会，沿着一条山路往西撤退，越南人民军当即跟踪猛烈追击。七日晨，人民军的先头部队进入昆嵩城，受到居民的热烈欢迎。
    由于敌人仓促撤逃，以致来不及炸毁弹药库，城内的军事设备和动力站也都完好无损。
    【新华社九日讯】据越南通讯社八日讯：越南人民军总司令部发表公报说，在一月份，越南人民军在南越歼灭近两千名敌军，拔除五十四个法军据点和了望塔，并迫使敌人自十八个据点和了望塔撤退。
    公报说，不久以前，法国侵略者被迫从南越抽调十个机动营增援到中越南部和寮国中部去。南越的人民武装利用这个时机加强了游击活动。
    在一月份，南越的人民武装胜利地进行了许多次战斗：在西贡至芽庄铁路上击毁了三列法军火车。对芹苴省和朔庄省的敌人水陆交通线同时发动了进攻，击沉了运河上的敌军重型炮艇和运输船各一艘，并击毁了装甲车六辆、汽车五辆，又在各交通线上歼灭了敌军约两个连。在龙川省和新市，南越的人民武装进攻伪军轻装部队，歼灭了敌军一个连。一月二十七日，越南人民军拔除了鹅贡省的十一个法军据点和了望塔；一月二十九日，又在美荻省拔除了十三个法军据点和了望塔。同时也拔除了由一连敌军据守的据点黎新。
    【新华社十日讯】据越南通讯社八日讯：越南人民军和人民武装在北越北宁等省主动出击获胜，并胜利粉碎敌人的“扫荡”。
    一月三十日，越南人民军拔除了北宁和河内之间的第一号公路上的法军据点慈山，计击毙和俘掳敌军一百一十六名，缴获机枪和步枪七十五挺（支）。同日晚上，越南人民武装拔除了距北宁省会五公里的法军据点三皂。在这以前，北宁省的人民军地方部队一月二十八日曾在河内东北十公里的金观歼灭敌军一个连。
    二月一日，兴安省的人民军地方部队在兴安省会西北十八公里的宜春用水雷炸毁了红河上满载敌军的一艘大型炮艇，艇上的两连多敌军全部被歼。
    另一消息说，一月八日，法国殖民者曾纠集两个机动团和许多炮兵营“扫荡”海阳省的宁江县西南和清冕县南部的游击基地。经过十一天战斗，越南人民武装胜利地击退了敌军。据不完全统计，人民武装共击毙敌军少校两名、上尉三名、中尉一名及数百名欧洲籍士兵和伪军，并重伤敌军第三机动团上校团长。
