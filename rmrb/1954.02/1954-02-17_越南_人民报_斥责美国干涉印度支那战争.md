    (Xinhua News Agency, February 16th) According to Vietnam News Agency on the 15th, the "People's Daily," the organ of the Vietnam Workers' Party, recently published an article condemning the shameless interference of US imperialists in the Indochina War.
    The article pointed out that the successive victories achieved by the Vietnamese army and people in Northwest Vietnam, the Red River Delta, the Central Highlands of Vietnam, and Southern Vietnam, as well as the recent significant victories gained by the Laotian army and people in Northern, Central, and Southern Laos, have greatly alarmed the French colonialists and their masters—the American interventionists.
    In the past few weeks, the United States has hurriedly sent more aircraft and air force personnel to Indochina. This fact proves that the United States is taking further steps to intensify its interference in the Indochina War and directly participate in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
    The article went on to say: The United States' shameful interference in Indochina nakedly exposes its conspiracy to invade Asia and deliberately undermine world peace. The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos harbor immense indignation towards the American interventionists, just as they hate the French colonialists. Because they recognize that the American interventionists are directly participating in the massacre of the people of Indochina and plotting to enslave them.
    The article emphasized that despite the military and economic "aid" given by the United States in the past few years, the French colonialists have still suffered repeated defeats. One thing the United States cannot help the French colonialists prevent is the demoralization of the French Expeditionary Force and the puppet army. And the morale of the army is an irreplaceable and important factor in guaranteeing victory.
    The article said: The United States' shameless interference in Indochina does not indicate its strength; on the contrary, it shows its unease and alarm at the continuous growth of the Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian armies and people. The United States, this paper tiger, has suffered a shameful defeat in Korea. Today, if it goes all out to "help" the French colonialists and their puppets, it will also be unable to avoid a disastrous fate.
    The article concluded by saying: The US interference in Indochina has deepened the indignation of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and has made them unite more closely to carry out a resolute struggle. Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are increasingly determined to fight for the true independence and freedom of their homeland. They will fight until complete victory is achieved.

### 越南“人民报”斥责美国干涉印度支那战争

    越南“人民报”斥责美国干涉印度支那战争
      【新华社十六日讯】　据越南通讯社十五日讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”最近发表了一篇文章，斥责美帝国主义者厚颜无耻地干涉印度支那战争。
    文章指出：越南军民在越南西北、红河三角洲、越南中部高原和越南南部接连不断取得的胜利，以及寮国军民最近在寮国北部、中部和南部获得的重大胜利，使法国殖民者及其主子——美国干涉者——大为惊慌。
    在过去几星期中，美国赶紧把更多的飞机和空军人员派到印度支那。这一事实证明，美国正采取进一步的步骤来加紧干涉印度支那战争，并直接参加扩大对越南、高棉和寮国的侵略战争。
    文章接着说：美国在印度支那的可耻的干涉，赤裸裸地暴露了它侵略亚洲和蓄意破坏世界和平的阴谋。越南、高棉和寮国人民正如仇恨法国殖民者一样，对美国干涉者怀着无比的愤慨。因为他们认识到美国干涉者正在直接参加对印度支那人民的屠杀，并阴谋要奴役他们。
    文章着重指出：尽管美国在过去几年中给予军事和经济的“援助”，但法国殖民者仍然遭到接二连三的失败。有一件事是美国无法帮助法国殖民者来防止的，这就是法国远征军和伪军士气的消沉。而军队的士气正是保证胜利的一个无可替代的重要因素。
    文章说：美国在印度支那的厚颜无耻的干涉，并不说明它的强大，相反地正说明它对越南、高棉和寮国军民的不断壮大感到不安和惊慌。美国这只纸老虎已在朝鲜遭到了可耻的失败。今天，如果它尽全力来“帮助”法国殖民者及其傀儡的话，它也将无法避免惨败的命运。
    文章最后说：美国在印度支那的干涉加深了越南、高棉和寮国人民的愤慨，而且使他们更加紧密地团结起来，进行坚决的战斗。越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，正在越来越坚决地为取得祖国的真正独立和自由进行战斗。他们将一直战斗到取得完全胜利为止。
