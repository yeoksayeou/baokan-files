Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 26th: According to TASS, the Soviet Union's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Andrei Yanuarevich Vyshinsky, has written to the UN Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjöld, suggesting that "Measures to Eliminate Obstacles to International Trade and Develop International Economic Relations" be included on the agenda of the 17th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. Hammarskjöld has formally announced the acceptance of Vyshinsky's suggestion to include the above issue on the preliminary agenda of the 17th session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

Attached to Vyshinsky's letter was a memorandum from the Soviet delegation explaining the reasons for this suggestion. The full text of the memorandum is as follows:

	"In accordance with the rules of procedure of the Economic and Social Council, the delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics proposes that the issue of 'Measures to Eliminate Obstacles to International Trade and Develop International Economic Relations' be included as an important and urgent matter on the agenda of the 17th session of the Economic and Social Council.

	Based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, and in particular, according to Articles 55 and 56 of the Charter concerning the solution of international economic and social problems, the Soviet delegation believes it is important that the Economic and Social Council should discuss this issue at its forthcoming 17th session and adopt recommendations aimed at eliminating obstacles to international trade and expanding peaceful and friendly relations.

	The basis for this assertion by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is that trade is a healthy and solid foundation for developing peaceful relations between countries, despite the differences in their economic and social structures.

	It is also known that eliminating obstacles to international trade, and the Economic and Social Council making concrete suggestions to strengthen and expand international economic relations, can help ease international tensions and promote the cause of world peace.

	The delegation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics suggests that the agenda of the 17th session of the Economic and Social Council should include an item on 'Measures to Eliminate Obstacles to International Trade and Develop International Economic Relations,' and firmly believes that an effective discussion on this issue will promote the interests of all countries, expand international economic cooperation between countries, and promote the consolidation of peace."

    维辛斯基建议在联合国经社理事会会议上
    讨论扩大各国间经济合作问题
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：苏联驻联合国常任代表安·扬·维辛斯基致函联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，建议将“关于消除国际贸易的障碍和发展国际经济关系的措施”列入联合国经社理事会第十七届会议议程。哈马舍尔德已正式宣布接受维辛斯基的建议，将上项问题列入联合国经社理事会第十七届会议的初步议程。
    维辛斯基函中并附有苏联代表团说明这一建议的理由的备忘录一件。备忘录全文如下：
      “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟代表团按照经社理事会议事规则，建议把‘关于消除国际贸易的障碍和发展国际经济关系的措施’作为一个重要而迫切的问题列入经社理事会第十七届会议的议程。
    本着联合国宪章的原则，特别是根据宪章中关于解决国际经济与社会问题的第五十五条和第五十六条的规定，苏联代表团认为下列事情是很重要的：经社理事会在即将举行的理事会第十七届会议上应该讨论这个问题，并应通过旨在消除国际贸易的障碍和扩大国际和平友好关系的建议。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟这种主张的依据是，贸易是发展各国之间的和平关系的健康的、稳固的基础，尽管这些国家的经济和社会结构有所不同。
    大家也知道，消除国际贸易的障碍，并由经社理事会作出加强与扩大国际经济关系的具体建议，可以帮助缓和国际紧张局势，并可促进世界和平事业。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟代表团建议经社理事会第十七届会议议程应包括一项‘关于消除国际贸易的障碍和发展国际经济关系的措施’，并且深信，关于这个问题的有效讨论将增进各国的利益，并可促进各国间国际经济合作的扩大，促进和平的巩固。”
