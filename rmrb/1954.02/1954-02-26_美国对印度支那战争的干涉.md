U.S. Intervention in the Indochina War
Cui Qi
    Recently, the Vietnamese army and people have achieved major victories successively in the Red River Delta, the Central Highlands of Vietnam, and the southern regions, as well as the Laotian army and people on the northern, central, and southern battlefields of Laos. The development of the Indochina War illustrates that France, relying on massive "aid" from the United States, implementing the so-called "Navarre Plan," and continuing the war has only resulted in more severe sacrifices and failures in Indochina. On February 7, the Associated Press admitted: "The Navarre Plan has not worked," and "this plan is useless." Even Navarre himself publicly expressed frustration with the "victory" of his "plan."
    Faced with the powerful offensives of the Indochina People's Forces, the morale of the French invading forces is declining daily. The Associated Press wrote in panic: "A major crisis has occurred in the morale of the French Union forces," and the US government "frankly expressed anxiety about the morale of the Vietnamese (puppet) army in Indochina." U.S. President Eisenhower also had to admit that the war of aggression against Indochina was unpopular and that "the people lack enthusiasm for this war."
    It is becoming increasingly clear that the desperate, disastrous war France is waging in Indochina cannot continue. The voices of the broad French public demanding peaceful negotiations to end the Indochina War are rising. On February 9, the French newspaper "Libération" wrote excitedly: "French public opinion is now unanimous. Everyone hopes to end the Indochina War. Enough blood has been shed, enough destruction has been done, and enough poverty has been endured in seven years of internecine warfare. Hundreds of billions of francs have been wasted in vain. The legs of the French economy are dragging heavier and heavier shackles. Enough is enough! We must negotiate."
    However, the American war group, which is trying to maintain tension in the Far East, is still desperately hindering a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue and is intensifying its intervention in the Indochina War. The US "New York Herald Tribune" openly stated: "From the deepest sense of American interests, this war is our war." Therefore, the US government is preparing to provide France with new and larger-scale "aid," encouraging France to continue shedding blood for American interests. According to the US Information Service, the US financial "aid" to France for the Indochina War in the 1954 fiscal year will reach $800 million to $1 billion. On February 6, the US International News Service wrote: "The Eisenhower administration's continued and increased aid... is a factor in strengthening the French determination to continue fighting."
    Moreover, the United States is blatantly stepping up its participation in the Indochina War with its military forces. On February 4, US Senator Alexander Smith openly said that whether France can continue the Indochina War "cannot be guaranteed." On February 5, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford suggested to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the United States must make an "additional effort" in the Indochina War. Recently, Eisenhower openly dispatched hundreds of air force officers and soldiers to Indochina and stepped up the supply of bombers and giant transport planes to the French invading forces. Pilots of the so-called "Civil Air Transport Company," led by war profiteer Chennault, also rushed to Indochina to participate in the war of aggression. US Far East Air Force Commander Weyland said that these air force personnel and aircraft are still "part of the regular US military assistance program." Starting on February 14, the United States again gathered Britain and France to hold provocative naval exercises lasting ten days in the waters off the coast of Indochina and near the southern coast of China. All these facts expose the US's sinister plan to further intervene in the Indochina War.
    At the same time, the US authorities are also attempting to use the puppet troops of Syngman Rhee, Phibunsongkhram, and others to participate in the intervention in the Indochina War. Under the direction of the United States, South Korea even "suggested" sending a division of puppet troops to participate in the war. The Thai government also openly took "measures" to increase troops to the Indochina border. This is clearly a vicious American plot to "use Asians to fight Asians."
    While the United States is pouring more dollars, weapons, and military personnel into the Indochina battlefield, it is demanding that France hand over more military command to the United States in order to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Indochina according to American intentions. US Commander of the Pacific Army O'Daniel recently openly stated that the United States must "share more of the management and command of the (Indochina) war." Radford also claimed that the United States would "send a high-level military delegation to assist France in planning strategy." The US "Time" magazine, published on February 15, even revealed that US military authorities are attempting to appoint an American commander to replace France in commanding the Indochina war of aggression.
    The United States is further demanding that France allow the United States to directly train and control the puppet troops in Indochina. US General Van Fleet, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Korean people, recently wrote in an American magazine while discussing the Southeast Asian puppet troops: "Native troops can only function if they are fully trained and if natives fill all levels of officer positions, including the highest positions." This means that French officers had better relinquish control of the puppet troops. Then who should control them? Van Fleet continued: "A division of Asian troops, in addition to its original training by the United States, also needs American advisors." At the same time, the US Department of Defense announced that in order for the United States to directly train the puppet troops, the more than 400 US military delegation personnel in Indochina need to be tripled.
    It is known that the United States has exerted various pressures on France, forcing France to allow the three puppet regimes in Indochina to "become independent" in order to further bring these puppet regimes into the arms of the United States. However, the concessions made by France in this regard cannot satisfy the United States. Under the guise of the "independence" of the puppet regimes, the United States is striving to gain military control of Indochina. The US International News Service recently said: America's "ultimate hope is that Vietnam (the Bảo Đại puppet regime) can take over the 'defense' of Indochina." "US News & World Report" admitted: "Radford is presiding over the American policy of gradually taking over the Indochina war." Obviously, the US expansion of intervention in the Indochina War is actually aimed at seizing France's military control in Indochina, thereby replacing the French colonialists in Indochina's dominant position and expanding American aggression in Southeast Asia.
    The increasing American involvement in the Indochina War has caused panic in France. Agence France-Presse reported on February 14 that France "feels uneasy about the possibility of the United States becoming more deeply involved in the Indochina War." The French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde," referring to the attempt by American generals to supervise and command the Indochina War, stated that France would not agree to "give up control over war and peace, and merely hang a sham name of an executor." French Commander-in-Chief of the invading forces in Vietnam Navarre also openly rejected US meddling in Indochina's "military work" on February 19. He believes that it is "unimaginable" and "absolutely unreasonable" for France to hand over Indochina's "military work" to the United States.
    With the continuous failures of the French invading forces, the increasing military, financial, and economic losses of France, and the rising strong movement of the French people demanding an end to the Indochina War, the number of people in the French ruling class who are willing to hold peace talks to end the Indochina War is increasing. French Prime Minister Laniel was long forced to admit that the Indochina War was unpopular in France. French Foreign Minister Bidault also stated at the recent Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference that the French government was willing to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. However, recently, French Defense Minister Pleven and other senior military officers held meetings in Indochina and the Bảo Đại puppet regime, planning to expand the invading forces to "gain the upper hand," while also discussing "US aid" with US Director of the Foreign Operations Administration Stassen. These activities are clearly incompatible with the consistent demands of the French people, the Indochinese people, and the peace-loving people of the world for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue.
    The Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference has reached an agreement on convening a conference in Geneva with the participation of the Soviet Union, China, France, the United States, Britain, and other relevant countries to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. This agreement has won universal welcome from world and French public opinion. The French newspaper "Le Monde" believes that the Berlin Conference "has opened the door for negotiations on Indochina." The French newspaper "Libération" further demanded that measures be taken to cease fire in Indochina before the Geneva Conference is convened. But everyone sees that the American war group's continued expansion of intervention in the Indochina War is making the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue more complicated. If France is willing to peacefully resolve the Indochina issue, it should get rid of American interference and control in order to facilitate a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. Since the United States agreed at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, it should immediately stop its intervention in the Indochina War pending consultation and resolution at the upcoming Geneva Conference.

    美国对印度支那战争的干涉
    崔奇
    最近越南军民在红河三角洲、越南中部高原和南部，以及寮国军民在寮国北部、中部和南部战场上，接连取得了重大胜利。印度支那战争的发展情况说明，法国依靠美国的大量“援助”，执行所谓“纳瓦尔计划”，继续进行战争的结果，只是使它在印度支那遭到了更惨重的牺牲和失败。二月七日合众社承认：“纳瓦尔计划并没有生效”，“这个计划不济于事”。而且连纳瓦尔自己也对它的“计划”的“胜利”公开表示沮丧了。
    在印度支那人民部队的强大攻势面前，法国侵略军的士气日益低落。合众社惊慌地写道：“法兰西联邦军的士气发生很大的危机”，美国政府“直率地对印度支那的越南（傀儡）军队的士气表示焦虑”。美国总统艾森豪威尔也不得不承认，侵略印度支那的战争是不得人心的，“人民对这个战争缺乏热情”。
    事情越来越明显：法国在印度支那所进行的绝望的灾难性的战争，是不能再继续下去了。法国广大舆论要求举行和平谈判以结束印度支那战争的呼声，正日益高昂。二月九日法国“解放报”激动地写道：“法国舆论现在已经一致了。大家都希望结束印度支那战争。在七年自相残杀的战争中，血也流得够了，破坏得也够了，贫穷折磨也受够了。白白浪费了数以千亿计的法郎。法国经济的腿拖上了越来越重的镣铐。这种情况够了！我们必须进行谈判。”
    但是，力图保持远东紧张局势的美国战争集团，却仍然拚命阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决，并变本加厉地对印度支那战争进行干涉。美国“纽约先驱论坛报”公然说：“从美国利益这一极深刻的意义说来，这个战争正是我们的战争。”因此，美国政府正准备给法国以新的、规模更大的“援助”，怂恿法国继续为美国利益而流血。据美国新闻处透露，美国在一九五四年会计年度，对法国进行印度支那战争的财政“援助”将达八亿到十亿美元。二月六日美国国际新闻社写道：“艾森豪威尔政府继续和增加援助……是加强法国人继续战斗的决心的一个因素。”
    不仅如此。美国更悍然以其军事力量加紧参与印度支那战争。二月四日美国参议员亚历山大·史密斯公开说，法国是否能继续印度支那战争，“这是保不住的”。二月五日美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福向参议院军事委员会建议，必须由美国对印度支那战争“作一种额外的努力”。最近艾森豪威尔公然派遣数百名空军军官和士兵到印度支那，并以轰炸机和巨型运输机加紧供应法国侵略军。以战争贩子陈纳德为首的所谓“民用航空运输公司”的驾驶员也大批地赶到印度支那参与侵略战争。美国远东空军司令威兰说，这些空军人员和飞机，还是美国“正规军事援助计划的一部分”。从二月十四日起，美国又纠集英国和法国，在印度支那海岸及中国南部海岸附近的海面，举行历时十天的挑衅性的海军演习。所有这些事实都暴露了美国对印度支那战争实行更进一步干涉的阴谋计划。
    同时美国当局还企图利用李承晚、銮披汶之流的傀儡军来参与对印度支那战争的干涉。在美国的指使下，南朝鲜竟“建议”派一师傀儡军参战。泰国政府也公然采取“措施”，向印度支那边境增兵。这显然是美国“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的一个恶毒阴谋。
    美国一边向印度支那战场投下了更多的美元、武器和军事人员，一边就要求法国把更多的军事指挥权交给美国，以便按照美国的意图延长和扩大侵略印度支那的战争。美国驻太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔最近公开表示，必须由美国“分担更多的（印度支那）战争的管理和指挥工作”。雷德福也声称，美国要“派遣一个高级军事代表团去协助法国计划战略”。二月十五日出版的美国“时代”杂志更透露，美国军事当局正企图任命一个美国司令官来代替法国指挥印度支那侵略战争。
    美国又进一步地向法国要求由美国直接训练和控制印度支那的傀儡军。双手沾满朝鲜人民鲜血的美国将军范佛里特，最近在一个美国杂志上谈论东南亚傀儡军时写道：“土著军队只有经过充分训练并由土著担任各级军官，包括最高的位置，才能发挥作用。”这就是说，法国军官最好放弃对傀儡军的控制权。那末由谁来控制呢？范佛里特接着写道：“一师亚洲兵除了它原来受美国的训练外，还需要美国顾问。”同时美国国防部并宣称，为了由美国直接训练傀儡军，美国在印度支那的四百多名的军事代表团人员，需要再增加两倍。
    人们知道，美国曾经对法国施行了种种压力，迫使法国允许印度支那的三个傀儡政权“独立”，以便使这些傀儡政权进一步投入美国怀抱。但是法国在这方面所作的让步，并不能使美国感到满足。美国在傀儡政权“独立”的掩饰下，正力图取得印度支那的军事控制权。美国国际新闻社最近说：美国“最终的希望是，越南（保大傀儡）能够把印度支那的‘防务’接手担当起来”。“美国新闻与世界报道”则承认：“雷德福正在主持使美国逐渐接管印度支那战争的美国政策。”显然，美国扩大对印度支那战争的干涉，实际上是要夺取法国在印度支那的军事控制权，从而代替法国殖民者在印度支那的统治地位，并扩张美国在东南亚的侵略势力。
    美国日甚一日地插足印度支那战争的行动，已经引起法国的惶恐。法新社二月十四日称，法国对美国“更深地卷入印度支那战争的可能性感到不安。”法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”在谈到美国将军们企图监督指挥印度支那战争时表示，法国是不会同意“放弃对战争与和平的控制，而徒挂一个执行者的虚名”的。法国侵越军总司令纳瓦尔并在二月十九日公开拒绝美国插手印度支那的“军事工作”。他认为，法国把印度支那的“军事工作”交给美国，“那是不可想像的”，“是绝对不合理的”。
    在法国侵略军不断失败，法国军事上和财政经济上损失越来越大，法国人民要求结束印度支那战争的强大运动日益高涨的情况下，法国统治阶级中表示愿意举行和平谈判结束印度支那战争的人，正日见增多。法国总理拉尼埃早就被迫承认印度支那战争在法国是不得人心的。法国外长皮杜尔在最近举行的柏林四国外长会议上，也曾表示法国政府愿意讨论恢复印度支那的和平问题。但是最近法国国防部长普利文和其他高级军官，却在印度支那和保大傀儡举行会议，计划扩充侵略军队“争取优势”，同时又和美国“援外事务管理署”署长史塔生商谈了“美援”问题。这些活动显然是和法国人民、印度支那人民以及世界爱好和平人民关于和平解决印度支那问题的一贯主张不相容的。
    柏林四国外长会议已经取得了关于在日内瓦召开苏、中、法、美、英及其他有关国家的会议来讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平的问题的协议。这个协议博得了全世界和法国舆论的普遍欢迎。法国“世界报”认为：柏林会议“为印度支那的谈判打开了大门”。法国“解放报”更要求在召开日内瓦会议以前就采取措施在印度支那停战。但是谁都看到，美国战争集团对印度支那战争的继续扩大干涉，使得和平解决印度支那问题趋于更加复杂化。法国如果愿意和平解决印度支那问题，就应该摆脱美国的干涉和控制，以利于和平解决印度支那问题。美国既然在柏林四国外长会议同意了讨论恢复印度支那和平问题的协议，就应该立即停止对印度支那战争的干涉，以待即将举行的日内瓦会议的协商解决。
