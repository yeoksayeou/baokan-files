The Story of Wang Chonglun
By our reporter Lù Hào

I.

He was wearing a neat blue uniform, carrying a manure basket on his back, with two or three piles of horse manure sloshing around inside. He walked slowly and listlessly down the street, and people cast surprised glances at him.

As he passed a basketball court, the lively game sparked his interest, and this young man, who usually loved to play ball, couldn't help but walk over.

He was immediately spotted, and someone called out to him, "Wang Chonglun, Wang Chonglun, come play a game!"

The strange sight of the mechanical worker carrying a manure basket surprised many people. Some praised him, saying, "Ah! Wang Chonglun, you're so thrifty, even collecting manure during your time off."

The game naturally stopped, and acquaintances surrounded Wang Chonglun.

His face was flushed, and since he had already walked over, he was embarrassed to leave immediately. He planned to brush it off and avoid the issue, so he casually replied, "Stop joking around, let's play ball."

One of the acquaintances suddenly asked him, "Isn't today Sunday? How come you're at home?"

This really left Wang Chonglun speechless. He forced himself to appear energetic but then dejectedly defended himself, "It's not Sunday, but I can give myself a holiday!" Although Wang Chonglun was smiling as he said this, he felt very sad inside.

"Can the working class just give themselves holidays?"

"What's going on here?"

"You must have had a quarrel with someone, tell us quickly, and we'll help you solve it."

Everyone asked questions, expressing their concern. Many people were stunned by his unexpected answer.

Wang Chonglun felt that there was no point in hiding such a thing, so he told everyone the whole story of why he hadn't gone to work. Finally, he helplessly spread out his hands and said:

"I know this is wrong, but my mother won't let me go to work, what can I do?"

Everyone knew that Wang Chonglun was very filial to his mother, and he listened to everything she said. This time, he hadn't gone to work, and it must be because he had listened to something his mother said again.

"You're too problematic. Don't you even use your own brain to think about what your mother says?"

"Your mouth is usually only good at talking about others!"

"You're a member of the Youth League, do you think this is the right thing to do?"

These words were more of a noble concern between people than a reprimand. The pain of wanting to find a personal way out after leaving the collective shook him violently. He said regretfully, "I'm wrong, what can I do now that I've done this?"

"That's okay, just go to work as usual tomorrow."

"If your mother doesn't agree, we'll all go and talk to your mother."

"We'll take you home."

"No need, I can talk to her myself." He thought, I'm such a big person, and I still need people to take me home, how would that look? He walked home, feeling extremely depressed. He thought about how he was getting caught up over such a small thing, going back and forth. He was a grown man, how could this be? He thought about the days when he wore rags, how could he have forgotten them so completely?

As soon as he entered the door, he said to his mother, "I can't stay at home any longer."

His mother said in surprise, "What's wrong with you? Who have you been listening to again?"

"If I stay like this, people will just laugh at me, I can't take it."

"Other people don't support us, why should you listen to them!"

"No. I'm a young man, and everyone says that what I did was wrong. If I walk alone, where can I go?"

"What are they all saying?" his mother asked suspiciously.

"People are saying that those who only think about taking care of their own interests will never actually gain anything in their lives. Everyone says that our ideas are outdated." He also said to his mother, "Because you wanted me to get a raise, you had me stop working and go to a private factory, and now I'm at home picking up manure, can I stay like this?"

"With your skills, are you afraid of not having work?" his mother said unconvinced.

"Thinking I'm so smart, but actually it's not like that," Wang Chonglun said, as if talking to himself, and also as if talking to his mother.

After hearing these words, his mother couldn't help but feel a little moved. She began to realize that her old ideas were a bit problematic, and she asked him with a worried tone, "Then what do you plan to do?"

"I'm going to work tomorrow."

As the two were talking, they suddenly heard someone call out outside the door:

"Is Wang Chonglun at home?"

Hearing the familiar voice, they knew it was the branch secretary from the workshop coming to visit. His mother quickly pushed him into the room across the way, telling him to hide. She replied, "Please come in."

The branch secretary entered the room and asked, "Where did Wang Chonglun go?"

"He went to collect manure."

"Old lady, can you find him? I'd like to have a few words with him."

His mother agreed and walked outside. She planned to walk around the street and then come back and say she couldn't find him. However, Wang Chonglun couldn't stay in that room any longer. He didn't know how to feel. In the old society, when he went to work in the factory, he was like a dog, and no one paid any attention to him. Now that he wasn't going to work, the cadre even came to his house, and he was hiding from him... He saw his mother walk out of the room and followed her out, saying to his mother, "Someone's here, and I'm here playing games, how can this be?" Regardless of whether his mother agreed or not, he turned and walked towards his room.

Wang Chonglun didn't know what to say for a moment, so the branch secretary spoke first: "What have you been thinking about these past few days?"

He said embarrassedly, "A lot of nonsense."

"How is it? These past few days haven't been easy for you, right?"

Wang Chonglun nodded, indicating that he agreed with the branch secretary's opinion. He said, "A few days ago, I wasn't happy because I was earning less. Now I know that if a worker leaves everyone else, leaves his own factory, that's the greatest pain."

This time, the branch secretary's tone was much more serious than before. He said, "Only those who integrate the interests of the country with their personal interests can be happy and never feel alone."

These simple words struck Wang Chonglun's heart. He thought of the awkwardness he had felt these past few days, the things he had encountered at the basketball court, and the unsavory thing he had done in a muddle...

The branch secretary seemed to understand and asked him, "Have you decided to go to work tomorrow?"

"Yes, I'm going to work tomorrow," Wang Chonglun replied firmly.

His mother had been listening to their conversation, and the more she listened, the more she realized that her son was no longer on her side.

II.

When Wang Chonglun returned to the factory, the sunny workshop was filled with a home-like warmth.

Although he hadn't been away from the factory for many days, it felt like he was returning to a place he had been away from for a long time. New production successes had been achieved in the workshop, and the machines had been fitted with new products.

When people saw him return, they greeted him warmly, calling out to him. One said, "Master Wang, you're back." Another said, "Master Wang, we've missed you, it's so much better when we're together." He felt warm inside and couldn't speak for a moment.

Not long after he returned to the factory, the workshop began making parts called pull rods. Everyone knew that this was work being done for the volunteers [in the Korean War], and they were all very happy.

However, making pull rods on the milling machine could only be done slowly, one at a time, and there were many rejects. But at that time, the delivery time was very tight. The workers on the milling machine wanted to try making a new tool, hoping to change from making one at a time to making ten at a time. They tried many times, but all failed.

Wang Chonglun was doing other work on the planer. Seeing this situation, he felt that he should also participate in the experiment and not let the Resist America, Aid Korea task be affected. So, during work hours, he carefully studied why the new tool on the milling machine was failing. When he returned home, he silently took a few bricks off the wall and stacked them into the shape of a new tool. When his mother saw this, she asked him:

"Where did you get those bricks?"

"I took them off the wall."

"Are you crazy?"

"I'm not crazy, that's why I'm doing this."

His mother saw that she couldn't talk him out of it, so she left. He stayed up late at night and still went to work as usual during the day. After working hard for several days, he finally created a new tool.

When Wang Chonglun's new tool was to be tested on the milling machine, everyone surrounded him tightly. The more people there were, the more nervous he became. His heart was pounding, and his whole body was tense. He said to himself secretly: Don't make a fool of yourself. However, as soon as the milling machine turned, it somersaulted, and the pull rod and the tool flipped over and rolled down. His head buzzed, and sweat poured down, soaking his shirt. He could only hear a commotion, and opinions differed.

Some said, "If others can't do it, how can we do it?"

Some said pessimistically, "It's going to be tough."

Some said sarcastically, "This tool isn't bad, it's really good!"

When Wang Chonglun heard these words, his head swelled up. He couldn't move, couldn't speak, and couldn't bear to show his face. The branch secretary came over to help him out of the situation. The branch secretary came up with a plan to have Wang Chonglun go out with him.

Wang Chonglun walked out of the factory gate with his head hanging low. As he walked, he thought: Why does the new tool somersault? How can I prevent it from somersaulting? As he walked and thought, he saw a tree branch on the ground that looked similar to the pull rod. He picked it up and placed it on his arm, using his hand to move the branch. The branch turned and moved. He thought, this is the problem I'm facing now. If I can find a way to solve this problem, the new tool will be easy to make.

When he returned home, his whole body and mind were seized by the failure to create a new pull rod tool. He thought dejectedly and unwillingly: Is the pull rod tool going to be considered a failure?

Just then, he heard the branch secretary calling his name outside the door again.

"Please come in," he said faintly without standing up. Just hearing this kind of voice, one could know how much he was weighed down by his thoughts.

"Wang Chonglun, how is it? Did you get a little angry?"

In order to pretend to be calm, Wang Chonglun deliberately tried to make his words lighter. He said, "No anger, just drinking sugar water."

"I hope you can persevere and not be discouraged by hearing those words."

"It's nothing, I'm a member of the Youth League, this is just a way to train myself."

The branch secretary told Wang Chonglun about Zhang Mingshan's creation of the "anti-enclosure disc," and also said: "Heroic models are all produced in difficulties. Zhang Mingshan overcame such great difficulties, and I believe that your difficulties can also be overcome."

"My difficulties are nothing." Wang Chonglun agreed with the branch secretary's opinion one hundred percent: "Compared with the difficulties encountered by Zhang Mingshan, my difficulties are nothing." As he said these words, his eyes seemed to brighten a little, and his heart also loosened up a little. The difficulties really didn't seem to be pressing down on him so much that he couldn't breathe.

That night, he was half asleep when he looked up and his eyes fell on the wooden stool in front of the bed. A sudden idea flashed in his mind. He thought, the legs of the stool can move. As long as I add some wood chips, the stool legs won't turn. Why can't I use the same method for my new tool?

When he returned to the factory, people hadn't started working yet. He told the leaders of the workshop, and everyone encouraged him to try it out. But Wang Chonglun said, "I sweat when people are around, I'll only try it when you're not here!"

When people heard his words, they all went out one by one. Only one of his apprentices remained next to the planer.

"Can I stand here and watch?" his apprentice said.

"I guess so."

The master and apprentice were busy experimenting. When they tried it, the new tool was completely usable. Making pull rods one at a time on the milling machine often produced rejects. With this new tool, two pull rods could be made at the same time, with 100% quality. When his apprentice saw this, he said happily, "Master Wang, this is extremely useful." Wang Chonglun was of course happy inside, but he still didn't show any emotion on his face. He deliberately pursed his lips and said, "It might not be useful, let's wait and see." He thought it was better to be happy later, and not to be too happy too soon.

Wang Chonglun's new tool was also suitable for use on the milling machine, but some workers on the milling machine felt that it wouldn't look good if they hadn't developed the tool themselves and had to use someone else's method. Some suggested trying Wang Chonglun's method; others disagreed. They also said, "We have more people and more machines. We can complete the task by working one at a time." Until the end, there were still more than a thousand pull rods left, the delivery time had arrived, but the task had not been completed. Union Chairman Zhang Chengshan felt that this was outrageous. He said to the workers on the milling machine, "Let's use Wang Chonglun's tool to produce." At this time, a worker named Li Wenlan still asked doubtfully, "There are only a little over a thousand left, is it even worth using it?" Zhang Chengshan said firmly, "Even if there's only one left, we still have to use it." That night, Wang Chonglun helped Zhang Chengshan install the new tool on the milling machine until past midnight. Zhang Chengshan saw that he was too sleepy and told him to go to the small building next to the workshop to sleep for a while. He lay down for a while, but he couldn't fall asleep. He could only hear the whirring sound of the milling machine. Based on this sound, he could tell that it was the sound of several pull rods being worked on at the same time. He quickly got up, stuck his head out, and shouted, "Master Zhang, how is it going?" Zhang Chengshan replied happily, "It's working great, it's working too well, thank you, your tool is a success." When Wang Chonglun heard this, he quickly said, "I should thank you, without you, this tool wouldn't have been promoted."

Using Wang Chonglun's new tool for production, all of the more than a thousand pull rods were completed in one day and one night. If the old method had been used, it would have taken two days and two nights to complete, and there would have been too many rejects and no guarantee of quality.

He walked home with great joy. This kind of joy can only be obtained by those who work very well. When he returned home, the family was eating well today, and everyone was waiting for him to come back.

This small north room was warm, the stove fire was burning red, and the family sat around the bed table. White steamed buns were on the table, and several dishes had been prepared. When Wang Chonglun saw this, he felt deeply moved. He took a bite of the steamed bun, and felt that many words were welling up in his heart. He saw that the whole family was seated and said:

"I am deeply grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao for being able to eat such a good dinner tonight." He paused and then continued: "I don't know if I can represent you in saying these words." His eyes especially looked at his mother.

The room was quiet without the slightest sound. Even his five-year-old son, Jinxia, was listening to his father with wide eyes.

"Do you have anything else to say?" his mother asked him, seemingly a little angry.

"I also thank the volunteers. If they weren't at the front, would we be able to eat such white steamed buns? I will definitely work hard in the future and live up to them."

After he finished speaking, his wife lowered her head and remained silent. His mother threw her chopsticks on the table, really angry.

"Why are you saying this? I'm an old woman at home, I don't know anything. You go to meetings and classes outside, and you don't say anything when you come back, and now you're criticizing me." She defended herself unhappily: "Does that mean that only you are allowed to support the Communist Party and Chairman Mao?"

Although that night's dinner wasn't very pleasant, Wang Chonglun was very happy inside. He felt that both his work and family situation could only get better and better.

III.

The time it took to work on one cam actuating device [Note 1] on the slotting machine at the beginning was a full two and a half hours.

The slow speed of the slotting machine made the production of cam actuating devices in the workshop seem to be suffering from severe digestive problems. The work coming off the lathes was stalled on the slotting machines, so the milling machines and grinders in the subsequent processes seemed to be completely paralyzed. At this time, the most anxious machine was the planer, even though the slotting machine badly needed someone to help out, it couldn't do anything to help.

The production of new products revealed a serious imbalance in the workshop's mechanical equipment. Some machines were extremely busy, while others were in a semi-resting state; some machines were simply unable to participate in the work. The most serious problem was that it would make it very difficult to complete the new product task, and the production schedule was in danger of being pushed back entirely.

In the face of difficulties, everyone had their own ideas.

Some said, "Adding four or five more slotting machines would solve the problem. Adding machines is the responsibility of the workshop director and the factory director, what can we do?"

Some said, "The technical staff should think of ways to improve the production efficiency of the machines." As for himself, he said, "If I had the ability to solve such complex problems, I would have become a technician long ago."

Some even suggested, "Handing over part of the cam actuating devices to another workshop to make would solve the problem, right?" In fact, other workshops had their own production tasks, and no one could help with this.

At that time, in addition to making cam actuating devices, anti-nuts [Note 2] also had to be added later. The slotting machine couldn't even handle the cam actuating devices, and now it had to add anti-nuts, the slotting machine was even more overwhelmed.

For a time, there were many opinions, saying all sorts of things.

Wang Chonglun listened to these opinions and thought, is this what a master looks like? He felt that since he was the master, he should dedicate all his strength to the motherland. These past few days, whenever he had free time, he would stand in front of the slotting machine, watching how it worked. He had worked on the slotting machine and knew that the circular plate played a big role in the up and down movement of the slotting machine. He wanted to move that circular plate and install it on his planer, so that the planer could also do the work of the slotting machine. This way, the planer wouldn't be idle, and the milling machine and grinder would also have work. But in reality, this seemed impossible. Everyone knew that the planer could only lie down and do flat work. How could it stand up and work like a slotting machine!

A few days later, the cam actuating devices and anti-nuts piled up more and more in front of the slotting machine, and Wang Chonglun's attempt to move the circular plate was actually not working. Under these circumstances, based on his past seven experiences, he knew that only by creating a new tool could the production difficulties be solved.

To come up with this new tool, Wang Chonglun's complexion gradually turned yellow, and his eyes slowly sank in. His cheekbones appeared even higher and more prominent.

This situation worried his mother and wife. The two women whispered to each other, feeling that something serious had happened in the family.

"Chonglun is always staying up like this, if he ruins his health, what do we do?" One day, his wife couldn't help but ask his mother.

His mother, since that dinner, had indeed changed her views greatly. Based on her recent observations, she knew that her son was probably pondering how to transform some new tool again. She said: "Yes, no one is like him. Everyone else works when they should work, and rests when they should rest. Only he's special." This old lady, rather than blaming her son, she was actually praising him with joy. She continued to say to her daughter-in-law: "Let's think of a way to let him do his work well, but also not let him ruin his health."

"Mom, then you talk to him about it."

The old lady shook her head and said: "It's no use if I say it. He'll think I don't want him to work hard." She clearly knew that Chonglun had always been very filial to her, but if she held him back, she knew that her words would no longer have as much power as before.

The two thought for a long time, and his wife finally came up with an idea. They knew that Wang Chonglun loved his son Jinxia the most. His wife said:

"When it's time to sleep, let Jinxia play on the small table. Once he plays, Chonglun will definitely be annoyed, so he won't be able to do anything, and he can rest."

However, unfortunately, this method did not succeed. Little Jinxia played for a while, but Wang Chonglun persuaded him to go to sleep obediently. The next day, even Jinxia knew what his father was doing. The kind neighbors recently saw that Wang Chonglun was looking pale and thin, and they sometimes came to ask his mother and daughter-in-law with concern: What's wrong with Wang Chonglun recently? At this time, the old lady would always purse her lips, hinting that the neighbors should ask little Jinxia. If someone really asked him, "What is your father doing?" The small, five-year-old Jinxia would look up with his little red face and answer you: "My father is making tools, looking for the trick."

After about half a month, Wang Chonglun finally drew a rough sketch of a new tool.

Wang Chonglun's new tool was immediately welcomed by everyone in the workshop. When Workshop Director Han Jianguang saw this sketch, he immediately affirmed that Wang Chonglun's creation could solve the workshop's major production difficulties. He quickly assigned the parts needed for the new tool to various processes for manufacturing in a timely manner. Technician Hu Yanlin specially sent someone to help Wang Chonglun draw detailed drawings of the new tool. Workers Li Haifeng and Hao Guofu used their rest time to help assemble the new tool. Li Wenlan, who had previously doubted the use of Wang Chonglun's pull rod tool on the milling machine, also came to see Wang Chonglun's new creation with a smile. He saw that there was no indexing plate on this new tool, and he felt that this could not fully guarantee the quality. He suggested modifying the indexing plate used on the milling machine and moving it to the new tool for use. Wang Chonglun immediately accepted this suggestion.

All the parts were ready, but the new tool was still missing a base. At first, this base was not considered a difficult task, and it was thought that it could be solved by sand casting. Unexpectedly, when it was actually needed, the trouble came. Casting a new base would have to go through the design section, and then through the production section, and finally be assigned to another workshop for casting. Not to mention disrupting the production plans of other units, the time was especially a problem. If it was cast, it would take at least two or three months. At this time, Wang Chonglun thought of Zhang Mingshan again. He knew that the materials for Zhang Mingshan's creation of the "anti-enclosure disc" were all found in the scrap iron pile. He thought, why can't I go to the scrap iron pile to find it? So, regardless of whether it was raining or getting dark, he walked through the large and small scrap iron piles of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Mechanical General Plant. It wasn't until the fourth day that he saw an old part, more than half of which was still pressed in the iron pile. He pulled hard, stepped on the cluttered iron frame, and tore his new leather shoes. He didn't care about anything. When he looked at the old part, its shape and size were exactly the same as the base he needed. This made Wang Chonglun extremely happy.

The results of the new tool's experiment proved that with it, the planer could do work that it couldn't do in the past, and it could do it better than the slotting machine. It took two and a half hours to work on a cam actuating device on the slotting machine; while on the planer, with this new tool, it only took 45 minutes to make. The most unexpected thing was that the new tool could not only make cam actuating devices, but also all fourteen other parts on the rock drill that could not be worked on in the past. So people gave this new tool a name, calling it the "Universal Tool Holder."

The "Universal Tool Holder" increased the original production capacity of cam actuating devices by more than two times at once, and the production imbalance in the workshop caused by the imbalance in mechanical equipment was largely resolved.

When everyone was praising the "Universal Tool Holder," Wang Chonglun was thinking about other things.

At that time, the tool workshop was beginning to discuss the 1953 production plan. Some people, when setting the production plan, wrote the first item as: The attendance rate should reach 100%. No lateness, no early departure. With special exceptions noted below; the second item was to ensure the completion of production tasks; the third item was to ensure no rejects...

If you set it up this way, and I set it up this way, the production plans of many people were largely the same, not much different. Wang Chonglun saw that almost everyone had the first item in these production plans, but some did not write special exceptions; for the second and third items, some only changed the word "ensure" to "resolutely."

He felt that the state's production plan was being handed over to the workers to set themselves, which meant that the workers were truly becoming masters. Then when setting his own plan, he had to act like a master. He thought, since I go to work every day, there was no need to set "the attendance rate should reach 100%" in my production plan. He felt that making a cam actuating device in 45 minutes was still too slow. In his opinion, setting a production plan, only saying how much would be completed, without saying how much would be over-fulfilled, only saying how much could be done now, without considering what specific methods could be used to strive for even more completion, was too conservative.

He found that when working, the cutter head would break at any time, and it might break four or five times a day. Each time a cutter head was replaced, it took four or five minutes. His production plan proposed to find a way to change the shape of the cutter head. As a result, the cutter head really didn't break even once in a day, saving more than 20 minutes each day.

He also specially made a tool box for himself, neatly arranging the wrenches, steel rulers, and oilstones he used, so that the tools he used at work could be easily reached, and he could save as much time as possible.

He adopted many specific methods to save time and improve production, so that the production record of the planer needing 45 minutes to complete a cam actuating device was soon reduced to only 30 minutes.

Perhaps some people thought that this situation was not bad. Completing a cam actuating device in 30 minutes was one-third faster than the record of 45 minutes; compared with the record of two and a half hours to complete a cam actuating device on the slotting machine, it was four times faster. But Wang Chonglun did not think so. He was not satisfied with his achievements. He was continuing to consider how to shorten the 30 minutes, and how to improve his production plan even more.

He revised his production plan again and again. He found that every time he finished making a cam actuating device, it would take two or three minutes to remove it and install another one, and he felt that this was a loophole. So he specially made an L-shaped tool. With this tool, he could save 30 seconds each time he installed and removed a cam actuating device.

Some people looked down on these dozens of seconds, saying: "What do these small bits of time amount to?"

However, Wang Chonglun felt that saving 30 seconds for each work meant saving 300 seconds or 3,000 seconds a day. If a worker could save hundreds or thousands of seconds in production everywhere, and everyone could do this, millions of people could save a considerable and astonishing amount of time.

In the past, the working time for each cam actuating device on the slotting machine was two and a half hours; later, the planer only needed 45 minutes; then it was shortened from 45 minutes to 30 minutes; now, the planer could usually complete a cam actuating device in 19 minutes. Our Wang Chonglun has closely linked his labor with the great cause of the country's socialist industrialization. You see, he has increased production efficiency by six and a half times at once. The work that an ordinary person would take seven and a half days to complete, Wang Chonglun can complete in just one day.

This is not Wang Chonglun's latest production record. When the planer was making ratchet wheels [Note 3], a newer record emerged. At first, the slotting machine made one in one hour and fifteen minutes, now it takes only five minutes to make one. The production efficiency has increased by fourteen times at once.

Wang Chonglun's new production records are constantly emerging. The story of Wang Chonglun recorded here is just the beginning. This is because Wang Chonglun is still very young, he is only 26 years old this year, and his career has just begun. Let us all wish him to create newer achievements for our country in the future.

Note 1, Note 2, Note 3: All are parts of the rock drill. The rock drill is a pneumatic tool used in mines.

    王崇伦的故事
    本报记者　陆灏
    一
    他穿着一套蓝色的整齐的制服，背着一只粪筐，粪筐里面有两三堆马粪在晃来晃去。他慢慢地没精打彩地在街上走过，人们都向他投来惊异的目光。
    在他经过一个篮球场的时候，热闹的球赛勾起了他的球瘾，这个平常好打球的小伙子，身不由己地走了过去。
    他马上被人发觉了，立刻就有人叫他：“王崇伦，王崇伦，来打一个吧。”
    这位机械工人背着粪筐的奇怪的样子，惊动了很多人。有人就夸奖说：“啊！王崇伦，你真勤俭，歇工还捡粪呢。”
    球赛自然而然地停下来了，熟人们向王崇伦围过来。
    他的脸通红通红，既然已经走过来，又不好意思马上溜走，他打算应付一下，把问题避开，就答讪着说：“别扯淡了，还是打球吧。”
    熟人当中有一个突然问他：“今天不是星期天，你怎么能在家啊！”
    这真使王崇伦有口难开，他强打精神而又泄气地辩护说：“不是星期天，我自己也可以给自己放假啊！”王崇伦说这句话时，虽然脸上在笑，但心里是很难过的。
      “工人阶级还可以自己给自己放假吗？”
      “这是怎么回事啊？”
      “准是和谁闹了蹩扭了，你快说，我们帮助你解决。”
    大家你一句，我一句，关切地问着，说着，很多人为他的意外的回答惊住了。
    王崇伦觉得瞒着这样的事也实在没有什么意思，就把为什么没有上班的原因给大家一五一十说了一遍。最后，他还是无可奈何地摊着两只手说：
  “我知道这事不对头，但我妈妈不让我去上班，我有什么办法。”
    大家知道王崇伦是很孝顺妈妈的，妈妈说什么，他听什么，这次他没有去上班，准是又听了他妈妈什么话了。
      “你太成问题了。你母亲讲的话，你也不用自
  己的脑袋想一想吗？”
     “你的嘴原来是只会说别人啊！”
      “你是一个青年团员，你想想，这样做对吗？”
    说是责备，还不如说这是人与人之间的一种高尚的关切。一种离开了集体想寻找个人出路给他带来的痛苦剧烈地震动了他，他懊悔地说：“我不对，我已经这样做了怎么办？”
    “那不要紧，你明天照常上班就是了。”
    “你妈妈要是不愿意，我们大伙儿给你妈妈去说说。”
    “我们送你回家吧。”
    “不用了，我自己回去能说。”他想，我那么大一个人，还要人家送回去，这像什么话呢。他走回家来，心里窝囊极了。他想自己为一点点小事儿打旋子，出来进去，挺大的个儿，这像什么话。他想过去身上穿破布渣渣的日子，怎么忘得干干净净了呢？
    一进门，他就给妈妈说：“我可不能再在家里呆下去了。”
    他妈妈惊讶地说：“你怎么啦？你又听信谁的话了？”
      “像这样呆下去，人家光看我的笑话，我受不了。”
      “别人又不养活我们，你听他们的话干什么！”
      “不行。我是一个青年人，别人都说我这事办得不对头。光我一个人走路，我能走到那里去？”
      “他们都说些什么？”他的妈妈怀疑地问。
  “人们都说光想照顾自己利益的人，实际上他
  一辈子也不会得到什么利益。谁也说咱们的想法是
  过时的了。”他又向妈妈说：“为了想涨工资，你让我歇工到私营工厂去，结果我现在在家里捡粪，这能呆下去吗？”
    “有手艺还怕没有活干？”他妈妈还不信服地说。
    “自己看着自己挺聪明，实际上不是那么回事儿。”王崇伦像是在对自己说；又像是在对妈妈说。
    听了这些话，他妈妈的心里不能不有一点点动静，她开始发觉自己的老主意有点蹩扭，就带着忧虑的口气问他：“那你打算怎么办？”
    “我明天就上班去。”
    娘儿俩个正说着说着，忽听见门外有人叫：
      “王崇伦在家吗？”
    一听这声音挺熟悉，知道是车间的支部书记来串门了。他的妈妈赶紧把他推到对面那个屋子里，要他藏起来；一面答应说：“请进来吧。”
    支部书记进了房门就问：“王崇伦到那里去了？”
      “捡粪去了。”
    “老太太，能不能找一找他，我想和他说几句话。”
    他的妈妈一面答应着；一面就往外走。她打算到街上去转个圈，回来说找不见，就算了。可是，王崇伦在那个屋子实在呆不住了。他现在的心里说不上是个什么味道。在旧社会，他去厂里上班，像只狗似的，根本没有人答理他；现在自己不上班，干部还到家里来，自己反躲着不见……他看见妈妈走出屋去，紧跟一步走了出来，对妈妈说：“人家来了，我在这里变把戏，这怎么行？”他不管妈妈同意不同意，回头走向他的房间去了。
    王崇伦一时不知说什么好，还是支部书记先开口：“这几天，脑袋里想些什么？”
    他难为情地简单地说了一句：“乱七八糟。”
   “怎么样？这两天歇得并不好受吧。”
    王崇伦点点头，表示很同意支部书记的意见。他说：“前几天，我因为少挣工资不乐意；现在我才知道，一个工人如果离开了大伙儿，离开了自己的工厂，那痛苦才大呢。”
    这一回，支部书记的说话就比刚才严肃多了。他说：“只有把国家的利益和个人的利益溶化在一起的人，他才能够愉快和从不感到孤独。”
    这几句很简单的话，正打在王崇伦的心坎上。他想起这几天来心里别扭的情形，想起刚才在篮球场上碰到的事情，想起自己稀里糊涂干的这样一件不漂亮的……
    支部书记好像很了解似地问他：“是不是决定明天就上班去？”
  “对，我明天就上班去。”王崇伦肯定地回答说。
    他妈妈一直在听他们说话，她越听，越发觉她的儿子不和她站在一起了。
    二
    王崇伦一回到厂里，那阳光灿烂的车间充满着家庭似地温暖。
    他虽然并没有几天不到厂里来，但现在却好像是回到了一个离别了很久的地方。车间里出现了新的生产捷报，机床上已经换上新的产品了。
    人们见他回来，亲亲热热地叫着他，喊着他，这个说：“王师傅，你可回来了。”那个说：“王师傅，我们可想你呢，咱们在一块多好啊。”他心里热辣辣地，一时说不上话来。
    他回到厂里不久以后，车间里做一种叫拉杆的零件。大家知道，这是给志愿军做的活儿，心里都很高兴。
    可是，在铣床上作拉杆，只能慢慢地一次干一根，而且废品很多。但当时交货的时间却很紧迫。铣床上的工人们想试做一种新工具，希望从每次做一根，改成每次同时做十根，试验了很多次，全失败了。
    王崇伦在刨床上干着别的活，他见到这种情形，觉得自己也应该来参加试验，不能让抗美援朝的任务受到影响。于是在上班时细心研究铣床上的新工具为什么会失败，回到家里，闷声不响从墙上拆下几块砖来，叠成新工具的样子。他妈妈看见了，问他：
    “你从那儿弄来的砖头？”
      “墙上拆下来的。”
    “你是不是疯了？”
    “我没有疯才干这事呢。”
    他妈妈见说不过他，也就走了。他晚上熬夜，白天照样上班，一连忙了好几天，终于搞成了一个新工具。
    当王崇伦搞成的新工具要在铣床上试验的时候，大家把他围得密不透风。人越多，他越发慌，心砰砰地跳，全身紧张极了。他暗暗对自己说：千万别出洋相。可是，那铣床一转动，一个筋斗，拉杆连工具，翻了个身，滚下来了。他脑袋糊的一下，汗??地落下来，把衬衣都湿透了，耳朵边只听见一片喧嚷，意见纷纷。
    有人说：“别人干不了，咱们还能干得了。”
    有人悲观地说：“够呛。”
    有人慢悠悠地挺凉快地说反话：“这工具不坏，真好！”
    王崇伦听到这些话，脑袋胀得好大好大，正在走不能走，说不能说，抹不开脸的时候，支部书记走来替他解了围。支部书记想了个办法，让王崇伦跟着他出去了。
    王崇伦搭拉着脑袋，走出厂门回家去。他一面走，一面想：为什么新工具会翻筋斗呢？怎么样就能不翻筋斗了呢？他边走边想，低头见到地上有一根树枝，样子和拉杆差不多，他拾起来，放在手臂上，用手拨树枝，树枝就转身移动。他想，现在碰到的就是这个问题，能想办法解决这个问题，新工具就好办了。
    他回到家里，整个身心被创造拉杆新工具的失败所攫夺了。他沮丧地而又不服气地想着：难道拉杆工具就这样算失败了吗？
    正在这时候，他听见支部书记又在门外喊他的名字了。
      “请进来吧。”他并没有站起来，淡淡地说了一句。只要一听这种声音，就知道他现在是怀着多么大的心事。
      “王崇伦，怎么样？是不是来了一点火？”
    王崇伦为了装作镇静，故意想把话说得轻松些，他说：“没有火，喝糖水了。”
      “我希望你能坚持下去，不要因为听到那些话就泄气。”
      “没有啥，我是个青年团员，这正是锻炼我自己呢。”
    支部书记把张明山创造“反围盘”的事迹讲给王崇伦听，又说：“英雄模范都是在困难中产生的。张明山遇到那样大的困难都克服了，我相信你的困难也一定能够克服的。”
    “我的困难不算什么。”王崇伦百分之百同意支部书记的意见：“和张明山遇到的困难比较，我的困难就算不了什么了。”他嘴里说这话，眼睛就像明亮了些，心里也就宽松了一些，困难真好像并不那样压得他喘不过气来了。
    那天夜里，他睡到半夜，抬起头来，眼睛落到炕头前那张木头凳子上，心里猛然一亮。他想，凳子的腿活动了，只要加些木片，凳腿就可以不转动，我那个新工具，为什么不可以也同样用这个办法呢？
    他回到厂里，人们还没有上班，他给车间的领导同志一谈，大家都鼓励他试验试验。但王崇伦说：“有人在，我就冒汗，你们都不在我才试验呢！”
    人们听了他的话，都一个一个出去了。刨床旁只剩下他的一个徒弟。
    “我能不能站在旁边看看呢？”他的徒弟说。
      “可以吧。”
    师徒两人忙着试验起来。一试，那新工具，完全好用。铣床上一次做一根拉杆，常常出废品；用这新工具，可以同时做两根，质量达到百分之百。他的徒弟一看，高兴地说：“王师傅，这好使极了。”王崇伦的心里当然乐得不行，可是脸上却仍然不动声色。他故意抿住嘴说：“不一定好使，等一回再说。”他想宁可晚一点高兴，可别喜欢得太早了。
    王崇伦的新工具同样也适合铣床使用，但铣床上有的工人觉得自己没有研究成，反而要用别人的办法，这在面子上不好看。有人提议用王崇伦的办法试试吧；有的却不同意。还说：“我们人多，机器多，一根一根干，也能完成任务。”直到最后，还剩下一千多根拉杆了，交货的时间已到，但任务还没有完成。工会主席张成山觉得这太不像话了，他对铣床上的工人们说：“咱们还是用王崇伦的工具生产吧。”在这时候，有个工人叫李文兰的还怀疑地问：“只剩下一千多根了，还用吗？”张成山坚决地说：“剩一根，我们也要用。”这一夜，王崇伦为了帮助张成山在铣床上安装新工具，弄到过半夜，张成山看他太困了，要他去车间旁边的小楼上睡一会儿。他躺了一会儿，那里能睡得着，只听那铣床上发出呼呼呼的响声，根据这响声，他能听出来，那是同时干几根拉杆的声音。他连忙起来，伸出脑袋喊：“张师傅，怎么样？”张成山高兴地回答他说：“好使，太好使了，谢谢你，你的工具成功了。”王崇伦一听，连忙说：“我还要谢谢你，没有你，这工具还推广不了呢。”
    用王崇伦创造的新工具生产，一天一夜，一千多根拉杆，全部做完了。要是用旧办法，需要两天两夜才能做完，特别是废品太多，质量没有保证。
    他满怀喜悦地走回家去，这种喜悦只有工作得很好的人才能够得到。他回到家里，家里今天吃好的，全家人都在等他回来。
    这小北屋，暖洋洋地，炉火通红，一家人围着炕桌坐下来了。桌子上摆着白面馒头，还弄了好几个菜。王崇伦一看这，心里很有感触，他咬了一口馒头，觉得有很多话涌上心来，他看全家都坐好了，说：
      “我今天能吃这样好的晚饭，我自己深深感谢党，感谢毛主席。”他停了一停，接着说：“我可不知道能不能代表你们说这几句话。”他的眼睛特别看了看他妈妈。
    房间里静静地没有一点点声音，连他五岁的儿子晋侠也睁大着眼睛听他的爸爸说话。
      “你还有别的话说吗？”他妈妈似乎有点生气地问他。
     “我还感谢志愿军，没有他们在前方，咱们能吃到这样白的馒头吗？我以后一定好好多干工作，要对得起他们。”
    他说完话以后，他的老婆低着头，没有言语。他的妈妈把筷子往桌上一扔，可真的生气了。
      “你为什么这样说？我一个老娘儿们在家里，什么也不知道，你们在外面开会上课，回来什么也不说，现在又来批评我了。”她不服气地为自己辩护说：“难道拥护共产党，拥护毛主席，就光许你
  一个人拥护吗？”
    那天的晚饭虽然吃得并不很痛快，但是王崇伦心里是很喜欢的，他觉得工作和家庭的情况，都是可以越变越好的。
    三
    一个卡动器〔注一〕，开始在插床上工作的时间，是整整两个半小时。
    插床的工作迟缓，这就使车间卡动器的生产好像患了严重的肠胃病。从车床上下来的活儿到了插床上就被搁住了，因而跟在插床后面工序的铣床、磨床就好像全部瘫痪了一样。在这个时候，最令人心焦的要算是那台刨床，虽然插床很需要有人去帮忙，但这些工作它却一样也不能伸手干。
    新产品的生产暴露了车间里机械设备不平衡的严重情况，它使有的机器忙不开交；有的机器却处于半休息状态；有的机器根本不能参加工作。而最严重的问题是因此会使完成新产品的任务发生很大的困难，生产的时间表有被整个推迟的危险。
    在困难的面前，每一个人有他自己的想法。
    有人说：“再增加四、五台插床，问题就解决了，增加机器那是车间主任和厂长的责任，我们能有什么办法。”
    有人说：“技术人员应该想办法提高机器的生产效率才对。”至于问到他自己，他就说：“我要有能力解决这样复杂的问题，早就当技术员了。”
    有人还提议说：“把一部分卡动器交给另外一个车间去做，困难不就解决了吗？”事实上，别的车间都有自己的生产任务，谁也没有办法来帮这个忙。
    当时，插床上除了要做卡动器以外，后来还要添作反螺姆〔注二〕，本来卡动器都干不了，又要加做反螺姆，插床就更招架不住了。
    一时意见很多，真是说什么的也有。
    王崇伦听了这些意见，他想，这还像主人翁吗？他觉得既是主人翁，就应该把自己的全部力量献给祖国。这几天，他只要一有空，就去站在插床跟前，看着插床工作的情形。他在插床上工作过，知道插床能上下插，是那个圆盘起着大作用，他想要是能把那个圆盘搬个家，安在自己的刨床上，刨床也就能干插床的工作。这样，刨床就闲不了，铣床、磨床也就有了工作。但事实上，这似乎办不到，谁也知道，从来刨床只能躺着干平面的工作，它怎么可能像插床那样立起来工作呢！
    几天以后，那卡动器、反螺姆，在插床跟前越堆越多了，而王崇伦想把圆盘搬家的企图实际上却是行不通。在这种情形下面，他根据以往七次的经验，知道只有创造一个新工具，才能解决生产上的困难。
    为了想这个新工具，王崇伦的脸色渐渐发黄，眼睛也慢慢凹下去了，他的颧骨更显得高高地突了出来。
    这情况急坏了他的妈妈和老婆，婆媳两人嘀嘀咕咕，觉得家庭里发生了严重的事情。
    “崇伦老是这么熬，把身体熬垮了，这怎么办？”有一天，他的老婆实在忍不住了，问他的妈妈。
    他的妈妈，自从那次吃晚饭以后，看法也确实大有改变，根据他最近的观察，她知道自己的儿子大约又在琢磨改造什么新工具了。她说：“是啊，谁也不像他，别人全是该工作时工作，该休息时休息，只有他特别。”这位老太太，现在与其说她是在责备自己的儿子，还不如说，她是正在高兴地夸奖他的儿子。她继续和她的媳妇说：“咱们想个办法，能让他做好工作；又能不累垮他的身体。”
    “妈，那你对他说一说吧。”
    老太太摇摇头说：“我说没有用，他还以为我不愿意他好好工作呢。”她清楚地知道崇伦一直非常孝顺她，但如果拉他的后腿，她知道妈妈的话就已经不会像以前那样发生很大的威力了。
    两个人想了很久，还是他的老婆想出了主意。她们知道王崇伦最爱他的儿子晋侠，她的老婆说：
  “到该睡的时候，就让晋侠到小桌上去玩，一玩，崇伦心里准麻烦，这样就做不成事了，可以休息了。”
    但是，很可惜，这个办法并没有成功。小晋侠玩了一会儿却为王崇伦说得乖乖地睡去了。第二天，反而连晋侠也知道他的爸爸在干什么了。好心的邻居们最近看见王崇伦面黄肌瘦，他们有时也来关心地问问他的妈妈和媳妇：王崇伦最近怎么回事。这时候，老太太总要呶呶嘴暗示邻人们去问小晋侠。如果有人真的去问他：“你的爸爸在干什么？”小小的五岁的晋侠，他会仰着小红脸回答你说：“我的爸爸在造工具，找窍门。”
    大约经过了半个月的时间，王崇伦终于画成了一副新工具的草图。
    王崇伦创造的新工具，立刻受到了全车间每一个人的欢迎。车间主任韩剑光一看这张草图，马上肯定了王崇伦的创造，能解决车间生产的大困难，他赶紧把新工具所需要的零件及时分配到各工序去制造。技术员胡延林专门派了人帮助王崇伦画出新工具的详细图纸。工人李海峰、郝国富利用自己的休息时间来帮助装配新工具。那个过去在铣床上曾经怀疑使用王崇伦拉杆工具的李文兰，他也笑呵呵地来看王崇伦的新创造，他看到这个新工具上没有分度盘，他觉得这不能完全保证质量，他提议把铣床上用的那种分度盘改造一下搬到新工具上用，王崇伦马上接受了这个意见。
    一切零件都准备好了，可是新工具还缺少一个底座。这个底座，开头没有把它当成是件难事，觉得翻砂铸一下就能解决，想不到当真要用它，麻烦就来了。铸一个新底座，要通过设计科，又要通过生产科，最后才能分派到另外一个车间去铸造，打乱别的单位的生产计划不要说，特别是时间成问题，铸造成了，至少也得两三个月。这时候，王崇伦又想起了张明山，他知道张明山创造“反围盘”，那些材料都是从废铁堆里找出来的。他想，我为什么不能到废铁堆里去找呢？于是，不管是淋着雨水，不管是天快要摸黑，他走遍了鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂的大大小小的废铁堆。一直到了第四天，看到了一个旧部件，有一大半还被压在铁堆里，他使劲拉，脚踩在乱铁架里，把那双新皮鞋也撕破了。他什么也顾不得，一瞧那旧部件，样子和大小正和自己需要的底座差不多，这一下可把王崇伦乐坏了。
    新工具试验的结果，证明刨床有了它，过去不能做的工作现在能做了，而且比插床还能干。一个卡动器，在插床上工作需要两小时半；而在刨床上，有了这个新工具，只要四十五分钟就做成了。最出人意外的，是那个新工具，不但能做卡动器，凿岩机上过去不能干的其他十四种零件，现在也样样都能干，于是人们给这个新工具取了一个名字，叫“万能工具胎”。
      “万能工具胎”把原来卡动器的生产能力一下子提高了两倍多，车间里因为机械设备不平衡而引起的生产不均衡的情况，大体上是得到解决了。
    当人人都在称赞“万能工具胎”的时候，王崇伦的心里却又在想着别的。
    那时候，工具车间正在开始讨论一九五三年的生产计划。有人订生产计划，第一条写的是：出勤率达到百分之百。不迟到，不早退。下面还注上特殊例外；第二条是保证完成生产任务；第三条保证不出废品……
    你这样订，我也这样订，结果很多人的生产计划是大同小异，相差不多。王崇伦看这些生产计划第一条，几乎人人都有，不过有的没有写特殊例外；第二条、第三条，有的只是把“保证”两个字改成“坚决”而已。
    他觉得国家的生产计划交给工人们自己来订，这是工人真正当了主人了，那自己订计划，就得像个主人的样子。他想我既然每天上班，我的生产计划里边就用不着订“出勤率达到百分之百”。他觉得四十五分钟做一个卡动器还是太慢了。在他看来，订生产计划，只说完成多少，而不说要超额完成多少，只说现在能做到多少，而不考虑要用些什么具体办法来争取再完成多少，那太保守了。
    他发现在工作的时候，说不定在什么时候刀头就会断，一天说不定就要断四、五个，每换一个刀头，需要四、五分钟时间，他的生产计划里就提出要想法改变刀头的形状。结果工作一天，刀头真的可以一个也不断，这样每天就可以节省二十多分钟。
    他还专门为自己做了一个工具箱，整整齐齐地摆着自己使用的扳子、钢尺、油石，为的是使自己在工作时使用的工具能手到拿来，尽一切可能节省能够节省的时间。
    他采用了很多节省时间、提高生产的具体办法，使本来刨床需要四十五分钟做完一个卡动器的生产纪录，在不久以后，只需要三十分钟就可以了。
    也许有人以为这种情况已经不坏了，用三十分钟做完一个卡动器，比起四十五分钟的纪录，已经快了三分之一；和插床上两小时半做一个卡动器的纪录相比，已经快了四倍。可是王崇伦却不是这样想，他并没有满足自己的成就，他正在继续考虑怎样才能使三十分钟的时间更缩短些，怎样才能使自己的生产计划更加提高些。
    他一次又一次地不断地修订自己的生产计划。他发现自己在每一次做完一个卡动器以后，卸下来，再装上一个，就得费两三分钟，他觉得这是一个漏洞。于是专门做了一个拐形工具，有了这个工具，每次上卸卡动器，就可以节省三十秒钟。
    有人却瞧不起这几十秒钟，他们说：“这星星点点的，算得了什么？”
    可是，王崇伦却觉得做一个活能节省三十秒钟，一天做几十个活，那就能节省三百秒，三千秒。一个工人在生产中，假若处处都能节省几百秒、几千秒，每个人都能够这样，千百万个人就能节省可观的惊人的时间。
    过去，每个卡动器在插床上工作的时间是两小时半；后来刨床只要四十五分钟；再从四十五分钟缩短成为三十分钟；现在，刨床通常十九分钟就可以做好一个卡动器了。我们的王崇伦，他把自己的劳动和祖国社会主义工业化的伟大事业紧紧地联系在一起了。你看他把生产效率一下子提高了六倍半，平常一个人要七天半做完的工作，王崇伦只要一天就把它干完了。
    这还并不是王崇伦的最新的生产纪录。刨床在做制逆轮〔注三〕的时候，又出现了更新的纪录。开始插床是一小时十五分做一个，现在是五分钟就可以做一个，生产效率一下子提高了十四倍。
    王崇伦的生产新纪录还在不断地涌现，这里记下的王崇伦的故事，只是刚刚开了一个头。这是因为王崇伦还很年青，他今年才二十六岁，他的事业也不过才刚刚开始。让我们大家都祝福他在未来的日子里，为我们祖国创造更新的成就。注一、注二、注三：全是凿岩机的零件。凿岩机是矿山用的一种风动工具。（附图片）
