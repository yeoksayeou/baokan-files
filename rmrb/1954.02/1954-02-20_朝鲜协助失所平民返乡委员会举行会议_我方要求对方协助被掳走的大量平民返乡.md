Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: The Committee for Assisting Displaced Civilians in Returning Home held a meeting on the 18th.

At the meeting, our side notified the other side that we have widely announced the contents of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement in our military control area, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and instructed the local civil affairs authorities to handle the registration of displaced civilians willing to return home and foreign civilians willing to go to the U.S. military control area. According to the registration results, our side will assist about ten foreign civilians to go to the U.S. military control area. However, because our side fundamentally opposed and never adopted the policy of forcibly abducting civilians from occupied areas, which the other side used during the war, and the actual situation of the war’s progress and changes made it almost impossible for civilians to move north during the war, there are virtually no displaced civilians from the other side in our military control area. Furthermore, the civilians in our area are now living and working in peace and contentment. Therefore, so far, no displaced civilians wishing to go to the other side's military control area have come to register.

The other side claimed at the meeting that it was only prepared to assist about seventy displaced civilians to return to our side.

Our side immediately pointed out that the other side had forcibly abducted a large number of civilians from our areas it temporarily occupied during the war. According to the U.S. side, the number totaled 1.5 million. News reports from the other side described their miserable conditions of unemployment, starvation, and displacement in the other side's area. Therefore, among these displaced civilians, there must be many who want to return home. Our side firmly demanded that the other side should effectively announce the contents of Article 59 of the Armistice Agreement in its military control area, guarantee that all displaced civilians in the other side's military control area have the freedom to express their willingness to return to their hometowns, and truly provide these displaced civilians with the necessary assistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 19th: The U.S. side claimed at the meeting of the Committee for Assisting Displaced Civilians in Returning Home on the 18th that only about seventy of our displaced civilians in South Korea were willing to return to their hometowns. This number is less than two ten-thousandths of the 1.5 million displaced civilians from our side in South Korea openly admitted by the Syngman Rhee government, which proves that the U.S. side has no sincerity in assisting the large number of our displaced civilians in South Korea to return to their hometowns.

The fact that the U.S. side forcibly abducted a large number of civilians from our areas it temporarily occupied during the war is a well-known fact. The people of Kaesong are witnesses to the U.S. side's abduction of civilians. In the eight days and nights from December 12 to December 20, 1950, they personally witnessed batches of our civilians being escorted southward through Kaesong by the U.S.-Rhee bandit troops. In Kaesong alone, about 60 percent of the residents were abducted at that time.

At the same time, our side has ample materials to prove that the U.S. side abducted a large number of our civilians during the war. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pointed out in a telegram to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on April 15, 1951: The U.S.-Rhee bandit troops abducted more than 25,000 civilians when they withdrew from Yangyang County, Gangwon Province. International organizations that conducted investigations in Korea have also confirmed this crime by the U.S. side. The report "Report on American Crimes in Korea" published by the International Association of Democratic Lawyers proved that on December 7, 1950, when the U.S. troops withdrew from Sinchon-myeon, Harrison, the commander of the U.S. occupation forces in the area, openly instructed U.S. military officers and Rhee puppet military officers to force the residents of the area to move south with the U.S. troops, and anyone who remained would be regarded as an enemy in combat. In December 1950, when the U.S. troops withdrew from An'yue County, they also ordered the residents to go south with them.

According to civilians who were abducted to South Korea in the winter of 1950 and later escaped back to Kaesong, after the U.S. side abducted a large number of civilians to South Korea, they forced the young people among them to join the Rhee puppet army, and other able-bodied men went to Busan and other places to do hard labor, while a large number of the elderly, weak, women, and children were left to wander the streets and rely on begging for a living.

The facts are very clear: among these displaced civilians who have endured the miserable life of displacement, there must be many who demand to return home. The U.S. side must, in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, give our displaced civilians in South Korea who long to return home the opportunity to freely express their wishes, and earnestly assist them in returning to their hometowns.

    朝鲜协助失所平民返乡委员会举行会议
    我方要求对方协助被掳走的大量平民返乡
     【新华社开城十九日电】协助失所平民返乡委员会在十八日举行会议。
    会上我方通知对方我方已按照停战协定的规定在我方军事控制地区内广为宣布停战协定第五十九款的内容，并责成各地民政当局办理愿意返乡的失所平民及愿意前往美方军事控制地区的外籍平民的登记工作。根据登记的结果，我方将协助十名左右的外籍平民前往美方军事控制地区，但由于战争期间我方根本反对也从未采用对方所采用的以强力掳走占领区的平民的政策，而此次战争的进行与变化的实际情况又使得平民在战争过程中几乎不可能向北迁移，故我方军事控制地区内事实上就几乎没有对方的失所平民，而我区的平民现又都过着安居乐业的生活，因此迄今并无愿往对方军事控制地区的返乡平民前来登记。
    对方在会上声称它仅准备协助七十名左右的失所平民回至我方。
    我方当即指出对方在战争期间曾自它所暂时占领的我方地区用武力掳走大量平民，据美方自称，其数目共达一百五十万，对方的新闻报道并描述了他们在对方地区内失业挨饿颠沛流离的悲惨状况，因此在这些失所平民中必然有许多人是要回家的。我方坚决要求对方应切实将停战协定第五十九款的内容在对方军事控制地区广为宣布，保证对方军事控制地区内的所有失所平民都有自由表达其愿意回返家乡的机会，并真正给予这些失所平民以必要的协助。
       【新华社开城十九日电】美方十八日在协助失所平民返乡委员会的会议上声称：流离在南朝鲜的我方失所平民中，只有七十名左右愿意返回家乡。这个数字还不到李承晚政府公开承认的流离在南朝鲜的我方一百五十万失所平民的两万分之一，这证明美方没有诚意协助流离在南朝鲜的大量我方失所平民返回家乡。
    美方在战争期间曾自它所暂时占领的我方地区用武力掳走大量平民，已是人所共知的事实。开城人民就是美方掳掠平民的见证人。在一九五○年十二月十二日到二十日的八天八夜里，他们亲眼看见美李匪军接连不断地押解了大批我方平民路经开城南下。仅开城一地，在那时就有百分之六十左右的居民被掳走。
    同时，我方手里掌握有充分的材料证明美方在战争期间掳走了大批我方平民。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相在一九五一年四月十五日致联合国大会主席的电报指出：美李匪军从江原道襄阳郡撤退时掳走两万五千多平民。在朝鲜进行过调查的国际团体也都证实了美方的这种罪行。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团发表的“关于美国在朝鲜的罪行的报告”证明：一九五○年十二月七日美军撤出信川面时，该地的美国占领军司令哈里逊公开对美军军官和李伪军军官训话，要他们强迫该地居民随美军南移，任何留下的人都将作为战斗中的敌人看待。一九五○年十二月美军自安岳郡撤退时，也命令居民和他们一块南去。
    据在一九五○年冬天被掳往南朝鲜后又逃回开城的平民说，美方在把大量平民掳往南朝鲜后，就强迫他们中的青年参加李伪军，其他的能够劳动的男子到釜山等地去做苦工，大量的老弱妇孺则流落在街头依靠乞食为生。
    事实十分明显，在这些饱尝颠沛流离的悲惨生活的我方失所平民中，必然会有许多人要求回家。美方必须按照停战协定的规定，给予流离在南朝鲜的渴望返乡的我方失所平民以自由表达自己愿望的机会，并且切实地协助他们往回家乡。
