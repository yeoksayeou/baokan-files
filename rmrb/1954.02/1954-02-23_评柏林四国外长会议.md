    The Soviet, French, British, and American Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting, which the whole world is closely watching, has studied many pressing international issues based on the agenda and various proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation, including reviewing measures to ease current international tensions. Although differences exist among the four governments on various issues, and they are significant, the meeting, thanks to the significant efforts of the Soviet delegation, finally reached two agreements: first, to convene a meeting of the five powers of China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, as well as other directly concerned countries; second, the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and Britain will take measures to smoothly resolve the issue of disarmament, or at least substantially reduce armaments. At the same time, the meeting fully exchanged views on the German question and the Austrian peace treaty. Many Soviet proposals pointed the way to resolving these pressing international issues. Although the meeting did not reach agreements on these issues, they were not removed from the agenda. Foreign Minister Molotov stated that efforts must continue and be made more resolutely to resolve these issues. The convening of the Berlin meeting, the agreements reached at the meeting, and the possibility of reducing differences due to Soviet efforts indicate that the path of consultation among major powers can be restored and that pressing international issues can be resolved through consultation. This is of positive significance.
    The entire process of the Berlin meeting vividly demonstrated the two fundamentally different positions and attitudes between the Soviet government and Western countries, especially the United States government. The Soviet delegation, proceeding from the standpoint of easing tensions and consolidating peace, put forward a series of constructive and practical proposals for various agenda items, and sought to reach agreements with a truly sincere attitude of consultation. Many newspapers and news agencies in Western countries have acknowledged the fact that the Soviet Union has consistently sought reconciliation. Even people in the American delegation admitted that "Molotov's attitude was conciliatory and friendly." However, the U.S. delegation adopted a negative attitude from the beginning, simply rejecting Soviet proposals without putting forward any positive proposals of its own. Reuters reported on January 29 that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting "generally, the situation is: Molotov takes the initiative and puts forward suggestions at the meeting, while the West rejects, criticizes, or ignores these suggestions." This attitude of the American delegation is completely consistent with its policy of maintaining international tensions. Facts show that the American delegation had no intention of enabling the Berlin meeting to achieve success. It is no accident that the American propaganda machine has been spreading a pessimistic atmosphere that the Berlin meeting could not achieve any agreements. It was precisely these desires and practices of the American delegation that prevented agreements from being reached on issues such as the German question and the Austrian peace treaty, and prevented the Berlin meeting from playing a greater role in promoting world peace.
    The Soviet delegation's proposal to convene a five-power conference to review measures to ease international tensions is in line with the vital interests of all nations (regardless of size) and is conducive to safeguarding international peace and security. As Foreign Minister Molotov convincingly explained, this proposal would improve relations between major powers, especially correct the abnormal situation in which some countries disregard the enormous changes that have taken place in Asia due to the emergence of the People's Republic of China and still intend to do whatever they want in the region. Moreover, convening a five-power conference could effectively discuss pressing issues such as disarmament among countries around the world, especially the five major powers, developing international trade relations, and resolving various international disputes. Therefore, the Soviet proposal immediately received widespread support around the world, so that Western countries finally did not dare to completely reject it.
    The Soviet Union also proposed convening a world general disarmament conference in 1954, linking the disarmament plan with the simultaneous resolution of the issue of atomic weapons. As countries continue to expand their armaments, especially as atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction are constantly being manufactured and stockpiled, the danger of a new war is increasing, and at the same time, the burden of military spending on the working people of capitalist countries is increasing. This situation has long aroused the unease and opposition of people of all countries. Therefore, this Soviet proposal made it impossible for the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to maintain a resistant attitude, and they had to agree that the four countries would continue to exchange views on the issue of disarmament, or at least on resolving substantial reductions in armaments, in order to reach an agreement.
    The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting focused on discussing the issue of ensuring European security, which is completely necessary. Because everyone can see that the international aggressive group headed by the reactionary forces of the United States is trying to establish the so-called "European Defense Community" to continue to implement a policy of arms expansion and war preparation in Europe in order to exacerbate international tensions. The main purpose of this military alliance plan of the six Western European countries is to create aggressive military blocs in Europe to revive German militarism. This bloc will inevitably create antagonism among European countries and a long-term division of Europe. This will not only plunge Europe into serious unrest, but also make it impossible to resolve the German question in accordance with the requirements of ensuring European security. Therefore, resolving the issue of ensuring European security has become an urgent task.
    The Soviet proposals for ensuring European security and the draft "All-European Treaty on Collective Security in Europe" principle put forward at the Berlin meeting are fully in line with the peaceful aspirations of the people of European countries, and have therefore been welcomed and supported by peace-loving people around the world. Even public opinion in capitalist countries has expressed support. For example, the French newspaper Le Monde believes that "this plan is the only serious way to replace the European Defense Community," and the British Daily Herald said that this proposal is a "shocking program." The Soviet proposal advocates that all European countries, including the two Germanys, participate in this treaty on an equal footing to jointly establish a system for ensuring collective security in Europe in order to prevent damage to European peace. Obviously, this is the correct way to eliminate threats to European security and antagonism among European countries, and to prevent the establishment of aggressive military blocs by a few European countries. It can also remove the main obstacles to resolving the German question, thereby facilitating the resolution of the German question. The Soviet proposal is so clear and reasonable that as long as the countries concerned have a desire for peaceful cooperation, there is no reason to reject it.
    Although Britain and France also recognized the need to ensure European security, they followed the policy of the United States, tried their best to defend the "European Defense Community" plan, and rejected the Soviet proposal along with the United States without serious consideration. Nevertheless, the concept of European collective security advocated by the Soviet Union will deeply penetrate people's hearts, and it will become the goal of the peace-loving people of European countries to strive for.
    The German question is primarily a matter for the German people themselves. It is closely related to ensuring European security and should be resolved in accordance with the interests of consolidating European security and the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany. The Soviet delegation, based on this principle, put forward suggestions for preparing a peace treaty with Germany and convening a peace conference on the peace treaty with Germany, as well as a draft of the principles of the treaty. At the same time, the Soviet government suggested efforts to promote an agreement between East and West Germany to create a temporary all-German government, and to achieve the true reunification of Germany through free all-German elections held by the German people themselves. Moreover, in order to prevent foreign pressure during German elections, the Soviet government also suggested that foreign troops withdraw from East and West Germany before the elections, leaving only a limited number of troops. However, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France resolutely refused to conduct discussions on the reasonable basis proposed by the Soviet Union. They insisted that the conditions for preparing a peace treaty with Germany were not yet in place, and opposed starting to draft the treaty; and they strongly claimed that East and West Germany could not reach an agreement and that the German people were not capable of resolving their own reunification issue. They put forward the so-called "Eden Plan" and insisted on holding so-called "free elections under international supervision" in order to facilitate the intervention and manipulation of all-German elections by the three Western countries, so that the remnants of fascism and militarism in Germany could regain control of the all-German regime. It is clear that the position of the United States, Britain, and France is to make the resolution of the German question subordinate to the purpose of establishing the European Defense Community and reviving German militarist forces, rather than subordinate to the purpose of restoring Germany to a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful country. This is clearly not allowed by the peace-loving people of Germany and European countries, so it is also unworkable.
    At the same time, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France also rejected the constructive suggestions put forward by the Soviet Union near the end of the meeting that would help improve the German situation and promote understanding between East and West Germany, such as the four countries agreeing to reduce Germany's financial and economic obligations due to the consequences of the war, the four countries reaching an agreement on the number and equipment of police in East and West Germany, and suggesting that East and West Germany establish two all-German committees to promote economic and cultural relations between East and West Germany. This clearly shows that the United States, Britain, and France do not want to truly peacefully resolve the German question and are unwilling to allow the German people to solve the urgent task of unifying Germany themselves. However, the Soviet delegation stated that the Soviet government hopes that the four governments will continue to work hard to strive for a satisfactory solution to the German question in accordance with the interests of consolidating European peace.
    The Austrian peace treaty issue could originally have been resolved at the Berlin meeting. However, the plans of the United States, Britain, and France to revive German militarism and establish a Western European military bloc are also hindering the resolution of the Austrian peace treaty issue. People remember that Hitler's aggression plan began with the annexation of Austria. Now, the West German monopoly capital and militarist forces, supported by international reactionary forces and holding power in the Bonn government, are planning a new conspiracy to merge Germany and Austria. Such a historical tragedy must never be repeated. At the Berlin meeting, the Soviet proposals regarding the Austrian peace treaty stipulated that Austria should guarantee not to participate in any alliance or military bloc and should not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory; at the same time, the withdrawal of the four countries' occupation troops in Austria should be suspended until the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet position is in line with the interests of consolidating European peace and safeguarding the national independence of the Austrian people. However, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France opposed the Soviet proposals, which ultimately prevented an agreement from being reached on the Austrian peace treaty issue.
    The failure of the Berlin meeting to reach agreements on the German question and the Austrian peace treaty issue shows that the Western countries have no intention of abandoning their current aggressive policy of arms expansion and war preparation, but these issues have not been removed from the agenda. The relevant proposals put forward by the Soviet Union will greatly help the peace-loving people of the world, especially the people of Europe, in their struggle to resolve these issues in the future. The people of our country fully support all the propositions and proposals of the Soviet government at the Berlin meeting. At present, the most urgent task for peace-loving countries and people all over the world is to strive for the smooth convening of the Geneva conference, to strive for the realization of European collective security, and to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue in order to seek the easing of tensions in the Far East and the world. The Chinese people will join the people of the world in continuing to wage unremitting struggles for the peaceful resolution of the current pressing international issues.

    评柏林四国外长会议
    全世界密切关心的苏、法、英、美四国外长会议，根据苏联代表团提出的议程和各项建议，研究了许多迫切的国际问题，包括审查缓和当前国际紧张局势的措施。虽然四国政府在各项问题上的分歧是存在的，并且是很大的，但是，会议在苏联代表团的重大努力下，终于取得了两项协议：第一、召开中、苏、美、英、法五国及其他直接有关国家参加的会议；第二、由苏、美、法、英四国政府采取措施以顺利解决裁军问题，或至少解决大量缩减军备问题。同时，会议对德国问题和对奥和约问题充分交换了意见，苏联的许多建议指引了争取解决这些迫切的国际问题的途径。会议虽然没有对这些问题取得协议，但是这些问题并没有从日程上除掉。莫洛托夫外长表示，必须继续努力，更加坚定不移地争取这些问题的解决。柏林会议的召开，会议所取得的协议以及由于苏联的努力而产生的减少分歧的可能，说明大国协商的道路是可以恢复的，迫切的国际问题是可能经由协商来解决的。这是具有肯定的意义的。
    柏林会议的整个过程，鲜明地表现了苏联政府与西方国家特别是美国政府之间的两个基本不同的立场和态度。苏联代表团从缓和紧张局势和巩固和平的立场出发，对各项议程提出了一系列的建设性的切实建议，并以真正诚恳的协商态度，力求达成协议。西方国家许多报纸和通讯社的报道，都承认了苏联自始至终寻求和解的这个事实。甚至连美国代表团的人士也承认“莫洛托夫的态度是和解的、友好的”。但是，美国代表团则自始就采取了否定的态度，一味拒绝苏联的建议，而它自己又没有提出任何一个积极的建议。路透社一月二十九日报道说：四外长会议“一般说来，情况是：莫洛托夫在会议上操着主动并且提出建议，而西方则是拒绝、批评或不理睬这些建议。”美国代表团的这个态度，和它所奉行的保持国际紧张局势的政策是完全吻合的。事实表明，美国代表团一心不想促成柏林会议获得成就。美国宣传机器一直散布柏林会议不可能获得任何协议的悲观气氛，这不是偶然的。正是美国代表团的这些愿望和做法，使得像德国问题和对奥和约问题未能取得协议，使柏林会议未能对促进世界和平起更大的作用。
    苏联代表团主张召开五大国会议，来审查缓和国际紧张局势的措施的建议，符合于一切民族（不分大小）的切身利益，有利于保障国际和平与安全。正如莫洛托夫外长令人信服地阐明的那样，这个建议将能改善大国关系，特别是矫正某些国家无视在亚洲由于中华人民共和国的出现所发生的巨大变化，而仍然打算在这地区为所欲为的不正常局面。而且，召开五大国会议还可以有效地讨论世界各国、尤其是五大国裁减军备、发展国际贸易关系、解决各项国际争端等迫切问题。因此，苏联的这个建议立即在全世界获得了广泛的支持，以致西方国家终于不敢完全加以拒绝。
    苏联还建议在一九五四年召开世界普遍裁减军备会议，把裁减军备计划和同时解决原子武器的问题联系起来。由于各国继续扩张军备，特别是由于原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器不断地被制造和积存起来，新战争的危险日益增加，同时资本主义国家的劳动人民的军费负担日益加重。这种情况早就引起了各国人民的不安和反对。因此，苏联这个建议使美、英、法三国代表无法坚持抗拒态度，不得不同意四国继续就裁军问题或者至少解决大量缩减军备问题交换意见，以求达成协议。
    四国外长会议曾着重地讨论了保障欧洲安全的问题，这是完全必要的。因为谁都看得到，以美国反动势力为首的国际侵略集团正在力图建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”，来在欧洲继续推行备战政策，以加剧国际紧张局势。这个西欧六国军事联盟计划的主要目的，是在欧洲制造侵略性的军事集团，来复活德国的军国主义。这个集团将不可避免地要造成欧洲国家的对立和欧洲的长期分裂。这不但将使欧洲陷于严重不安，而且也将使德国问题不可能根据保障欧洲安全的要求获得解决。因此，解决保障欧洲安全的问题，就成为当前的一个迫切任务。
    苏联在柏林会议上提出的保障欧洲安全的建议和“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”原则草案，完全符合于欧洲各国人民的和平愿望，因而受到全世界爱好和平人民的欢迎和拥护。连资本主义国家的舆论都表示支持。例如法国世界报都认为“这个方案是代替欧洲防务集团的唯一认真的办法”，英国每日先驱报说这个建议是“震动人心的纲领”。苏联的建议主张由所有的欧洲国家，包括两个德国在内，都以平等地位参加这个条约，来共同建立保障欧洲集体安全的体系，以预防对欧洲和平的破坏。显然，这是消除欧洲安全威胁和欧洲国家的对立、防止少数欧洲国家建立侵略性的军事集团的正确途径。并且也可由此扫除解决德国问题的主要障碍，从而有利于德国问题的解决。苏联的这个建议是如此明确和合理，只要有关国家都怀有和平合作的愿望，原是没有理由加以拒绝的。
    英、法两国虽然也承认保障欧洲安全的必要，但它们竟追随美国的政策，极力为“欧洲防务集团”计划辩护，并且没有经过认真的考虑就和美国一道拒绝了苏联的建议。虽然如此，苏联所倡导的欧洲集体安全观念将会深入人心，它将成为欧洲各国爱好和平人民努力奋斗的目标。
    德国问题，首先是德国人民自己的事情，它与保障欧洲的安全有着密切关系，应当按照巩固欧洲安全和德国和平民主统一的利益来加以解决。苏联代表团就根据这个原则提出了准备对德和约和召开关于对德和约的和平会议的建议及和约原则草案。同时苏联政府建议努力促进东西德之间的协议，产生一个临时的全德政府，而由德国人民自己举行全德自由选举来实现德国的真正统一。并且，为了使德国选举时免受外国压力，苏联政府还建议外国军队在选举前从东德和西德撤退，只留下有限的部队。但是，美、英、法三国外长却断然拒绝在苏联所提出的合理基础上进行讨论。他们硬说准备对德和约的条件还未具备，而反对开始草拟和约；并强称东西德之间无法达成协议，德国人民没有能力解决自己的统一问题。它们提出所谓“艾登计划”，坚持举行所谓“在国际监督下的自由选举”，以便于西方三国干涉和操纵全德的选举，使德国的法西斯和军国主义残余势力得以重新掌握全德政权。很明显，美、英、法三国的这种立场，是要使德国问题的解决服从于成立欧洲防务集团、复活德国军国主义势力的目的，而不是服从于使德国恢复成为一个统一、独立、民主与和平国家的目的。这显然是德国和欧洲各国爱好和平人民所不能允许的，所以也是行不通的。
    同时，美、英、法三国外长还拒绝了苏联在会议快结束时提出的有助于改善德国现状和促进东西德谅解的建设性建议，如四国同意减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政与经济义务，四国就东西德警察的人数及装备问题达成协议，建议东西德成立两个全德委员会以促进东西德的经济文化关系等。这就清楚地表明，美英法三国不想真正和平解决德国问题，不愿意由德国人民自己解决统一德国的迫切任务。但苏联代表团声明，苏联政府希望四国政府继续努力，争取按照巩固欧洲和平的利益来圆满解决德国问题。
    对奥和约问题原是可以在柏林会议上获得解决的。但是，美英法三国复活德国军国主义和建立西欧军事集团的计划，也阻碍着对奥和约问题的解决。人们记得，希特勒的侵略计划就是从吞并奥地利开始的。现在，由国际反动势力扶植、在波恩政府中掌握了大权的西德垄断资本和军国主义势力，正在计划着进行新的德奥合并阴谋。这种历史悲剧是决不容重演的。在柏林会议上，苏联关于对奥和约问题的建议规定，奥地利应保证不参加任何联盟或军事同盟，并不得允许在其领土上建立外国军事基地；同时在对德和约缔结前暂缓撤退四国在奥地利的占领军队。苏联这个立场是符合于巩固欧洲和平和维护奥地利人民的民族独立的利益的。然而，美、英、法外长反对苏联的建议，终于使对奥和约问题未能达成协议。
    柏林会议未能就德国问题和对奥和约问题取得协议，说明了西方国家无意放弃其现行的扩军备战的侵略政策，但这些问题并没有从日程上除掉。苏联提出的有关建议，将大大有助于今后世界爱好和平人民特别是欧洲人民争取解决这些问题的斗争。我国人民完全支持苏联政府在柏林会议上的一切主张和建议。目前全世界爱好和平的国家和人民最迫切的任务，是争取日内瓦会议的顺利召开，争取欧洲集体安全的实现，促进裁军问题的解决，以谋求远东及世界紧张局势的缓和。中国人民将与全世界人民一道，继续为和平解决当前迫切的国际问题进行不懈的斗争。
