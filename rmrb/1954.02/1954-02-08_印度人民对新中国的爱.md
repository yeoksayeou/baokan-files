    The Love of the Indian People for New China
    Yuan Shuipai

    Dear Volunteer Army Comrades:

    I want to tell you about the impressions I recently gained while visiting India, my dear comrades! I cannot rest easy without doing so.

    This profound impression not only gave me a new and strong affection for the Indian people; but also, as a result, made me even more proud to be a citizen of New China. It made me feel even more how lovable our motherland is and how great our Party and Chairman Mao are; and it also made me have even greater respect and love for you, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. You have won the heartfelt praise of people all over the world, including the Indian people, in the glorious cause of defending world peace.

    This profound impression is: the widespread friendly attitude of the Indian working people towards New China.

    In recent years, the Indian people have been watching with concern from the other side of the Himalayas the great people's revolution taking place in their neighbor's land. They rejoice in every victory of ours. Our new republic is constantly attracting Indian people to visit. They have come to our cities and villages, seen our factories and schools, and visited the Guanting Reservoir and other construction sites. After returning home, they have praised the tremendous achievements in our country's construction and the great victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. They said that New China's "progress in all aspects of national construction in the two years after liberation is a source of inspiration for all Asian countries." These are the words in a written statement issued by all members of the Indian Goodwill Visiting Group to China in 1951 after returning home.

    During the delegation's trip to more than a dozen cities and rural areas in North and South India, we met with the broad masses of the Indian people. The crowds welcoming us always filled every train station. People wanted to greet us and shake hands, often crowding us so that we could not get out of the station for a while, and we had to rely on friends in charge of the reception to mobilize the youth to maintain order before we could escape. Sometimes, the cars were also surrounded. Countless hands reached out, giving us flowers, giving us fruit, asking us to sign autographs, wanting to shake hands with us, or just wanting to get close to us, to take a good look at these people from Mao Zedong's land!

    They raised their fists and shouted slogans excitedly, not only slogans about peace and Sino-Indian friendship, but also slogans like "Long live the People's Republic of China," "Long live Mao Zedong," and "Long live the Chinese Communist Party."

    Traveling by train from northern India to southern India, due to the tight schedule, we could only get off the train to stay in important cities for a day, and had to take the train again at night. Moreover, we could not get off at every city along the way. Some could only stop for a few minutes. If there was a little more time, local people would hold a welcome meeting on the station platform. If the time was really too short, they would ask the delegation to stand at the train door so that they could shout slogans, talk, shake hands, and hug each other during these short few minutes, until the train drove away and they could no longer see each other.

    There were also some smaller stations where the express train we were on did not stop. But the local people still brought flags and banners to the station. They waited for a long time, just to meet us for a few seconds as the train sped past!

    Sometimes the train stopped at a station late at night. Suddenly the lights in the dark carriage were all lit up, and before we had time to get out of bed, beautiful and lovely Indian little girls had already put a string of rose garlands with the dew of the night around our necks! Behind these seemingly simple things lies such profound emotion and longing for New China!

    At the train station in Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh, coppersmiths gave us copper water pots they had made, a utensil that Indian people usually use to wash their hands. As a gift, it seemed to give us a more intimate feeling than anything else.

    At this welcome meeting, mostly attended by workers, a young worker, perhaps especially for this opportunity, put on a beautiful red silk vest and recited a poem on the spot. Here are a few lines, which I have translated below:
      Come, see, dear friends and comrades!
      Come see this bright and splendid picture,
      Crimson dawn shines on the high mountains,
      Flowers are fragrant everywhere, the river sparkles with gold,
      Come, see, come see the new atmosphere of New China.
      Come, see, dear friends and comrades!
      Over there, the tiller is the harvester,
      Only labor is glorious,
      The fertile fields suck the milk of the Yangtze River,
      Oh, she is moving towards prosperity and abundance!
      Come, see, dear friends and comrades!
      But what is there here?
      Ah, overflowing rivers, abandoned fields…
      Come, comrades, friends, let us join hands!
      We have found an example, we have generated strength,
      Let our glorious India grow again.

    It was in this Andhra Pradesh province that suffered from floods and famine last year. At several welcome meetings, Indian friends repeatedly expressed their gratitude for the Chinese people's donations and sincere concern. In addition to the famine, the majority of the 20 million handloom workers there are suffering from unemployment. The feelings expressed in this poem are not difficult to understand.

    A song in Assamese, "Echoes from New China," also contains similar feelings and moving images:
      I stand on the top of a mountain on the Indian border,
      Gazing intently in this midnight darkness,
      New echoes come from the other side of the high mountain…
      I press my palm behind my ear,
      I hold my breath and listen quietly,
      How moving that sound is!
    The second half of the song goes on to say that the Chinese people drove away the brutal Kuomintang, the oppressed peasants ended their long life of suffering, and the great New China sings her song of liberation, the sound waves breaking down the barriers built by the warmongers, and the strong appeal is sent by the great wind to the ears of millions of awakened people.

    What strong sympathy is contained here!

    When we left the Rajahmundry station, our Indian friends specifically instructed us to open the train doors and windows, and asked us to stand at the train doors.

    The train left the station, creeping forward. We saw that across a river from the railway line, far away on the factory walls, earthen mounds, and trees on the opposite bank, stood groups of people. We could not see their faces clearly, but we saw them waving their arms at the train incessantly. The train slowly increased its speed, passing one group of people after another. The figures became smaller and smaller, but the arms were still waving there…

    It turned out that many workers in the factory were at work and could not come to the station to welcome us, but they asked to see us on the walls, so they specifically asked the local Sino-Indian Friendship Association to take care of us, and we must stand at the train door.

    Dear soldiers! How touching this is! The Indian working people, who have suffered the pain of the Second World War (more than three million people starved to death in Bengal Province) and the consequences of the post-war imperialist war policy, are firmly opposed to war and support peace. They deeply believe in the Chinese people's determination and strength to defend peace. The clear facts of recent years have made them deeply realize that a bright road is unfolding before the people of Asia, that is, the road of peace and democracy taken by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Mao Zedong!

### 印度人民对新中国的爱

    印度人民对新中国的爱
    袁水拍
    亲爱的志愿军同志：
    我要把我最近在访问印度时得到的印象告诉你们，我亲爱的同志们！不这样，我不能安心。
    这深刻的印象，不仅使我对印度人民发生了新的强烈的好感；而且，也因此，使我更加为自己是新中国的人民而骄傲，我更加感到祖国的可爱、党和毛主席的伟大；也更加使我对你们、中国人民志愿军战士，发生了更大的尊敬和爱。你们在保卫世界和平的光荣事业中赢得了全世界人民、包括印度人民在内的衷心赞颂。
    这深刻的印象就是：印度劳动人民对新中国的普遍的友好态度。
    近年来，印度人民从喜马拉雅山的那一边，关切地注视着在他们邻居的土地上所进行的伟大人民革命。他们为我们的每一个胜利而欢欣鼓舞。我们的新的共和国吸引着印度人民不断地前来访问。他们来到我们的城市和农村，看了我们的工厂和学校，到了官厅水库和别的建设工地。回国以后盛赞我国建设上的巨大成就和抗美援朝的伟大胜利。他们说新中国“在解放后的两年中在国家建设的一切方面得到的进步是一切亚洲国家的鼓舞力量的泉源。”这是一九五一年印度亲善访华团全体团员回国时所发表的书面声明中的话。
    在代表团访问印度南北十几个城市和农村的旅途中，我们和广大印度人民见了面。欢迎我们的群众总是挤满了每一个火车站。人们都想和我们招呼握手，时常挤得我们一时不能走出车站，必须经过负责招待工作的友人，发动青年们维持秩序，才能够脱身。有时，汽车也被团团围住了。无数只手伸过来，送鲜花给我们，送水果给我们，要我们签名，要和我们握手，或者只是要挨近我们，要好好儿看一看这些从毛泽东的国土来的人！
    他们高举着拳头，激动地呼着口号，不仅呼关于和平和印中友谊的口号，而且高呼“中华人民共和国万岁”“毛泽东万岁”“中国共产党万岁”的口号。
    从印度北方坐火车到南方，由于日程紧凑的关系，重要的城市也只能下车去停留一个白天，到晚上又得搭火车走。而且，并不是每一个沿线的城市我们都能下去。有些只能停几分钟。如果时间稍多，当地群众就在车站站台上开欢迎会。时间实在太少的话，他们也要求代表团站在车门口，让他们在这短短几分钟里面，和我们一起呼口号，谈话，握手，拥抱，直到火车开走，彼此望不见。
    还有一些较小的车站，我们坐的一班快车不停。可是当地群众还是带了旗帜和标语牌到站上来。他们等候许久，就为了要和我们在火车飞奔而过的几秒钟里，见一见面！
    有时火车在深夜停在一个站上。黑暗的车厢里突然灯光齐明，我们还没来得及起床，美丽可爱的印度小女孩已经把一串带着夜露的玫瑰花环套到了我们的脖子上！在这些看来简单的事情后面，包含着多么深刻的感情和对新中国的向往啊！
    在安特拉省拉加孟特拉城的车站上，铜器工人们把自己做的铜制水罐送给我们，这是一种印度人民日常用来洗手的器皿。作为礼物，它好像比什么东西都更给我们以亲切的感觉。
    就在这多数是工人的欢迎会上，一个青年工人也许特意为了这一机会，穿起一件漂亮的红绸背心，当场朗诵了一首诗。有几节是这样的，我译在下面：来吧，来看吧，亲爱的朋友和同志们！来看这幅光明灿烂的图画，绯红的曙光照在高山上，鲜花到处香，河水闪金光，来吧，来看吧，来看新中国的新气象。来吧，来看吧，亲爱的朋友和同志们！在那边，耕种的人就是收获的人，只有劳动才是光荣的事情，肥沃的田地吸着长江的奶，哦，她正在向繁荣富饶的道路前进！
      来吧，来看吧，亲爱的朋友和同志们！
      可是，这儿有的是什么呢？
      啊，泛滥的河流，荒废的田地，……
      来吧，同志们，朋友们，让我们手拉着手！
      我们得到了榜样，我们产生了力量，
      让我们光荣的印度重新生长。
    就在这安特拉省，去年遭受了水灾和饥荒。在几处欢迎会上，印度友人一再对中国人民的捐款和亲切的关怀，表示感谢。除了灾荒，那儿的二千万手纺工人的一大半，正忍受着失业的痛苦。这首诗里所流露的感情是不难理解的。
    在一支阿萨姆语的歌“新中国传来的回声”中，也有类似的感情和动人的形象：
      我站在印度边境的山顶，在这午夜的黑暗里凝神谛听，从高山的那一边传来了新的回声……我把手心按在我的耳后，我屏息闭目地静听，那声音是多么动人！歌词后半部接着说到，中国人民赶跑了残暴的国民党，被压迫的农民结束了长期的苦难生活，伟大的新中国唱着她的解放之歌，那音波冲倒了战争贩子筑起的障壁，大风把有力的号召送到千百万觉醒了的人民耳边。
    这里蕴藏着多么强烈的同情啊！
    当我们离开拉加孟特拉车站的时候，印度友人特地嘱咐我们要打开车门和车窗，并且要我们站在车门口。
    火车出了站，蠕蠕前行。我们看见，和铁路线隔一道河，远远地在对岸工厂的围墙上、土堆上和树上，站着一群一群的人。我们看不清他们的脸，只看见他们向火车不住地扬着手臂。火车慢慢地增加速度，过了一群人，又是一群人。人影儿越来越小，可是手臂还是在那儿扬着……
    原来工厂里许多工人正在上班，不能到车站来欢迎，但是他们要求在围墙上望我们，所以特地通过当地印中友协的人来关照我们，务必站在车门口。
    亲爱的战士们！这是多么使人感动的事啊！身受第二次大战的痛苦（孟加拉省饿死三百多万人）和战后帝国主义战争政策恶果的印度劳动人民是坚决地反对战争拥护和平的。他们对中国人民保卫和平的决心和力量是深信不疑的，几年来的鲜明事实使他们深深体会到在亚洲人民面前，展现着一条光明的大道，那就是中国人民在伟大领袖毛泽东领导下所走的和平民主的大道！
