Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 11th: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference was held on February 10th, with Molotov as chairman.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Molotov delivered a speech on the issue of guaranteeing European security.

    After Molotov finished speaking, he handed the full text of the Soviet delegation's proposal on "Guaranteeing European Security" and the draft of the basic principles of the "All-European Treaty for Guaranteeing European Collective Security" to the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, and the United States.

    Dulles then requested a temporary recess to study the Soviet delegation's speech and proposals.

    After the discussion resumed, Dulles said that he would like to offer a few simple opinions on the substance of the Soviet delegation's proposals. Dulles expressed agreement with the point in the Soviet proposal that the four countries would continue to work towards a proper solution to the German problem. Dulles then spoke about the second point of the Soviet proposal. He said that his attitude towards the proposal to withdraw the occupying forces remained unchanged. The American delegation could not accept this proposal, because it was said that implementing this proposal would leave West Germany and a large part of Europe defenseless in the face of the threat of aggression. Dulles also opposed the third point of the proposal (convening a conference of European countries to conclude a collective security treaty), without saying why he opposed this proposal. His only "argument" was that the current meeting was going to produce another meeting.

    Next, Dulles explained his attitude toward the Soviet draft of the basic principles of the "All-European Treaty for Guaranteeing European Collective Security". Dulles said that, according to his understanding of Articles 7 and 10 of the draft and Molotov's remarks about the North Atlantic Treaty, the All-European Treaty for Guaranteeing European Collective Security was intended to replace the North Atlantic Treaty. He repeated the well-known American propaganda lies, saying that the establishment of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and the "European Defense Community" were the result of the "threat" from the Soviet side. He attempted to question the purpose of the Soviet proposal to establish a genuine collective security in Europe.

    Bidault then spoke. He talked about the Soviet proposal to establish collective security in Europe. He expressed his disagreement with Molotov's view that in order to avoid another war in Europe, every effort should be made to prevent the formation of mutually opposed military blocs in Europe. Bidault still tried to portray the North Atlantic Group and the "European Defense Community" as purely "defensive" organizations.

    Bidault said that he agreed with the concept of collective security, but at the same time he opposed the specific measures proposed by the Soviet delegation to establish a universal European collective security system. He groundlessly denied the necessity of realizing the concept of collective security among European countries. He insisted that a treaty on guaranteeing European collective security would be impossible without the participation of the United States. But why could a Pan-American Convention be concluded without the participation of European countries, while a treaty on European collective security among European countries could not be concluded without the participation of the United States? He avoided answering this question. Bidault said that before establishing a collective security system, the German problem must be resolved and a peace treaty concluded. But he once again opposed the Soviet proposal to withdraw the occupying forces from Germany, which would contribute to the resolution of the German problem and the consolidation of security throughout Europe.

    Bidault said that the French government had always considered the Franco-Soviet Treaty as "one of the main factors of security" for France. However, he repeated the old and long-refuted arguments, insisting that the plan to establish the "European Defense Community" and to bring re-militarized West Germany into this group was not directed against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. At the same time, he said that he was prepared to consider the possibility of offering "new guarantees" to the Soviet Union, but he ignored the fact that without guarantees to prevent the revival of German militarism, any guarantee of European security would be empty.

    Eden then spoke, opposing the Soviet delegation's proposal aimed at preventing the establishment of mutually opposed military blocs among countries in Europe. He said that the North Atlantic Group was the cornerstone of British policy. Eden could not produce any evidence, but simply insisted that the Soviet proposal was aimed at opposing German unification and was based on distrust of the democratic forces in Germany.

    Like Dulles and Bidault, Eden insisted that the North Atlantic Group was defensive, and said that the Soviet delegation, on the one hand, proposed to abolish the North Atlantic Group, and on the other hand, wanted to preserve the Soviet defense system and its allies. Eden did not explain what "defense system" he was referring to in the Soviet Union, and he could not say. Because everyone knows that the Soviet Union does not belong to any international military group, but bases its policy on the desire to live in peace with all countries.

    Molotov then spoke. He talked about the objections of the foreign ministers of the three Western countries to the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the meeting on February 10th.

    He pointed out that the Soviet delegation proposed to continue discussing and preparing a decision on the German issue, so as to quickly unify Germany under democratic and peaceful principles and conclude a peace treaty with it. He pointed out that the three Western countries had not yet submitted their draft peace treaty with Germany, and had refused to hold discussions on this issue. Therefore, a new situation had arisen, and it was necessary to decide what to do while a peace treaty with Germany had not yet been concluded. Molotov said that today it was already necessary to begin establishing a European collective security system. He emphasized the great significance of the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation, especially the basic principles of the draft All-European Treaty for Guaranteeing European Collective Security.

    Speaking of Bidault's speech on the Franco-Soviet Treaty, Molotov asked: What is the role of this treaty now? On the one hand, according to the Franco-Soviet Treaty of 1944, France and the Soviet Union are allies, but, on the other hand, France is helping to establish a "European Defense Community" with the participation of re-militarized West Germany, which is aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Molotov said that the French government could declare that it wished to abide by both the Franco-Soviet Treaty and the "European Defense Community" Treaty, and we could only express surprise at this fact. We can only express surprise at the fact that the French government suddenly believes that it can guarantee France's security through an alliance with re-militarized West Germany that is aimed at the Soviet Union.

    Molotov then spoke of Eden's statement that Britain was prepared to extend the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942. He pointed out that Eden's proposal was a far cry from Britain's policy of trying to maintain a military bloc like the North Atlantic Group that was aimed at the Soviet Union.

    Molotov pointed out that the claim that there was a so-called "Eastern Bloc" was untenable. He pointed out that friendly political, economic, and cultural relations existed between the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, but there were no treaties between the Soviet Union and any of the people's democracies that were aimed at any of the countries participating in the Berlin Conference. All treaties between the Soviet Union and the people's democracies had only one purpose: to guarantee European security, to guarantee peace, and to prevent German militarist aggression.

    Molotov then said that the role of the United States was particularly emphasized in the speeches on the Soviet proposals. He pointed out that in discussing the issue of a European collective security system, it was necessary to start from the fact that the United States was an American country and not a European country. Speaking of the role played by the United States in the Second World War, Molotov said: We believe that all the evaluations of the great contribution of the United States in the war against Hitler's Germany by the Soviet leaders, starting with the head of the Soviet government, J.V. Stalin, are still absolutely correct today.

    The Soviet people are sincerely grateful to the American people and the American government for the assistance they gave to the people of all European countries who were ravaged by Hitler's aggression during the World War. The divergence in policies between the Soviet Union and the United States after the war was entirely due to the United States' abandonment of the policies it pursued in the common struggle against aggression.

    Molotov pointed out that only Eden had openly rejected the Soviet proposal on the establishment of European collective security. The Soviet delegation was willing to know whether the other two foreign ministers also rejected the proposal on the establishment of collective security among European countries.

    Dulles then spoke, saying that the Soviet proposal on "Guaranteeing European Security" was "unacceptable to the United States." Regarding the Soviet draft of the All-European Treaty for Guaranteeing European Collective Security, Dulles said that the American delegation felt that there was no need to respond to this draft, because the draft did not stipulate that the United States should participate in the All-European Treaty.

    Bidault spoke after Dulles, saying that the idea of a broad European security system was completely acceptable, but the French delegation believed that such a system could only be established after a thorough resolution of the German issue and without excluding other so-called "defensive treaties and agreements." Bidault also said that the Soviet draft in its current form was unacceptable to the French delegation.

    Eden said that he had nothing to add to the answer he had given earlier.

    Before the adjournment, the future work of the meeting was discussed. Molotov moved that the Soviet proposals put forward on February 10th should be discussed further at a later meeting. He specifically pointed out that he was referring to the meeting on February 13th, because on February 11th there would be a closed meeting to discuss the first item on the agenda, and on Friday, February 12th, discussions on the Austrian peace treaty would begin as agreed.

    Dulles moved that a decision on this issue be made at the meeting on February 12th.

    Molotov moved that, considering that the discussion at the meeting on February 10th had not ended, the meeting on February 12th should decide when to continue the discussion.

    Molotov's motion was adopted.

    The meeting adjourned at this point.

    苏、法、英、美四国外长会议继续举行会议
    莫洛托夫提出保障欧洲安全的建议
    同时提出保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的基本原则的草案
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林十一日讯：四国外长会议于二月十日举行会议，由莫洛托夫任主席。
    会议开始的时候，莫洛托夫就保障欧洲安全问题发言。
    莫洛托夫发言完毕后，把苏联代表团关于“保障欧洲安全”的建议全文和“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的基本原则的草案交给法国、英国和美国的外长。
    杜勒斯接着要求暂时休会，以便研究苏联代表团的发言和建议。
    恢复讨论后，杜勒斯说，他要对苏联代表团的建议的实质提出几点简单的意见。杜勒斯对苏联建议中关于四国将继续努力使德国问题获得适当的解决这一点表示同意。杜勒斯接着谈到苏联建议的第二点。他说，对于撤退占领军的建议，他的态度还是不变。美国代表团不能接受这个建议，因为据说实行这个建议就将使西德和欧洲的一大部分面对着侵略的威胁而毫无防御。杜勒斯也反对建议的第三点（召开欧洲国家会议，以便缔结集体安全条约），他没有说为什么反对这个建议，他唯一的“论据”是：目前的会议又要产生了另一个会议。
    接着，杜勒斯说明了他对苏联“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”基本原则的草案的态度。杜勒斯说，根据他对草案第七条和第十条以及莫洛托夫关于北大西洋公约的话的了解，保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约是要代替北大西洋公约。他重复众所周知的美国宣传谰言，说什么成立北大西洋侵略集团和“欧洲防务集团”是苏联方面的“威胁”的后果。他企图质问苏联，建立欧洲的真正的集体安全的建议目的何在。
    皮杜尔接着发言。他谈到苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全的建议。他表示不同意莫洛托夫的见解：为了避免在欧洲发生另一次战争，应该尽力防止互相对立的军事集团在欧洲的成立。皮杜尔仍然努力想把北大西洋集团和“欧洲防务集团”说成是纯“防御性”的组织。
      皮杜尔说，他赞成集体安全的观念，但同时他反对苏联代表团建议的建立普遍的欧洲集体安全体系的具体措施。他毫无根据地否认有实现欧洲国家集体安全观念的必要。他硬说，关于保障欧洲集体安全的条约如果没有美国参加，是不可能的。但是为什么没有欧洲国家参加就可以缔结一个泛美公约，而没有美国参加就不能够缔结一个欧洲各国关于欧洲集体安全的条约呢？他对这个问题避不作答。皮杜尔说，在建立集体安全体系以前，必须先解决德国问题和缔结和约。但是他再一次反对苏联的关于从德国撤退占领军的建议，而这个建议是有助于德国问题的解决和整个欧洲安全的巩固的。
      皮杜尔说，法国政府始终认为法苏条约是法国“安全的主要因素之一”。但是，他又重复老早就被驳倒了的陈腐论据，硬说建立“欧洲防务集团”以及把重新军国主义化的西德拉入这个集团的计划不是针对着苏联和人民民主国家的。同时他说，他准备考虑向苏联提出“新保证”的可能，但是他无视这样一个事实：如果没有防止德国军国主义复活的保证，那么任何欧洲安全的保证都是空的。
    艾登接着发言，他反对苏联代表团提出的目的在于防止互相对立的国家间的军事集团在欧洲建立的建议。他说，北大西洋集团是英国政策的基石。艾登举不出任何证据，只一味把苏联的建议说成是以反对德国统一为目的的，是以对德国的民主势力的不信任为基础的。
    艾登和杜勒斯、皮杜尔一样，硬说北大西洋集团是防御性的，并说苏联代表团一方面建议取消北大西洋集团，同时又想保存苏联的防御体系和它的盟国。艾登没有说明他所指的是苏联的什么“防御体系”，他也说不出来。因为大家都知道，苏联不属于任何国家间的军事集团，而是以和一切国家和平共处的愿望为它的政策的基础的。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。他谈到三个西方国家的外长对苏联代表团在二月十日会议上提出的建议的反对意见。
    他指出，苏联代表团建议继续讨论并准备关于德国问题的决定，以便迅速使德国在民主与和平的原则下获得统一并与它缔结和约。他指出，三个西方国家到现在还没有提出它们的对德和约草案，而且还拒绝就这个问题举行讨论。因此，产生了一个新的情况，必须决定在对德和约尚未缔结期间应该怎样办。莫洛托夫说，今天已经有必要开始建立一个欧洲集体安全体系。他强调苏联代表团提出的建议特别是保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案的基本原则的重大意义。
    谈到皮杜尔关于法苏条约的发言时，莫洛托夫问道：这个条约还有什么作用呢？一方面，根据一九四四年的法苏条约，法国和苏联是盟友，但是，另一方面，法国却帮助建立一个有重新军国主义化的西德参加的、矛头指向苏联和人民民主国家的“欧洲防务集团”。莫洛托夫说，法国政府可以宣布它希望同时信守法苏条约和“欧洲防务集团”条约，我们对于这一事实只能表示惊异。法国政府突然间竟相信它可以通过与重新军事化的西德间的矛头指向苏联的联盟来保障法国的安全，我们也只能对这一事实表示惊异。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到艾登所谓英国准备延长一九四二年的英苏条约的说法。他指出，艾登的这个建议，与竭力维持像北大西洋集团这样一个矛头指向苏联的军事集团的英国的政策，是大相迳庭的。
    莫洛托夫指出，关于有所谓“东方集团”存在的说法是站不住脚的。他指出，苏联和人民民主国家之间的友好的政治、经济和文化关系是存在的，但是苏联和任何一个人民民主国家之间都没有任何矛头指向参加柏林会议的任何一个国家的条约。苏联与人民民主国家之间的一切条约都只有一个目的：保障欧洲安全、保障和平和防止德国军国主义的侵略。
    莫洛托夫接着说，在关于苏联建议的发言中曾特别着重提到美国的作用。他指出，在讨论欧洲集体安全体系的问题时，必须从下面的事实出发：美国是一个美洲国家而不是一个欧洲国家。谈到美国在第二次世界大战中所起的作用时，莫洛托夫说：我们认为，苏联的领袖们，从苏联政府首长约·维·斯大林起，对美国在反希特勒德国的战争中的伟大贡献的一切评价，到现在都还是绝对正确的。
    苏联人民衷心感激美国人民与美国政府在世界大战期间给予遭受希特勒侵略荼毒的全欧洲各国人民的援助。苏联与美国的政策在战后有了分歧完全是由于美国放弃了在反侵略的共同斗争中所奉行的政策。
    莫洛托夫指出，只有艾登公然拒绝了苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全问题的建议。苏联代表团愿意知道其他两位外长是否也拒绝关于建立欧洲各国集体安全的主张。
    杜勒斯接着发言说，苏联关于“保障欧洲安全”的建议是“美国所不能接受的”。关于苏联提出的保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案，杜勒斯说，美国代表团认为不需要对这个草案作什么答复，因为草案并没有规定美国参加全欧条约。
    皮杜尔继杜勒斯之后发言，他说，广泛的欧洲安全体系的主张是完全可以接受的，但是法国代表团认为，只有在彻底解决德国问题以后，在不排除其他的他所谓的“防御条约与协定”的情况下，才能够建立这样的体系。皮杜尔又说，不过目前这种形式的苏联草案是法国代表团所不能接受的。
    艾登说，对于他以前所提出的答复，他没有什么可以补充的。
    在休会前，讨论了会议今后的工作。莫洛托夫动议在以后的一次会议上继续讨论苏联在二月十日提出的建议。他具体指出他所指的是二月十三日的会议，因为，二月十一日将举行秘密会议讨论第一项议程，而在星期五，即二月十二日，将按照协议，开始讨论对奥和约问题。
    杜勒斯动议延到二月十二日的会议上再对这个问题作出决定。
    莫洛托夫动议，认为二月十日会议的讨论没有结束，由二月十二日的会议来决定什么时候继续讨论。
    莫洛托夫的动议获得通过。
    会议至此休会。
