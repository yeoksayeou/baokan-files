    Boshan Motor Factory Adopts Various Measures to Solve Product Quality Problems
    Qin Bingfu, Director of the Central Electrical Industry Administration's Boshan Motor Factory, wrote: The People's Daily published a letter from reader Wang Shiying on September 20th last year criticizing our factory's serious neglect of product quality. This criticism is fundamentally correct. After we convened relevant personnel for inspection, the main reason for the poor product quality of our factory is that leading cadres still have a tendency to "only pursue quantity and neglect quality" in their thinking, which leads to the situation where products of poor quality leave the factory in actual work. For example, the specified no-load current specification for a 20 kVA single-phase transformer is no more than 4.2 amperes, but the tested output was 5.5 amperes; at that time, we thought that such products could still be shipped without investigating and tracking down why the quality was reduced. In addition, our factory lacks a responsibility system and a strict inspection system. Design drawings often have errors, and no one is responsible when problems occur. The phenomenon of mutual shirking and buck-passing is very serious. This is also the reason why product quality has not been guaranteed for a long time.
    Through this inspection, we established a technical research association to specifically study and solve technical quality problems and handle customer opinions on product quality; further clarified the relationship between various departments, strengthened the inspection system, strengthened technical management and drawing review work, and formulated operating procedures for major products to effectively ensure product quality.

    博山电机厂采用各种办法解决产品质量问题
    中央电器工业管理局博山电机厂厂长秦秉富来信：去年九月二十日人民日报刊登了读者王世英批评我厂严重忽视产品质量的来信。这一批评基本上是正确的。经我们召集有关人员进行检查，我厂产品质量不好的主要原因是领导干部思想上还存在着“只求数量、忽视质量”的偏向，因而在实际工作中也就出现了质量不佳的产品出厂的情况。如二十千伏安单相变压器规定空载电流的规格为不得超过四点二安培，出产品经试验却为五点五安培；当时我们认为这样的产品还可以出厂，而不去研究、追查为什么会降低了质量。此外，我厂缺乏责任制度和严格的检验制度，图纸设计经常出错，发生问题无人负责，互相推诿、扯皮的现象很严重。这也是造成长期不能保证产品质量的原因。
    通过这次检查，我们成立了技术研究会，专门研究解决技术质量上的问题和处理客户对产品质量的意见；进一步明确了各科室的关系，加强了检验制度，加强了技术管理和图纸审校工作，并订出主要产品操作规程，以切实保证产品质量。
