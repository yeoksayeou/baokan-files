Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Soviet scientists, closely integrating research work with production, continue to make significant contributions to improving industrial production and solving problems in production.

    In terms of the theory and practice of automatic regulation, Soviet scientists, relying on the cooperation of design agencies and industrial sector workers, have solved the complete automation of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, and the automation of production in mining, metallurgy, chemical, and petroleum industries. In the Kuznetsk coal region, an automated coal mining site utilizing hydraulic machinery has been put into production. In this mine, the pressure of powerful water currents can break open the coal seams, and the water flow can dislodge coal blocks and transport coal along the working face and roadways. Specially made pumps can draw the water-coal mixture along pipelines to the surface and then to the coal preparation plant. Because all of this work has been automated, the mine can free up one-quarter to one-fifth of the personnel for other work. Staff at the Donbas Industrial Institute have designed an automatic pump device that can draw water from a depth of 1,500 meters, which can be used to drain water from mines. Hundreds of these automated pumping devices are now working in various mines in the Donbas.

    In deep well coal mining, staff at the Mining Institute of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences are designing a machine that can create an artificial climate in deep mines. These machines can ensure that the climate at the locations where miners work is the same as on the surface. The Makiivka Scientific Research Institute for Safety in Mining Work has manufactured a special mine car that can safely transport miners from inclined roadways to distant work locations. Soviet scientists and engineers have also manufactured a very strong steel rope that can be used for hoisting in mines as deep as 1,100 to 1,200 meters.

    苏联科学家继续为改进工业生产作出贡献
    据新华社讯：苏联科学家密切结合生产进行研究工作，继续为改进工业生产和解决生产中的问题作出巨大贡献。
    在自动调节的理论和实践方面，苏联科学家依靠设计机关和工业部门工作人员的合作，已解决了水电站和火力发电站的完全自动化，采矿、冶金、化学、石油等工业部门生产自动化的问题。库兹湼茨克煤区已有一个利用水力机械的自动化采煤场投入生产。在这个矿场中，强大的水流压力可以冲开煤层，水流可以打下煤块并沿工作面和巷道运煤。特制的唧筒能把水、煤混合物沿着导管抽上地面，再送进选煤场。由于这一切工作都已自动化，矿场就可腾出四分之一到五分之一的人作其他工作。顿巴斯工业研究所的工作人员设计的一种能把一千五百公尺深处的水抽出的自动唧筒装置，可以用来抽干矿场中的积水。现在已有几百个这种自动化的抽水设备在顿巴斯的各个矿场中工作。
    在深井采煤方面，乌克兰科学院采矿研究所的工作人员正在设计一种能在深矿井中制造人工气候的机器。这些机器可以保证在矿工们工作的地点有和地面相同的气候。马基耶夫卡的采矿工作安全科学研究所已经制造了一种专用的矿车，这种矿车可以把矿工们安全地由倾斜巷道运到距离很远的工作地点。苏联的科学家和工程师还制造了一种非常结实的钢绳，可以供给深达一千一百到一千二百公尺的矿井起重之用。
