Comrades Representatives of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, Disabled Revolutionary Soldiers, and Demobilized and Transferred Soldiers:

    This representative meeting of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers held in Beijing is of great significance for mobilizing all revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers in the city to actively participate in production, join mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and participate in various national construction undertakings; it is also of great significance for further carrying out preferential treatment work throughout the city to solve the difficulties in production and life of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, so that they can obtain the conditions to participate in production, join mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and participate in various national construction undertakings. I congratulate the success of the meeting and extend my heartfelt greetings on behalf of the Central People's Government to all revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers in the capital.

    This meeting is convened under the circumstance of vigorously publicizing the general line of the transition period. You have all heard the publicity of the general line of the transition period. Chairman Mao called on us to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce within a considerable period, that is, to transition to a socialist society. The Chinese revolution includes two stages: the new democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. The task of the first stage is to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and this task has been victoriously completed. From the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has entered the second stage—the stage of building a socialist society in China. Everyone knows that a socialist society is a very beautiful and happy society. In this society, there is no exploitation of man by man. All means of production are socialist public property, so productivity can be greatly developed, and the material and cultural life of the people will be greatly improved. The Soviet Union is already a socialist country, and the Soviet people are enjoying a happy life unprecedented in history. The second stage of our revolution is to build our country according to the example of the Soviet Union. How to start? This is divided into two aspects: one is to organize a new economy, and the other is to transform the old economy. To organize a new economy is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country, with the state running factories and mines. As you all know, in recent years, the state has established many industrial and mining enterprises. In 1953 alone, Beijing expanded 22 factories and built 8 new factories. One more state-owned factory means one more socialist force. Many revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers are already working in factories and mines, and more people will go to factories and mines in the future. This is very good, which contributes to the socialist industrialization of the country. As for the transformation of the old economy, there are also two aspects of work. One is to transform capitalist industry and commerce, that is, to gradually transform this exploitative economy into a state-owned economy, that is, a socialist economy owned by the whole people. The method of transformation is through the road of state capitalism. This has less direct relationship with revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, because few of us are engaged in capitalist industry and commerce. The other transformation is to transform the individual economy, including the transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, so that it becomes a collective economy, that is, a socialist economy collectively owned by cooperatives. The method of transformation is through the road of cooperatives. This is of great concern to revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, because among the revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers in the country, those engaged in agriculture account for the vast majority, and many people are also engaged in handicrafts. Therefore, we must plan our cause according to the general line.

    Representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers! Our relatives and ourselves did not hesitate to sacrifice blood and strive for the victory of the first stage of the revolution, overthrowing the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, in order to carry out the second stage of the revolution, that is, the socialist revolution, on the basis of this victory, to build a socialist society. Chairman Mao instructed us:

  "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory." Participating in the first stage of the revolution is glorious, and participating in the second stage of the revolution is even more glorious. The two stages are continuous. We must not relax, let alone abandon our glory for a moment. The resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference convened by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government in 1953 stated: "Civil affairs departments must earnestly lead the people to do a good job in preferential treatment, and earnestly solve the life and production problems of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, so as to give play to their political and production enthusiasm, mobilize and organize them to actively engage in production along the road of mutual aid and cooperation, gradually establish family businesses, achieve self-sufficiency in production, or participate in other possible and capable work, and participate in various national socialist construction undertakings." That is to say: we must not only engage in production and work, but also engage in production and work that conforms to socialist construction, and we must play an advanced role in these undertakings. You should do this and have already done so, and the government should help you do this and has already helped you.

    In order to achieve this goal—“striving for greater glory,” we must overcome the shortcomings that are incompatible with this goal, such as: some people have the idea of being meritorious officials. That's right, revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers have made contributions, and the country and the people respect your contributions very much; but if you are unwilling to work even though you have labor because you have made contributions, and want to sit back and enjoy the fruits of other people's labor, this is not socialist thinking, but the exploitative thinking of the bourgeoisie. It is not to strive for greater glory, but to turn the past glory into a burden, which should be corrected.

    There are also some people who are not unwilling to work, but they pick and choose labor, dislike this and dislike that, dislike the countryside and like the city; dislike being a handyman with low wages; dislike certain jobs that are troublesome; dislike certain jobs that are not decent. They do not know that any work that is beneficial to the people, whether physical or mental, is part of socialist construction, and therefore glorious. Those who dislike this and dislike that are always disliked by others and cannot find a way out. We should not be like this.

    There are also a few people who feel that production is too strenuous, and it is easier to do business or buy land for rent, hire workers to operate, and lend money at high interest rates, or even engage in speculative business. If these people think about what we sacrificed our blood for, it was to overthrow the old society of the exploitation system. Can we do this ourselves? I think: he will inevitably break out in a cold sweat.

    Of course, the people mentioned above are very few. Especially after hearing the publicity of the general line, it will be greatly reduced. Because revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers have high revolutionary spirit, and their acceptance of the general line education is very sharp. In recent years, many moving examples of actively participating in work, participating in production, and participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement have emerged in various places. The achievements are even greater in areas with a foundation. Look at the following facts. There are a total of 24 production units in Beijing organized exclusively by revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents, engaged in 18 kinds of businesses such as clothing, sewing, box making, binding, and knitting. Among them, 18 production units have been transformed into production cooperatives. Many revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents can give play to their labor enthusiasm in these production units and have improved their lives. In Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, there are two disabled revolutionary soldiers and eight demobilized and transferred soldiers in Chengguan. Before they were organized, there were many difficulties in individual production. After being organized, under the leadership of model transferred soldier Xing Nengxing, they reclaimed wasteland on the river beach and established a lithographic printing bureau. From May 1952 to the end of 1953, the group had accumulated public property, and everyone's income had increased. Five of the ten people in the group were unmarried, and now they are all married. Three of them had no family business in the past, and now they have also established a family business. They not only declined to cultivate land on their behalf, but also cultivated 40 mu of land for eight revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents in 1953, and volunteered to carry water, sweep snow, and build kangs for poor revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents. Xing Nengxing was also elected as a representative to the county people's congress. Such examples are found in every county and city. They not only improved their lives, but also influenced other people due to their vivid facts of collectivism. The People's Government did not give them much help, but they played a great role, and thus gained more respect from the government and the people.

    In addition, there are many model examples of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers participating in work and study in factories, government agencies, schools, and other positions, proving that they are sincere revolutionaries and powerful fighters for socialist construction.

    Here, I would like to say a few words to the staff engaged in preferential treatment work. Our preferential treatment work has been successful in the past, and will achieve greater success in the future in accordance with the requirements of the general line and the instructions of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference. For example, in 1953, Beijing conducted political education for revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, and successively organized five political study classes for military dependents, with a total of 886 people participating in the study; and organized 190 revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents to study accounting, sewing, binding, box making, and other technologies. These methods are very good. Beijing introduced revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to work in various government agencies, factories, enterprises, schools, and other departments. In 1953, there were a total of 1,653 people. The municipal government has a special person in charge, so the efficiency of job placement is significant, which is also very good and worthy of emulation. There are many places in the country where preferential treatment work is done well, but the work in some areas is still not satisfactory. In the future, we must further call on and organize revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to participate in production, participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and participate in various national construction undertakings. This is the main thing, but it does not mean that we can give up cultivating land on their behalf and providing material assistance. Necessary cultivation on their behalf and material assistance, and solving the necessary difficulties in life and production are still an indispensable part of preferential treatment work.

    Also, I feel that convening regular or irregular representative meetings of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, just like the meeting you are holding now, can not only improve everyone's ideological awareness, become the best way to educate revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, but also can closely link the government and you, and become a powerful tool to promote preferential treatment work. I hope that all localities can convene such meetings. At the same time, I think it is very important to cultivate models and set up banners among revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers. Many of you are already models. I hope you will make further efforts to strive to maintain the glorious title of model for a long time. Those who have not yet become models should strive to become models. I hope that preferential treatment workers all over the country can attach importance to the work of cultivating models.

    Representatives, our relatives and comrades are now serving at the front. With the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism still undying, they are shouldering the glorious task of defending peace in the Far East and the world and defending the construction of the motherland. Their high patriotism, their work enthusiasm and life hardships are all commendable. Now the Third Comfort Mission to Korea is making a report across the country on its return home. You must have heard such a report. I think it is very educational for people living in the rear to listen to the report on the situation of the Korean War, the report on the high morale and hard life of the soldiers at the front, and the report on the cooperation and mutual assistance between the military and civilians at the front. From the front to the rear, we will feel our inadequacy, and feel that compared with the great contribution of our most beloved people, we are still insignificant, and we will feel the importance of our responsibility. In particular, government cadres should do a better job in helping revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers solve the difficulties in production and life, so that they can further improve their lives and obtain the conditions to participate in production, participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and participate in various national construction undertakings. I suggest that you communicate more with the soldiers at the front, so as to be educated, encouraged and comforted from their letters, and at the same time, use your letters to encourage and comfort the soldiers at the front. I also suggest that cadres at all levels engaged in preferential treatment work often check their work with the situation at the front, educate the masses, and further do a good job in preferential treatment work.

    I congratulate you on your good health! I congratulate the health of your relatives and comrades—our most beloved people—all commanders, fighters, political workers, and logistics workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Chinese People's Public Security Forces!

    The great martyrs are immortal!

    中央人民政府内务部谢觉哉部长春节在北京市烈属、军属、残废军人、复员转业军人代表会议上的讲话各位革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人代表们：
    这次北京市召开的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人代表会议，对于动员全市革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人积极参加生产、参加互助合作组织、参加国家的各项建设事业，有十分重大的作用；对于进一步开展全市优抚工作，以解决革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人生产和生活上的困难，使他们获得参加生产、参加互助合作组织、参加国家的各项建设事业的条件，也有十分重大的作用。我祝贺会议的成功，并代表中央人民政府向首都的全体革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人致以衷心的慰问。
    这次会议是在大张旗鼓地宣传过渡时期的总路线的情况下召开的，各位都早已听过了过渡时期的总路线的宣传。毛主席号召我们，要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和对农业对手工业对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，即是说：要过渡到社会主义社会。中国革命包括新民主主义革命和社会主义革命两个阶段。第一阶段的任务是推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，这一个任务已经胜利地完成了。从中华人民共和国成立之日起，即已进入第二阶段——在中国建设一个社会主义社会的阶段。大家知道社会主义社会是非常美好非常幸福的社会，在这个社会里，没有人剥削人的事，一切生产资料都是社会主义的公共财产，因而生产力可以获得极大的发展，人民的物质和文化生活，将大大地提高。苏联已是社会主义国家，苏联人民享受着历史上未曾有过的幸福生活。我们革命的第二阶段就是要依照苏联的榜样来建设我们的国家。怎样着手呢？这分为二方面，一是组织新经济，一是改造旧经济。组织新经济，就是逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，由国家来办工厂开矿山。各位知道，几年以来，国家办了许多的工矿企业。只是北京市一九五三年就扩建了二十二个工厂，新建了八个工厂。多一个国营工厂，就多一分社会主义的力量。革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人已有许多人在工厂和矿山上做工，将来还要有更多的人去工厂和矿山上做工。这是很好的，这有助于国家的社会主义工业化。至于改造旧经济，又有二方面的工作，一是改造资本主义工商业，也就是要把这种剥削性质的经济逐步改造使之转为国营经济即全民所有的社会主义经济，改造的办法就是经过国家资本主义的道路。这对于革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人的直接关系较少，因为我们之中，从事资本主义工商业的人是很少的。另一种改造就是改造个体经济，包括改造农业和手工业，使之转为集体经济即合作社集体所有的社会主义经济，改造的办法就是经过合作社的道路。这对于革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人关系很大，因为全国的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人中，从事农业的占绝大多数，也有许多人从事手工业。因此，我们必须依照总路线来计划我们的事业。
    革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人代表们！我们的亲人和自己不惜牺牲流血争取革命的第一阶段的胜利，推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治，为的是要在这个胜利基础上进行第二阶段的革命亦即社会主义革命，以建设社会主义社会。毛主席指示我们说：
  “发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，参加第一阶段革命是光荣，参加第二阶段革命更光荣，两个阶段是连续的，我们不能松劲，更不能一刻放弃我们的光荣。一九五三年中央人民政府内务部召开的第二次全国民政会议的决议上这样写着：“民政部门必须切实领导人民群众做好优抚工作，对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人的生活和生产问题切实予以解决，发挥他们在政治上和生产上的积极性，发动和组织他们按照互助合作的道路积极从事生产，逐步建立家务，达到生产自给，或参加其他可能的和力能胜任的工作，参加国家的各种社会主义建设事业。”这就是说：我们不仅要从事生产和工作，且要从事合于社会主义建设的生产和工作，更要在这些事业中起先进作用。你们应该这样做也已经这样做了，政府应该帮助你们这样做也已经这样帮助了。
    为着达到这一目的——“争取更大光荣”，我们必须克服和这一目的不相容的缺点，比如：有些人有功臣思想。不错，革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人是有功的，国家和人民很尊重你们的功劳；但若因为有功，虽有劳动力也不愿劳动，想坐享旁人的劳动果实，这不是社会主义思想，而是资产阶级的剥削思想，不是争取更大光荣，而是把过去的光荣变成了包袱，这是应该纠正的。
    还有些人，不是不愿意劳动，但他们挑选劳动，嫌这嫌那，嫌农村、喜城市；嫌做小工赚工资少；嫌某种工作麻烦；嫌某种工作不体面，他们不知道用体力或脑力的任何有益于人民的工作，都是社会主义建设的一部分，因而都是光荣的。凡嫌这嫌那的人结果总是被人嫌而得不到出路，我们是不应如此的。
    还有少数的人，觉得生产太费力，不如做生意或买田出租、雇工经营、放高利贷来得轻巧，甚至从事投机生意。这类人如果想一想，我们牺牲流血为着什么，为的是推翻剥削制度的旧社会，难道我们自己又可以这样做吗？我想：他必然要惊出一身冷汗。
    自然，如上述的人是很少的。尤其是听到总路线的宣传以后，还要大大地减少。因为革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人革命性高，对于总路线教育的接受甚为锐敏。几年以来，各地已涌现出积极参加工作参加生产参加互助合作运动的许多动人事例。在有基础的地区成绩更大。看看下面的事实罢，北京市专由革命烈士家属、革命军人家属组织起来的生产单位，共有二十四个，从事着被服、缝纫、制盒、装订、针织等十八种业务。其中，有十八个生产单位已经转成了生产合作社。使许多革命烈士家属、革命军人家属能够在这些生产单位中发挥其劳动积极性，并获得了生活的改善。山西省定襄县城关有二位革命残废军人、八位复员转业军人，在没有组织起来以前，单独生产有许多困难；经过组织起来以后，在模范转业军人邢能兴的领导下，开垦了河滩荒地，成立了石印局，从一九五二年五月干到一九五三年底，组内已积累有公共财产，每人的收入都有增加。全组十人原有五人未结婚，现在都结了婚，有三个人过去毫无家务，现在也建立了家务。他们不但谢绝了代耕，而且在一九五三年全组代耕了八户革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的四十亩土地，并自愿为贫苦革命烈士家属、革命军人家属担水扫雪打炕。邢能兴并当选为县人民代表会议的代表。这样的例子各县各市都有，他们不仅生活得到改善，且由于他们的集体主义的生动事实，影响到其他人民。人民政府给他们的帮助并不多，他们发挥的作用则很大，因而更得到政府和人民的尊敬。
    此外，革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人参加工厂、机关、学校及其他岗位工作和学习的，也有不少模范事例，证明他们是真诚的革命者，是社会主义建设的有力战士。
    在这里，我想向从事优抚工作的工作人员说几句话。我们的优抚工作，过去是有成绩的，今后依从总路线的要求，依照第二次全国民政会议决议的指示，当获得更大的成绩。比如北京市在一九五三年对革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人进行政治教育，先后组织了五次革命军人家属政治学习班，参加学习的共有八百八十六人；又组织了革命烈士家属、革命军人家属一百九十人学习会计、缝纫、装订、制盒等技术，这些办法是很好的。北京市为革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人介绍到各机关、工厂、企业、学校等部门工作，一九五三年共有一千六百五十三人，市人民政府有专人负责，因而介绍就业的效率显著，这也是很好的，值得仿效的。全国各地优抚工作做得好的很多，但有些地区的工作还不能令人满意。今后必须进一步号召和组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人参加生产参加互助合作组织参加国家的各项建设事业。这是主要的，但并不是说可以放弃代耕和实物补助，必要的代耕和实物补助，必要的生活与生产困难的解决，还是优抚工作不可忽视的部分。
    还有，我感觉召开定期的或不定期的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人的代表会议，就像你们现在所开的会议一样，它不但能提高大家的思想觉悟，成为教育革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人的一种最好的方式，而且能密切政府和你们的联系，成为推动优抚工作的一种有力的工具。我希望各地都能召开这样的会议。同时我觉得在革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人中培养模范，树立旗帜，是很重要的工作。你们之中，已有很多人是模范，我希望你们进一步努力，争取长期保持模范的光荣称号，尚未成为模范的，则应争取成为模范。我希望全国的优抚工作者，都能重视培养模范的工作。
    诸位代表，我们的亲人和战友，现在正在前方服务，在美帝国主义的侵略野心依然未死的情况下，他们担负着保卫远东和世界和平保卫祖国的建设的光荣任务。他们爱国主义精神的高昂，他们工作的积极和生活的艰苦，都是可歌可泣的。现在第三次赴朝慰问团正在全国作归国传达报告，各位想必也听过这种报告。我以为生活在后方的人，听听朝鲜战争情况的报告，听听前方战士战斗情绪高昂和生活艰苦的报告，听听前方军民合作互助情况的报告，是很有教育意义的，从前方来看后方，我们就要感觉我们的不够，感觉比起我们的最可爱的人的伟大贡献来，我们还是微不足道，我们将感到自己责任的重大。特别是政府干部，应该更加做好帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人解决生产和生活上的困难问题的工作，以使他们能进一步获得生活的改善，获得参加生产参加互助合作组织参加国家各项建设事业的条件。我建议你们多和前方战士通讯，以便从他们的来信中得到教育，得到鼓励与安慰，同时，也用你们的信件，去鼓励与安慰前方的战士。我还建议各级从事优抚工作的干部，经常以前方的情况来检查自己的工作，来教育群众，来进一步做好优抚工作。
    我祝贺诸位身体健康！祝贺诸位的亲人和战友——我们的最可爱的人——中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军、中国人民公安部队的全体指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员、后勤工作人员的身体健康！
    伟大的烈士们永垂不朽！
