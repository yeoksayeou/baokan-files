    Grand Event at Yaroslavsky Station
    A Record of the First Direct Train Service from Moscow to Beijing
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow, Li Nan
    
    A splendid and brand-new passenger train was stationed on platform number one of Moscow's Yaroslavsky Station. At the entrance to the platform hung a red banner with the white characters "Long Live the Great Friendship Between the Peoples of China and the Soviet Union" written in both Chinese and Russian. On the platform, amidst the dense snow and cold wind, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union fluttered. More than a dozen strong spotlights illuminated the names of the two great capitals, "Moscow-Beijing," written in Chinese and Russian on the green carriages.

    This was the first direct Moscow-Beijing train to Beijing. The train departed from Moscow at 5:50 PM (Moscow time) on January 31st. This train would traverse more than 9,000 kilometers, crossing the Ural Mountains where Europe and Asia meet, passing through the vast Siberian wilderness, along the beautiful shores of Lake Baikal, and through China's Songhua River and the Northeast Plain, directly reaching China's capital, Beijing. This was the longest direct train route in the world. Passengers would spend nearly nine days and nights of comfortable travel on the train, traveling from the capital of one great nation to the capital of another great nation.

    Konstantinov, the stationmaster of Yaroslavsky Station, greeted the guests who came to the station to offer congratulations with a warm smile. At various entrances to the station, passengers and their relatives and friends continued to arrive. On this train, there were a total of 365 passengers departing from Moscow, of which 135 were direct passengers to Beijing. On this train were Chinese students who had completed their studies in the Soviet Union and were returning home, Soviet experts who were coming to China to assist in construction, friends from our neighboring country of North Korea, and Romanian personnel working in Beijing. There were also many Soviet people traveling to various locations in the Soviet Far East.

    The famous and familiar song "Moscow-Beijing" was broadcast loudly on the platform, along with beautiful Russian folk songs and songs that made Chinese passengers feel particularly close, such as "Ode to the Motherland" and "We Workers Have Strength" sung in Chinese. Amidst the touching songs, passengers successively entered their carriages. In the middle compartment of one carriage were staff returning from the Machine Tractor Station conference in Moscow. Four Korean friends boarded in the compartment on the left. On the right was a Soviet family with two children. The children leaned against the window, waving to the people on the platform. People helped each other carry luggage, greeting newly arrived friends, who were not yet familiar, with the words "Moscow-Beijing." Here, people experienced the warmth and cordiality of people's friendship.

    Snowflakes fell incessantly on the platform, and the cold wind blew, but passengers entering the carriages could feel warmth and comfort like at home. The corridors and rooms of each carriage were covered with exquisite carpets with rich Russian folk flavors and hung with delicate curtains. Each room had a radio, soft sofas, a dining table and a desk lamp, toys such as chess, and magazines and pictorials introducing China and the Soviet Union. All signs in the train were in both Russian and Chinese. In each carriage, there was a detailed timetable in both Chinese and Russian. At each stop, passengers would hear the local place names and stopping times reported in both Russian and Chinese. On the train, passengers could listen to Soviet music and Chinese songs. In the dining car, Chinese passengers could not only see menus in Chinese but also eat dishes prepared in the Chinese style. There was a library on the train exclusively for passengers to borrow from, with 500 books in Russian and Chinese. On the train, passengers could send letters and telegrams; within the Soviet Union, they could also use the telephone to talk to relatives and friends in distant cities.

    Here, people could feel how meticulous and thoughtful the Soviet railway staff had been in preparing for the opening of the service, for the comfort and convenience of the passengers. As Stationmaster Konstantinov said: "We railway staff regard this opening as a grand event in Sino-Soviet friendship. We should do our best to make this journey the most convenient journey." The Soviet staff on the train learned Chinese with the greatest enthusiasm. Under the guidance of professors at the Moscow Oriental Institute, they learned more than 400 Chinese characters after three months of training and were able to answer inquiries from Chinese passengers. On the train, people could see them greeting passengers while still practicing the Chinese language.

    The staff assigned to the train were all excellent employees of the Soviet railways. The train conductor, Likuli, was a very experienced person who had worked for many years. Excellent personnel were also selected to serve as the train drivers. This time, the train driver, Filipov, was a veteran worker with 23 years of experience. The carriages on the train were all newly manufactured. Workers had particularly improved the wheel manufacturing technology, enabling the direct train to travel at 70 kilometers per hour.

    The moment of the train's departure was approaching. The loudspeakers on the platform alternately reported the train's departure time and the precautions to be taken along the journey in Russian and Chinese. Well-wishers and guests crowded the entire platform. Soviet Minister of Transportation Beshchev and personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arrived, as well as personnel from the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union and many Chinese students studying in Moscow. In the station, in a room with bottles of wine and fruit, Chinese and Soviet personnel raised their glasses to celebrate the opening of the direct train service, the friendship between the two peoples, and the common cause of peace.

    On the platform, people waved to the passengers and said goodbye to their relatives and friends. Two Soviet women who were seeing off several Korean friends were softly saying, "Happy journey." Chinese comrades were waving to Soviet friends in the carriages. A Soviet worker in a railway uniform said loudly: "The peoples of China and the Soviet Union are truly outstanding peoples." Movie cameras filmed the crowds saying goodbye and offering blessings.

    The train slowly moved forward. The well-wishers and guests forgot the severe wind and snow, rushing ahead of the train, cheering it as it left the platform, wishing this direct train carrying the friendship of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union a safe journey to the East.

    雅罗斯拉夫斯基车站的盛事
    记莫斯科——北京直达列车第一次通车
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李楠
    一列华丽崭新的客车停在莫斯科雅罗斯拉夫斯基车站的第一号站台上。站台入口处挂着一幅红底白字用中文俄文写着“中苏两国人民伟大的友谊万岁”的横额。站台上迎着密雪寒风飘扬着中苏两国的国旗。十多架强烈的聚光灯辉耀着绿色车厢上用中文俄文书写的两个伟大首都的名字：“莫斯科—北京”。
    这是开往北京的莫斯科—北京第一次直达列车。列车在一月三十一日下午五点五十分（莫斯科时间）从莫斯科开出。这列火车将经过九千多公里旅程，经过欧亚两洲交界的乌拉尔山脉，经过辽阔的西伯利亚原野，经过美丽的贝加尔湖畔，经过我国的松花江和东北平原直达我国的首都北京。这是世界上里程最长的直达列车。旅客们将在列车上经过将近九昼夜舒适的旅途生活，从一个伟大国家的首都到另一个伟大国家的首都。
    雅罗斯拉夫斯基车站站长康士坦丁诺夫带着笑容热烈地接待来到车站祝贺的来宾们。在车站的各个入口，旅客们和送别的亲友们不断地进来。在这次列车中，从莫斯科出发的共有三百六十五名旅客，其中一百三十五人是直达北京的旅客。在这次列车上有我国学成回国的留苏实习学生，有到我国帮助建设的苏联专家，有我国另一邻邦朝鲜的朋友，有罗马尼亚到北京的工作人员。还有更多的到苏联远东各地的苏联人民。
    站台上嘹亮地播送着“莫斯科—北京”这一著名的为人熟悉的歌曲，播送着优美的俄罗斯民歌和使中国旅客特别感到亲切的用中国语言唱的“歌唱祖国”、“咱们工人有力量”等歌曲。在感人的歌曲中，旅客们陆续走进自己的车厢。在一列车厢的中间房间里的是从莫斯科开完机器拖拉机站会议回去的工作人员。在左边的房间里上来了四个朝鲜朋友。右边是一个带着两个孩子的苏联家庭。孩子们扶着车窗向站台上的人挥手。人们在相互帮助着递送行李，在用“莫斯科—北京”的话语招呼着新上车来的暂时还不熟悉的朋友。在这里，人们体验到人民友谊的温暖和亲切。
    站台上不息地飘落着雪花，寒风在吹刮着，但旅客们进入车厢却可以感到像在家庭似的温暖和舒适。每部车厢的走廊和房间都铺着高贵的、富有俄罗斯民间风味的地毡，挂着精美的窗帘。每个房间都有无线电收音机，有柔软的沙发，有餐桌和台灯，有象棋等类玩具，有介绍中国和苏联的杂志画报。列车内各种标志都同时用俄文和中文两种文字。在每部车厢里，都有详细的中俄文对照的时刻表。在每个停车站，旅客将听到用俄语和汉语报告当地的地名和停车的时刻。车上，旅客们将能听到苏联的音乐和中国的歌曲。在餐车里，中国的旅客们不仅能看到中文的菜单，还可以吃到仿照中国作法的菜肴。列车上有专门供旅客借阅的图书馆，这里有五百本俄文和中文的书籍。在列车上，旅客可以交送信件和电报；在苏联境内，还可以利用电话和远方城市的亲友谈话。
    在这里，人们会感到苏联的铁路员工为准备通车，为旅客的舒适和便利做了多么细致和周到的工作。正如康士坦丁诺夫站长讲的一样：“我们铁路员工把这次通车看作是中苏友谊的一件盛事。我们应该尽自己的力量使这段旅程成为最便利的旅程。”列车上的苏联工作人员以最大的热情学习中文，他们在莫斯科东方学院教授的帮助下，经过三个月的训练已学会了四百多个中文字，已能回答中国旅客的询问。在列车上，人们看见，他们一面招呼旅客，一面还在练习着中国语言。
    列车上配备的都是苏联铁路方面优秀的员工。列车长利库利是极有经验的工作多年的人员。列车的司机也挑选优秀的人员担任。这一次列车的司机费利波夫就是一个工作二十三年的老工人。列车上的车厢都是新出厂的。工人们特别改进了制造车轮的技术，使直达列车每小时能行驶七十公里。
    列车出发的时刻快到了。站台上的播音机用俄语和汉语交换着报告行车的时刻和沿途旅程应注意的事项。送别的人和来宾挤满了整个站台。苏联交通部部长别什切夫和外交部的人员到来了，我国驻苏大使馆的人员和许多在莫斯科的中国留学生也来了。在车站里，在一间摆着酒瓶和水果的房间里，中苏两国人员举杯为这次直达通车庆祝，为两国人民的友谊，为共同的和平事业庆祝。
    在站台上，人们挥着手向旅客们向亲友们道别。两个送别几个朝鲜友人的苏联妇女在轻轻地说着旅途幸福。中国同志在向车厢中的苏联朋友挥着手。一个穿着铁路人员制服的苏联工人大声地说：中苏两国人民，这是真正优秀的人民。电影机拍摄着道别和祝福的人群。
    列车缓缓地向前移动了。道别的人们和来宾忘记了风雪严寒赶在列车的前面，欢送列车驶出站台，祝福着这部直达列车载着中苏两国人民的友谊驶向东方。
