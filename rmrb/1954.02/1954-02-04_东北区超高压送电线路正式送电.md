    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. The newly built 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line in Northeast China officially began transmitting power on January 27th. At 5:00 PM on January 28th, the capital construction department of the ultra-high-voltage transmission line handed the line over to the production department. The inexpensive electricity transmitted by the new line is now safely supplying industrial cities such as Anshan, Shenyang, Fushun, and Fuxin. Among the 128 electricity users recently approved by the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau, some have already received an ample supply of electricity from this line.
    Before the official commissioning of this ultra-high-voltage transmission line, rigorous acceptance and power transmission tests were conducted. When carrying out the step-up voltage test and the impact closing test at 220,000 volts, there were no problems with the entire line. The high quality of this line is the result of the workers' great attention to project quality during construction. For example, when workers from Team 304 connected the wire ends, they stamped each crimp connector with "Made by Group X" to show responsibility. From the start to the completion of the work, each construction team, whether it was laying the foundation, assembling the iron towers, burying the grounding devices, or stringing and tightening the wires, had to undergo strict inspection and acceptance by quality inspectors after each process was completed. The quality inspectors climbed high towers or jumped into foundation pits, inspecting very carefully and meticulously, and even the slightest problem had to be corrected.

    东北区超高压送电线路正式送电
   【新华社沈阳一日电】东北区新建二十二万伏超高压送电线路，已从一月二十七日起正式送电。一月二十八日下午五时，超高压送电线路的基本建设部门已把线路移交给生产部门。新线路输送出来的廉价电力已安全地供应给鞍山、沈阳、抚顺和阜新等工业城市。沈阳电业局最近批准的一百二十八家用电户，有的已经从这条线路得到充裕的电力供应。
    这条超高压送电线路正式送电前，曾经过严格的验收和送电试验。当进行二十二万伏超高压的递升加压试验和冲击合闸试验时，全部线路未出任何问题。这条线路的质量好，是工人们在建设过程中非常注意工程质量的结果。如三零四队的工人接线头时，在每个压接管上都打上“某某小组制”的钢印，以示负责。各工程队从开工到完工，无论是打基础、组铁塔、埋接地装置和架线、紧线等，每个工序结束后都要经过质量检查人员严格的检查和验收。质量检查人员们攀登高塔或跳下基础坑，检查得很认真细致，即使有一点点小毛病也要设法纠正过来。
