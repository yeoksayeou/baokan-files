Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th: Chinese People's Volunteer Army commanders and fighters, filled with joyful feelings about the bright future of socialist construction in their motherland, are joyfully celebrating their fourth Spring Festival in Korea since leaving their country.

On this Spring Festival day, a festive scene was present everywhere on the positions of the Volunteer Army units. Many unit commanders and fighters got up especially early, each dressed neatly. Some commanders and fighters also wore their gold "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative medals and "Long Live Peace" commemorative medals, as well as various orders and medals, on their chests, congratulating each other on the first Spring Festival after the armistice victory. The Volunteer Army soldiers guarding the "T-shaped Mountain" position in the central sector hung colorful lanterns and pasted colorful slogans in front of their barracks and halls. One slogan read: "Maintain vigilance to guard the position, celebrate the Spring Festival with joy."

The Volunteer Army units held various cultural and recreational activities on this Spring Festival day. On many positions, drums and gongs shook the sky, and songs never ceased all day long. Movie projectionists from the units formed many projection teams and went to the positions to show movies to the soldiers. Many units held sports competitions. The Volunteer Army soldiers guarding the west coast performed programs such as climbing mountains to seize red flags, parallel bars, pommel horse, and traditional Chinese martial arts; and held singing and dancing competitions. A Volunteer Army unit on the eastern front held a grand soldiers' literary and artistic performance. A certain unit of the Korean People's Army, which guarded the position alongside the Volunteer Army, also sent a慰问团 and a战士演出队to慰问 a certain Volunteer Army unit guarding the Kim Il-sung area.

During the Spring Festival, commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army units held forums. On New Year's Eve, Gao Lianglun, a second-class combat hero of a certain Volunteer Army unit, reported to his comrades about his visit to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Shenyang. The soldiers of the squad where Hu Xiudao, who was awarded the title of "Hero of the Republic" of Korea, was located held a forum to recall the great victory of resisting America and aiding Korea.

The Volunteer Army units universally inspected mass discipline during the Spring Festival and held joint celebrations with the local Korean people. Many unit commanders and fighters, beating gongs and drums, brought gifts and greeting letters to pay New Year's greetings to the local Korean people. A certain Volunteer Army unit on the western front sent representatives to comfort Park Young-soon, a model supporter of the army known as "Volunteer Army Mama," with gifts. The unit also presented Park Young-soon with a silk banner inscribed with the words "Our Mama" and a Spring Festival couplet reading "Mama loves us like her own family, Sino-Korean fighting friendship lasts forever." Many Volunteer Army units also invited local Korean people to dine together during the Spring Festival. A certain Volunteer Army unit on the western front also held a joint celebration with more than 3,000 local Korean people, and the local Korean people performed many beautiful folk dances. A certain railway unit of the Volunteer Army also held ball games and a get-together with Korean railway employees on this Spring Festival day.

While celebrating the Spring Festival, the Volunteer Army soldiers patrolled the northern edge of the demilitarized zone more vigilantly than usual, and artillery observers also watched the south vigilantly. A few days before the Spring Festival, the Volunteer Army unit guarding the front line position in Kim Il-sung captured a Syngman Rhee spy. The soldiers said that they would not relax or become complacent at any time.
