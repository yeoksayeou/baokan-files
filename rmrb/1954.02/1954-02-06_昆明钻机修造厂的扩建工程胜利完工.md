Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 4th: The expansion project of the Kunming Drilling Machine Repair and Manufacturing Plant was completed on January 31st, which will greatly contribute to geological drilling work in the Southwest region.

The Kunming Drilling Machine Repair and Manufacturing Plant is the only drilling machine plant in the Southwest region. Previously, due to insufficient equipment, many drilling tools, salvage tools, and consumable materials in the Southwest region had to be purchased from Tianjin and other places far away. The drilling machines used by the non-ferrous metal system were all transferred from Shenyang, Shanghai, Taiyuan, and other places, resulting in high transportation costs. To change this situation, the plant began to expand last winter. The total investment is more than double the plant's total output value last year. These investments were mainly used to expand equipment and factory building construction. Now, the plant's machinery and equipment have increased three times compared to before, and the number of employees has doubled. In the future, in addition to meeting the needs of all accessories and drilling towers for existing drilling machines, the plant will also manufacture drilling machines.

During the construction of the Kunming Drilling Machine Repair and Manufacturing Plant expansion project, it received strong support from various places. All the newly added equipment in the plant is domestically manufactured. Jinan Second Machine Tool Plant, Fourth Machine Tool Plant, and machine tool plants in Qiqihar, Shenyang, and other places manufactured more than 40 lathes, sawing machines, planers, milling machines, and so on for the plant. When the workers of the plant held the completion and commencement ceremony for the expansion project on January 31st, they expressed their determination to respond to the support of brother factories with practical actions of familiarizing themselves with the operation of these new machines.

    昆明钻机修造厂的扩建工程胜利完工
    【新华社昆明四日电】昆明钻机修造厂扩建工程已在一月三十一日完成，这对西南区地质钻探工作将起很大作用。
    昆明钻机修造厂是西南区唯一的钻机厂，原来由于设备不足，使西南区许多钻探工具、打捞工具以及消耗材料，都要远从天津等地进货。有色金属系统使用的钻探机，全部是从沈阳、上海、太原等地调来，运费很贵。为改变这种状况，该厂在去年冬天开始扩建。投资总额相当于该厂去年生产总值的一倍多。这些投资主要用于扩充设备及厂房建筑。现在，该厂的机器设备比以前已增加了三倍，职工人数增加了两倍。今后，该厂的生产除满足现有钻探机的全部配件和钻塔的需要外，并将制造钻探机。
    昆明钻机修造厂扩建工程施工中，曾得到各地的大力支援。该厂新增加的设备，全部是国内制造的。济南第二机器制造厂、第四机器制造厂以及齐齐哈尔、沈阳等地的机器制造厂，为该厂制造了四十多部车床、锯床、刨床、铣床等。该厂工人在一月三十一日举行扩建工程落成开工典礼时，纷纷表示要以熟悉这些新机器操作的实际行动来回答兄弟工厂的支援。
