(Xinhua News Agency, February 11th) According to TASS, Moscow: "Izvestia" and "Pravda" both published articles on the 10th, exposing the conspiracies of Western diplomats. These diplomats have recently begun to pretend to be willing to solve the Indochina issue.

    Polyanov wrote in "Izvestia": The fact that the Western diplomatic community has not yet submitted to the Berlin Conference a truly mature international problem for resolution has aroused dissatisfaction among the broad public in Germany and elsewhere.

    Western representatives are aware of this and are rushing to try to alleviate this sentiment somewhat. The task undertaken by the reactionary newspapers of Western Europe and the United States is: first, to unreasonably accuse the Soviet Union of not talking about anything new at the Foreign Ministers' Conference; however, every fair observer knows that the Berlin Conference has been discussing Soviet proposals from the beginning, while the Western countries have not put forward any calm and reasonable suggestions; second, to greatly exaggerate and make the world believe that the Western foreign ministers are seeking agreement on many "specific issues," including the Korean and Indochina issues.

    Therefore, we are faced with a strange situation: only a short time ago, in the first few days of the Berlin Conference, Western diplomats were unwilling to even hear about comprehensive discussions on any issues other than the German and Austrian questions. But when Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward proposals for a peaceful resolution of the German question and ensuring European security, the Western countries suddenly changed their tactics. While the Western diplomats simply ignored or avoided the Soviet proposals with unreasonable arguments, they are now suddenly expressing great interest in other aspects of international affairs. The Western countries verbally say they will "try their best" to ease the tensions in Southeast Asia and the Far East, while their actual actions are precisely to seek the completely opposite goal. They hope to use this to numb the vigilance of the people of all countries against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and international cooperation in Europe and Asia. At the same time, they are also attempting to shift the blame for implementing this policy onto those who are striving to ease international tensions not only in words but also in deeds. Therefore, Western diplomats and Western newspapers are once again trying their best to portray the People's Republic of China as the one responsible for the Indochina conflict, and the imperialist interventionists as warriors for peace.

    If Western diplomats sincerely hoped to end the bloody war in Vietnam, they could have taken all necessary measures long ago. But Paris and Washington clearly have very different plans.

    Polyanov concluded: All these facts show how valuable the hypocritical remarks of certain Western diplomats really are. They are trying to divert public attention in order to conceal the indecent actions of those who are preventing the easing of the situation in Europe and Asia, but their conspiracy has fallen apart as soon as it comes into contact with reality. Now they are saying that the key to solving the Southeast Asian problem is in Berlin. It might be more appropriate to say that the key is in Paris and Washington!

    The broad public in Western Europe is closely watching the progress of the Berlin Conference, and they are demanding that the Western countries stop playing diplomatic tricks and sit down to seriously discuss urgent issues. Millions of good people in all countries of the world are waiting for the resolution of these issues.

    O. Orestov also talked about this issue in "Pravda." He commented on a speech by French Foreign Minister Bidault, which was published on February 9 in the American newspaper "Neue Zeitung" published in German in Berlin. In his speech, Bidault expressed optimism about the future of the Berlin Conference and hoped that the conference would pave the way for an "Asian Issues Conference."

    Orestov wrote: "Neue Zeitung" pointed out that the French Foreign Minister's speech "is undoubtedly intended to influence French public opinion, which is shocked by the progress of the Berlin Conference."

    Orestov continued: Many facts show that "Neue Zeitung"'s view seems to have some truth to it. First of all, just as French public opinion is intoxicated with "optimistic" expectations, a conference is about to be held in Indochina. French Defense Minister Pleven and representatives of the US military command will participate in this conference. According to American newspapers, this conference will discuss the issue of expanding and strengthening military operations in Indochina, and not at all discuss the issue of ending the war there.

    At the same time, American newspapers are full of news about the United States stepping up its direct intervention in the Indochina War. It is worth noting that the American ruling group does not conceal that their direct intervention in the Indochina War is not due to concern for France's interests, but to ensure that the US armed forces are in control in Southeast Asia.

    To some extent, these actions are also to support the French ruling group, who have economic and political ties with the United States and are willing to continue the Indochina War.

    Orestov wrote: Based on these facts, it is difficult, even impossible, to believe that the "optimism" expressed in Bidault's speech is real. Similarly, it is difficult to believe the words of the "New York Times," which supports Bidault, saying that one of the main goals of the French delegation at the Berlin Conference is to seek ways to resolve the Indochina issue through negotiations.

    Orestov concluded: The proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Berlin Conference have put forward real solutions to the urgent Asian and Far Eastern issues. These methods provide concrete possibilities for easing international tensions.

    The Soviet delegation has repeatedly pointed out that the best way to solve urgent international issues, including Asian issues, is to convene a conference of the five major foreign ministers.

    The Western countries' representatives' opposition to these proposals can only make the whole world see that they are unwilling to solve the urgent problems in Asia and beyond.

    美英法的外交官装模作样表示愿意解决印度支那问题
    “真理报”和“消息报”揭穿他们的阴谋诡计
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“消息报”和“真理报”在十日都发表文章，揭露西方外交官的阴谋。这些外交官最近开始装模作样，表示愿意解决印度支那问题。
    波利扬诺夫在“消息报”上写道：西方外交界到现在还没有向柏林会议提出一项真正要解决成熟的国际问题的建议，这种态度引起了德国及其他地方的广大社会人士的不满。
    西方国家代表知道这一点，正在急忙设法稍稍缓和一下这种情绪。西欧和美国的反动报纸担负的任务是：第一，无理地指责苏联在外长会议上没有谈什么新的东西，然而，每一个公正的观察家都知道，柏林会议从一开头就在讨论苏联的建议，而西方国家却一直没有提出冷静而合理的建议；第二，大吹大擂地使世界相信西方外长正在包括朝鲜和印度支那问题在内的许多“具体问题”上谋求协议。
    因此，我们碰到了一种奇怪的情况：仅在不久以前，在柏林会议开头的几天，西方外交官除了德国和奥地利问题外，甚至不愿听到关于其他任何问题的全面讨论。但是当苏联外长莫洛托夫提出了和平解决德国问题和确保欧洲安全的建议时，西方国家就突然改变了它们的策略。西方外交官一面干脆不理或用毫无道理的论据避开苏联的建议，现在又突然表示对国际事务中的其他方面极感兴趣。西方国家口头上说要“竭力设法”缓和东南亚和远东的紧张局势，而实际行动却正是要设法达到完全相反的目的。他们希望以此来麻痹各国人民对和平与国际合作的敌人在欧洲和亚洲的阴谋的警惕。同时，他们还企图把执行这种政策的罪名转嫁在那些不仅在口头上而且在行动上争取缓和国际紧张局势的人的身上。所以，西方外交官和西方报纸就再次竭力企图把中华人民共和国说成是应对印度支那冲突负责的人，而把帝国主义干涉者说成是捍卫和平的战士。
    如果西方外交官真心希望结束越南的流血战争，他们早就可以采取各种必要的措施了。但是巴黎和华盛顿方面显然有着截然不同的计划。
    波利扬诺夫最后写道：所有这些事实说明了某些西方外交家的虚伪言论到底有多大价值。他们企图分散公众的注意，以掩藏那些阻止欧洲和亚洲局势缓和的人的不体面行动，但是他们这种阴谋一和实际接触就破了产。现在他们又说什么解决东南亚问题的关键是在柏林。说关键是在巴黎和华盛顿，也许还来得恰当一些吧！
    西欧广大的社会人士密切地注视着柏林会议的进展，他们要求西方国家停止玩弄外交手腕，坐下来认真讨论迫切的问题。世界各国千百万善良人民都在等待着这些问题的解决。
    奥·奥列斯托夫也在“真理报”上谈到了这个问题。他评论法国外交部长皮杜尔的一篇谈话，这篇谈话于二月九日刊登在柏林用德文出版的美国报纸“新报”上。皮杜尔在谈话中对柏林会议的前途表示乐观，并且希望会议会为“亚洲问题会议”开辟道路。
    奥列斯托夫写道：“新报”指出，法国外交部长的谈话，“其用意无疑是想影响对柏林会议进展情况感到震惊的法国舆论”。
    奥列斯托夫接着说：许多事实说明“新报”的看法似乎有点道理。首先，正当法国舆论陶醉于
  “乐观的”预料时，一个会议不久就要在印度支那举行了。法国国防部长普利文和美国军方司令部的代表都要参加这个会议。据美国报纸说，这个会议要讨论扩大和加强印度支那军事行动的问题，而根本不是讨论结束那里的战争的问题。
    同时，美国报纸充满了美国加紧直接干涉印度支那战争的消息。值得注意的是：美国统治集团并不隐瞒，他们直接干涉印度支那战争，并不是由于关心法国的利益，而是为了保证美国武装部队在东南亚处于控制地位。
    在某种程度上，这些行动也是为了替法国统治集团撑腰，这些人和美国有经济上和政治上的联系，愿意继续进行印度支那战争。
    奥列斯托夫写道：根据这些事实，人们很难，甚至于不可能相信皮杜尔谈话中所表示的“乐观”是实有其事的。同样，对于“纽约时报”大吹大擂的话，人们也很难相信。这个报纸支持皮杜尔的话，说法国代表团在柏林会议上的主要目的之一，是要寻求办法，通过谈判来解决印度支那问题。
    奥列斯托夫最后写道：苏联在柏林会议上提出的建议，已经提出了解决迫切的亚洲和远东问题的真正办法。这些办法为缓和国际紧张局势提供了具体的可能。
    苏联代表团再三指出：要解决包括亚洲问题在内的迫切的国际问题，最好的办法就是召开五大国外长会议。
    西方国家的代表反对这些建议，只能使全世界看出他们不愿意解决亚洲的迫切问题以及亚洲以外的问题。
