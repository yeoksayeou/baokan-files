The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin has been discussing the German question and the issue of guaranteeing European security for two weeks. During the discussion of this issue, the Soviet delegation put forward broad and concrete proposals for resolving the German question and guaranteeing European security. The Soviet government submitted suggestions such as the "Draft Treaty on Germany," "Preparing a Peace Treaty with Germany and Convening a Peace Conference on Germany," and "Establishing a Provisional All-German Government and Holding Free All-German Elections" for consideration at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and raised the issue of alleviating Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war. On February 10, the Soviet government submitted the full text of its proposal on "Ensuring European Security" and a draft of the basic principles of a "Pan-European Treaty on Collective Security" for discussion.

The Soviet proposals are based on the realistic possibility that exists this year to complete the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, to resolve disputes between European countries, and to strive for agreements on guaranteeing European collective security. Based on this possibility, the Soviet government suggested that a peace conference to discuss the treaty with Germany should be convened no later than October 1954. The Soviet government also suggested that the four Foreign Ministers' assistants be tasked with preparing a draft peace treaty within three months; these assistants could begin this work shortly after the Berlin Conference ends.

The purpose of the Soviet Union in putting forward these proposals is to end the abnormal situation caused by the Western countries' deliberate procrastination in resolving the German question and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet government, in the spirit of adopting a consultative approach by the four major powers to resolve the German question, put forward its own proposals. These proposals will be supported by the democratic forces of the German people.

The Soviet proposals on the German question are based on this firm and unwavering democratic principle: the unification of Germany should be carried out by the Germans themselves, not by foreign occupying authorities. Therefore, the Soviet government suggested the establishment of a provisional All-German government by the Parliament of the German Democratic Republic and the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany, with the broad participation of various democratic groups. The main task of this government would be to prepare and conduct genuinely democratic elections in a short period of time, free from interference by imperialist monopoly groups, fascist organizations, and other reactionary forces. After the elections, an all-German National Assembly could be formed this year, which could formulate an all-German constitution and establish an all-German government with full rights that could conclude a treaty.

In order to guarantee the true freedom of the all-German elections and to prevent the foreign occupying forces from exerting any pressure on the elections, the Soviet government proposed that the occupying forces be withdrawn from East and West Germany before the elections, leaving only a limited number of troops needed to carry out the security responsibilities within the scope of the Four-Power Control mission.

All of the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question are permeated with a desire to help the German people reunify Germany into a democratic, peace-loving, and independent state based on the principles of the Potsdam Agreement and to help the German people build their lives according to democratic and peace-loving principles. Among these major proposals of the Soviet Union, it is emphasized that the revival of German militarism must be prevented. German militarism is not only the deadly enemy of Germany's neighbors but also the deadly enemy of the German people themselves. The Soviet proposals also pointed out that Germany must not join any military blocs of European countries aimed at opposing other European countries.

The task of resolving the German question and guaranteeing European security is indivisible. Therefore, the attention of world public opinion is naturally focused on the Soviet proposal of February 10 to establish European collective security.

V.M. Molotov, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, pointed out in his proposal:

"...The Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to establish a pan-European collective security system instead of organizing some countries to oppose other European countries. This system should stipulate that all European countries cooperate closely to prevent the disruption of peace in Europe and provide the necessary resistance should peace be disrupted; furthermore, it should stipulate the corresponding specific obligations of these countries, including obligations of a military nature, so that the system can be powerful and effective."

Everyone knows that an attempt by one group of European countries to oppose other European countries has caused two world wars. In order to prevent a third world war, historical lessons should be learned. That is to say, efforts must be made to prevent European countries from establishing mutually opposing military blocs. At the same time, we cannot forget the particularly dangerous role that German militarism played in launching the First and Second World Wars.

The Soviet government put forward proposals on guaranteeing European security based on the actual situation formed by the Western countries' unwillingness to resolve the German question and eliminate the division of Germany. At present, given that the three Western countries have not yet submitted their draft peace treaty with Germany and are refusing to hold discussions on this issue, the Soviet draft stipulates that before Germany is unified, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany may participate in the European Collective Security Treaty, enjoying equal rights; after Germany is unified, a unified Germany may participate in the treaty under general conditions.

Establishing a collective security system in Europe will not in any way diminish the importance of resolving the German question as soon as possible; the German question must be resolved in accordance with the needs of maintaining peace in Europe. Moreover, the establishment of such a collective security system will certainly help to resolve the German question, because such a system prohibits dragging one part or another of Germany into military blocs, which can remove a major obstacle on the road to building a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany.

The Soviet plan for resolving the German question and guaranteeing European security has attracted the attention of a wide range of international figures and has won the strongest support from the people of European countries, including the German people. The broadest strata of European countries understand that this plan points out a reliable shortcut to consolidating peace and cooperation in Europe and the world.

Some members of European society are comparing the specific, well-founded Soviet proposals, which are filled with genuine concern for consolidating peace, with the negative stance adopted by the representatives of the three Western countries in Berlin. Everyone sees that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France have rejected the Soviet proposals one after another, while at the same time, they themselves have not put forward any proposals. Everyone can also see that the position of the Western countries' representatives is determined by their obvious unwillingness to restore German unity. In addition, the course of the conference also shows that all the efforts of American diplomacy are aimed at prolonging Germany's reunification and the conclusion of a treaty with Germany for a long time.

The only proposal that the representatives of the three Western countries brought to the Berlin Conference was the so-called "Eden Plan," which stipulates that elections should be held in Germany under the supervision of the Four-Power occupying authorities. This plan opens up the widest possibilities for revanchist fascists to run rampant and act freely. With the help of this plan, certain American groups, with the support of certain officials in France and Britain, are blatantly intending to enable that militarist group to seize power in a unified Germany. This militarist group is rapidly restoring the German Wehrmacht in the name of West Germany, and using this army as the main assault force of the "European Defense Community." It is quite clear that such elections will undoubtedly make it easier for the militarist, revanchist group to seize power in Germany, just as the sham democratic elections in 1932 cleared the way for Hitler to seize power.

Broad sections of the people in Europe understand that the American diplomatic officials, who have been pretending to be concerned about resolving the German question as soon as possible in recent months and willing to hold a four-power conference for this purpose, actually have completely different plans. Now, even the American press does not hide that the main purpose of the US State Department is to convince European public opinion in this regard that it is impossible to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, and therefore it is necessary to submit to the concept of splitting Germany and attract West Germany to join the "European Army" as soon as possible. This plan has failed. Facing a concrete, clear plan for resolving the German question and guaranteeing European collective security, which is recognized by all peace-loving people as feasible, the representatives of the Western countries have recently begun to try to undermine the discussion of the German question.

Initially, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France opposed a serious discussion of the first item on the agenda - measures to ease international tensions and convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the five major powers - on the pretext that the main topic of the Berlin Conference, as they affirmed, should be the German question. But now, they are trying to obstruct a serious discussion of the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question by using the excuse that the Austrian question must be discussed and the first item on the agenda must be further studied.

It is clear to everyone that the fact that the delegations of the three Western countries are doing their best to avoid discussing the most important outstanding issues in the international situation proves that they are unwilling to seek solutions to these issues. As everyone knows from reports in the American and Western European press, the American delegation had no intention of resolving those outstanding issues when it attended the Berlin Conference. US Secretary of State Dulles' attitude confirms these press reports.

However, the attempt by some people in the United States to use the Berlin Conference to accelerate the realization of their plan to establish a "European Army" has failed. The people of European countries see that a new road has been opened before them to resolve the German question and guarantee European security. The people of European countries are clearer than ever before that the American-style "small Europe," in which only six of the thirty-two countries in Europe participate, will be opposed to other European countries and will therefore only be a hotbed for creating new conflicts and exacerbating international tensions. At the same time, they also see that the Soviet government's plan to guarantee European security in order to resolve the German question will establish a peace-loving democratic Germany in Central Europe, eliminate friction and conflicts among European countries, and bring peace and prosperity to the people of European countries.

The Soviet people warmly support and support their government's proposals for resolving the German question and guaranteeing European security. These proposals have also received the support of the broad public in countries around the world.

The letter to all voters from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out: "The Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has been confirmed by all its actions. At present, the whole world sees how great the difference is between the atmosphere of artificial anxiety and war mania in capitalist countries and the atmosphere of peaceful, creative construction labor and stable, confident atmosphere that is unique to socialist countries. Everyone knows that the Soviet people are mainly concerned and most eager to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries. …

Millions of people in all countries call our motherland the pioneer and banner of peace. The banner of peace and friendship with the people of all countries is sacred and inviolable to us Soviet people! We are and will always hold high this great and lofty banner."

The process and development of the Berlin Four-Power consultations convincingly confirms the peace-loving nature of Soviet foreign policy. This policy is formulated under the care of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government for the vital interests of the Soviet people.

    为了巩固欧洲的和平与安全
    ——苏联“真理报”二月十二日社论
    柏林四国外长会议讨论德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题已经有两个星期了。在这个问题的讨论过程中，苏联代表团提出了解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的广泛而具体的方案。苏联政府将“关于对德和约的草案”、“准备对德和约及召开关于对德和约的和平会议”、“关于成立临时的全德政府和举行全德自由选举”等项建议提交柏林四国外长会议考虑，并提出了关于减轻德国由于战争后果而担负的财政与经济义务的问题。二月十日，苏联政府将关于“保障欧洲安全”的建议全文和“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的基本原则的草案提交会议讨论。
    苏联的建议是根据在今年已经具有完成对德和约的准备和缔结、以及解决欧洲国家之间的争端和在保障欧洲集体安全方面努力达成协议的现实可能性而提出的。基于这种可能性，苏联政府建议不得迟于一九五四年十月召开讨论对德和约的和平会议。苏联政府同时建议责成四国外长助理在三个月内准备好对德和约草案；各外长助理可在柏林会议结束后不久立即进行此项工作。
    苏联提出这些建议的目的，是为了终止由于西方国家故意拖延德国问题的解决及对德和约的缔结而造成的不正常情况。苏联政府本着采取四大国协商的办法来解决德国问题的愿望，提出了自己的建议。这些建议会得到德国人民的民主力量的支持。
    苏联关于德国问题的建议，是以这个坚定不移的民主原则为基础的：德国的统一应由德国人自己来进行，而不应由外国占领当局来进行。因此，苏联政府建议由德意志民主共和国议会和德意志联邦共和国议会并在各民主团体广泛参加下成立一个临时的全德政府。这个政府的主要任务是：在短期内，在不受帝国主义垄断集团、法西斯组织及其他反动势力干涉的情况下，筹备和进行真正民主的选举。选举结束后，今年就可以组成全德国民议会，它可以制订全德宪法，并成立具有充分权利的、能缔结和约的全德政府。
    为了保证全德选举的真正自由以及防止外国占领军对选举施加任何压力，苏联政府提议在选举前自东德和西德境内撤退占领军，只留下为执行四国管制任务范围内的安全职权所需的数量有限的部队。
    苏联关于德国问题的全部建议都贯串着一个愿望：根据波茨坦协定的原则来帮助德国人民把德国重新统一成为一个民主的、爱好和平的、独立的国家，帮助德国人民根据民主与爱好和平的原则来建设自己的生活。在苏联的这些主要建议中，强调必须防止德国军国主义复活。德国军国主义不仅是德国邻邦的死敌，而且是德国本国人民的死敌。苏联的建议同时指出，德国不得加入欧洲国家任何旨在反对其他欧洲国家的军事集团。
    解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务是不可分割的。因此，现在世界公众的注意力自然集中在苏联二月十日所提出的建立欧洲集体安全的建议上。
    苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫在他的建议中指出：
    “……苏联认为必须建立一个全欧集体安全体系，而不是组织一些国家来反对其他欧洲国家。这种体系应该规定所有欧洲国家密切合作来预防对欧洲和平的破坏，在和平一旦遭受破坏时，提供必要的抵抗；此外，应该规定这些国家相应的具体义务，包括属于军事性质的义务，使这个制度得以有力、有效。”
    大家都知道，一个欧洲国家的集团反对欧洲其他国家的企图，曾引起两次世界大战。为了防止第三次世界大战，就应当吸取历史的教训。这就是说，必须尽力阻止欧洲国家建立互相对立的军事集团。同时，我们不能忘记德国军国主义在发动第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战时曾起过特别危险的作用。
    苏联政府提出关于保障欧洲安全的建议，是根据西方国家不愿解决德国问题和消除德国的分裂状态而形成的实际形势出发的。目前，鉴于三个西方国家到现在都没有提出它们的对德和约草案，而且拒绝就这个问题举行讨论，所以苏联的草案规定，在德国统一以前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以参加欧洲集体安全条约，享有同等的权利；在德国统一以后，统一的德国可以根据一般的条件参加这个条约。
    在欧洲建立集体安全体系，并不会在任何程度上减弱及早解决德国问题的重要意义，德国问题是必须按照维护欧洲和平的需要来解决的。而且，建立这种集体安全体系一定会有助于解决德国问题，因为这种体系禁止把德国这一部或那一部拖进军事集团，这就可以扫除在建立统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的道路上的一个主要障碍。
    苏联的解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的方案，引起了广大的国际人士的注意，并获得了欧洲各国人民——包括德国人民在内——的最有力的拥护和支持。欧洲各国最广泛的阶层都了解到，这个方案指出了通向巩固欧洲和全世界和平与合作的可靠的捷径。
    欧洲国家的一些社会人士把具体的、有很好根据的和对巩固和平充满了真正关心的苏联的建议与三个西方国家代表在柏林所采取的那种消极的立场相比。每一个人都看到，美国、英国和法国的外长一个接一个地拒绝了苏联的建议，同时，他们自己没有提出任何建议。每一个人也都看得到，西方国家代表们的立场，是由他们不愿恢复德国统一的明显愿望所决定的。此外，会议的进程也表明，美国外交的一切努力是旨在长期拖延德国的重新统一和对德和约的缔结。
    三个西方国家的代表们带到柏林会议上的只有这样一个唯一的建议：规定在四国占领当局监督下在德国举行选举的所谓“艾登计划”。这个计划为复仇主义的法西斯分子打开了横行和自由活动的最广泛的可能性。借助这个计划，某些美国集团在法国和英国的某些官方人士支持下，露骨地打算使那个军国主义集团取得统一了的德国的政权。这个军国主义的集团已经以西德的名义迅速恢复着德国国防军，并把这支军队作为“欧洲防务集团”的主要突击力量。这种选举，毫无疑问会使军国主义、复仇主义的集团更容易夺取德国的政权，就像在一九三二年在虚伪的民主选举的掩饰下曾为希特勒夺取政权肃清了道路一样，这已是十分清楚的了。
    欧洲广大阶层的人士都了解，最近数月来装作关心尽快解决德国问题并愿意为此目的举行四大国会议的美国外交官员，实际上怀着完全不同的打算。现在，甚至美国报刊都不掩饰，美国国务院的主要目的是想在这方面说服欧洲舆论界，即不可能同苏联达成协议，因此必须顺从使德国分裂的概念，并尽快地吸引西德参加“欧洲军”。这种打算是落空了。西方国家的代表，面对着的是具体、明确、而为一切爱好和平人民认作是切实可行的解决德国问题和保障欧洲集体安全的方案，于是他们最近几天开始想破坏对德国问题的讨论。
    最初，美、英、法三国的代表反对对第一项议程——关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开五大国的外长会议——作认真的讨论，借口是，柏林会议的主要课题一如他们所肯定的，应当是德国问题。但现在，他们又想用必须讨论奥国问题和继续研究第一项议程的口实，来阻碍认真讨论苏联就德国问题所提的建议。
    每个人都很清楚，三个西方国家的代表团竭力回避讨论国际局势中最重要的悬而未决的问题，这证明他们并不愿意求得这些问题的解决。正如大家从美国和西欧报刊的报道中所知道的那样，美国代表团在出席柏林会议时，就根本没有打算要解决那些悬而未决的问题。美国国务卿杜勒斯的态度就证实了这些报刊的报道。
    可是，美国的一部分人士想利用柏林会议来加速实现他们建立“欧洲军”的计划落空了。欧洲各国人民看到，在他们面前已经打开了通向解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的新道路。欧洲各国人民比以往更清楚地认识到，在欧洲的三十二个国家中一共只有六个国家参加的美式“小欧洲”，将会同其它欧洲国家相对立，因而只会是一个制造新冲突和加剧国际紧张局势的温床。同时他们也看到，苏联政府所提出的关于保障欧洲安全以解决德国问题的方案将使欧洲中部建立起一个爱好和平的民主德国，使欧洲各国间的摩擦和冲突得到消除，并为欧洲各国人民带来和平与繁荣。
    苏联人民热烈拥护和支持他们的政府关于解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全的建议。这些建议也得到了世界各国广大公众的支持。
    在苏联共产党中央委员会的告全体选民书中指出：“苏联的和平外交政策已经被它的一切行动证实了。目前，全世界都看到：在资本主义国家中那种人为的不安和战争狂的气氛，跟社会主义国家所特有的那种和平的、创造的建设劳动的环境以及安定的、充满信心的气氛，是有着多么大的差别。大家都知道，苏联人主要关心的和最渴望的是和各国人民和平友好相处。……
    各国千千万万的人都把我们祖国称为和平的先驱和旗手。和平与各国人民友好的旗帜对我们苏联人来说，是神圣不可侵犯的！我们正在而且将永远高高举起这面伟大、崇高的旗帜。”
    柏林四大国会商的过程和发展令人信服地证实了苏联外交政策的爱好和平的性质。这个政策是在苏联共产党和苏联政府关怀苏联人民切身利益的情况下所制定的。
