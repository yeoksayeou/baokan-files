Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 26th: The British Hong Kong government unreasonably refused the "Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City People's Delegation to Console Fire Victims of the Kowloon Deepwater Pier Six Villages" access to Kowloon to console affected compatriots.

After the delegation was formed, it wrote to the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, entrusting them to assist in handling matters related to going to Kowloon. The delegation recently received replies from the aforementioned organizations, learning that the British Hong Kong authorities actually used the excuse of so-called "security issues" to refuse the delegation's entry into Kowloon.

Zhang Zhennan, the head of the delegation, issued a statement saying: The British Hong Kong government's refusal of the delegation's entry into Kowloon proves that the British Hong Kong government has a guilty conscience. The cause of the fire in the Deepwater Pier wooden house area six villages this time is undoubtedly the same as the East Head Village fire in the winter of 1951. The delegation is no longer preparing to go to Kowloon, because the truth of this bizarre fire has been finally revealed to the world, and the affected compatriots have also more deeply felt the infinite and deep concern and love of the people of the motherland for them.

The Guangzhou Nanfang Daily also published a commentary on this on the 24th. The commentary pointed out: The British Hong Kong government's refusal of the delegation's entry into Kowloon proves that the cause of this fire cannot be investigated, and the "emergency" situation for the victims cannot be seen. The commentary said: The British Hong Kong government must continue to intensify relief and rehabilitation work for the tens of thousands of victims who are still in a state of displacement, hunger, and cold, and ensure that these measures are agreed to by the people. The British Hong Kong government must also effectively guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

Also: The 1,251,200,000 yuan in Renminbi donated by the people from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City to relieve the affected compatriots in the Kowloon Deepwater Pier wooden house area has been fully distributed. 57,671 affected compatriots have once again received relief funds from the people of the motherland, and they all sincerely thank the people of the motherland for their kind concern and assistance.

    香港当局拒绝广东各界慰问团进入九龙
    证明九龙深水埗六村火灾的灾情是看不得的
    【新华社广州二十六日电】香港英国政府无理拒绝“广东省、广州市各界人民慰问九龙深水埗六村火灾灾胞代表团”进入九龙慰问受灾同胞。
    慰问代表团成立后，曾致函港九工会联合会和香港中华总商会，委托他们协助办理前赴九龙的事宜。慰问代表团在最近接到上述团体的复函，得悉香港英国当局竟以所谓“治安问题”为借口，拒绝慰问代表团进入九龙。
    慰问代表团团长张振南为此发表声明称：香港英国政府拒绝慰问代表团进入九龙，证明香港英国政府作贼心虚。此次九龙深水埗木屋区六村大火的起火原因，和一九五一年冬东头村大火同出一辙，是无可怀疑的。慰问代表团已不准备前去九龙，因为此次离奇大火的真相，已经最终地大白于世，受灾同胞也已更加体会到祖国人民对他们无限深切的关怀和爱护。
    广州南方日报在二十四日也为此发表了评论。评论指出：香港英国政府拒绝慰问代表团进入九龙，证明此次火灾的起火原因是查不得，对灾民“急救”情况是看不得的。评论说：香港英国政府对仍处在流离失所、饥寒交迫困境中的数万灾民必须继续加紧进行救济和善后工作，并保证这些措施为人民所同意，香港英国政府还必须切实保证今后不再有同类事件发生。
    又：广东省、广州市各界人民救济九龙深水埗木屋区受灾同胞的捐款人民币十二亿五千一百二十万元已发放完毕。五万七千六百七十一个受灾同胞再一次领到了祖国人民的救济款，他们都衷心地感谢祖国人民的亲切关怀和援助。
