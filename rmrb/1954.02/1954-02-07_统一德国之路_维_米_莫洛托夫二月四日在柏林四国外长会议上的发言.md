    The Road to a Unified Germany
    -- V.M. Molotov's Speech at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference on February 4

    We are discussing the issue of a unified Germany.

    From the perspective of the German people's national interests, the resolution of this issue is extremely important. At the same time, this resolution must conform to the interests of lasting peace in Europe.

    In discussing the unification of Germany, we must recognize that at present, there are the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany on German territory, each with its own government and constitution, its own currency, borders, and domestic police. Under these circumstances, Germany's unification cannot be achieved if the two parts of Germany do not reach an agreement and if their common interests are not reasonably taken into account.

    We should not close our eyes to the fact that East and West Germany have developed along different paths in the post-war period.

    According to the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, in East Germany, monopoly capital and concerns have been completely dissolved, their existence is prohibited by the constitution, and the huge assets of Hitler's war criminals have been transferred to the people. A democratic land reform was implemented, and the land of the large aristocratic landlords who were the bastion of German militarism was given to land-poor farmers and returning migrants.

    In West Germany, despite the Potsdam Conference's decision to eliminate excessive concentration of economic power, concerns and monopoly capital continue to control the economy. Land reform has not been implemented to this day, and war criminals and militarists are playing an increasingly important role in the government and economy.

    These and many other differences in the situation in East and West Germany illustrate that the unification of Germany should not be regarded as a technical problem that can be accomplished without proper agreement between East and West Germany.

    Mr. Eden's plan, which was proposed and supported here by Mr. Dulles and Mr. Bidault, focuses solely on formal issues of an organizational and technical nature. We do not deny the importance of these issues, but in the current German question, formal issues are not of decisive importance.

    The Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary to first draw everyone's attention to the substance of the issue.

    We all say that we want to see a democratic, peace-loving, unified Germany. Our plan for a unified Germany must serve this purpose. This is also in the interests of the German people themselves.

    Does the plan of the three Western powers conform to these goals? It cannot be said that it conforms. Mr. Eden's plan ignores this issue, as if it were a minor issue unrelated to the matter.

    Then, the question arises: Why should we ignore well-known facts in German history that have undeniable lessons? Can we forget, for example, that the rise of German fascists, the Hitler party, was prepared through parliamentary activities? Let us look back at the period before the Hitler party came to power, from 1932 to 1933. As everyone knows, on July 31, 1932, Germany held parliamentary elections. The parliament met on August 30, and although the Hitler party only occupied a minority of seats, Goering was elected speaker of the parliament. The open preparation for putting Hitler in power began. As everyone knows, Franz von Papen played an important role in this work. Incidentally, Papen and Adenauer originally came from the same political roots. During the Weimar Republic, both Papen and Adenauer belonged to the right-wing group of the "Centre Party."

    In May 1932, Papen took office as Chancellor, and from then on, he began to actively clear the way for the Hitler party to come to power. However, he could not do much alone. The nationwide parliamentary elections on November 6, 1932, showed that in the three months after the previous parliamentary elections, the Hitler party lost more than two million votes, and as a result, the number of National Socialist members in parliament was greatly reduced. President Hindenburg, Chancellor Papen, and others adopted emergency measures to save Hitler and his party. In December 1932, General Schleicher was appointed as the new Chancellor. This was merely a stepping stone for the German fascists. On January 30, 1933, Hitler became Chancellor. From this time on, a stage began in German history that ended with the collapse of Hitlerism in the spring of 1945.

    Papen wrote in his memoirs, published in London in 1952: "One thing that should be understood is that Hitler's first government was formed strictly in accordance with parliamentary procedures within the framework of the constitution."

    However, regarding this point, Hitler had already said on September 7, 1932, that is, a few months before he came to power: "National Socialism will seize power through constitutional means."

    Needless to say, the issue is not about parliamentary procedures. Behind all these developments were giants of German heavy industry such as Thyssen, Krupp, von Bohlen, Keidorf, Flick, Voegler, Bausig, Changen, and Klöckner. One of Germany's largest monopoly capitalists, Thyssen, openly wrote in his memoirs that in 1932, "a large amount of money was transferred from the funds of heavy industry to the safe of the National Socialist Party." Naturally, this had already been done before this period. For example, everyone knows that the German Miners' Association, from January 1, 1931, levied funds from its members to regularly donate to the National Socialist Party, with shareholders deciding to donate five pfennigs for every ton of coal sold.

    Before Hitler came to power, big bankers and industrialists had given Hitler's party millions of marks and tens of millions of dollars. This also played a role.

    The Hitler party found a considerable number of allies and accomplices, paving the way for their rule. All of this was carried out while complying with parliamentary norms and formally complying with the German constitution, even though the Hitler party only occupied 32 percent of the total number of members in parliament. All of this information about Hitler's seizure of power is now well known. Many books have been published on this aspect in various languages.

    From this, a major conclusion can be drawn: we should not simply be obsessed with parliamentary forms and the organizational and technical aspects of this issue, to which our government gave due attention at the Potsdam Conference.

    The Potsdam Agreement signed by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and later joined by France, stipulated that "when a suitable German government is established, the German government" should accept the peace treaty with Germany, which is certainly not accidental. Nine years ago, we all understood that in order to conclude a peace treaty, there must be a "suitable German government."

    This provision should not violate another democratic principle, that is, the resolution of the German question is first and foremost a matter of concern to the German people themselves. In this regard, we must ensure that the steps taken by our four countries and the Germans themselves are properly coordinated.

    Is this principled provision outdated today?

    The Soviet government believes that this extremely important principled provision cannot be abandoned when resolving the German question. Otherwise, the events of 1932 to 1933 will be difficult to avoid repeating.

    Today's Papens and Schleichers will appear, and they will pave the way for today's fascists to seize power. We also cannot close our eyes to the fact that there are still Hitler remnants in Germany. We should remember our responsibility simply by recalling the sacrifice and bloodshed of our millions of brothers and sisters in the battle against Hitler's aggression. We must prevent fascist scum from dominating the central government agencies of a unified Germany by various means, including through parliament. The German people themselves are very concerned about preventing this.

    For some reason, Mr. Eden is not interested in this aspect of the issue. His plan's "five stages" do not stipulate any preventive measures in this regard. He is keen on formal constitutional and electoral procedures, etc. Apparently, he believes that the rest will be naturally guaranteed. It seems that as long as a good election law is passed, and a series of stages for a unified Germany are stipulated in writing, it will be enough to ensure that a unified Germany becomes a democratic and peaceful Germany.

    However, the Soviet people cannot agree to adopt this attitude towards such an important issue as establishing a unified Germany that is a democratic and peace-loving country.

    It is precisely because the German people have suffered enormous difficulties after thirteen years of Hitler's rule, and for this reason, we should not let things take their course. Just as in the Hitler era, the worst guys, those anti-democrats, may take advantage of the temporary difficulties of the German people after the war to usurp important positions in political life. Industrial giants and banks will also come forward, and they will once again spend millions of marks and dollars to put those who can unscrupulously work for them in power. In West Germany, there are such notorious revanchist-type adventurers. For example, not long ago, the British occupying authorities talked about the revival of West German fascist organizations. This is a real threat not only to Germany's neighbors but also to the German people themselves, especially the German working people who make up the vast majority of the population.

    All of this shows why the Soviet government cannot support Eden's plan.

    The plan of these three Western countries does not conform to the interests of lasting peace; it does not guarantee the basic interests of German democracy. On such a basis, we cannot guarantee that Germany will be reunified into a peaceful and democratic country. Tacitly agreeing to this plan would entail a new and dangerous gamble by German militarists. This is not in the interests of the German people, the interests of Germany's neighbors, the interests of European security, and it is not in the interests of Britain and the United States.

    First of all, we must reach an agreement on this basic issue, that is: do we agree that our task and the task of the German democratic forces are the same task? Do we agree that this task is to ensure that Germany is reunified into a democratic and peaceful Germany?

    Perhaps some people support the following position: it is enough for us to take care of the organizational and technical aspects of the election procedures, and as for the consequences of such elections, it has nothing to do with us. Perhaps this idea has influenced the plan proposed by Eden.

    We cannot agree with this position.

    We believe that after the elections, Germany should develop along a peaceful and democratic path, which is an unshirkable responsibility of the four countries. We should first reach an agreement on this point.

    There are two basic preconditions for guaranteeing the freedom of a unified Germany and its subsequent peaceful and democratic development. These conditions are related to internal issues on the one hand and external issues on the other.

    Let us first talk about the internal conditions necessary for reunifying Germany along a peaceful and democratic path.

    We all hope that the elections in Germany will be free and democratic. From this perspective, the conclusion should be that such elections should be held by the Germans themselves, not by foreign occupying authorities. The Soviet Union, which is related to East Germany, is not afraid of the Germans themselves and their democratic organizations preparing and holding elections. In East and West Germany, democratic forces are striving for a unified Germany, a Germany that will be democratic and peaceful.

    If our four countries sympathize with this and take concerted action, there is no doubt that a unified Germany will inevitably take this path, and the all-German elections will conform to the interests of democracy and peace in Europe.

    However, the goal of the plan of the three countries is not like this.

    A serious shortcoming of this plan is that it is full of distrust of German democratic forces.

    We cannot agree that the issue of German unification should actually be completely controlled by the occupying countries. Germans should not be excluded from this issue. This would be an insult to the German people, who have their own genuine democratic traditions.

    It seems as if the Germans themselves cannot even draft an election law for all-German elections. The Germans originally had their own election law during the Weimar Republic, which did not cause particular opposition from democrats. There are also election laws in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and incidentally, Mr. Eden does not think these two election laws are bad. Can't the Germans draft a new all-German election law that conforms to the current situation? Is it necessary for this law of the German people to be drafted in Britain?

    Mr. Eden's plan takes a different approach. This plan suggests that elections be supervised by the four countries with occupying forces stationed on German territory. This means undermining the rights of the German people and further expanding the rights of the occupying forces, which is incorrect.

    This suggestion is also full of distrust of German democratic forces.

    But if we want any truly democratic organizations to be able to actively participate in the preparation and conduct of elections without being excluded or deprived of their opportunities, then there is no need to implement any foreign control over all-German elections. The best way is for the Germans themselves to decide what should be done to ensure the normal democratic procedures for preparing and holding national elections. This will be in line with democratic principles.

    If we agree that holding all-German elections is a matter for the Germans themselves, then we should also draw corresponding practical conclusions. That way, we can no longer delay the practical steps for unifying Germany.

    We should help the Germans immediately establish appropriate all-German authorities. The best way to do this is for the parliaments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to form a provisional all-German government with the broad participation of various democratic organizations. Such a provisional all-German government can be established by agreement between East and West Germany and can replace the two current governments in Berlin and Bonn. If there are still difficulties in doing so at present, these two governments can be preserved for a considerable period of time. There is no doubt that the Germans themselves can prepare and hold free all-German elections in accordance with the interests of the German people, in accordance with their freedom and the interests of consolidating German national independence, and they will certainly do it better than the occupying authorities, and certainly not worse.

    Our four governments should provide all necessary cooperation to East and West Germany to promote the establishment of such an all-German center.

    If we refuse to help in establishing a provisional all-German government, we will only cause more difficulties and delays in the re-establishment of German unification. But if we recognize the need to establish a provisional all-German government, we will not only be able to help the German people exercise their legitimate right to establish a unified, democratic and peaceful Germany. We will also be able to solve many very practical problems as a result. In this way, we can alleviate the difficulties in the lives of the German people today, guarantee their rights, and ensure the development of economic, trade and cultural relations between East and West Germany.

    In order to guarantee the right of the German people to solve their own national problems, we should suggest that the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany immediately convene a meeting of plenipotentiary representatives from East and West Germany. Such a meeting can reach an agreement on the procedures for establishing an all-German provisional government, its composition, responsibilities, tasks and rights.

    All of this will make it possible to hold all-German elections under free conditions in the near future. That way, Germany will have the opportunity to convene an all-German parliament elected in free elections. This all-German parliament will not only form a provisional government, but also a government with full rights and based on a democratic constitution.

    The Soviet government starts from the premise that all these measures should be implemented by agreement between our four countries.

    We must pay particular attention to avoiding conflicts of interest between our four countries in this matter.

    Naturally, all-German elections must be conducted under conditions that allow all democratic groups to operate freely. This certainly does not mean that we should not take measures to stop the activities of fascist and militarist organizations. Similarly, big monopoly capitalists must not be allowed to put pressure on the work of preparing and conducting elections.

    Let us talk about the external conditions for guaranteeing the peaceful and democratic development of a unified Germany. This relates to the need to guarantee Germany's national independence.

    In this regard, we must again talk about the "European Defense Community" treaty, that is, the Paris Treaty and the Bonn Treaty signed by the West German authorities. We cannot ignore that the Paris Treaty, which stipulates West Germany's participation in the "European Army," is incompatible with the interests of the national independence of a unified Germany. It is also incompatible with the interests of European security, because it will lead to the revival of German militarism.

    To provide the necessary external conditions for establishing a free, peaceful Germany as an independent country, it is necessary to abandon the policy of imposing the "European Defense Community" treaty and the treaty requiring West Germany to participate in the West European army on West Germany. If this treaty, which stipulates West Germany's participation in the military group of West European countries for a period of fifty years, is preserved, it means that someone is attempting to extend this treaty to a unified Germany. Therefore, someone not only intends to bind West Germany with the "European Defense Community," but also to bind East Germany, which is naturally impossible.

    According to the Paris Treaty, West Germany can only be unified with East Germany if it continues to remain faithful to its obligations regarding participation in the West European army. That is to say, German unification is only possible when East and West Germany are dragged into the "European Defense Community" together. However, this is firmly opposed by the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the Paris Treaty on the "European Defense Community" is actually opposed to German unification. From this, it can be seen that it is also opposed to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany.

    Only one conclusion can be drawn from the above situation: in order to realize the plan for a unified Germany and make it possible to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, West Germany should never be forced to participate in the military group of West European countries, especially because this not only does not conform to the interests of the German people, but also violates the interests of lasting peace and security in Europe.

    In his speech today, Mr. Bidault expressed dissatisfaction with the criticism made by the Soviet delegation when it talked about the adverse effects of the European Defense Community on European international relations, while the Soviet delegation believes that this criticism is minimal. It is not difficult to point out that Mr. Bidault's arguments are completely weak. It is impossible to defend a plan that leads to the preparation for another war in Europe rather than the consolidation of peace.

    Let us summarize.

    The British proposal put forward by Mr. Eden and supported by the United States and France is unacceptable. The reasons are as follows:

    This proposal means an attempt to subject the work of holding all-German elections to the control of the occupying authorities and effectively exclude the Germans from the work of organizing and holding all-German elections. Doing so will not produce any good results.

    The three countries' suggestion does not guarantee the true freedom of elections and does not stipulate the prevention of foreign political pressure on elections. The starting point of this suggestion is: holding elections on the one hand, and maintaining the status quo of the occupying forces in Germany on the other. This is wrong.

    The three countries' suggestion not only does not guarantee the freedom of action of the all-German government after the elections, but on the contrary, restricts the rights of this government in advance, stipulating that Germany should be bound by the Paris and Bonn treaties after the all-German elections. The Paris and Bonn treaties are of a enslaving nature to the German people and make Germany undertake the obligation to participate in the West European army and the aggressive North Atlantic military group.

    The three countries' suggestions on the procedural issues of holding all-German elections will create a situation. In this situation, the German aggressive group may use this election to undermine the interests of European peace: use the election to support those who advocate the revival of German militarism and put them in power. This must be especially remembered, because such all-German elections have already occurred in German history, especially the 1932 election, which enabled German militarists and fascists to seize power and form the Hitler government.

    Therefore, in its current form, the three countries' suggestion on all-German elections not only cannot guarantee Germany's further development on a peaceful and democratic basis, but on the contrary, opens the way for those in Germany who are currently openly concealing their aggression and revenge plots against Europe to seize power. This is a direct threat to the cause of maintaining European peace, and first of all to the security of Germany's neighbors.

    The Soviet Union, which suffered the most in the war against Nazi Germany, cannot ignore this: once the forces that launched wars against peaceful countries in the past seize power in Germany, it means a threat of a new military adventure by German militarism.

    The Soviet government is proposing suggestions on the issue of unifying Germany and holding free all-German elections.

    The main feature of these suggestions is to promote the establishment of a unified Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis. The joint efforts of the four countries must serve this purpose. Only by relying on the democratic forces of Germany can we achieve this goal.

    In order to guarantee truly free all-German elections, the work of preparing and holding elections must be in the hands of the Germans themselves, not in the hands of the occupying authorities. In order to do this, we must promote reconciliation between East and West Germany and help them solve the problem of establishing a provisional all-German government, so that this government can be supported by all democratic forces in East and West Germany.

    In order to avoid the occupying authorities putting pressure on the elections, foreign occupying forces must be withdrawn from East and West Germany before the elections. In this case, only a limited number of troops necessary for performing security duties within the scope of the four-country control tasks will be left in Germany: the Soviet Union is responsible for East Germany; the United States, Britain, and France are responsible for West Germany.

    The Soviet delegation is now submitting to you for consideration the suggestion on "Establishing a Provisional All-German Government and Holding Free All-German Elections." Adopting these suggestions can lay a solid foundation for the issue of unifying Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis.

    In addition to all of the above, Eden's plan has another basic shortcoming. His plan would cause endless disputes over the "five stages" of the unified Germany he suggested. And all the urgent issues related to the German question are actually delayed indefinitely for a long time. It is enough to cite this point: for example, Eden's plan states that the "preparatory work for peace treaty negotiations" will only begin in the so-called third stage, that is to say, even the preparatory work for peace treaty negotiations cannot be started for a long time.

    In contrast to Eden's plan, the Soviet suggestions are simple and clear.

    If we recognize that it is now necessary to establish a provisional all-German government, then we have already taken a real step towards unifying Germany today. Such a step may not be complete. Therefore, it can only be temporary.

    The establishment of a provisional all-German government will mean that the democratic forces of East and West Germany can begin today to work for the true unification of Germany. The Germans should take the work of preparing and holding all-German elections into their own hands.

    Our four governments should trust and support them.

    统一德国之路
    ——维·米·莫洛托夫二月四日在柏林四国外长会议上的发言
    我们在讨论统一德国的问题。
    从德国人民民族利益的观点来看，这个问题的解决是非常重要的。同时，这个解决又必须符合于欧洲持久和平的利益。
    在讨论德国统一问题时，我们必须看到，在目前，德国领土上有德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国，它们各有自己的政府和宪法，有自己的货币、边界和国内警察。在这种情况下，如果德国两部分没有达成协议，如果不是合理地考虑到它们的共同利益，德国的统一就无法实现。
    我们不应该闭上眼睛，不看战后时期东德和西德是沿着不同路线发展的事实。
    根据波茨坦会议的决定，在东德，垄断资本和康采恩已被完全解散，宪法禁止它们存在，希特勒战犯的巨额财产已转入人民手中。实行了民主的土地改革，作为德国军国主义堡垒的大贵族地主的土地已被交给了缺地的农民和回国的移民。
    在西德，尽管波茨坦会议作出了消除经济力量过度集中现象的决定，康采恩和垄断资本继续控制了经济。那里到今天还没有实行土地改革，战犯和军国主义者在政府和经济中所起的作用越来越大。
    东德和西德局势中的这些以及其他许多不同之点都说明，不应把统一德国当作是一个不用东西德之间达成适当协议就能做到的一个技术问题。
    艾登先生提出的并在此间得到杜勒斯和皮杜尔两位先生支持的统一德国的计划，仅仅着眼于各种关乎组织和技术性质的形式问题上。我们并不否认这些问题的重要性，但是在目前这个德国问题上，形式上的问题并不具有决定性的重要意义。
    苏联代表团认为有必要请大家首先注意问题的实质。
    我们都说，我们希望看到一个民主的、爱好和平的、统一的德国。我们的统一德国的计划必须服从于这个目的。这也是符合于德国人民自身的利益的。
    西方三国的计划是否符合于这些目的呢？不能说它是符合的。艾登先生的计划中忽略了这个问题，好像它是一个与事情无关的小问题似的。
    那么，问题产生了：我们为什么要忽视具有不可否认的教训意义的德国历史上尽人皆知的事实呢？难道我们能够忘记，例如，德国法西斯分子、希特勒党羽的上台是通过议会活动来准备的吗？让我们回顾一下希特勒党羽上台以前的一段时期，一九三二年到一九三三年。大家知道，一九三二年七月三十一日，德国举行了国会选举。国会于八月三十日举行会议，尽管当时希特勒党羽在议员中只占少数，戈林却当选为国会的议长。捧希特勒上台的公开准备工作就此开始了。大家知道，在这个工作中起重要作用的是弗朗兹·巴本。顺便提一提，巴本和阿登纳原出于同一政治根源。在魏玛共和国时代，巴本和阿登纳都属于“中央党”的右翼集团。
    一九三二年五月，巴本就任总理，从那时起，他就开始为希特勒党羽的上台积极扫清道路。但是，他一个人的力量做不了很多事情。一九三二年十一月六日的全德国会选举说明，在前一次议会选举以后的三个月中，希特勒党羽失去了二百多万票，结果，国会中的国家社会党员大大减少了。兴登堡总统、巴本总理等采用了紧急措施来拯救希特勒和他的党。一九三二年十二月，斯莱彻将军被任命为新总理。这不过只是德国法西斯分子的踏脚石。在一九三三年一月三十日，希特勒当了总理。从这时起，在德国的历史上开始了一个阶段，这个阶段以一九四五年春季希特勒主义的垮台而告终。
    巴本在他的一九五二年出版于伦敦的回忆录中写道：“有一件应该了解的事情是：希特勒的第一个政府是严格地依照议会程序在宪法的规范内成立的。”
    然而，关于这一点，希特勒早在一九三二年九月七日，即他当权的几个月以前，就已经说过了：“国家社会主义将经由宪法途径掌握政权。”
    不用说，问题并不是什么议会程序。在局势的所有这些发展的后面，有这样一些德国重工业的巨头，如蒂森、克虏伯、冯·波伦、基多夫、弗利克、伏格勒、包西格、昌根、克吕克纳等人。德国最大的垄断资本家之一蒂森在他的回忆录中公开写道：在一九三二年“大批巨额款项从重工业的基金中转入国社党的保险箱。”自然，在这个时期以前，已经在这样做了。例如，大家都知道，德国矿主联盟从一九三一年一月一日起就向它的会员摊派款项定期捐助国社党，股东们决定每卖一吨煤抽五个芬尼捐献出来。
    在希特勒当权以前，大银行家和大工业家已经给了希特勒党以百万计的马克和以千万计的美元。这也起了作用。
    希特勒党羽找到了相当多的同盟者和共谋者，为他们的执政铺平了道路。这一切都是在遵守议会规范、形式上遵守德国宪法的情况下进行的，虽然希特勒党羽在国会中只占议员总数的百分之三十二。关于希特勒掌握政权的这一切情况，现在是人所共知的。关于这方面用各种文字出了不少的书。
    由此可以得出一个主要的结论：我们不应单单醉心于议会形式和这个问题的组织上、技术上的方面，我们的政府在波茨坦会议上对这方面是已给予了应有的注意的。
    由美国、英国和苏联所签订、后来法国也参加的波茨坦协定规定，“于合乎目的之德国政府成立时，德国政府”应该接受对德和约，这当然不是偶然的。九年前，我们大家都明白，为了签订和约，必须要有一个“合乎目的之德国政府”。
    这个规定不应当违背另一条民主原则、即德国问题的解决首先是德国人民自己所切身关怀的问题。在这方面，必须做到使我们四国和德国人自己的步骤适当地配合起来。
    今天，这个原则性规定是不是已经过时了呢？
    苏联政府认为，在解决德国问题时，不能抛弃这个极其重要的原则性规定。否则，一九三二年到一九三三年的事件将难免重演。
    今天的巴本和斯莱彻将出现，他们将为今天的法西斯分子夺取政权铺平道路。我们也不可闭起眼睛不顾德国还有希特勒余孽这个事实。我们只要记起我们千百万兄弟姊妹在抵抗希特勒侵略的战斗中牺牲流血，就应该想起我们的责任。我们必须防止法西斯败类用种种办法——包括通过议会的办法在内——在一个统一德国的中央政权机构中占统治地位。德国人民自己对于防止这一点是很关心的。
    为了某些原因，艾登先生对于问题的这个方面是不感兴趣的。他的计划中的“五个阶段”在这一点上并未规定任何预防性的措施。他热衷于形式上的宪政和选举的程序问题等等。显然，他认为其余的将自然而然地得到保障。似乎，只要通过一个很好的选举法，在字面上规定一连串统一德国的阶段那就够了，似乎那样就能保证使一个统一的德国成为民主与和平的德国。
    但是，苏联人民不能同意采取这种态度，来对待建立一个成为民主与爱好和平的国家的统一的德国这样一个重要问题的。
    正是因为德国人民经过希特勒主义十三年统治而遭受到巨大的困难，正因为这个原因，我们不应当听其自然。正如在希特勒时代一样，最坏的家伙，那些反民主分子，可能利用德国人民战后暂时的困难，僭夺政治生活中的要位。工业巨头和银行也将出面活动，他们将再一次花几百万的马克和美元使那些能不择手段地为他们奔命的人们掌握大权。在西德就有像这种恶名昭著的复仇主义类型的冒险分子。例如，不久前，英国占领当局谈到了西德法西斯组织的复活。这不仅对于德国的邻国而且对于德国人民自己，首先是占居民绝大多数的德国劳动人民是一个真正的威胁。
    这一切说明，为什么苏联政府不能支持艾登的计划。
    这三个西方国家的计划并不符合于持久和平的利益；并未保障德国民主的基本利益。在这样一个基础上，我们不能保证使德国重新统一成为一个和平与民主的国家。宽容地同意这个计划将招致德国军国主义分子的新的危险的赌博。这不符合德国人民的利益，不符合德国邻国的利益，不符合欧洲安全的利益，而且也不符合英国和美国的利益。
    首先，我们必须在这个基本问题上取得一致的意见，即：我们是不是同意我们的任务和德国民主力量的任务就是同样的一个任务。我们是否同意，这个任务是保证使德国重新统一成为民主与和平的德国呢？
    也许有人支持如下的立场：我们只要照顾到选举程序的组织上和技术上的方面就已经够了，至于这种选举的后果如何，跟我们没有什么关系。或许，这种想法对于艾登所提出的计划是有影响的。
    我们不能同意这种立场。
    我们认为在选举之后，德国应当沿着和平民主的路线发展，这是四国不容推卸的责任。我们首先应当在这一点上达成协议。
    保证一个统一的德国的自由及其以后的和平民主的发展，有两个基本的先决条件。这种条件一方面是跟内部问题有关，另一方面是跟外部问题有关。
    让我们先来谈为了按照和平民主路线重新统一德国所必须的内部条件。
    我们都希望德国的选举是自由的、民主的。从这方面来说，结论应当是：这种选举应当由德国人自己来举行，而不是由外国占领当局来进行。和东德有关的苏联是不怕由德国人自己和他们的民主组织来准备和举行选举的。在东德和西德，民主力量都在争取一个统一的德国，一个将是民主与和平的国家的德国。
    如果我们四国同情这一点，并采取一致的行动，毫无疑问，统一的德国将必然走这条道路，而且全德选举将符合欧洲民主与和平的利益。
    然而三国的计划的目标却不是这样。
      这个计划的严重缺点是：它充满了对于德国民主势力的不信任。
    我们不能同意德国统一问题实际上应当完全由占领国家来控制。不应当在这问题上把德国人排除在外。这对于具有自己的真正民主传统的德国人民将是一种侮辱。
    这好像是说，德国人自己甚至不能为全德选举草拟一个选举法。德国人原先在魏玛共和国时期就有他们自己的选举法，这个选举法并没有引起民主人士方面的特别反对。在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国也都有选举法，顺便说一句，艾登先生也并不认为这两个选举法是坏的。难道德国人就不能草拟符合目前情况的新的全德选举法吗？难道说，德国人民的这种法律必须在英国草拟吗？
    艾登先生的计划抱着另外一个方针。这个计划建议，由在德国领土上派有占领军的四国监督，进行选举。这意味着损害德国人民的权利，进一步扩大占领部队的权利，这是不正确的。
    这个建议对德国民主势力也是充满了不信任。
    但是，如果我们要使任何真正民主的组织都能积极参加选举的准备和进行，不至被排斥或被剥夺其机会，那就不需要对全德选举实行什么外国管制。最好的办法是由德国人自己决定应当怎样做，来保证准备和举行全国选举的正常的民主程序。这将是符合民主原则的。
    假如我们同意举行全德选举是德国人自己的事情，那么我们还应当得到相应的实际的结论。那样，我们就不能再拖延统一德国的实际步骤。
    我们应当帮助德国人立刻建立适当的全德当局。办这件事的最好办法是：由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国议会在各民主组织广泛参加之下组成一个临时的全德政府。这样的一个临时的全德政府可以由东德和西德之间取得协议而成立，可以代替目前在柏林和波恩的两个政府。如果在目前这样做还有困难的话，可以把这两个政府保存相当时期。毫无疑问，德国人自己能够按照德国人民的利益，按照他们的自由和巩固德国民族独立的利益而准备和举行全德自由选举，而且做得一定只会比占领当局好，而不会坏。
    我们四国政府应当给予东德和西德一切必要的合作，以促进这样一个全德中心的建立。
    如果我们拒绝在建立临时的全德政府方面给予帮助，我们只会使德国统一的重新建立遭到更多的困难和拖延。但是，如果我们认识到有必要建立一个临时的全德政府，我们将不仅能帮助德国人民运用他们的合法权利以建立一个统一、民主与和平的德国。我们还将因此而有可能解决许多很实际的问题。这样我们在今天就能解除德国人民生活上的困难，保证他们的权利以及东德和西德之间经济、贸易和文化关系的发展。
    为了保证德国人民自己解决他们自己的民族问题的权利，我们应当建议德意志民主共和国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府立刻召开东德和西德的全权代表的会议。这样的会议可以就建立全德临时政府的程序、它的组成、职责、任务和权利达成协议。
    这一切将使在最近的将来在自由条件下举行全德选举成为可能。那样，德国将可以有机会召开在自由选举中选出来的全德议会。这个全德议会将不仅组成临时政府，并且组成享有充分权利并以民主宪法为基础的政府。
    苏联政府从这样的前提出发：这一切措施都应当由我们四国之间的协议来贯彻。
    我们必须特别注意避免我们四国的利益在这件事情上互相发生冲突。
    自然，全德选举必须在允许所有民主团体自由活动的条件下进行。这当然不是说，我们不应当采取措施来制止法西斯和军国主义组织的活动。同样，也必须不让大垄断资本家有可能对筹备和进行选举的工作施加压力。
    让我们谈谈保证一个统一的德国的和平与民主的发展的外部条件吧。这关系到必须保证德国的民族独立。
    在这方面，我们又必须谈到“欧洲防务集团”条约，那就是西德当局所签订的巴黎条约和波恩条约。我们不能忽视，规定西德参加“欧洲军”的巴黎条约是和一个统一的德国的民族独立的利益不相容的。也是与欧洲安全的利益不相容的，因为它将导致德国军国主义的复活。
    要为建立一个自由的、和平的作为独立国家的德国提供外部的必要条件，就必须放弃把“欧洲防务集团”条约和要西德参加西欧军的条约强加在西德头上的政策。如果让这个规定西德参加西欧国家军事集团为期五十年的条约保存下来，这就是说，有人企图把这个条约也扩大到统一的德国身上来。因此，有人不仅打算用“欧洲防务集团”来束缚西德，而且还要束缚东德，这自然是不可能的。
    根据巴黎条约，西德只有在继续忠于关于参加西欧军的义务的情况下，才能和东德统一。也就是说，只有当东德和西德一起被拖进“欧洲防务集团”时，德国的统一才有可能。然而，这是德意志民主共和国所坚决反对的。所以，关于“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎条约，实际上是反对德国统一的。由此可见，它也是反对缔结对德和约的。
    从上述情况中只能得出一个结论：为了实现统一德国的计划，并使缔结对德和约成为可能，决不应当强迫西德参加西欧国家的军事集团，尤其是因为这不仅是不符合德国人民的利益，而且违反欧洲持久和平与安全的利益。
    皮杜尔先生今天发言时，对苏联代表团在谈到欧洲防务集团对欧洲国际关系所起的不良影响时所作的批评，表示不满，而苏联代表团认为这种批评是起码的。不难指出，皮杜尔先生的论点是完全软弱无力的。要为一个导致在欧洲准备另一次战争而不是导致巩固和平的计划来辩护，是不可能的。
    让我们来总结一下吧。
    艾登先生所提出的并得到美国和法国支持的英国建议，是不能接受的。其原因如下：
    这个建议意味着企图使举行全德选举的工作受占领当局的控制，并实际上将德国人排斥于组织和举行全德选举的工作之外。这样做是得不到什么好结果的。
    三国建议并未保证选举的真正自由，并未规定防止外国对选举施加政治压力。这个建议的出发点是：一面举行选举，一方面保持占领军在德国境内的现状。这是错误的。
    三国建议不但没有保证选举以后的全德政府的行动自由，相反地，预先就限制这个政府的权利，规定在全德选举后德国应该受巴黎和波恩条约的束缚。而巴黎和波恩条约对于德国人民是具有奴役性质的，并使德国承担参加西欧军和侵略性的北大西洋军事集团的义务。
    三国关于举行全德选举的程序问题的建议，将造成一种局面。在这种局面下，德国侵略集团可能利用这种选举来破坏欧洲和平的利益：利用选举来支持那些主张复活德国军国主义的人并使他们当权。这一点必须特别记住，因为在德国历史上已经发生过这种全德选举，特别是一九三二年那次选举，使德国军国主义分子和法西斯分子掌握了政权，成立了希特勒政府。
    因此，目前这种形式的关于全德选举的三国建议不但不能保证德国在和平与民主的基础上进一步发展，相反地，却为德国那些目前已经毫不掩饰他们对欧洲的侵略和复仇阴谋的人开辟了掌握政权的道路。这对于维护欧洲和平的事业，首先对于德国邻国的安全，是一个直接的威胁。
    在反对纳粹德国的战争中受害最大的苏联不能忽视这一点：过去对和平国家发动战争的那种势力在德国一旦掌握了政权，就意味着德国军国主义一个新的军事冒险的威胁。
    苏联政府正在提出关于统一德国和全德自由选举问题的建议。
    这些建议的主要特点就是要促进在民主与和平的基础上建立一个统一的德国。四国的共同努力必须服从这种目的。只有依靠德国的民主力量，我们才能达到这种目的。
      为了保证真正的全德自由选举，筹备和举行选举的工作必须掌握在德国人自己手中，而不是掌握在占领当局的手中。为了做到这一点，我们必须促进东德和西德之间的和解，并帮助他们解决成立一个临时的全德政府的问题，使这个政府得到东、西德所有民主力量的支持。
    为了避免占领当局对选举施加压力，必须还在选举以前，就从东德和西德境内撤退外国占领军。在这个情况下，在德国境内只留下为执行四国管制任务范围内的安全职权所必需的数量有限的军队：苏联负责东德；美、英、法负责西德。
    苏联代表团现在将“关于成立临时的全德政府和举行全德自由选举”的建议提交你们考虑。采纳这些建议，就可以为在民主与和平的基础上统一德国的问题打下一个稳固的基础。
    除掉以上种种之外，艾登的计划还有一个基本的缺点。他的计划会在他所建议的统一德国的“五个阶段”上引起漫无止境的争论。而一切与德国问题有关的迫切问题实际上被无限期的长期拖延下去。只要举出这样一点就足够了：例如，艾登计划中说，“和约谈判的筹备工作”要到所谓第三阶段才能开始，也就是说，甚至和约谈判的筹备工作很长时间中也还不能开始进行。
    与艾登的计划相反，苏联的建议是简单明了的。
    如果我们承认现在有必要成立一个临时的全德政府，那么今天就已在统一德国方面真正跨进了一步。这样一步或许不是完全的。因此也只能是暂时的。
    临时的全德政府的成立，将意味着东德和西德的民主势力今天就可以开始为了德国的真正统一而工作。德国人应当将筹备和举行全德选举的工作掌握在自己手中。
    我们四国政府应当信任和支持他们。
