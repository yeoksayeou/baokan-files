    Cooperative Societies in Various Parts of Xikang Province Will Expand the Supply of Production Materials
    The supply and marketing cooperative system in Xikang Province is actively preparing to expand the supply of production materials to meet the needs of farmers for developing production.
    Farmers in Ya'an, Tianquan, Lushan, Baoxing and other counties are accustomed to planting winter potatoes. In order to protect winter potatoes from being ruined by wild animals, the cooperative societies prepared early to supply shotguns, gunpowder, and cannons for animal protection. Farmers in various places have also put forward the production materials they need for spring plowing and even autumn harvest this year. Farmers in the Second District of Baoxing requested the supply and marketing cooperative in their district to supply them with cattle for better planting this year. Many mutual aid teams in Luding County are already asking the supply and marketing cooperative to prepare "corn threshers" for them to use during the autumn harvest. In addition, the amount of fertilizer farmers are preparing this year is also more than in previous years, and the time has also been moved forward. In December of last year, cadres of the Ya'an County United Cooperative, in coordination with the purchase of surplus grain, investigated the farmers' needs for production materials in Mujia Village, Daxing Township, First District. The village only bought more than 2,000 dan of manure in 1951. However, in late December of 1953, the seventh residential group of the village alone had already bought more than 6,000 dan of manure. The Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Yingjing County had more than 10,000 jin of oil cake stockpiled in 1952 and 1953, but it was soon completely sold out.
    At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are actively organizing cadres to study the general line of the state during the transition period, combining this with a review of last year's supply of production materials, and focusing on criticizing the erroneous business ideology of emphasizing general merchandise over production materials in supply. The preparatory committee of the provincial united cooperative convened a meeting of the directors of the united cooperatives of Ya'an Special District and Luding County and other counties to make arrangements for the supply of production materials. Recently, a business meeting of supply and marketing cooperatives across the province was also held to further review the preparations of cooperatives in various counties for the supply of production materials. After this business meeting, internal material exchanges will be organized to adjust and replenish the supply of production materials this year.
    In order to make the supplied production materials better suit the needs of farmers, some supply and marketing cooperatives have strengthened contact with relevant units. When planning the supply of cattle, pigs, and sheep, the Luding County United Cooperative conducted research with the Luding branch of the People's Bank. In the future, when the People's Bank issues these loans, the supply and marketing cooperative can sell the livestock to the farmers who have obtained livestock loans. The Shimian and Baoxing County United Cooperatives recently also invited agricultural technicians to inspect the pesticides and machinery they are preparing to supply, and solicited opinions, adding supply items.

### 西康省各地合作社将扩大供应生产资料

    西康省各地合作社将扩大供应生产资料
    西康省供销合作社系统正在积极准备扩大生产资料的供应，以适应农民发展生产的要求。
    雅安、天全、芦山、宝兴等县的农民习惯播种冬洋芋，为了保护冬洋芋不被野兽糟踏，合作社及早准备了供应防兽用的火枪、火药和火炮。各地农民还纷纷提出今年春耕、甚至秋收时需要的生产资料。宝兴二区的农民们为了今年把庄稼种得更好，要求该区供销合作社供应他们耕牛。泸定县有很多互助组，现在就已经在叫供销合作社给他们备办秋收用的“玉米脱粒机”了。此外，今年农民们准备的肥料也比往年数量增多、时间也提早了。去年十二月份，雅安县联社的干部，配合收购余粮，在一区大兴乡穆家村调查农民对生产资料的需要量，该村一九五一年才买了二千多担大粪。但是在一九五三年的十二月下旬，单是该村的第七居民组就已经买了六千多担大粪。荥经县二区供销合作社在一九五二年和一九五三年积压了一万多斤油饼，不多久就完全卖光了。
    目前，各地供销合作社正在积极组织干部学习国家在过渡时期总路线，结合检查去年生产资料供应情况，着重批判了供应上重百货轻生产资料的错误的经营思想。省联社筹委会召开雅安专区及泸定县等县联社主任会议，对生产资料供应工作作了布置。最近又召开了全省供销合作社的业务会议，更进一步地检查各县合作社对生产资料的供应准备。这次业务会议以后，将组织内部物资交流，调剂、充实今年生产资料的供应。
    为了使供应的生产资料能更好的适合农民需要，有的供销合作社已加强了与有关单位的联系。泸定县联社在计划供应耕牛、猪、羊时，就和人民银行泸定支行进行了研究，以后人民银行在发放这些贷款时，供销合作社就可以把牲畜卖给贷到牲畜款的农民。石棉、宝兴县联社最近也请农业技术干部来检查了他们准备供应的杀虫药械，并征求意见，增加了供应项目。
