Northwest China's major state-owned coal mines—the Tongchuan Coal Mine in Shaanxi and the Aganzhen Coal Mine in Gansu—will vigorously carry out capital construction this year. The Tongchuan Coal Mine will build and renovate one pair of vertical shafts each, and the Aganzhen Coal Mine will renovate two pairs of inclined shafts. After these capital construction projects are completed, the annual output of the two coal mines can be increased by about three times. The coal produced can not only fully meet the needs of power, textile, and flour industries in Xi'an, Xianyang, and Lanzhou, but also partially supply the needs of railway transportation. The current situation of the two mines, where equipment is simple and output is far from meeting the needs of Northwest industrial development, will be gradually changed.

    The pair of vertical shafts to be newly built at the Tongchuan Coal Mine this year will be the largest modern mines in the Northwest region. The mining of coal underground and the transportation above ground in this mine will be fully mechanized, and coal cutting machines, electric drills, and electric transportation equipment will be used in the mine. The other pair of vertical shafts to be renovated at the Tongchuan Coal Mine will also be partially mechanized. After the renovation of this mine is completed, the annual output can be increased by more than one time. The two pairs of inclined shafts to be renovated at the Aganzhen Coal Mine are planned to extend the underground main roadways and improve the ventilation equipment and coal mining methods to increase output. The construction projects of the above two coal mines have undergone a year of geological prospecting work in advance to determine the coal reserves. At present, the Northwest Coal Mine Administration Bureau is actively carrying out design and construction preparation work for the construction of the two mines.

    西北铜川和阿干镇煤矿
    将大力进行基本建设
    西北区主要的国营煤矿——陕西铜川煤矿和甘肃阿干镇煤矿，今年将大力进行基本建设。铜川煤矿将新建和改建各一对竖井，阿干镇煤矿将改建两对斜井。这些基本建设工程完成以后，两个煤矿的年产量约可增加三倍。所产的煤不但可以充分供应西安、咸阳、兰州一带电力、纺织、面粉等工业需要，并且可以部分供应铁路交通的需要。目前两矿设备简陋、产量远远赶不上西北工业发展需要的情况，将可以逐步得到改变。
    铜川煤矿今年准备新建的一对竖井，将是目前西北区规模最大的现代化矿井。这个矿井从井下采煤到地面运输将全部是机械化的，矿井内将使用割煤机、电钻和电动运输设备。铜川煤矿改建的另一对竖井，也将做到部分机械化。这个矿井改建完成，年产量可提高一倍多。阿干镇煤矿改建的两对斜井，准备延伸井下的大巷道，并改进通风设备和采煤方法，使产量增加。上述两个煤矿的建设工程，事先曾进行过一年的地质钻探工作，确定了煤的储量。现在西北煤矿管理局正在为两矿建设积极进行设计和施工准备工作。
