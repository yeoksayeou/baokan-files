The Hungarian national mixed football team played its final exhibition match in Beijing on February 19th, defeating China's "August 1st" football team with a score of 2-0.

This was a very attractive and exciting friendly match. The audience was more tense and enthusiastic than in previous matches. There were more spectators than before; the stands and the area around the field outside the railings were packed.

The "August 1st" football team was the champion of the 1953 national football competition. The team's characteristics are good physical strength, strong sprinting ability, and a brave and tenacious attacking spirit.

After the start of the match, the "August 1st" team posed a great threat to the Hungarian team with its rapid attacks. In the first minute, the "August 1st" team took a shot at the goal. In the tenth minute, Jiang Jiexiang, the center forward of the "August 1st" team, took a long shot, and the Hungarian goalkeeper Durai rushed out to catch the ball, but the ball slipped out of his hands. At this time, the Hungarian goal was unguarded. The left inside forward of the "August 1st" team was too hasty and shot the ball out of bounds, losing a good chance to score. After that, the "August 1st" team took several shots, but none were successful. Then, the Hungarian team launched an attack from the left wing, which was intercepted several times by the "August 1st" team's defense. In the fifteenth minute, the Hungarian center forward Szocza received the ball on the left side of the eighteen-yard box and took a powerful shot, the ball penetrated from the upper right corner, opening the scoring. After losing this goal, the "August 1st" team tried hard to launch a counterattack and repeatedly passed the ball over the Hungarian team's central defensive zone, but they lost the opportunity to attack many times due to offsides. The Hungarian team continued to attack from both wings. The "August 1st" team's defense was tight, and right-back Chen Fulai repeatedly intercepted the Hungarian team's left-wing dribbling. In the thirty-third minute, the Hungarian team, with center forward Szocza in the middle, used a wonderful triangular passing from the center line to break through the "August 1st" team's central defensive line. Left inside forward Pacztol shot quickly with his foot at fifteen yards in front of the "August 1st" team's goal, scoring another goal. The score was now 2-0. Although the "August 1st" team tried hard to counterattack, because the forwards' connection was not close enough, the ball was often intercepted by the Hungarian team after crossing the midfield line. Two minutes before the end of the first half, the "August 1st" team's forward attacked to within a few yards of the Hungarian team's goal, but because the "August 1st" team's forward accidentally touched the ball with his hand in the fierce competition, the goal was invalid even though the ball entered the net. The first half ended with a score of 2-0.

In the second half, both teams fought hard to gain the offensive initiative, and the game was very tense. The "August 1st" team had several good shooting opportunities, but they did not score. Several long shots by Hungarian center forward Szocza and right inside forward Kis were also caught by "August 1st" team goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen. The "August 1st" team's defense used tight man-to-man marking tactics and courageous interceptions, preventing the Hungarian team's repeated wing attacks from succeeding. Two minutes before the end of the match, Hungarian left inside forward Várnai had a wonderful aerial shot from fifteen yards in front of the goal, which was caught by the "August 1st" team's goalkeeper. There were no goals in the second half. The final score of the match was 2-0. Thus, the Hungarian team concluded their exhibition in Beijing with an outstanding record of four wins in four games, scoring eleven goals and conceding one goal. The players of both teams left the field amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience.

In this match, the Hungarian team still used precise short passes and attacks from both wings. In the second half, because the "August 1st" team defended tightly and wing attacks were more difficult, they also used long passes with high balls, and they were also very accurate when passing high balls.

The "August 1st" team's defense was better. However, the forwards' cooperation was not close enough, there were too many offsides, and the players were too nervous, which affected the attack. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Also, the Hungarian national mixed football team concluded its exhibition matches in Beijing and left for Shanghai by train on the evening of the 20th to visit and play exhibition matches. The Central Sports Institute football team and the "August 1st" football team also went along to study.

Rong Gaotang, Secretary-General of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and others were at the station to see them off.

The Hungarian Ambassador to China, Szobek, was also at the station to see them off.

    匈牙利足球队在京和“八一”队举行友谊赛
    二月十九日，匈牙利国家足球混合队在北京作了最后一场表演赛，以二比零胜我国“八一”足球队。
    这是一场很有吸引力的、精采的友谊比赛。观众们的情绪比以前各次都要紧张热烈。参观的人比以前各次还要多，看台上、场外四周的栏杆外，都挤的满满的。
    “八一”足球队是一九五三年全国足球比赛的冠军。队员们的特点是体力好，冲刺力强，具有勇敢顽强的进攻精神。
    比赛开始后，“八一”队以迅速的进攻给匈牙利队以很大的威胁。第一分钟时，“八一”队就射了一次门。第十分钟时，“八一”队中锋姜杰祥远射一高球，匈牙利队守门员杜拉伊冲出扑球，球从手中滑出，此时匈牙利队门守空虚，“八一”队左内锋操之过急，将球射出界外，失去一次很好的胜球机会。此后，“八一”队多次射门，都没有成功。接着，匈牙利队从左翼发起进攻，被“八一”队后卫数次截出。第十五分钟时，匈牙利队中锋苏查在左侧十八码处获球猛射，球从右上角穿入，首开记录。“八一”队在失去这一球后，努力展开反攻，曾多次将球传过匈牙利队中卫区，但多次都因越位而失去攻门机会。匈牙利队继续从两翼进攻，“八一”队后卫防守严密，右后卫陈复赉多次截住匈牙利队左翼的带球。到三十三分钟时，匈牙利队以中锋苏查居中，从中线以美妙的三角传递，突破“八一”队中卫防线，左内锋帕奇托尔在“八一”队门前正中十五码处，举足疾射，再获一球。这时记录为二比零。“八一”队虽努力反攻，但因前锋联系不够紧密，球过中线后常被匈牙利队截走。在上半时终场前两分钟，“八一”队前锋攻入匈牙利队球门前数码处，但因在激烈争夺中，“八一”队前锋不慎用手触球，球虽入网也归无效。上半时即以二比零结束。
    下半时，两队都力争攻势，踢来十分紧张。“八一”队曾获几次良好射门机会，都没有攻进。匈牙利队中锋苏查和右内锋基什数次远射也被“八一”队守门员黄肇文接出。“八一”队后卫运用紧逼人盯人战术和勇猛的截球，使匈牙利队多次的两翼切入都没有成功。在终场前两分钟，匈牙利队左内锋瓦尔纳伊在门前十五码处，曾有一次美妙的悬空斜射，被“八一”队守门员接住。下半时各无所获。全场比赛结果二比零。至此，匈牙利队以四战四胜、获十一球失一球的出色成绩，结束了他们在北京的表演。两队队员在观众们热烈掌声中离场。
    在这一场比赛中，匈牙利队仍运用精确短传，从两翼发动进攻的战术。下半时，因“八一”队防守严密，两翼切入较困难，所以也曾运用高球远传，他们在传高球时也很准确。
    “八一”队后卫防守得较好。但前锋合作还不够紧密，越位较多，队员情绪也过于紧张，因此影响了进攻。　（据新华社讯）
    又讯：匈牙利国家足球混合队结束了在北京的表演赛，在二十日晚乘火车赴上海访问和作表演比赛。中央体育学院足球队和“八一”足球队也随同前往学习。
    到车站欢送的有中央人民政府体育运动委员会秘书长荣高棠等。
    匈牙利驻我国大使苏贝克也到车站欢送。
