    Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference
    --Soviet "Pravda" Editorial, February 20

    The Berlin Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which concluded on the 18th, has been the focus of world attention for nearly four weeks. Broad segments of society have attached great importance to this conference, hoping that the meeting of the four foreign ministers at the negotiating table will help resolve the most important international issues, thereby contributing to the cause of consolidating peace and international cooperation.

    The exchange of views in Berlin has helped to more correctly understand the positions of the participating countries. In the process of exchanging views, the differences in the positions of the governments were clearly demonstrated. At the same time, because the parties concerned have genuinely shown a willingness to reduce these differences, the ways to reduce the differences have become clearer. Undoubtedly, some of the specific agreements reached at the meeting are meaningful. First, it has been decided that the governments of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union will take measures to facilitate the solution of the disarmament issue, or at least the issue of substantial reductions in armaments. Second, there was unanimous agreement to convene a conference in Geneva with representatives from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and countries directly related to the relevant issues. The purpose of convening this conference is to finally resolve the Korean issue and to discuss the restoration of peace in Indochina. Finally, the four foreign ministers comprehensively exchanged views on the German issue, the European security issue, and the Austrian issue. The four foreign ministers were unable to reach an agreement on these issues; however, these issues have certainly not been removed from the agenda.

    Of course, if the delegations of the Western countries, especially the United States delegation, had expressed a willingness to resolve pressing international issues on the basis of agreements acceptable to all relevant parties (rather than unilaterally), the Berlin Conference would have had an immeasurably greater and more significant effect. However, as everyone knows, the US delegation that went to Berlin received completely opposite instructions. This situation could not but have a negative impact on the progress of the Berlin Conference. As everyone knows, the notorious "policy of strength" has no chance of success when used against equal and independent countries.

    The Soviet delegation attending the Berlin Conference was motivated by a desire to reach agreements that would not harm the interests of anyone, that would be acceptable to the participants, that would be in line with the vital interests of all nations (regardless of size), and that would guarantee peace and the security of all peoples.

    In the course of the Berlin Conference, the Soviet delegation put forward a series of proposals that became a broad and concrete plan of action for seeking to ease international tensions and resolve outstanding issues.

    The Soviet government has proposed convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China to discuss some outstanding international issues. Such a meeting would undoubtedly help to ease international tensions and help to eliminate some of the difficulties that now exist in the Korean issue or other pressing international issues. This proposal is to correct the abnormal situation in which some countries, ignoring the changes that have taken place in Asia, as manifested by the establishment of the People's Republic of China, still intend to do whatever they want in this region as in the nineteenth century.

    The Soviet proposal to convene a meeting of the five major powers has received such a wide response around the world that the Western countries have also found it impossible to completely reject it. After lengthy discussions, an agreement was finally reached to convene a conference in Geneva with the participation of the People's Republic of China. The Italian newspaper "Il Tempo" pointed out the significance of this decision, saying: "This decision is very important; this alone is enough to show that the Berlin Conference was not in vain." The newspaper went on to emphasize that "without Asia's participation, order and peace cannot be established in the world," and that "Asia cannot participate in this matter without China."

    The Soviet Union also proposed to convene a world conference on universal disarmament in 1954, linking the disarmament plan with the simultaneous resolution of the atomic weapons issue.

    The Soviet proposal is to extricate the United Nations from the impasse on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons; the United Nations has been trapped in this impasse because American diplomacy has confused and complicated the above issues for several years. The successful holding of such a conference would undoubtedly help to ease international tensions and greatly reduce the burden of military spending on the working people of capitalist countries.

    This proposal has also received widespread support from the people of all countries, and as a result, as mentioned above, the representatives of the Western countries finally had to agree to continue exchanging views in order to facilitate the solution of the disarmament issue, or at least the issue of substantial reductions in armaments.

    The peaceful nature of Soviet foreign policy was once again very clearly reflected in the Soviet government's proposals on the German issue. These proposals are permeated with a central idea: in order to guarantee peace and European security, the revival of German militarism, which has twice dragged Europe and then the entire world into war in twenty-five years, must never be allowed.

    The Soviet delegation emphasized that resolving the German issue is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves. Therefore, it suggested that the opinions of representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany should be heard at the meeting in order to understand what the German people themselves think about the urgent issues of unifying Germany and Germany's participation in guaranteeing peace and European security. The Soviet delegation then put forward suggestions for preparing a peace treaty with Germany and convening a peace conference on the peace treaty with Germany, and also put forward a concrete draft treaty for everyone to discuss.

    The Soviet delegation proposed the establishment of a temporary all-German government, which should draft an all-German electoral law that can guarantee truly democratic all-German elections, and conduct elections under truly free conditions so that voters are not subjected to the pressure of large monopoly capitalists, fascist organizations, militarist organizations, and other organizations.

    In order to help the all-German government complete its tasks and to protect it from foreign pressure during elections, the Soviet government also proposed that foreign troops withdraw from East and West Germany before the elections, leaving only a limited number of troops.

    When it became clear that the foreign ministers of the three countries did not want to resolve the German issue on a broad basis as the conference was nearing its end, the Soviet delegation proposed the establishment of an all-German committee whose task was to adjust and coordinate trade, financial accounting, transportation, borders, and other aspects of economic relations between West and East Germany. In addition, an all-German committee was established to be responsible for developing cultural, scientific, and sports ties between West and East Germany. The Soviet Union also suggested passing a resolution expressing the willingness of all parties to reach an agreement on the police issues of East and West Germany, including the number of police and various weapons.

    In order to improve the living standards of the German people, the Soviet delegation raised the important issue of alleviating Germany's financial and economic burden due to the consequences of the war. The Soviet delegation suggested that measures to alleviate this burden should also be taken for West Germany, as was done for the German Democratic Republic.

    When discussing the German issue, the Soviet delegation also pointed out that it is possible and appropriate for the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union to establish economic and cultural ties.

    The representatives of the Western countries rejected all Soviet proposals on the German issue. This shows that they do not want a genuinely peaceful resolution of the German issue and are unwilling to allow the German people themselves to resolve the urgent task of unifying Germany. As for the Soviet delegation, it said on February 18 that the Soviet government hopes that the four countries will continue their efforts to strive for a satisfactory resolution of the German issue in accordance with the interests of consolidating European peace.

    The plan for guaranteeing collective security in Europe proposed by the Soviet Union has left a deep impression on the people of all countries in the world, especially the people of European countries. In the process of discussing this plan, the true face of the American aggressive bloc's plan to establish a military group of six Western European countries headed by West Germany was clearly and accurately revealed. This group is disguised as the "European Defense Community," but is actually a serious threat to peace.

    In response to this plan, the Soviet Union put forward suggestions for guaranteeing European security, which stipulated a neutral Germany. The Soviet Union also put forward a draft of the Pan-European Treaty for guaranteeing collective security in Europe. Germany can participate in this treaty on an equal footing, now by East and West Germany, and after reunification, by a unified Germany. Non-European countries can also contribute to the realization of the European collective security system. A single camp including all countries must be established to fight for peace, regardless of the social system of these countries.

    The plan for guaranteeing collective security proposed by the Soviet Union has been understood and supported by Europe, especially Germany.

    However, the representatives of the Western countries rejected the plan for guaranteeing collective security proposed by the Soviet Union.

    If the Western countries' representatives had not stubbornly tied the Austrian issue to some conspiracies that had nothing in common with the interests of peace and security or with the national interests of the Austrian people, then the issue of the Austrian peace treaty, which was included on the agenda of the Berlin Conference, could have been completely resolved within a few days.

    The above-mentioned German plan of the Western countries, which deepens the danger of the revival of German militarism, hindered the resolution of the Austrian issue. However, the Soviet Foreign Minister has repeatedly stated that the Soviet government is convinced that the possibility of resolving this issue in the near future still exists. The Austrian government must take this into account, and the Austrian people must correctly understand this.

    The foreign ministers of the three Western countries could not put forward any counter-proposals to the clear and concrete plan for resolving outstanding international issues. They only put forward a notorious "Eden Plan." This plan is essentially a poorly disguised plan to extend the current Bonn regime to the whole of Germany and to drag a unified Germany into the military group of six Western European countries.

    Since the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom could not put forward their own plans for resolving international disputes, they adopted a completely negative attitude at the meeting, rejecting all Soviet proposals. This behavior of the Western delegations is naturally a cause for condemnation by the broadest sections of the people and the press in Europe.

    There is no doubt that the role played by the Berlin Conference in easing international tensions and resolving outstanding issues could have been greater than it is now. The American aggressive bloc, keen on maintaining and deepening international tensions, is using its influence to obstruct the passage of decisions that could contribute to the early resolution of the above issues (especially the German issue).

    However, as Molotov emphasized in his speech on February 18, the holding of the Berlin Conference and the resumption of direct contact between the foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union "has positive significance under the current circumstances. This conference studied a number of pressing international issues, and the resolution of these issues is necessary for further easing international tensions." Molotov went on to say: "The issues that were not resolved at this conference have not been removed from the agenda. We must continue our efforts and more firmly strive for the resolution of these issues."

    The Soviet people unanimously support the position of the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Conference and will continue to resolutely and vigorously support the struggle of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government to further ease international tensions and resolve pressing international issues.

    柏林四国外长会议
    ——苏联“真理报”二月二十日社论
    十八日结束的苏、法、英、美四国外长柏林会议，在将近四周的时间中一直是全世界注意的中心。广大社会人士都非常重视这次会议，希望四国外长在会议桌上会晤能有助于解决最重大的国际问题，从而对巩固和平与国际合作的事业有所贡献。
    在柏林互相交换意见，有助于更正确地了解与会各国的立场。在交换意见过程中，明显地表现出各国政府在立场上的分歧。同时，由于有关各方都真正表现出减少这种分歧的愿望，减少分歧的途径已经愈加清楚了。无疑，在会上所达成的一些具体的协议是有意义的。第一，已经决定美国、法国、英国和苏联政府要采取措施，以便顺利解决裁军问题，或者至少解决大量缩减军备的问题。第二，一致同意在日内瓦召开有美国、法国、英国、苏联、中华人民共和国以及与相应的问题直接有关的各国代表参加的会议。召开这个会议的目的是：最后解决朝鲜问题以及讨论在印度支那恢复和平的问题。最后，四国外长就德国问题、欧洲安全问题以及奥地利问题全面地交换了意见。四国外长没有能够在这些问题上达成协议；但是，这些问题当然并没有从议事日程上抹掉。
    当然，如果西方国家的代表团，首先是美国代表团，表示愿意在各有关方面（而不是单方面）都可以接受的协议的基础上解决迫切的国际问题，那末，柏林会议就会收到无可衡量的更加重大的效果。可是，大家知道，到柏林去的美国代表团却接到了完全相反的指示。这种情况不能不对柏林会议的进程发生消极的作用。大家都知道，臭名远扬的
  “实力政策”如果用来对付平等、独立的国家，那是没有一点点成功的机会的。
    出席柏林会议的苏联代表团是怀着取得协议的愿望的，这些协议要不损害任何人的利益，要能为会议参加者所接受，要符合一切民族（不分大小）的切身利益，并且要能够保障和平与各国人民的安全。
  在柏林会议进程中，苏联代表团提出了一系列的建议，这些建议成为谋求缓和国际紧张局势和解决悬而未决的问题的广泛而具体的行动计划。
    苏联政府曾建议召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议，以讨论一些悬而未决的国际问题。这样一个会议无疑会有助于缓和国际紧张局势，有助于消除现在存在于朝鲜问题或是其他迫切的国际问题中的一些困难。这个建议是要矫正这样一种不正常的局面：某些国家无视在亚洲发生的，已经以中华人民共和国的成立而表现出来的变化，仍然打算像在十九世纪那样，在这个地区为所欲为。
    苏联关于召开五大国会议的建议，在全世界获得了如此广泛的反应，以致西方国家也认为不可能完全加以拒绝。经过长久讨论后，终于达成协议，要在日内瓦召开有中华人民共和国参加的会议。意大利的“邮报”指出这个决定的意义说：“这个决定是非常重要的；光是这一点就足以说明柏林会议不是白开的。”这个报纸接着强调：“没有亚洲参加，就不能在世界上建立秩序与和平”，而“亚洲没有中国，就不能参与此事”。
    苏联还建议在一九五四年召开世界普遍裁减军备会议，把裁减军备计划和同时解决原子武器的问题联系起来。
    苏联这个建议是要解脱联合国在裁军问题和禁止原子武器问题上陷入的绝境；联合国是因为美国外交数年来把上述问题搞乱，并且使之变得复杂，而在这个问题上陷入绝境的。顺利地举行这样一个会议，无疑会有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，并且会大大减轻资本主义国家劳动人民的军费重担。
  这个建议也同样获得了所有国家的人民的广泛支持，结果，像上面所说的，西方国家的代表也就终于不得不同意继续交换意见，以便顺利解决裁军问题，或者至少解决大量缩减军备的问题。
    苏联外交政策的和平性质又一次非常明确地表现在苏联政府对德国问题的建议上。这些建议贯穿着一个主旨：要保障和平与欧洲安全，就绝不能让德国军国主义复活，德国军国主义在二十五年内曾经两次把欧洲，然后把整个世界，拖入战争。
    苏联代表团强调解决德国问题首先是德国人自己的事情，因此建议在会上应听取德意志民主共和国代表和联邦共和国代表的意见，以便了解德国人民自己对统一德国和德国参加保障和平及欧洲安全的迫切的问题有什么想法。苏联代表团接着提出了准备对德和约及召开关于对德和约的和平会议的建议，同时还提出了具体的和约草案供大家讨论。
    苏联代表团建议成立临时的全德政府，这个政府要拟订能保证举行真正民主的全德选举的全德选举法草案，并且要在真正自由的条件下进行选举，使选民不致于受到大垄断资本家、法西斯组织、军国主义组织及其他组织的压力。
    为了帮助全德政府完成自己的任务，并且使它在选举时免受外国压力，苏联政府还建议外国军队在选举前从东德和西德撤退，只留下数额有限的部队。
    到会议快要结束时，三国外长不想在广泛的基础上解决德国问题这一点已经很清楚，这时，苏联代表团就建议成立一个全德委员会，它的任务是调整和调配西德和东德之间的贸易、财务结账、运输、边界及经济关系方面的其他问题，另外还成立一个全德委员会负责发展西德和东德之间的文化、科学、体育联系。苏联还建议通过决定，表示各方愿就东德和西德的警察问题，包括警察人数和各种武器在内，达成协议。
    为了提高德国人民的生活水平，苏联代表团提出了关于减轻德国由于战争后果而承担的财政经济负担的重要问题。苏联代表团建议，像对德意志民主共和国一样，对西德也采取减轻这种负担的措施。
    在讨论德国问题时，苏联代表团同时指出：联邦共和国和苏联建立经济和文化的联系是可能而且是适宜的。
    西方国家的代表拒绝了苏联关于德国问题的一切建议。这就表明：他们不想真正和平解决德国问题，不愿意由德国人民自己解决统一德国的迫切任务。至于苏联代表团，它在二月十八日曾经说过：苏联政府希望四国继续努力，争取按照巩固欧洲和平的利益来圆满解决德国问题。
    苏联提出的保障欧洲集体安全的计划，使世界各国人民，首先使欧洲各国人民，印象甚深。在这个计划的讨论过程中，美国侵略集团要建立以西德为首的六个西欧国家的军事集团的计划的真面貌，被清楚而准确地揭露了，这个集团伪装为“欧洲防务集团”，而实际上却是对和平的严重威胁。
    苏联针对这个计划提出了保障欧洲安全的建议，这些建议规定要中立德国。苏联还提出了保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案。德国可以平等地位参加这个条约，现在由东德和西德来参加，而在重新统一以后，就由统一的德国参加。非欧洲国家也可以有助于欧洲集体安全体系的实现。必须建立起一个包括一切国家的单一的阵营，为和平而斗争，不论这些国家的社会制度如何。
    苏联提出的保障集体安全的计划得到了欧洲特别是德国的谅解和支持。
    但是，西方国家的代表拒绝了苏联提出的保障集体安全的计划。
    如果西方国家代表不把奥地利问题和某些与和平及安全的利益、与奥地利人民的民族利益毫无共同之处的阴谋硬拉扯在一起，那末，列入柏林会议议程的对奥和约问题是能够在几天之内完全解决的。
    西方国家加深德国军国主义复活危险的上述关于德国的计划，阻挠了奥地利问题的解决。然而，苏联外交部部长一再表示：苏联政府坚信在最近解决这个问题的可能性仍然存在。奥地利政府必须考虑到这一点，奥地利人民必须正确地理解这一点。
    西方三国外长不能对解决悬而未决的国际问题的明确和具体的计划提出任何反建议，他们只提出了一个声名狼藉的“艾登计划”。这个计划实质上是个几乎没有什么掩饰的计划，它要使目前的波恩政权扩大到全德国，并且要把统一以后的德国拖进西欧六国军事集团。
    美国、法国和英国的外长既然提不出自己的解决国际纠纷的计划，就在会议上采取完全否定的态度，对苏联的任何建议一概拒绝。西方国家代表团的这种行为自然要引起欧洲最广泛阶层的人民和报纸的谴责。
    毫无疑问，在缓和国际紧张局势和解决悬而未决的问题方面，柏林会议所起的作用本来可以比现在更大。热衷于保持和加深国际紧张局势的美国侵略集团却利用它的影响，来阻挠可以促成上述问题
  （首先是德国问题）早日解决的决定获得通过。
    但是，正如莫洛托夫在二月十八日的发言中强调的，柏林会议的召开以及法国、英国、美国、苏联四国外长直接接触的恢复，“在目前情势之下，具有肯定的意义。这次会议研究了一些迫切的国际问题，而这些问题的解决是为进一步缓和国际紧张局势所必需的。”莫洛托夫接着说：“这次会议没有解决的问题并没有从日程上除掉。我们必须继续努力，更加坚定不移地争取这些问题的解决。”
    苏联人民一致拥护苏联代表团在柏林会议上的立场，今后仍然要坚决有力地支持苏联共产党和苏联政府为进一步缓和国际紧张局势、为解决迫切的国际问题而进行的斗争。
