    After Demobilization
    —A Record of the People Building Anshan
  　By our reporter Lu Hao
    This happened when Anshan began its large-scale construction.
    In front of the Anshan Labor Exchange, crowds of people have been gathering daily, all coming here to participate in the great peaceful construction of the motherland. Among these people, a group particularly attracts attention: the veterans and demobilized soldiers from the People's Armed Forces. Some are still wearing their neat, grass-green army uniforms; others are sporting the blue shirts with wide, white-striped collars of naval warriors. They come from the remote borders of the motherland or the turbulent seas, and they are here to operate cranes or pour concrete.
    The Labor Exchange assigned appropriate work to everyone who requested it, and each person who got a job left satisfied. In order, the conversation for job assignment turned to an army soldier.
    This army soldier's name was Qiu Zhiguo, and he had a plump face as red as a persimmon. Before anyone could ask, he blurted out, "I want to go to the large steel rolling mill construction site." His voice was sincere, almost shy.
    The staff at the Labor Exchange opened his resume, which clearly stated: Comrade Qiu Zhiguo had been injured. They quickly remembered this soldier, because he had said he was not in good health and had refused to be assigned to the residential construction site the day before. One of them replied kindly, "The work at the large steel rolling mill construction site is much heavier than at the residential construction site. You have been injured, so you certainly can't go to the large steel rolling mill construction site."
    "I am going to the large steel rolling mill construction site." He firmly insisted on his opinion. When he spoke, he was slow and mumbled, giving people a sense of simplicity and stubbornness that made it difficult to refuse his request.
    "Then, will you come back and ask for a reassignment?"
    "No." He said decisively, "I came to Anshan because I wanted to go to the large steel rolling mill construction site." He told the people around him that he didn't want to go to other construction sites yesterday because he wanted to work at the large steel rolling mill construction site. He had been thinking about a construction site like the large steel rolling mill for a long time.
    Comrade Qiu Zhiguo became a soldier of the People's Liberation Army in 1948. During the Liberation War, the Kuomintang bandit gangs retreated and destroyed the railways. They fought from Northeast China all the way to Guangxi, and much of the time they relied on walking. In Hubei, he joined the Railway Corps to repair railways, often carrying sand and stones from seven or eight miles away. Without axes or saws, they took kitchen knives and sickles and went to the woods twenty or thirty miles away to cut wood for trestles. Often, the roadbed was repaired and the temporary bridge erected, but because there were no rails, they could only watch the train toot a few miles away. At that time, they really thought about trains and rails day and night. As soon as they heard the train, the comrades would run out to see if the rails had arrived and if the train was closer. Qiu Zhiguo realized at this time that our country could not yet make rails. He saw his comrades marching in the wind and rain, step by step, all relying on their legs. He thought, when the whole country is liberated, our country will be able to make a lot of rails, build railways everywhere, and run trains everywhere. How wonderful that would be.
    Later, in a battle, Qiu Zhiguo was injured in the stomach by a shell that splintered and lodged in his intestines. He was sent to a hospital for treatment. It was difficult to defecate and urinate, and his condition was very serious. The hospital director said to him, "Let's send you to a sanatorium for long-term recuperation." He couldn't agree to that. He said, "It's not that I can't move, I can still do a lot of things." The troops sent him to Beijing for treatment. He had surgery in a Beijing hospital, had a section of his intestine removed, and finally recovered and returned to the front. The leaders of the troops saw that he was very weak and asked him to recuperate. He stayed for a while, but got bored. He repeatedly asked the leaders for work, but they always refused. Finally, they couldn't resist his persistence and let him guard a garden; but he still stubbornly demanded to go to the front. He said, "I can still hold a gun, why should I do light work?"
    Qiu Zhiguo's health improved day by day. Although his illness had been cured, his physique was no longer suitable for working in the armed forces. The organization finally decided to demobilize him, so he returned to his hometown, Liaozhong County, Liaoxi Province.
    In Liaozhong County, Qiu Zhiguo heard that Anshan was going to build a large steel rolling mill that would produce rails. This news reminded him of the painful feeling of looking forward to rails during the war; he thought of the things he had dreamed of in the past were about to come true today, so he looked forward to coming to Anshan and working at the large steel rolling mill construction site. Coincidentally, Anshan was recruiting a large number of workers at that time, and the Liaozhong County People's Government gave him travel expenses to help him get to Anshan.
    Qiu Zhiguo's wish to work at the large steel rolling mill construction site was finally realized. He was assigned to a concrete team of demobilized soldiers from various armed forces to work as a concrete worker. These veteran soldiers, who were brave warriors in the war, became skilled laborers in the great peaceful construction.
    When Qiu Zhiguo started working, he was assigned to lay the "foundation." At first, he didn't understand what reinforcing steel and wooden formwork were, or what honeycombing and pitting meant. Others used iron bars to tamp the concrete, but he was afraid the quality wouldn't be assured, so he put his hand into the mortar and slowly mixed it bit by bit. Although he seemed unfamiliar with everything, he always thought about how he had taken bunkers and carried explosives at the front, and he had always completed his tasks. On the peaceful construction front, he couldn't lose the glory brought by the troops. Some "foundations" were very deep, and he often stayed down there for eight hours at a time, eating his meals squatting down. When he worked, he was like a little tiger.
    In the "foundation," three carts of concrete were once poured in a place where no one was working. Because no one tamped it, the concrete hardened over time. On this day, Qiu Zhiguo happened to be working here on his shift. When he saw this situation, he thought, if he continued to tamp on top of this, it would be like pouring concrete on a honeycomb, how could that work? He immediately went to see the foreman.
    "Can concrete be poured here?" He asked like an experienced concrete worker.
    "Yes, just beat it in." The foreman nodded and answered without hesitation.
    Qiu Zhiguo thought, this guy is so stingy with his brain when it comes to state affairs. Based on his short time in the concrete team, he knew that the foreman's words couldn't be trusted. He said, "If it's okay, give me a note."
    "What note?" The foreman asked, puzzled.
    "If you're responsible, give me a note stating that there's no problem pouring concrete here." Qiu Zhiguo said cautiously, "Just give me a note like that."
    This "pinned down" the foreman. He said awkwardly, "What do you think we should do?"
    "According to me," Qiu Zhiguo said, "those three carts of concrete must be removed."
    "Who will remove them?"
    "No need to ask, I'll do it myself."
    After he finished speaking, he turned around and went down into the "foundation." Half an hour later, the concrete pouring project began on a solid foundation. The three carts of concrete that had not been tamped had all been removed, and the foundation would no longer be in any danger of accidents.
    When the first "foundation" that Qiu Zhiguo and his comrades were building was about to be completed, these people who used to carry guns and now poured concrete were very worried about the quality of the "foundation." They were afraid that their lack of experience would ruin the "foundation." Especially as it got closer to the time to remove the wooden boards, no one could sleep at night in the demobilized soldiers' dormitory.
    One day, it was almost midnight, and Qiu Zhiguo, who was lying on the kang, heard the demobilized soldiers' captain, Ma Hongjin, tossing and turning. He asked, "Old Ma, are you still not asleep?"
    Old Ma said, "I can't sleep, why aren't you asleep either!"
    "Can't sleep, what do you think the quality will be like?"
    "I don't think there's any problem." Ma Hongjin said, "But no one is sure."
    At this time, the dormitory was filled with chatter, as if a discussion was underway. Everyone was worried about the quality, no one was asleep. Hearing Qiu Zhiguo and the captain start talking, everyone simply didn't sleep and started talking to each other.
    "Are you not asleep either?"
    "Same as you, I don't know why, I can't sleep no matter how hard I try."
    "I think it's guaranteed, what are you worrying about!"
    "Anyway, we did our best, we'll know when we remove the wooden boards."
    On the day of removing the wooden boards, people crowded around the "foundation" at dawn. Everyone strained their eyes, staring at the wooden formwork. Some people even brought their breakfast here to eat. When the wooden formwork was opened, the "foundation" was shiny and smooth like a mirror. After seeing it, the Soviet experts thought it was of the highest quality. Everyone felt indescribably happy, just like winning a battle at the front.
    The selfless labor of the comrades in the demobilized soldiers' team quickly attracted the attention of the concrete team headquarters. The leaders of the team were worried that everyone would exhaust themselves, so they decided to assign some people to do lighter work, such as taking care of tools or doing odd jobs on the construction site. Qiu Zhiguo was assigned to guard the dormitory under these circumstances.
    When Qiu Zhiguo heard this news, he was about to explode. He found the captain and said angrily, "Captain, are you going to let me express my opinion?"
    The captain couldn't guess what had happened and replied, "What's your opinion?"
    "If you want me to guard the dormitory, just let me go home."
    The captain then understood what he meant. He said to Qiu Zhiguo:
    "You're not in good health, wouldn't it be good to do some lighter work?"
      "Why should a person only look for light work? Why should they avoid hard work when they see it?" He repeated the old arguments he had made in the past: All the difficulties of taking bunkers and carrying explosives in the army were overcome, are we afraid of these difficulties now? The captain wanted to persuade Qiu Zhiguo, but Qiu Zhiguo persuaded him instead. In the end, he had to let him stay in the concrete team.
    The bitter cold winter had arrived in Anshan, and the concrete team's pouring project entered the winter construction stage. On the construction site, warm sheds made of reeds and straw mats covered the huge "foundations" like hats. The heaters installed in the warm sheds caused the water vapor emanating from the damp ground to seem to envelop people in clouds. Although the roaring northwest wind outside cut people's faces like knives, people could sometimes work in the warm shed in single-layer clothes like in summer. The tops of the "foundations" were paved with floors, making the entire "foundation" seem like a two-story building. Above the floor, handcarts filled with concrete were running back and forth busily; underground, carpenters were supporting wooden boards; rebar workers were tying rebar; electricians were installing lights; and concrete workers were tamping. This complex, large-scale construction, where various types of work were intertwined, now seemed to be taking place indoors. The whole warm shed was stuffy and hot. The workers were working with their heads down in the crisscrossing pipes, rebar, and anchor bolt gaps. Some people even worked bare-chested, and the sweat on their heads soaked their hair.
    One night, Qiu Zhiguo was tamping in the No. 47 "foundation." He tamped slowly from the bottom up. The bottom was cool and the top was hot. He worked so hard that he felt a little uncomfortable after he finished. He felt dizzy. He was about to climb out of the "foundation," but he saw that another worker next to him had not finished, so he immediately crawled to a place near that worker to help him tamp. He held the iron bar in his hand, and his body was too weak, but he still crawled over.
    He wanted to crawl out of the foundation to drink some water, but his hands and legs didn't obey him. He couldn't crawl, and later he almost dragged his body out of the "foundation." Sitting on the "foundation," he drank two bowls of water and sat for a while, feeling a little better. He was still thinking about the work below, so he immediately crawled down again. As soon as he went down, he finished two carts of concrete in a row. His heart felt like it was being cut with a knife, it hurt so much. He wanted to vomit, but couldn't. He still worked silently, gritting his teeth, but his head was too heavy to lift. Suddenly, he lost consciousness and fainted.
    That night, Qiu Zhiguo was taken to the hospital by ambulance; but the next morning, people saw him coming to the construction site again. Others anxiously asked him, "You're still not well, who let you come to work?" He still smiled as usual, his eyes narrowed into a line, and answered slowly and softly, "I can't stand being idle." As he spoke, he walked boldly into the warm shed of the No. 47 "foundation," where the pouring project was in full swing. Those behind him hurriedly chased after him, shouting, "Qiu Zhiguo, Qiu Zhiguo, the captain orders you to go back and rest today." A slightly older concrete worker next to him saw this scene and sighed, "Alas, this person, asking him to rest is like taking his life."

    转业以后
    ——记建设鞍山的人们
  　本报记者　陆灏
    这事情发生在鞍山开始大规模建设的时候。
    在鞍山市劳动介绍所的门口，这些日子天天拥挤着川流不息的人群，他们都是来到这里参加祖国伟大的和平建设事业的。在这些人中，有一部分人特别引起人们的注意，那就是来自人民武装部队的复员转业军人。他们有的仍旧穿着整齐的草绿色的陆军军装；有的还披着蓝色的，有着白道道的宽大领子的海军战士的衬衣。他们来自遥远的祖国的边境或波涛翻腾的海面，他们到这里来驾驶吊车或浇灌混凝土了。
    劳动介绍所把每一个要求工作的人都分派了适当的工作，得到工作的人一个一个都满意地走开了。按照次序，分派工作的谈话轮到了一位陆军战士的身上。
    这位陆军战士的名字叫邱志国，有一副胖胖的红得像柿子一般的脸孔。他不等有人问他就先抢说：“我是要到大型轧钢厂工地去的。”他的声音是诚恳的，几乎是有点害羞的样子。
    劳动介绍所的工作人员翻开了他的履历表，表上清楚写着：邱志国同志受过伤。他们很快想起了这位战士，是因为说身体不好，所以昨天不愿意被分派到住宅工程的工地去工作。他们当中有一个人和蔼地回答他说：“大型轧钢厂工地比住宅工地的工作要重得多，你受过伤，当然更不能去大型轧钢厂工地了。”
    “我是要去大型轧钢厂工地的。”他肯定地坚持着自己的意见，他说起话来，黏黏糊糊，又低又慢，给人一种纯朴和固执的感觉，使人很难拒绝他的要求。
    “那么，你会不会去了又再回来要求重新分派别的工作呢？”
    “不会的。”他斩钉截铁似地说：“我是为了想到大型轧钢厂工地才到鞍山来的。”他告诉周围的人们说，他因为想到大型轧钢厂工地去工作，所以昨天才不愿意到别的工地去。他想大型轧钢厂这样的工地，已经想得很久了。
    邱志国同志在一九四八年成为人民解放军的一个战士。解放战争期间国民党匪帮退却破坏了铁路，他们从东北一直打到广西，很多的时间是靠两条腿走路。在湖北的时候，他参加铁道兵团修铁路，常常到七、八里以外的地方去抬砂子石头；没有斧头锯子，就拿着菜刀镰刀，到二、三十里路以外的树林里砍木头做排架。常常路基修好了，临时的桥架搭好了，结果因为没有铁轨，只好眼瞪着看火车在几里地外嘟嘟嘟地叫唤。那时候，真是日日夜夜想火车，想铁轨，只要一听火车叫，同志们都要跑出来看看铁轨是否来了，火车是否离得近一些了。邱志国从这时候起，他才知道我们的祖国还不能造铁轨。他看到同志们，在风里雨里行军，一步一步，都是靠两条腿走路。他想，将来全国解放了，我们的祖国能自己造很多铁轨，能到处修铁路，到处跑火车，那多好啊。
    后来，在一次战斗中，邱志国被炸伤了肚皮，炮弹皮崩进了他的肠子，他被送到一个医院里医治，拉屎撒尿，都很困难，病很严重。医院的院长对他说：“送你到疗养院去长期休养吧。”他那里能答应。他说：“我不是不能动，我还能做很多事儿呢。”部队上把他送到北京来医治，他在北京的医院里，开了刀，剪去了一段肠子，终于治好了病，又回到了前方。部队首长看他身体很衰弱，让他休养，他住了一个时期，就住腻了。他一次又一次向首长要求工作，首长总是不答应，最后实在给他缠不过了，就让他去看守一个花园；但他总还是固执地要求到前方去。他说：“我还可以拿枪，为什么要挑轻闲的事儿干？”
    邱志国的身体一天一天好起来了，他的病虽然已经治好，但他的体格确已不再适宜在武装部队里工作。组织上最后决定他复员转业，于是他回到了他的故乡辽西省辽中县。
    在辽中县。邱志国听到鞍山要造一个出铁轨的大型轧钢厂，这消息使他想起在战争时期盼望铁轨的那种难受的滋味；想起自己过去梦想过的事情今天就要实现了，于是他盼望到鞍山来，盼望到大型轧钢厂的工地来工作。恰巧当时鞍山正在大批招收工人，辽中县的人民政府给他发了路费，帮助他到了鞍山。
    邱志国到大型轧钢厂工地工作的愿望毕竟实现了。他被分派在工地混凝土队的一个荣军队当一名混凝土工人。这个荣军队，都是从各个武装部队里来的复员转业军人，他们在战争中都是勇敢的战士，在伟大的和平建设中又成了劳动的能手。
    邱志国开始工作的时候，就被分派打“基础”。开始，他对于什么是钢筋木模，什么叫蜂窝麻面，根本弄不清。别人用铁钎捣固，他怕质量不保险，用手伸在灰浆里，一点一点地慢慢和。他虽然对一切都显得很生疏，但他总想着过去在前方拿地堡，抱炸药，那一次也完成了任务；在和平建设的战线上，可不能把部队带来的光荣丢掉了。有的“基础”很深，他往往一下去就是八小时，吃饭也蹲在里头，工作起来，呼吃呼吃，真像只小老虎似的。
    在“基础”里，一次有三小车混凝土被倒在一个没有人工作的地方，混凝土倒下去，因为没有人捣固，时间长了，那混凝土就坚硬地凝固了。这一天，正逢上邱志国接班在这里工作，他一看这情形，心想，要在这上面继续捣固，就等于把混凝土浇灌在蜂窝狗洞上，这怎么能行，他立刻去找见了领工员。
    “这里能灌混凝土吗？”他像一个老练的混凝土工人似地这样问。
    “行，把它打在里头就可以了。”领工员点点头，毫无犹疑地回答了他。
    邱志国想，这家伙对国家的事那样舍不得用自己的脑袋。凭他在混凝土队短短的日子里，他完全知道领工员的话听不得。他说：“要是可以打，你给我开个条子吧。”
    “什么条子？”领工员不明白地问。
    “你要是负责任，你给我开个条子，写明这里灌混凝土没有问题。”邱志国慎重地说：“你就给我开一张这样的条子吧。”
    这一下可是把领工员“将”住了。他很尴尬地说：“你说怎么办才好啊！”
    “按照我的意思，”邱志国说：“一定要把那三车混凝土打掉。”
    “谁来打呀？”
    “那还用问，我自己干。”
    他说完话，一转身，就钻下“基础”去了。半点钟以后，混凝土的浇灌工程开始在坚实的地基上进行，三车没有经过捣固的混凝土已经全部被打掉，那基础就再也不会发生什么意外的危险了。
    当邱志国和他的同志们打的第一个“基础”快要完工的时候，这些过去拿枪杆的，现在打混凝土的人，都很担心这个“基础”的质量，他们怕自己没有经验把“基础”打坏了。特别是快到揭木板的时间，到了晚上，荣军队的宿舍里谁也翻来覆去睡不着。
    有一天，已经快过半夜了，躺在炕上的邱志国听见荣军队的队长马洪金老是在翻身，他问：“老马，你还没有睡着吗？”
    老马说：“怎么也睡不着，你怎么也没有睡呀！”
    “睡不着呀，你说咱们的质量会怎么样？”
    “我看没有什么问题。”马洪金说：“可是谁也没有把握。”
    这时候，宿舍里就你一言，我一语，好像开起讨论会来了。人们都在担心质量，谁也没有睡着，听见邱志国和队长说开了话，大家就干脆不睡，互相谈开了。
    “你也没有睡着吗？”
    “和你一样，不知怎么搞的，使劲睡也睡不着。”
    “我看能保险，发什么愁呀！”
    “反正咱们使了劲，揭木板的时候就知道了。”
    到了揭木板的那一天，天刚亮，人们都拥在“基础”的边上。大家使劲睁大着眼睛，死盯住木模板，有的人捧着碗，把早饭也拿到这里来吃了。木模板一打开，看，那“基础”光亮光亮，滑溜溜地像面镜子一样。苏联专家看了以后，认为这是第一等的质量。大家真像在前方打了胜仗一样，感到说不出的痛快。
    荣军队的同志们的忘我劳动，很快地引起了混凝土队队部的注意。队部的领导者们担心大家把身体累垮了，于是决定分派一部分人去做较轻一些的工作，譬如照料一些工具，或者在工地上做些零星的工作。邱志国同志就是在这种情形下，被分派去看守宿舍。
    邱志国一听到这消息，他简直要发火了。他找到了队长，生气似地说：“队长，你们讲不讲民主，能让我提个意见吗？”
    队长猜不透是发生了什么事情，回答说：“你有什么意见？”
    “要让我看宿舍，就让我回家算了。”
    队长这才明白了他的意思，他向邱志国说：
    “你身体不好，干些轻一点的工作，不是很好吗？”
      “一个人为什么只找轻一点的工作做呢？为什么见了艰苦的工作要躲避呢？”他又说了他过去说过的那些老意见：在部队里拿地堡，抱炸药的困难全克服了，难道眼前这些困难就害怕了吗？队长本想说服邱志国，结果却被邱志国说住了。最后，只好仍旧让他留在混凝土队工作。
    酷寒的冬天已经来到了鞍山，混凝土队的浇灌工程进入冬季施工阶段了。工地上，芦苇和草垫子搭成的暖棚，像顶帽子似地把庞大的“基础”都一个一个罩起来。暖棚里安装着的暖气，使潮湿的地上散发着的水蒸气把人们好像裹在云雾中一般。尽管外面怒吼着的西北风像小刀子一样割着人的脸孔，而在暖棚里，人们有时候竟能像夏天一样穿着单布衫工作。“基础”的上边都铺了地板，把整个的“基础”好像变成了一座两层的楼房。地板上面，装满了混凝土的手推车在忙碌的来回奔跑；地下，木工在支木板；钢筋工人在绑钢筋；电工在安装电灯；混凝土工人在捣固，这样复杂的各种工种相互交错进行的大规模施工，现在都仿佛搬到屋子里边来进行了。整个的暖棚是闷气和燥热的。工人们钻在纵横交错的管道、钢筋、地脚螺丝的空隙里，低头弯腰地工作着，有的人甚至光着膀子，头上的汗水把头发也湿透了。
    有一天晚上，邱志国正在四十七号“基础”里捣固。他从下边慢慢往上打，下边凉，上边热，他干得又猛，打完了，就觉得有些不舒服，眼前有些发黑。他正要钻到“基础”上来，但看见旁边另一个工人还没有打完，他就马上钻到那个工人附近的地方去帮他捣固。他手里拿着铁钎，身体也软得没有力气，可是他还是钻过去了。
    他想钻到基础上边来喝一点水，但他的手和腿都不听他的指挥。爬也爬不动，后来他几乎是把自己的身体拖到“基础”上来的。坐在“基础”上，喝了两碗水，稍许坐了一会，人就觉得好过一些，他又惦记着下面的工作，马上又钻下去了。他一下去，连着猛猛地打完了两车混凝土，他的心像被刀剜的一样，疼得难受，想吐，吐不出来。自己仍旧一声不响，咬着牙工作着，但头已重得抬不起来，突然就人事不知地晕倒了。
    当天晚上，邱志国被救护车送到了医院；但第二天一早，人们又见他到工地上来了。别人着急地问他：“你病还没有好，谁让你来上班的？”他还像平时那样，说话就笑，笑起来，两只眼睛眯成了一条线，缓慢而又低低地回答说：“我闲着就受不了。”他一面说，一面就豪迈地走进正在紧张进行浇灌工程的四十七号“基础”的暖棚去了。急得后面的人一面跑步追上去；一面喊着：“邱志国，邱志国，队长命令你，今天一定要你回去休息。”旁边一个年纪稍许大一点的混凝土工人，他看到了这种情形，感叹地说：“唉，这个人，要他休息，简直好像要他的命一样。”
