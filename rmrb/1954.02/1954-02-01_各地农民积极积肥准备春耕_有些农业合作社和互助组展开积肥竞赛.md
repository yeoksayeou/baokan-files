Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Farmers in various regions are actively accumulating fertilizer to prepare for spring plowing. Farmers in North China are paying close attention to accumulating coarse fertilizer during spring plowing preparations. Some villages, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams have even launched fertilizer accumulation competitions. According to incomplete statistics from 28 counties in Hebei Province, including Chicheng and Neiqiu, over 9.8 billion jin of fertilizer have been accumulated. According to statistics from 29 counties in Shanxi Province, including Pingding and Hongdong, over 100 million dan of fertilizer had been accumulated by early December of last year. In addition to raising pigs, repairing toilets, and digging manure pits, farmers in various regions are also working hard to sweep street soil, dig river mud, and use smoke fertilizer to increase coarse fertilizer. In Changli, Fengrun, and Qian'an counties of Hebei Province, six districts have already dug over 100 million jin of river mud and pit mud. During the fertilizer accumulation movement, farmers also transport manure and garbage from cities to increase fertilizer. Wulitun Village in Fengnan County, Hebei Province, transported 570,000 jin of manure and garbage from Tangshan City.

Farmers in various regions of Central and Southern China are universally increasing fertilizer accumulation as a guarantee for increasing grain and cotton production. In Qicheng County, Henan Province, the seventh district has already accumulated over 2,552,800 cartloads of fertilizer. Each county in Anyang Prefecture has implemented the principle of focusing on accumulating fertilizer and supplementing with purchased fertilizer, putting forward the slogan of "accumulate early, accumulate more, accumulate well." According to statistics from 28 villages, by finding fertilizer sources, exchanging wall soil, padding cattle and pig pens, and digging manure pits, over 14,350,000 jin of fertilizer have been accumulated, and over 1,200,000 jin of leaves have been swept to make compost. In the vast rice-producing areas south of the Yangtze River in Central and Southern China, fertilizer accumulation for rice has now generally begun. In the Jianghan Plain of Hubei Province, the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province, and the Poyang Lake area of Jiangxi Province, farmers in groups are rowing small boats to nearby lakes and ponds to collect lake grass for green manure. Farmers near the sea in Guangdong Province are also driving small boats to sea in groups to collect seaweed or other marine plants to make fertilizer.

Farmers in Southwest China are all looking for fertilizer sources based on local characteristics in fertilizer accumulation. Farmers in Qujing, Zhenxiong, and Lunan counties in Yunnan Province are generally digging ditch mud and river mud. Farmers in Yimen, Yuxi, and Hexi counties are gathering tree leaves, collecting duckweed, and collecting seaweed to accumulate fertilizer. At present, the fertilizer reserves of farmers in Yunnan Province generally exceed 10% to 15% of the same period in previous years. Mountainous farmers in Yingjing, Hanyuan, Lushan, and Xichang counties in Xikang Province, and Bijie and Guiding prefectures in Guizhou Province have also recently launched fertilizer accumulation activities. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives throughout the region have all formulated fertilizer accumulation plans and taken the lead in accumulating fertilizer. Song Haiqing and other three mutual aid teams in Huilong Village, Jiang'an County, Sichuan Province, put forward the slogan "vigorously accumulate fertilizer to welcome the establishment of cooperatives," and a total of 62 men and women were mobilized to screen over 43,000 jin of slag ash near the county seat.

Farmers in Shandong, Fujian, and Liaodong provinces have achieved significant results in fertilizer accumulation. In most areas of Tai'an, Jining, Linyi, Liaocheng, Wendeng, and Laiyang prefectures in Shandong Province, 80% of farmers have participated in fertilizer accumulation. In Jiaozhou Prefecture, 580,000 farmers have accumulated over 8 million cartloads of soil fertilizer, more than double the previous amount. In Fujian Province, as of early January, according to statistics from some areas of Nanping, Jianyang, and Jinjiang prefectures, over 10 million dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. In Liaodong Province, mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various regions have taken the lead in fertilizer accumulation. Huai'an Village in Xi'an County has many mountains. In the past, farmers delivered manure during the spring thaw. Most of the mountainous areas were difficult to travel due to mud, so manure could not be delivered, which affected crop yields. This year, Sun Dechen's mutual aid team in the village changed this habit and delivered manure while it was still frozen. Under their influence, many farmers in the area are now also delivering manure in advance.

    各地农民积极积肥准备春耕
    有些农业合作社和互助组展开积肥竞赛
    【新华社三十日讯】各地农民积极积肥，为春耕生产进行准备。华北各地农民在春耕准备中都很注意积粗肥，有些村、农业生产合作社、互助组还展开了积肥竞赛。河北省据赤城、内邱等二十八个县不完全统计，已积肥九十八亿多斤。山西省据平定、洪洞等二十九个县统计，到去年十二月上旬已积肥一亿多担。各地农民除圈猪、修厕所、挖粪坑外，并努力扫街土、挖河泥、熏肥等以增加粗肥。河北省昌黎、丰润、迁安三县六个区已挖河泥、坑泥一亿多斤。在积肥运动中，农民们并到城市运粪尿和垃圾以增加肥料。河北省丰南县五里屯村即从唐山市运回大粪和垃圾五十七万斤。
    中南区各地农民普遍增积肥料作为增产粮棉的保证。河南省项城县七区已积肥二百五十五万二千八百多车。安阳专区各县都贯彻了积肥为主、买肥为辅的方针，提出“积早、积多、积好”的口号。据二十八个村的统计，通过找肥源、换壁墙、垫牛栏猪圈和挖粪坑等办法，已积肥一千四百三十五万多斤，还打扫了一百二十多万斤的树叶来沤肥。中南区长江以南广阔的产稻区，现已普遍开始为水稻积肥。在湖北省的江汉平原、湖南省的洞庭湖区、江西省的鄱阳湖区，农民们成群结队划着小船到附近湖沼、池塘里打捞湖草，沤制绿肥。广东省靠近海边的农民，也驾上小艇结伴出海，去采集海藻或其他海生植物造肥。
    西南区农民在积肥中都根据地方特点寻找肥源。云南省曲靖、镇雄、路南等县农民普遍挖沟泥和河泥，易门、玉溪、河西等县农民打树叶、捞浮萍、捞海草等积肥。目前云南省农民积储的肥料，一般已超过往年同期的百分之十到十五。西康省荥经、汉源、芦山、西昌等县和贵州省毕节、贵定专区的山区农民，最近也普遍展开了积肥活动。全区各地的农业生产合作社和准备建社的互助组，都订出了积肥计划带头积肥。四川省江安县会龙村宋海清等三个互助组提出“大力积肥，迎接办社”口号，共出动男女六十二人，到县城附近筛了渣灰四万三千多斤。
    山东、福建、辽东等省农民的积肥工作已有显著成绩。山东省泰安、济宁、临沂、聊城、文登、莱阳等专区的大部地区，有百分之八十的农户参加积肥；胶州专区已经有五十八万户农民积土肥八百多万车，比过去增加一倍。福建省到一月上旬为止，据南平、建阳、晋江三个专区的部分地区统计，已积肥一千多万担。辽东省各地互助合作组织在积肥中都首先行动起来。西安县怀安村山地多，过去农民都在春天化冻时送粪，大部山地因泥泞难行，送不上粪，影响了庄稼的收成。今年该村孙德臣互助组就改变了这种习惯，趁冻送粪。在他们的影响下，当地许多农民现在也都提前送粪。
