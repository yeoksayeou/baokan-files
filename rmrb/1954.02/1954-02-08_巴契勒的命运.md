    Batcheler's Fate
    Hesheng
    On January 1 this year, American prisoner of war Batcheler walked out of the gate of the Songgong-ni camp and returned to the so-called "free world." Batcheler arrived at Panmunjom and attended a press conference hosted by the Americans. A "free world" photographer wanted Batcheler to smile in order to capture a shot that could be exchanged for dollars, so Batcheler had to force a smile for a while; the photographer also wanted Batcheler to give a thumbs-up, and Batcheler had to comply. On the same day, another "free world" reporter, John Sack, sent a "brilliant" report from Panmunjom: "Private First Class Claude Batcheler smiled broadly when he was handed over to the United Nations Command," "Batcheler smiled happily and gave the reporters a thumbs-up, indicating everything was great."
    When Batcheler arrived in Seoul, American intelligence officials and news reporters swarmed him like flies, wanting him to express this and admit that. When Batcheler arrived in Tokyo, he was sent to a U.S. military hospital in Tokyo, where he was subjected to constant questioning, to the point of making Batcheler "mentally confused," and this continues to this day. So, people want to ask: What will happen to Batcheler in the future? Let's look at Dickinson, the American prisoner of war repatriated last October! Not only did he become the object of investigation by the "Un-American Activities Committee" as soon as he returned to the "free world," but he was also arrested on January 22 this year. Immediately after his arrest, he was subjected to court-martial. According to the International News Service, "he may be sentenced to death." Batcheler, naturally, can hardly be an exception. Even he himself is preparing to return home to "face accusations."
    Batcheler was freely repatriated from the prisoner-of-war camp and returned to the so-called "free world," but as soon as he returned to the "free world," he lost his freedom and was interrogated to the point of "mental confusion," and may even be "interrogated" and even "sentenced" in the future. This is Batcheler's fate, and it is also the fate of millions of ordinary Americans.
    Batcheler's fate is like a mirror, revealing the true form of the so-called "free world." There, there is indeed "freedom," that is, the "freedom" of news reporters to force Batcheler to smile and give a thumbs-up, the "freedom" of the McCarthys to extort confessions and even try Batcheler, and the "freedom" to prevent the repatriated Batcheler from returning home to live a peaceful life.

    巴契勒的命运
    禾生
    今年一月一日，美国战俘巴契勒走出了松谷里营场的大门，回到所谓“自由世界”去了。巴契勒到了板门店，出席了美国人主持的记者招待会。一位“自由世界”的摄影记者为了拍摄换取美元的镜头，要巴契勒笑，巴契勒只得尴尬地笑了一阵子；那位记者又要巴契勒翘起大姆指，巴契勒也只得照办。就在同一天，另一位“自由世界”的记者约翰·萨克从板门店发出了“精彩”的报道：“一等兵克劳德·巴契勒在被移交联军司令部方面时笑逐颜开”，“巴契勒笑得很高兴，并对新闻记者们翘起大姆指表示顶好。”
    巴契勒到了汉城，美国的情报官员和新闻记者又像苍蝇似地包围了他，要他表示这个，承认那个。巴契勒到了东京，就被送到东京的美军医院里，又受到了不断的盘问，以至把巴契勒弄到“精神混乱”的地步，一直到现在。那末，人们要问：巴契勒以后会怎样呢？我们看看去年十月遣返的美国战俘狄根逊吧！他不仅一回到“自由世界”就成了“非美活动委员会”调查的对象，而且在今年一月二十二日被捕了，被捕后立即受到军法审判，据国际新闻社说：“可能判处死刑。”巴契勒呢！自然很难例外。连他自己都在准备回国“面对控告”了。
    巴契勒从战俘营中被自由地遣返了，回到了所谓“自由世界”，但是他一回到“自由世界”就失掉了自由，就被审讯得“精神混乱”，以后可能还要受到“审讯”以至“判刑”。这就是巴契勒的命运，也是千千万万普通美国人的命运。
    巴契勒的命运像一面镜子，照出了所谓“自由世界”的原形，在那里，的确也有“自由”，那就是新闻记者硬要巴契勒笑、要巴契勒翘大姆指的“自由”，麦卡锡们逼供以至审判巴契勒的“自由”，以及使已被遣返的巴契勒仍然没有回家过和平生活的“自由”。
