Xinhua News Agency, Andong, February 24th: Twenty-one Americans and one Briton, former prisoners of war in Korea who refused repatriation, arrived in Andong by train from Kaesong today. Representatives from the Chinese Red Cross and the Andong Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace welcomed them at the station.

    At a welcoming meeting held for them, Ji Feng, a representative of the Chinese Red Cross, welcomed them to China on behalf of the Red Cross. Ji Feng said that the Red Cross is willing to provide assistance to the best of its ability during their stay. Richard Corden, representing these Americans and Britons, said in his speech: "It is indeed a pleasure to come to China and receive such a warm welcome. Our gratitude for this hospitality is beyond words." Corden continued, "We have known the Chinese people for more than three years. We know they are a peace-loving, vibrant, and determined nation. We want to thank the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Chinese Red Cross for all the care they have given us."
    Adams, a Black American, shook a Chinese representative's hand emotionally and said that he, a Black man, found racial equality for the first time when he met the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said, "I believe that the Black people in our country know that we are enjoying equal treatment from the Chinese people."
    These twenty-one Americans and one Briton applied to come to China through the Chinese Red Cross. As soon as they received permission, they set off from Kaesong to China, accompanied by representatives of the Chinese Red Cross. They had a very comfortable journey on the train. Some people sat by the train window all day, watching the scenery along the way, and admired the work of the Korean people in healing the wounds of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, February 24th: Two Belgian soldiers who surrendered to the People's Army on the Kimhwa front five days after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement arrived in China from North Korea today. The two Belgians are Roger Devrian from Gits, West Flanders Province, and Louis Veldinee from Schilde, Antwerp Province.

    The two young men said: They left the stronghold defended by the Belgian battalion on the evening of July 31st and went to the stronghold of the Chinese People's Volunteers. They arrived at the Volunteers' stronghold the next morning.
    Louis Veldinee said, "We had been preparing to surrender long before the signing of the armistice agreement, but because of the fighting, we didn't get the chance." "It wasn't until after the armistice that we got this opportunity."
    Although the Chinese People's Volunteers persuaded the two Belgians to return to the American side, they refused to go back. They said that they did not want to return to Belgium. Devrian said: Belgium is rapidly becoming an American colony. Life in Belgium is no longer worth living. There are too many American soldiers stationed in Belgium, and their behavior in many ways is worse than that of Hitler's soldiers. The United States controls the Belgian army, and we have to be trained by the United States. That is one of the reasons why I wanted to come to China.
    The two men were farmers before they enlisted. They said that the dumping of surplus American military supplies in Belgium has brought hardship to the farmers in their country. They said that milk powder and egg products imported from the United States have depressed the prices of milk and eggs in Belgium.
    Veldinee said that the American army treats the Belgian soldiers in Korea like their colonial army. He also said, "They more or less regarded our battalion as a labor camp, using us to dig bunkers and trenches for them."

    拒绝遣返的美英人员由开城到达安东
    停战后向志愿军投诚的两名比利时兵来到我国
    【新华社安东二十四日电】前在朝鲜被俘而拒绝遣返的二十一名美国人和一名英国人今天由开城乘火车到达安东。在车站上欢迎他们的有中国红十字会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会安东分会的代表。
    在为他们举行的欢迎会上，中国红十字会代表纪锋代表红十字会欢迎他们前来中国。纪锋说，在他们逗留期间，红十字会愿尽力给予帮助。理查德·柯敦代表这些美国人和英国人致词说：“来到中国并受到这样热烈的欢迎，的确令人高兴。我们对这种厚遇的感谢是难以用言辞表达的。”柯敦接着说：“我们了解中国人民已经三年多了。我们知道他们是一个爱好和平的、充满活力的、坚决果敢的民族。我们要感谢中国人民、中国人民志愿军和中国红十字会给与我们的一切照顾。”
    美国黑人亚当斯紧握着一位中国代表的手感动地说，在他遇到中国人民志愿军的时候，他，一个黑人，才第一次找到了种族平等。他说：“我相信，我们国内的黑人知道我们享受着中国人民的平等待遇。”
    这二十一个美国人和一个英国人是通过中国红十字会申请前来中国的。他们一得到许可，就从开城动身来中国。陪他们同来的有中国红十字会代表。他们在火车上过得很舒适。有些人成天坐在火车窗口边，沿途观看，对朝鲜人民医治战争创伤的工作十分赞赏。
    【新华社安东二十四日电】在朝鲜停战协定签订以后五天在金化前线向人民部队投诚的两个比利时兵士已在今天从北朝鲜抵达中国。这两个比利时人是西佛兰德省杰茨的罗歇·德夫里安，和安特卫普省歇尔德的路易·弗尔迪湼。
    这两个年轻人说：他们在七月三十一日傍晚离开了比利时营防守的据点到中国人民志愿军的据点去。在第二天早上他们到达了志愿军的据点。
    路易·弗尔迪湼说：“在停战协定签订以前很久，我们就准备投诚了，然而因为战斗，没有得到机会”。“一直到停战以后，我们才得到了这个机会”。
    虽然中国人民志愿军劝说这两个比利时人回到美方去，他们还是拒绝回去。他们说：他们不想回到比利时去。德夫里安说：比利时正在迅速成为美国的殖民地。比利时的生活再也不值得留恋了。驻扎在比利时的美国兵太多，他们在许多方面的行为比希特勒兵士的行为还要坏。美国控制了比利时军队，我们要受美国的训练。这就是我为什么要到中国来的一个原因。
    这两个人在未入伍以前是农民。他们说：美国在比利时倾销剩余军火给他们国家的农民带来了困苦。他们说：从美国进口的奶粉和蛋类产品压低了比利时的牛奶和蛋类的价格。
    弗尔迪湼说：美国军队对待在朝鲜的比利时士兵就像对待他们的殖民地军队一样。他还说：“他们或多或少地将我们这营人当作劳工营，利用我们来为他们挖掘地堡和壕沟。”
