    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Opens Wang Chonglun Advanced Producer School
    Further Promote Wang Chonglun's Spirit and Experience of Production Innovation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Anshan] Anshan Iron and Steel Company, emulating the Soviet Union's method of running Stakhanovite schools, has opened the Wang Chonglun Advanced Producer School. The purpose of opening this school is to rapidly disseminate Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation and specific experiences to workers through short-term intensive study by the students, expand its influence, and become a force for promoting production. The school is taught by advanced producer Wang Chonglun, and Bai Yongwei, the Chinese Communist Party Branch Secretary of the tool workshop of Anshan Iron and Steel Machinery General Factory where he works, is hired as the political instructor, and Hu Yanlin, the technician who helped him create advanced tools, as the technical instructor. Fifty-one advanced mechanical workers from more than thirty units of Anshan Iron and Steel are participating in the study. During their studies, they first listened to the political instructor's report on Wang Chonglun's advanced deeds and great contributions to the motherland's construction, listened to Wang Chonglun's own report on his thoughts and experiences in the process of improving production, and launched discussions in light of their own thoughts. Then, the technical instructor lectured on advanced technology, and the students visited Wang Chonglun's operation performance, and conducted in-depth research in connection with their respective operation methods.
    After studying, the students have gained greatly in both thought and technology. During the study period, the whole class put forward fifty-one rationalization proposals for creating or improving tools, etc. After completing their studies, the participating students also brought Wang Chonglun's advanced thinking and experience to every corner of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Nineteen units, including the Medium-Sized Rolling Mill, the Ironmaking Plant, and the Dagushan Mine, have opened or are preparing to open Wang Chonglun Advanced Producer branch schools after the participating students returned, in order to further promote Wang Chonglun's experience.

    鞍山钢铁公司开办王崇伦先进生产者学校
    进一步推广王崇伦生产革新精神和经验
    【新华社鞍山讯】鞍山钢铁公司仿效苏联举办斯塔哈诺夫学校的方式，开办了王崇伦先进生产者学校。开办这个学校的目的，是以短期集中学习的方式，将王崇伦的生产革新精神和具体经验迅速地通过学员传达到工人中去，扩大影响，成为推动生产的力量。这个学校由先进生产者王崇伦担任教师，并聘请他所在的鞍钢机械总厂工具车间中国共产党支部书记白永威为政治辅导员、帮助他创造先进工具的技术员胡延林为技术辅导员。参加学习的是鞍钢三十多个单位的五十一个先进机械工人。他们在学习期间，首先听了政治辅导员关于王崇伦的先进事迹对祖国建设事业伟大贡献的报告，听了王崇伦本人在改进生产过程中思想情况的报告，结合自己的思想展开了讨论。然后由技术辅导员讲授先进技术，并参观了王崇伦的操作表演，联系各自的操作方法作了深入的研究。
    经过学习，学员们在思想上和技术上都取得了很大收获。在学习期间，全班学员就提出了五十一件创造或改进工具等的合理化建议。参加学习的学员在学习完毕后，并将王崇伦的先进思想和经验带到了鞍山钢铁公司各个角落去。中型轧钢厂、炼铁厂和大孤山矿等十九个单位在参加学习的学员回去后，已开办或正在准备开办王崇伦先进生产者分校，以进一步推广王崇伦的经验。
