The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau held a commendation meeting for model people's police and a celebration of achievements in late January. One hundred and eighty outstanding household registration police, traffic police, and fire police were awarded the titles of model police and meritorious police, and five hundred and twenty-six people were commended. The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government and the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau sent representatives to the meeting to offer their congratulations.

The Tianjin People's Police, having undergone training in various social democratic reform movements, especially the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, have become a powerful and new type of people's police force. In order to further improve the political and professional level of the police and to strengthen the ties between the police and the people, the Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau organized street police stations, traffic police teams, fire brigades, and water security agencies throughout the city to launch a campaign last year to create model officers and strive for meritorious service. This has played a significant role in promoting the completion of various public security tasks by the bureau's staff, ensuring the smooth progress of Tianjin's economic construction, and maintaining social order. In terms of household registration management, reliance on the assistance of the broad masses of residents and the diligence and creativity of the household registration police have resulted in the accurate grasp of population information, blocking or reducing the space for counter-revolutionaries and other criminals to operate, and protecting the safety of residents' lives and property. The "Household Registration Verification Method" created by Yu Xin of the Eighth Branch Police Station was promoted throughout the city, resulting in a fivefold increase in work efficiency. Firefighters throughout the city have gone deep into factories to learn fire protection knowledge, inspect and strengthen fire protection facilities, and conduct fire safety education for employees, effectively preventing the occurrence of fires. Many firefighters have been alert and brave in extinguishing fires, some even continuing to fight fires while sick or injured. The Fifth Traffic Police Team adopted the "Red and Green Flag Command Method" proposed by team member Wang Shiying, which greatly improved traffic management, eliminated traffic accidents, and ensured the completion of transportation tasks. Many model police officers who selflessly safeguarded the interests of the people have emerged in various units. These include Wang Zhedi, a first-class model household registration police officer who rescued disaster victims bare-armed in heavy wind and rain and united the masses to control and transform counter-revolutionaries; Lu Chongzhang, a third-class meritorious police officer who risked his life and crawled on thin ice to rescue an old man who had fallen into an ice hole; Yu Shujiang, a third-class meritorious police officer who jumped into a stinking ditch seven times during the rainy season to clear drainage outlets, saving hundreds of households from danger; and Meng Jixin, a second-class model household registration police officer who fearlessly rushed into a collapsing house to rescue residents' property. They have all been deeply loved by the people and were awarded the titles of model police and meritorious police at the commendation and celebration meeting.

The conference summarized this campaign to create model officers and strive for meritorious service. Seventeen model and meritorious police officers reported on their deeds and work experience at the meeting.

During the conference, Tianjin Mayor Wu De and Deputy Director Wang Chijun of the Political Department of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central Government spoke at the meeting, elaborating on the important role of public security work in implementing the general line of the state during the transition period. They pointed out that because imperialism still exists, it and its running dogs, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, will inevitably continue to send special agents and spies to our country to sabotage our economic construction. Therefore, as a pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship and an important component of the people's public security organs, the people's police force must further strengthen its own construction, making it a force with a high degree of political consciousness, a pure organization, and proficient professional capabilities, to severely suppress counter-revolutionaries and all other criminals who endanger the construction of the motherland and the safety of the people's lives and property. After discussing the speeches and reports of the responsible comrades, the police officers attending the meeting unanimously stated that they would work hard, learn with an open mind, and lead the masses in striving to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, safeguard the construction of the motherland, and protect the safety of the people's lives and property.

    天津市召开表扬模范人民警察和庆功大会
    一百八十名人民警察荣获模范民警和立功民警称号
    天津市人民政府公安局在一月下旬举行了表扬模范人民警察和庆功大会，一百八十名优秀的户籍警、交通警、消防警荣获模范民警和立功民警的称号，五百二十六人受到表扬。中央人民政府公安部、北京市公安局曾派人到会祝贺。
    天津市人民警察经过历次社会民主改革运动，特别是经过镇压反革命运动的锻炼，已经成为一支强有力的、新型的人民警察队伍。为了进一步提高民警的政治、业务水平，更加密切民警与人民群众的联系，天津市公安局组织全市街道派出所，交通队、消防队、水上治安机关于去年普遍开展了创造模范和争取立功的运动，对于推动全局工作人员完成民警治安工作的各项任务，保障津市经济建设的顺利进行和社会秩序的安定，起了很大作用。在户口管理工作方面，依靠广大居民的协助和户籍警的钻研创造，准确地掌握了人口情况，堵塞或缩小了反革命分子及其它犯罪分子活动的空隙，保护了居民生命财产的安全。八分局民警于新所创造的“户口查对法”在全市推行后，工作效率普遍提高五倍。全市消防队员深入工厂学习消防业务知识，检查和加强消防设施，并向职工进行防火安全教育，有效地防止了火灾的发生。许多消防队员在扑灭火灾时机警勇敢，有的甚至带病或带伤坚持不下火场。交通队五分队采用队员王世英所提出的“红绿旗指挥法”的建议后，大大地改进了交通管理工作，消灭了车祸，保证了运输任务的完成。各单位还出现了许多忘我地维护人民利益的模范警察。其中有在大风雨中赤着臂膀抢救灾民、团结群众管制和改造反革命分子的一等模范、户籍警王哲棣；冒着生命危险、爬着薄冰抢救掉进冰窟窿的老大爷的三等功民警吕崇章；在雨季中七次跳进臭水沟挖通沟眼使数百户居民脱险的三等功民警于舒江；奋不顾身冲入将要倒塌的房屋中抢救居民财物的二等模范户籍警孟继鑫等。他们都受到了广大人民的热爱，在表模庆功大会上荣获了模范民警和立功民警的称号。
    大会总结了这一创模立功运动，十七位模范和立功民警在会上报告了自己的事迹和工作经验。
    在大会期间，天津市吴德市长和中央公安部政治部王赤军副主任曾到会讲话，阐述了民警治安工作在贯彻国家过渡时期总路线中的重要作用。他们指出：由于帝国主义还存在，它和它的走狗蒋介石残余匪帮必然要继续向我国派遣特务间谍，破坏我国经济建设事业。因此，作为人民民主专政的支柱和人民公安机关一个重要组成部分的人民警察队伍，必须进一步加强自己的建设，使它成为具有高度的政治觉悟、纯洁的组织、熟练的业务能力的队伍，严厉地镇压反革命分子及其他一切危害祖国建设和人民生命财产安全的犯罪分子。与会民警在讨论了各负责同志的讲话和报告后一致表示：要努力工作，虚心学习，带领群众，为巩固人民民主专政，保障祖国建设，保护人民生命财产安全而奋斗。
