Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 31st: National industrial labor models Ma Hengchang, Jiang Wanshou, Zheng Xikun, Tian Guiying, Liu Jinggui, and others who are studying at the Affiliated Workers and Peasants School of Northeast Institute of Technology, wrote letters to the nationally renowned agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Han En, Geng Changsuo, Lü Hongbin, Jin Shilong, Yang Xianting, and Deng Guozhang on the eve of the Spring Festival to congratulate them on the holiday. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear comrades Li Shunda, Han En, Geng Changsuo, Lü Hongbin, Jin Shilong, Yang Xianting, and Deng Guozhang:

Around this Spring Festival, many workers from factories and mines will select their own representatives to visit farmer brothers in the vast countryside. Because we are studying at school, we cannot participate in this meaningful visit and celebration. Therefore, we can only express our concern and congratulations to you by writing this letter!

This year is the second year of our country's planned economic construction. In order to achieve socialist industrialization as soon as possible, we working people, especially our worker and farmer brothers, should strengthen unity, work together, support each other, and actively carry out socialist construction. Industry promotes the development of agriculture, and the development of agriculture also strongly supports industrial construction. We have already made many achievements in these aspects. In the past four years, due to the rapid restoration and development of the national industry, more than 600,000 new-style agricultural tools and more than 500,000 waterwheels have been supplied to farmer brothers across the country; there are also a large number of bean cakes, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and pesticide equipment. Similarly, the farmer brothers actively produce and support industrial production with the fruits of their hard work – surplus grain and industrial raw materials. Last year, when the state purchased grain, many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. For example, comrades Geng Changsuo, Han En, and their agricultural production cooperatives sold 140,000 to 150,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Dear comrades, we express our great respect and gratitude for your exemplary actions in actively supporting the country's industrial construction! You are all experts and banners on the agricultural production front. This year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the country may develop to about 45,000. In order to strive for the completion of this glorious and arduous task, it is necessary to widely exchange and promote your valuable experience in running cooperatives in various places, so as to complete the country's socialist transformation of agriculture as soon as possible. In order to better realize the general line and general task of the country's transition period, our worker and farmer brothers must unite, trust, help, and support each other even better.

Dear comrades, in order to live up to the cultivation and education of us by the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, we are working hard to study seriously. In the past year, we have made great progress in culture. We recently finished our winter vacation exams, and the grades of several of us are generally not bad. This can also be told to you for comfort. In order to meet the national construction tasks, we must vigorously improve our political and cultural level and scientific knowledge, so as to contribute our share to socialist construction.

We wish you
Happy Spring Festival!
Ma Hengchang, Jiang Wanshou, Zheng Xikun, Tian Guiying, Liu Jinggui.

    全国工业劳动模范马恒昌姜万寿等
    向全国农业劳动模范李顺达等祝贺春节
    【新华社沈阳三十一日电】正在东北工业学院附属工农速成中学学习的全国工业劳动模范马恒昌、姜万寿、郑锡坤、田桂英、刘景贵等，在春节前夕，写信给全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达、韩恩、耿长锁、吕鸿宾、金时龙、杨显亭、邓国章祝贺春节。信的全文如下：
    亲爱的李顺达、韩恩、耿长锁、吕鸿宾、金时龙、杨显亭、邓国章等同志：
    今年春节前后，有许多工厂、矿山的工人兄弟们，将要选出他们自己的代表，到广大农村去访问农民兄弟们。我们几个人因为在学校学习，不能前往参加这一有意义的访问和联欢，因此，只有写这封信来表达我们对你们的关怀和祝贺！
    今年是我们祖国进入有计划经济建设的第二年，为了早日实现社会主义工业化，我们劳动人民，特别是我们工人和农民弟兄更应该加强团结，共同努力，互相支援，积极进行社会主义建设。工业促进了农业的发展，农业的发展也有力地支援了工业建设。这些方面，我们已做出了不少成绩，四年来，由于国家工业的迅速恢复和发展，供给了全国农民兄弟六十多万部新式农具，五十多万辆水车；还有大量的豆饼、化学肥料、农药和农药器械。同样，农民弟兄积极生产，把他们辛勤劳动的果实——多余的粮食和工业原料也支援了工业生产。去年国家收购粮食时，许多农业生产合作社和互助组都踊跃地把余粮卖给了国家，如耿长锁、韩恩等同志和他们的农业生产合作社，把十四、五万斤的余粮卖给了国家。亲爱的同志们，我们对你们这种积极支援国家工业建设的模范行动，表示极大的敬意和谢意！你们都是农业生产战线上的能手和旗帜，今年全国农业生产合作社，可能要发展到四万五千个左右。为了争取这一光荣而又艰巨任务的完成，就需要把你们办社的宝贵经验，广泛地在各地交流和推广，以便早日完成国家对农业的社会主义改造。为了更好地实现国家过渡时期总路线总任务，我们工人和农民兄弟就要更好的团结、信任，互相帮助，互相支援。
    亲爱的同志们，我们为了不辜负中国共产党和人民政府对我们的培养和教育，我们正在努力认真地学习。一年来，我们在文化方面已经有很大的提高，最近才考完了寒假期考，我们几个人的成绩，一般都不算坏，这一点也可以告慰于你们。为了迎接国家建设任务，我们还要大力提高我们的政治、文化水平和科学知识，以便在社会主义建设中尽我们应尽的一份力量。
    祝你们
    春节快乐！
    马恒昌、姜万寿、郑锡坤、田桂英、刘景贵。
    一月二十七日
