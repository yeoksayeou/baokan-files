The great Chinese people not only sent their excellent sons and daughters to help us during the war and resist the aggression of American imperialism, but also gave the Korean people generous assistance in various aspects after the armistice. This great internationalist spirit fills us with firm confidence in restoring the peaceful construction of our country." General Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the CPVA Political Department, in his reply, congratulated all the workers of the mine on achieving greater success in rapidly restoring and developing production.
