Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, February 12th: The earthwork engineering planned for the 1953 winter Huai River project has been successfully completed, with a total of over 14 million cubic meters of earth moved. All earthwork projects were halted before the Spring Festival, and the 200,000 laborers are now at home celebrating the holiday. These earthwork projects mainly include the improvement projects of the Hong River, Ying River, and Huiji River in Henan Province in the upper reaches of the Huai River; the improvement projects of the Quan River and North Tuo River in Anhui Province in the middle reaches; and the North Fei River drainage and irrigation project. The improvement of these tributaries of the Huai River plays a significant role in protecting farmland on both sides of the Huai River from flooding and increasing grain production. For example, after the winter improvement of the Hong River is completed, together with the previously completed flood storage and river channel improvement projects, the Hong River can be initially protected from the threat of floods. In Xinyang Prefecture of Henan Province alone, more than 3.7 million mu of farmland will benefit. After the completion of the winter project of the North Fei River drainage and irrigation project, together with the sluice gates completed last year, the 700,000 mu of farmland in the most severely waterlogged areas on both sides of the North Fei River will no longer suffer from waterlogging.

During the winter construction of the Huai River project, laborers in various regions universally participated in labor competitions and formulated targets for increasing production and practicing economy. Although the weather was severe and construction was very difficult, earthwork efficiency was still very high. On the Hong River construction site, the work efficiency of more than 40,000 laborers increased by 33% compared to the start of construction due to the improvement of labor organization and working methods. On the North Fei River construction site, laborers excavated about two cubic meters of earth per person per day, with the highest exceeding four cubic meters. Work efficiency also increased by 30% to 40% compared to the start of construction, saving a total of 150,000 workdays and completing the winter construction task five to eight days ahead of schedule.

    一九五三年冬季治淮工程的土工工程完工
    【新华社蚌埠十二日电】一九五三年冬季治淮工程已胜利完成了预定的冬季施工中土工工程的计划，共做土方一千四百多万公方。土工工程在春节前已全部停工，二十万民工此时在家中欢度了春节。这些土工主要有淮河上游河南省的洪河、颍河、惠济河整理工程，中游有安徽省的泉河、北沱河整理工程，和北淝河排涝灌溉工程。这些淮河支流的整理，对淮河两岸农田的免除水灾，增产粮食有很大作用。如洪河冬季整理完工后，配合过去已做好的蓄洪工程和河道整理工程，可使洪河初步免除洪水的威胁，仅河南省信阳专区受益的农田就有三百七十多万亩。北淝河排涝灌溉工程冬季工程完工后，配合去年已做好的闸坝，可使北淝河两岸最严重的内涝地区的七十万亩农田不再遭受内涝的灾害。
    治淮冬季施工中，各地民工普遍参加了劳动竞赛，拟订了增产节约的指标，虽然天气严寒，施工十分困难，但土工效率依然很高。洪河工地上四万多民工由于改进了劳动组织和工作方法，工作效率较开工时提高了百分之三十三。北淝河工地上民工每人每天挖土两公方左右。最高的有四公方以上，工作效率也较开工时提高了百分之三十到四十，共计节省了十五万个工作日，提前五天到八天完成了冬季施工任务。
