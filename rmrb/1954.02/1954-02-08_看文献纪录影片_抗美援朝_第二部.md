Grateful thanks to the film photographers on the Korean front, who day and night braved artillery fire and the frenzied bombing of enemy aircraft, overcoming all kinds of difficulties and dangers, to truthfully record the world-shaking feat of resisting America and aiding Korea, time and time again. The documentary film "Resist America, Aid Korea" Part Two, allows us to see the victorious progress from the Fifth Campaign until the realization of the Korean armistice, giving us tremendous encouragement.

Over the past four years, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our motherland has been advancing by leaps and bounds. Every achievement in the construction of the motherland is inseparable from the great victory of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea. When the American aggressor troops and their accomplices were ravaging the peaceful land of Korea, when the American warmongers were barking madly that "the Yalu River is not an insurmountable barrier that distinctly separates China and Korea," if it were not for the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, bravely fighting against American imperialism, if the Chinese people had not promptly sent their outstanding sons and daughters—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—to fight alongside the Korean people against the aggression of American imperialism, could our motherland have carried out construction so peacefully? Could our factories, mines, mutual aid groups, cooperatives...have carried out production so peacefully? Could the "forty-year wish" of the people of Southwest China have been realized so early? Could the people on both sides of the Huai River have obtained happiness so quickly? Therefore, when the workers see the red line on the production increase chart rising day by day, when the farmers see the golden grain yielding bumper harvests year after year, when the "Red Scarves" happily "sing of our beloved motherland," they all cheer for the glorious victory of resisting America and aiding Korea, and they all thank and love the heroic Korean people and our most beloved people—the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—from the bottom of their hearts. In the film "Resist America, Aid Korea" Part Two, when the Young Pioneer hangs his beloved red scarf on the Meritorious Cannon, he represents the profound feelings of the people of the whole country.

In the film "Resist America, Aid Korea" Part One, we have already seen the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, with inferior equipment, overcome serious difficulties, and together with the Korean People's Army, drive the mad enemy from the Yalu River to beyond the 38th parallel, reversing the Korean war situation and laying the foundation for the victory of the anti-aggression war. "Resist America, Aid Korea" Part Two reflects and sings the praises of the brilliant achievements of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies who became braver and stronger after the Fifth Campaign. The film allows us to see that after the Fifth Campaign, the American aggressor troops bowed their heads before our two hundred and fifty-kilometer-long steel underground Great Wall. The American bandits called our "1211" highland "Heartbreak Ridge" during the "Summer Offensive." In fact, within this Great Wall, every hero's cave and every hero's hill was also a "Heartbreak Ridge" for the American aggressor troops! Such a vast and arduous project was designed by our heroes themselves; it was built by their own hands, hammer by hammer, shovel by shovel, in situations where they put down their guns and picked up shovels, and put down their hammers and picked up guns. Our heroes concentratedly demonstrated the diligence, bravery, and outstanding wisdom of the Chinese people here. We also see in the film teams of swift "silver swallows" taking to the sky; dense anti-aircraft artillery groups constantly giving the American aerial bandits a head-on blow; our tanks moving out; our rocket launchers roaring. The modern weapons donated by the people of the motherland give our most beloved people wings like a tiger.

The film uses many shots to record the miracles on the transportation front. This steel-like battle line is condensed with the blood, sweat, and friendship of the Korean and Chinese people, demonstrating unparalleled strength. Let the American bandits bomb wantonly, and do everything possible to destroy it. The will of the Korean and Chinese people is thousands and ten thousands of times stronger than the power of any bomb, and it can never be blown up or cut off. In front of our heroic drivers, air defense sentries, and road-building soldiers and civilians, the thousands upon thousands of tons of steel dropped by the American bandits seem so small, despicable, and incompetent! It is these heroes who have continuously supplied the front line with the materials supported by the people of the motherland, ensuring the victory of the war.

The film not only truthfully describes the brilliant victories of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, but also tells people that the victory of resisting America and aiding Korea is inseparable from the wise leadership of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. The film records the scene of Comrade Mao Zedong speaking at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The US imperialists are willing to fight for however many years, and we are prepared to fight with them for however many years, until the US imperialists are willing to give up, until the Chinese and Korean people win complete victory." The motherland's ever-changing construction, the full support and repeated visits of the people of the motherland, and the support and solidarity of the world's peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union are all truthfully reflected in the film. All of this has given our heroic troops great encouragement, constantly enhancing their combat power.

In the face of heroic troops fighting for justice and peace, even the most ferocious enemy has to bow their heads. The American aggressors had no choice but to accept the Soviet proposal for Korean armistice negotiations. The film provides a systematic introduction to the world-renowned Korean armistice negotiations.

After tasting the bitterness on the battlefield, the US imperialists vainly hoped to recoup the capital they had already lost on the negotiating table. During the more than two years of negotiations, the American aggressors used every hooligan trick imaginable. Denial, blackmail, rumors, slander, arson, shooting, disrupting the venue, bombing the neutral zone... But what else have these hooligan tricks done besides thoroughly exposing the American imperialists as the deadly enemies of peace? So they took risks on the battlefield again. But what was the result? Whether it was the "strangulation war," "bacterial war," or the so-called "military pressure" of indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents, they were all successfully crushed by the Korean and Chinese people. The American bandits got only: a significant increase in the list of casualties; more intense internal disputes; and a sweeping loss of prestige in the eyes of their servants.

Not long after the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, Stalin had already wisely pointed out that "the Korean War can only end in the failure of the interventionists." The facts are exactly like this. On July 27, 1953, the three-year and thirty-three-day war of aggression against Korea launched by US imperialism finally had to stop at the point where it launched the aggression.

"Resist America, Aid Korea" Part Two also shows the Korean people carrying out recovery and reconstruction work after the signing of the armistice agreement. The film allows us to see how Korean workers smelted the first furnace of molten iron on the ruins; how the railway from Pyongyang to Kaesong was restored to traffic on the fourth day after the armistice; and how the heroic Korean people, with the selfless assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, began to rebuild their homes. These vivid shots not only powerfully illustrate that the imperialist war conspiracy can be completely defeated, and that peace will surely defeat war, but also point out that the heroic Korean people, under the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, with the sincere assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and the world's peace and democracy camp, are fully capable of healing the wounds of war and rebuilding a happy life.

Of course, as the ending of the film shows, the US imperialists will not learn any lessons from the failure of the war of aggression against Korea. Before the ink on the armistice agreement was dry, the American aggressors tried every possible means to obstruct and undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Recently, they forcibly detained more than 20,000 captured Korean and Chinese personnel, and insisted on having them serve as cannon fodder for the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs, which is a powerful ironclad proof of this conspiracy.

However, the victorious Korean and Chinese people know how to deal with the warmongers. As General Peng Dehuai pointed out in the "Report on the Work of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist America and Aid Korea": "We must solemnly warn the warmongers in the United States that if you or your running dog, the Li Seung-man clique, dare to betray the Korean Armistice Agreement and launch another war of aggression, then you will definitely be beaten to a pulp. Any conspiracy of yours to abort and undermine the political conference will inevitably suffer more serious defeat due to the most resolute opposition of the Korean and Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world." (See "People's Daily," September 13, 1953)

Everyone who has seen the film "Resist America, Aid Korea" Part Two will definitely come to this conclusion.

    感谢朝鲜前线的电影摄影师们，日日夜夜地冒着炮火，出入敌机的疯狂轰炸，克服各种各样的困难和艰险，把震动世界的抗美援朝的壮举，一次又一次地如实记录下来。文献纪录影片“抗美援朝”第二部，又使我们看到了从第五次战役直到朝鲜停战实现这一阶段的胜利进程，又给我们以极大的鼓舞。
    四年来，在共产党的领导下，我们的祖国一日千里地前进着。祖国建设的每一成就都是与抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利分不开的。当美国侵略军及其帮凶们蹂躏着和平的朝鲜土地的时候，当美国好战分子们狂吠着“鸭绿江并不是把中朝两国截然分开的不可超越的障碍”的时候，如果不是英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，勇敢地和美帝国主义进行搏斗，如果中国人民不是及时地派出自己的优秀儿女——中国人民志愿军，去和朝鲜人民并肩抗击美帝国主义的侵略，我们祖国能这样安安稳稳地进行建设吗？我们的工厂、矿山、互助组、合作社……能这样太太平平地进行生产吗？西南人民“四十年的愿望”，能实现的这样早吗？淮河两岸人民的幸福，能得到的这样快吗？所以，当工人们眼看着增产图表上的红线一天天上升的时候，当农民们眼望着黄金似的粮食一年年丰收的时候，当“红领巾”愉快地“歌唱我们亲爱的祖国”的时候，他们都要为抗美援朝的辉煌胜利而欢呼，都要从心底里感谢和热爱英雄的朝鲜人民和我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军。在影片“抗美援朝”第二部里，当那个少年先锋队员把心爱的红领巾挂在功臣炮上的时候，他是代表着全国人民的海样深的心意的。
    在影片“抗美援朝”第一部里，我们已经看到祖国的英雄儿女，以劣势的装备，克服了严重的困难，和朝鲜人民军一起，把疯狂的敌人从鸭绿江边赶过了三八线，扭转了朝鲜战局，奠定了反侵略战争的胜利基础。而“抗美援朝”第二部又反映和歌颂了朝中人民军队在五次战役以后愈战愈勇、愈战愈强的辉煌业绩。影片让我们看到，五次战役以后，美国侵略军在我们的绵延二百五十公里的钢铁的地下长城面前低头了。美国强盗在“夏季攻势”中，把我们“一二一一”高地称做“伤心岭”，其实，在这座长城里，每一个英雄洞、每一座英雄的山头，又何尝不都是美国侵略军的“伤心岭”呢！这么一座浩大而艰巨的工程，都是我们的英雄自己设计的；是他们在放下枪拿起锹、放下锤又拿起枪的情况下，用自己的双手，一锤一锤、一锹一锹修成的。我们的英雄，在这里集中地表现了中国人民的勤劳、勇敢和卓越的智慧。我们在影片里也看到一队队风驰电掣的“银燕”升高了；密密层层的高射炮群，不断给予美国空中强盗以迎头痛击；我们的坦克出动了；我们的火箭炮怒吼了。祖国人民所捐献的现代化武器，使得我们最可爱的人如虎生翼。
    影片用许多镜头，记录了运输战线上的奇迹。这条钢铁般的战线，凝结着朝、中人民的血汗和友谊，表现了无比的力量。让美国强盗肆意地轰炸吧，千方百计地破坏吧，朝、中人民的意志，比任何炸弹的威力，都要强出千倍、万倍，它是永远炸不烂、打不断的。在我们英雄的驾驶员、防空哨、修路军民的面前，美国强盗投掷的成千成万吨钢铁，显得多么渺小、卑鄙、无能！就是这些英雄们，把祖国人民支援的物资源源不断地供应了前线的需要，保证了战争的胜利。
    影片不仅真实地描述了朝、中人民部队的辉煌胜利，而且也告诉人们，抗美援朝的胜利，是和我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的英明领导分不开的。影片记录了毛泽东同志在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上讲话的镜头，毛泽东同志说：“美帝国主义愿意打多少年，我们也就准备跟他打多少年，一直打到美帝国主义愿意罢手的时候为止，一直打到中朝人民完全胜利的时候为止。”祖国日新月异的建设，祖国人民的全力支援和多次慰问，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的支持和声援，也都在影片里真实地反映着。这一切，又给我们的英雄部队以莫大的鼓舞，使他们的战斗力量不断增强。
    在为正义和和平而战的英雄部队面前，那么凶恶的敌人也不得不低下头来。美国侵略者，不得不接受苏联提出的关于朝鲜停战谈判的建议。影片对于举世注目的朝鲜停战谈判，作了系统的介绍。
    美帝国主义在战场上尝到苦头以后，妄想在谈判桌上捞一把已经赌输了的血本。两年多的谈判过程中，美国侵略者使用了应有尽有的流氓手段。抵赖、讹诈、造谣、污蔑、纵火、开枪、捣乱会场、轰击中立区……。而这一切流氓手段除了彻底暴露了美帝国主义者是和平的死敌以外，又有什么呢？他们于是又在战场上冒险了。可是结果怎样呢？无论是“绞杀战”、“细菌战”以及滥炸和平居民的所谓“军事压力”，都被朝、中人民胜利地粉碎了。美国强盗得到的只有：伤亡名单的显著增加；内部的争吵更加激烈；在仆从们的心目中的威信扫地。
    在美帝国主义发动侵朝战争不久，斯大林就已经英明地指出：“朝鲜战争只能以干涉者的失败而告终。”事实完全是这样。一九五三年七月二十七日，美帝国主义发动的三年零三十三天的侵朝战争，终于不得不在他发动侵略的起点上停止下来了。
    “抗美援朝”第二部也表现了停战协定签字以后进行恢复和重建工作的朝鲜人民。影片让我们看到，朝鲜工人怎样在废墟上炼出第一炉铁水；从平壤通到开城的铁路，怎样地在停战后第四天就恢复通车；英雄的朝鲜人民，怎样地在中国人民志愿军无私的帮助下，着手重建家园。这些生动的镜头，不仅有力地说明了：帝国主义的战争阴谋是完全可以被打败的，和平一定能战胜战争，而且也指出了：英雄的朝鲜人民在金日成元帅的英明领导下，加以苏联、中国以及全世界和平民主阵营的真诚的援助，完全有力量来医治战争创伤，重建幸福生活。
    当然，正如影片的结尾所表现的，美帝国主义并不会因侵朝战争的失败而接受任何教训的。停战协定签字的墨渍未干，美国侵略者又千方百计地阻挠和破坏朝鲜问题的和平解决。最近，他们强迫扣留了两万余名朝、中被俘人员，硬要他们给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰，就是这一阴谋的有力的铁证。
    不过，胜利了的朝、中人民，是知道应当怎样来对付战争贩子们的。正如彭德怀将军在“关于中国人民志愿军抗美援朝工作的报告”中指出的那样：“必须严正警告美国的好战分子们，如果你们或你们的走狗李承晚集团敢于背信弃义地破坏朝鲜停战协定，再次发动侵略战争，那么，你们就一定会碰得头破血流。你们任何使政治会议流产和遭受破坏的阴谋，都必将遭受朝中人民和世界爱好和平人民最坚决的反对而遭受更严重的失败。”（见一九五三年九月十三日“人民日报”）
    每个看了影片“抗美援朝”第二部的人，一定会得出这样的结论。
