    Large Quantities of Sacks on Round Trips
    Reader Wan Fanghuai writes from Huaihua: During the grain transfer work in the Qianyang Special District of Hunan Province in September and October of last year, due to the irresponsibility of the personnel involved, large quantities of sacks were transported empty for hundreds of kilometers, resulting in a waste of financial and human resources.

    On September 14th of last year, the Storage and Transportation Management Station of the Qianyang Special District Grain Bureau, because Huitong County and Huang County urgently needed sacks, notified the Chenxi County Grain General Warehouse by telephone to transfer 8,000 sacks to Huitong County and Huang County (6,000 for Huitong County and 2,000 for Huang County). Qin Zhang, the deputy director of the Chenxi County Grain General Warehouse, misheard the phone call and ordered Zhou Fusheng, the clerk in charge, to transport all 8,000 sacks to Huang County. On September 16th, the Storage and Transportation Management Station sent the transfer voucher to the Chenxi County Grain General Warehouse, stating that the sacks were to be transported to two counties separately. However, Zhou Fusheng, the clerk in charge, did not pay attention, and Qin Zhang, the deputy director of the General Warehouse, did not inquire. Later, Huaihua County needed 2,000 sacks, and the Storage and Transportation Management Station told Huang County by telephone to allocate 2,000 sacks from the extra sacks received (Huaihua is located between Chenxi and Huang County). The Huang County Grain Section actually transported all 6,000 sacks that were mistakenly delivered to Huaihua County. However, a week later, Huang County urgently needed 6,000 sacks, so the Storage and Transportation Management Station had to transport 4,000 sacks that had just arrived in Huaihua back, and additionally transferred 2,000 sacks from Hongjiang City. In this way, the 6,000 sacks that departed from Chenxi made a round trip, costing "travel expenses" of more than 11 million yuan, and affecting the grain transportation time of Huitong County.

### 大批麻袋往返“旅行”

    大批麻袋往返“旅行”
    读者万方怀来信：湖南省黔阳专区在去年九、十月间的粮食调运工作中，由于经办人员的工作不负责任，使大批麻袋往返空运了数百公里，造成财力和人力上的浪费。
    去年九月十四日，黔阳专署粮食局储运管理站因会同县和晃县急需麻袋，就用电话通知辰溪县粮食总仓库调八千条麻袋分运会同县和晃县（会同县六千条，晃县二千条）。辰溪县粮食总仓库副主任秦璋竟听错了电话，叫经办人周富生将八千条麻袋都运往晃县。九月十六日，储运管理站将调拨凭证送到辰溪县粮食总仓库，载明麻袋是分运两个县的。但经办人周富生没有引起注意，总仓库副主任秦璋也没有过问。后来怀化县需要二千条麻袋，储运管理站就用电话告诉晃县从多收的麻袋中拨给二千条（怀化是在辰溪、晃县之间）。晃县粮食科竟将六千条错运麻袋全数运到怀化县。但一个星期以后，晃县又急需六千条麻袋，于是储运管理站只得将刚到怀化的麻袋又运回四千条，并另从洪江市加调二千条。这样，从辰溪出发的六千条麻袋来回
  “旅行”，花掉“旅费”一千一百余万元，并影响了会同县的运粮时间。
