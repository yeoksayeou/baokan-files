Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 3rd: V.M. Molotov wrote a letter on February 2nd in reply to a letter from Erich Kerstens, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany, dated January 29th. In his letter, Kerstens urged the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to pay attention to the fact that 9,275,028 German citizens had signed an appeal calling for representatives of the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the discussion of the German question. V.M. Molotov pointed out in his reply that "The Soviet government believes that the German people's desire to allow representatives from both parts of Germany to participate in the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference is just and entirely reasonable, because it is difficult to imagine resolving the German question without the participation of German representatives." The letter went on to say that, therefore, the Soviet delegation supports the request made by the government of the German Democratic Republic to invite representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. The letter said, "Unfortunately, this proposal has not yet been supported by the US, British, and French Foreign Ministers."

    莫洛托夫外长答复柯伦斯的来信
    支持东西德代表参加四外长会议的建议
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社柏林三日讯：维·米·莫洛托夫于二月二日写信答复民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团主席埃里希·柯伦斯于一月二十九日的来信。柯伦斯在来信中促请四国外长会议注意已有九百二十七万五千零二十八个德国公民在一封要求让德意志民主共和国和西德代表参加德国问题的讨论的呼吁书上签了名。维·米·莫洛托夫在复信中指出，“苏联政府认为德国人民要求让德国两部分的代表参加柏林外长会议的愿望是公正的，而且是完全合理的，因为没有德国代表的参加，要解决德国问题是难以想像的事。”这封信接着说，因此，苏联代表团支持德意志民主共和国政府所提出的关于邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表参加四外长会议的要求。这封信说，“不幸的是这个建议到目前为止还没有得到美国、英国和法国外长们的支持。”
