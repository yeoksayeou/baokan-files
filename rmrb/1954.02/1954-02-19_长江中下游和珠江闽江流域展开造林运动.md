    Afforestation Movement Unfolds in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River and the Pearl and Min River Basins
    Large areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Pearl and Min River basins are vigorously launching a mass spring afforestation movement.
    The vast areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Pearl and Min River basins have a mild climate and abundant rainfall, which is extremely suitable for the growth of timber forests such as Chinese fir and eucalyptus. Seedlings can grow into forests in about 20 to 30 years after planting and can be felled for use. In order to ensure the long-term supply of timber for national construction, the Central South Region plans to afforest more than 6.7 million mu this year. It is estimated that 90% of this can be completed this spring. At present, farmers in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other places have actively started afforestation. Jiangxi Province plans to afforest more than 1.6 million mu this year, mainly with timber forests such as fir and pine. Under the slogan of "Planting Trees and Making Forests to Support National Industrial Construction," the enthusiasm of farmers in the province for afforestation labor has reached an unprecedented high. After the Beginning of Spring (February 4), thousands of farmers carried seedlings and seeds to the mountains to plant trees. The afforestation pilot projects in Liling, Wangcheng, Youxian and other places in Hunan Province have also been fully launched. Farmers in the first district of Xiangtan County are actively afforesting to "green the hometown of Chairman Mao." Jiangsu Province, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, plans to afforest more than 200,000 mu this year, and spring afforestation has now begun. Guangxi Province, in the upper reaches of the Pearl River, plans to afforest 1.2 million mu and cultivate 4,600 mu of seedlings this year. By the end of January, Liuzhou Forest Farm had completed the planting of more than one million seedlings. Pingle County afforested more than 60,000 trees in one month. Fujian Province plans to cultivate 700,000 mu of timber forests and fuel forests such as Chinese fir, pine, and eucalyptus this year. At present, 36 state-owned nurseries and farmer-run nurseries throughout the province have cultivated more than 240 million robust seedlings of Masson pine and cork oak, etc., for planting in various places. In Hainan Island, located in the subtropics, farmers are also vigorously planting coconut trees and sisal hemp, both of which are rare and important industrial raw materials in China.
    This year, the vast areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Pearl and Min River basins made full preparations before spring afforestation. Last year, the Central South Region dispatched cadres to investigate more than 8.2 million mu of suitable afforestation land, and cultivated more than 3 billion seedlings and collected more than 2,000 tons of tree seeds for spring afforestation, based on the principle of "what kind of forest to plant, what kind of seedlings to cultivate; how much forest to plant, how many seedlings to cultivate; where to plant forests, where to cultivate seedlings." According to the distribution of seedlings, Hubei Province has determined Huanggang and Xiaogan, two special districts with a relatively large number of cultivated seedlings, as the focus of afforestation this spring. 18 counties in Guangdong Province, including Dianbai, Meixian, Xingning, and Wengyuan, have held forestry training classes, and more than 1,400 forestry activists have studied forestry policies and afforestation techniques.

    长江中下游和珠江闽江流域展开造林运动
    长江中下游和珠江、闽江流域的广大地区，正大力展开群众性的春季造林运动。
    长江中下游和珠江、闽江流域广大地区气候温和、雨量充足，极宜杉木、桉树等用材林木的生长。幼苗种植后约二三十年就可成林，并可伐用。为了长期地保证国家建设用材的供应，今年中南区计划造林六百七十多万亩。预计今年春季即可营造百分之九十。目前，江西、湖南、广东、广西等地农民群众都已积极着手造林。江西省今年计划造林一百六十多万亩，其中以杉、松等用材林为主。该省农民在“植树造林，支援国家工业建设”口号的鼓舞下，造林劳动热情空前高涨。立春（二月四日）后，成千上万的农民携带着树苗、种籽上山植树。湖南省在醴陵、望城、攸县等地的造林试点工作，也已全面展开。湘潭县一区的农民正为“绿化毛主席故乡”而积极造林。长江下游的江苏省，今年计划造林二十多万亩，现在春季造林也已开始。珠江上游的广西省，今年计划造林一百二十万亩、育苗四千六百亩。柳州林场到一月底已完成了一百多万株的植树计划。平乐县一个月内就造林六万多株。福建省今年计划营造杉、松、桉等用材林和薪炭林七十万亩。现在全省三十六个公营苗圃和农民群众自育苗圃，已培育了两亿零四十多万株马尾松、栓皮栎等茁壮树苗，供应各地栽种。地处亚热带的海南岛，农民也正在大力栽植椰子树和剑麻，两者都是国内稀有的重要工业原料。
    今年长江中下游和珠江、闽江流域广大地区在春季造林前，都作了充分的准备工作。中南区去年就抽派干部调查了宜林地八百二十多万亩，并根据“造什么林，育什么苗；造多少林，育多少苗；什么地方造林，什么地方育苗”的原则，培育了三十多亿株苗木，采集了两千多吨树种，供春季造林之用。湖北省根据苗木分布的情况，确定以黄冈、孝感两个培育苗木较多的专区，作为今春造林的重点。广东省电白、梅县、兴宁、翁源等十八个县，都举办了林业训练班，有一千四百多个林业积极分子学习了林业政策和造林技术。　（新华社）
