Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: The system of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central People's Government overfulfilled the January production plan. The total output value exceeded the plan by 9.9%, which was 208.6% of the actual total output value in January last year. Among the 44 major products of the ministry, 33, including generators, control equipment, drilling machines, and ball bearings, have completed their plans.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's production plan, the First Ministry of Machine Building issued instructions on the production work for the first quarter of 1954 in November last year, requiring organizations at all levels to mobilize ideologically from top to bottom. On the basis of further strengthening plan management and promoting operational plans, they were asked to promptly prepare for production in the first quarter, strengthen technical management and equipment maintenance, as well as the political work of enterprises, in order to overcome the phenomenon that has existed in the past of being slack at the beginning of the year and tight at the end, failing to complete the state plan in a balanced manner. Most enterprises attached great importance to these instructions. While striving to overfulfill the annual production plan and the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy last year, they paid attention to the promotion of operational plans, maintained a certain amount of work-in-progress reserves, and promptly arranged for the production preparation work for the first quarter. For example, Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory ensured that the number of parts in stock at the end of the year and the number required by the assembly workshop exceeded the January planned task by one unit. Therefore, it reversed the phenomenon of using up the work-in-progress at the end of the year, which prevented timely supply, and guaranteed the overfulfillment of the January production plan. In order to supply the timber needed for January production in a timely manner, Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant sent people to fraternal factories in Dalian, Changxindian, and other places in advance to learn timber drying methods and kiln drying methods. They dug their own kilns to dry timber, which not only guaranteed the supply of timber, but also ensured the quality.

    第一机械工业部系统及时作好生产准备
    保证了一月份生产计划超额完成
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府第一机械工业部系统超额完成了一月份生产计划。生产总值超额百分之九点九，为去年一月份实际生产总值的百分之二百零八点六。该部四十四种主要产品中，已有发电机、控制设备、钻床、滚珠轴承等三十三种完成了计划。
    第一机械工业部为保证完成今年的生产计划，在去年十一月份就发出了关于一九五四年第一季度生产工作的指示，要求各级组织自上而下从思想上动员起来，在进一步加强计划管理和推行作业计划的基础上，及时作好第一季度的生产准备工作，加强技术管理和设备保养，以及企业的政治工作，以克服历年来存在的年初松、年末紧，不能均衡完成国家计划的现象。多数企业都十分重视这一指示，在争取超额完成去年全年生产计划和增产节约任务的同时，注意了作业计划的推行，保持了一定的在制品储备量，并及时地布置了第一季度的生产准备工作。如济南第一机床厂，做到了年底零件库存数量和装配车间需用数量比一月份计划任务多出一台，因而扭转了年末把在制品用光不能及时供应的现象，保证了一月份生产计划的超额完成。齐齐哈尔车辆厂为了及时供应一月份生产所需要的木材，事先派人到大连、长辛店等地兄弟工厂去学习木材干燥法和地窑烘烤法，自己挖地窑烘干木材，不仅保证了木材供应，而且保证了质量。
