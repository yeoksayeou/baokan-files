    Cultivating Technical Talent for China
    By our correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    "China has started its Five-Year Plan. You will have large automobile factories and large machinery factories. Study hard, and we will share all our experiences with you."
    "Everything we have, you will definitely have. Everything we know, you will definitely learn."
    Our Chinese interns studying at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory often hear such confident and sincere conversations from Soviet workers and technicians. This vividly demonstrates the deep friendship and enthusiasm of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. It is like a raised torch, burning in the hearts of the interns, encouraging them to study well so that they can participate well in the socialist construction of the motherland after completing their studies.
    The staff of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, on the one hand, selflessly participate in the design work of our automobile factories with the latest technology, and on the other hand, spare no effort to cultivate the first batch of technical talent for manufacturing automobiles in our country.
    Many of the Chinese interns who came to study at the Stalin Automobile Factory initially did not even recognize the Russian alphabet, and some did not have a solid foundation in technology or theory. Mastering a car manufacturing technique within a year was a heavy task for them. Therefore, Soviet comrades first paid attention to instilling their tenacious spirit of overcoming difficulties into the hearts of Chinese interns. A metallurgical engineer introduced his experience to an intern studying tool heat treatment, saying that in the early days of Soviet socialist construction, he had interned in the United States. At first, he didn't understand English, and the United States didn't allow him to take notes, but he didn't bow to difficulties and still succeeded in his studies. Now that China and the Soviet Union have such close friendship, what difficulties cannot be overcome? The traditional virtues of hard work and endurance of the Chinese working people, and the tenacious and fearless qualities of the Soviet people, guarantee that the Chinese interns at the Stalin Automobile Factory will smoothly seize the fortress of technology.
    The internship is proceeding while gradually breaking down language barriers. The factory leadership has formulated a detailed one-year internship plan for each intern based on their specific circumstances; assigned the most experienced engineers, technicians, and foremen to be responsible for training them individually; and invited the most knowledgeable engineers to systematically teach them technical theory. One intern studying forging initially did not know Russian and could not understand the diagrams. The foreman in charge of him had been working for twenty-five years. Once, he was studying forging dies in the technical department, but no matter how the foreman explained it, he didn't understand. The foreman took him to the workshop, found the die at the bottom of a pile of dies, and lifted it out with a crane. Looking at the die and listening to the explanation, he quickly understood. Soviet comrades are not afraid of any trouble and will continue to teach until the Chinese interns understand. They often urged the Chinese interns: "Don't be shy, ask if you don't understand." One intern accidentally made a defective product because the milling machine turned one more turn, and was very sad. Another intern broke the cutting tool on the lathe several times in a row, and was very anxious. The foreman comforted them, saying: "The problem has already occurred, there is no need to be sad or anxious, the important thing is to study the cause, draw improvement methods from the lessons, and learn from the shortcomings." Soviet comrades are so patient and kind in their guidance.
    In various workshops of the Stalin Automobile Factory, people often see: Soviet masters leading Chinese apprentices, gesturing and teaching around the machines, over and over again. These Soviet comrades are the most experienced and the busiest people. They often come to work early and take time out from their meals to give lectures to the Chinese interns. As soon as they see the interns coming, they put aside other things and solve the Chinese comrades' questions first, sometimes explaining for one or two hours. If the questions raised are beyond their expertise, they will definitely find someone more knowledgeable to answer them. They said: "Always be prepared to serve Chinese comrades," "Chinese comrades' affairs are the most important." This lofty internationalist feeling is overflowing in every Soviet comrade.
    Not only the Soviet comrades who are responsible for leading the interns are enthusiastic about passing on their experience, but also many people who have not undertaken this task are equally enthusiastic. An installation engineer guided an intern learning stamping to see the installation of a punch press, carefully explaining how to lay the foundation, find the level, and the installation steps, and gave revisions to his notes. This engineer sometimes skipped meals in order to explain during installation. He said to the intern: Although this is not within the scope of your internship, your new automobile factory will definitely install many punch presses in the future, and it will be useful to learn now if you have the opportunity.
    Soviet comrades are thinking very far ahead for the Chinese interns and for China. They pay great attention to training the Chinese interns to become talents who understand both technology and theory. One intern studying design had not studied the three courses of automobile theory, automobile calculation, and automobile structure; the factory specially hired three teachers for him. The factory gave the interns the convenience of attending classes at the factory's affiliated night school. For the newly arrived batch of technicians, the factory not only teaches them new operating techniques, but also teaches them courses such as drawing, machine tool structure, cutting principles, manufacturing methods, metal materials, and so on. Soviet comrades believe that Chinese comrades will also teach others after returning to China, so they must learn a set of theories.
    Whether Soviet workers or Soviet technicians, whether teaching technology or teaching theory, they all selflessly take out their skills and teach the latest experience to the Chinese interns. An intern studying on a boring machine became an assistant to the boring machine worker. This Soviet worker taught him the crystallization of his experience written in a booklet. As a result, he learned the basic operations of several types of boring machines in more than a month. An engineer told the intern studying heat treatment about the latest technology of steel's changes during heating and cooling, and led him to do experiments, explaining the results of the experiments theoretically.
    Technical personnel who serve the people should not only have new technologies, but also have good qualities. The Stalin Automobile Factory is a very good quality refining furnace for Chinese interns. The staff of the Stalin Automobile Factory are famous for being very economical. They educated the Chinese interns about their good qualities of thrift. One intern studying gauges wondered why the calipers used for gauges were not polished. The technician leading him said: "The things we make must be good and cheap; if the calipers are polished, they are prone to rust and labor-intensive, so phosphating to prevent rust is enough." A designer explained to an intern studying design the principle of using cheaper steel sheets instead of copper sheets, and using steel instead of alloys. He said: "In mass production, every bit of saving will bring great accumulation. The principle of saving is universal to both the Soviet Union and China." Once, this intern drew a diagram of a gearbox, only drawing one side. The designer asked him to draw the other side. After drawing it, he realized that the two sides did not match. Then the designer pointed out that inaccurate drawing would cause serious rework and waste. Soviet comrades often educate the Chinese interns: As technical personnel, they should do more hands-on work, go deep into practice, rely on practical experience, and technical personnel should learn from workers, because workers are the most familiar with practice. Many of the factory's technical personnel are workers who have continuously improved their technical level through continuous learning, and they often ask workers for advice, so they never deviate from reality. The interns saw that the factory's technical personnel always consulted experienced workers and jointly experimented when they had new suggestions. The Soviet technical personnel's close reliance on practice and their harmonious and coordinated style with the workers deeply infected the Chinese interns. The Stalin Automobile Factory also taught the Chinese interns the experience of production management, so that they realized that production management is an important art of leadership and not just clerical work.
    The Stalin Automobile Factory's administration and organization took meticulous care of the Chinese interns' lives, making them feel as if they were in their home country. They have always enjoyed preferential treatment in the factory's canteen and cinema. On rest days, people always organized visits and outings for them. Last year, on China's National Day, each workshop prepared gifts and greetings to congratulate the Chinese comrades who were interning in that workshop.
    The eight interns who have completed a year of study at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory will soon complete their studies and return to China. Hundreds of large numbers of interns will be sent to the Stalin Automobile Factory.
    Many Chinese interns are studying in many factories, mines and construction sites in the Soviet Union. Like the interns at the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, they have received great care from the Soviet Communist Party, government and people.
    Talent is an important factor in socialist construction, and the Soviet Union is cultivating technical talent for our socialist construction. From here, we also see the strong assistance of the Soviet Union to our country's construction.

    为中国培养技术人材
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    “中国开始五年计划了。你们将有大汽车厂、大机器厂。你们好好实习，我们要把所有的经验都告诉你们。”
    “全部我们所有的，你们都一定会有。全部我们所知道的，你们也一定会学会。”
    在莫斯科斯大林汽车制造厂学习的我国实习生，他们经常听到苏联工人和技术人员这种确信的、恳切的谈话。这生动地表现了苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊和热情。它像高举的火炬，燃烧着实习生们的心，鼓舞着他们很好地学习，以便学成后很好地参加祖国的社会主义建设。
    莫斯科斯大林汽车厂的职工，一方面大公无私地以最新技术参与我国汽车厂的设计工作，一方面不遗余力地为我国培养第一批制造汽车的技术人材。
    到斯大林汽车厂学习的我国实习生，初到工厂时，许多是连俄文字母也不认得，有的技术或理论的根基也不厚。要在一年内掌握一门制造汽车的技术，这对他们是沉重的任务。所以苏联同志首先注意把自己克服困难的坚韧精神灌输到我国实习生心里。一位冶金工程师对学习工具热处理的实习生介绍自己的经历说，在苏联社会主义建设初期，他曾到美国实习，起初不懂英文，而且美国不让写笔记，但是他不向困难低头，还是学成了；现在中国和苏联有这样亲密的友谊，还有什么困难不可以克服呢？中国劳动人民的刻苦耐劳的传统美德，和苏联人民的坚韧无畏的品质，保证着在斯大林汽车厂的我国实习生顺利地夺取着技术的堡垒。
    实习在逐渐打破语言阻隔的情况下进行着。工厂领导上根据每个实习生的具体情况，为他们制订了一年实习的周密计划；派了最有经验的工程师、技师、工长，一个带一个地负责培养，邀了最有学问的工程师有系统地教授他们技术理论。一位学锻工的实习生，初来时不会俄语，也看不懂图解。负责带他的是已经工作二十五年的工长。有一次，他在技术科研究锻模，无论工长怎样讲解，他总不懂。工长把他带到车间，从大堆模当中找到压在最底下的模，用吊车运出来。看着模听讲解，他很快就懂了。苏联同志就是这样不怕任何麻烦，一直要教到我国实习生懂得为止。他们经常叮咛我国实习生说：“不要不好意思，不懂就要问。”一位实习生让铣床多转了一转，出了废品，很难过。另一位实习生接连弄断了车床上的切刀，很着急。工长安慰他们说：“毛病已经产生了，不必难过或着急，重要的在于研究出原因，从教训中得出改进的办法，从缺点中学习。”苏联同志就是这样谆谆善诱的。
    在斯大林汽车厂各个车间，人们常常看到：苏联师傅带着中国徒弟，在机器旁边，比手画脚，一遍又一遍地教着。这些苏联同志都是最有经验的，也是最忙的人。他们每每提早上班，抽吃饭时间为我国实习生讲课。他们一看见实习生来了，就推开别的事情，先解决中国同志的疑问，有时讲解一两个钟头。遇着所提的问题超出他们的专长，一定代找更在行的人来解答。他们说：“随时准备好为中国同志服务”，“中国同志的事情是最重要的”。这种崇高的国际主义感情，洋溢在每个苏联同志身上。
    不只是负责带领实习生的苏联同志热心传授经验，而且不少没有承担这种任务的人也是同样的热心。一位安装工程师引导学习冲压的实习生看安装冲床，仔细地讲解怎样打地基、找水平面，讲解安装的步骤，给修改笔记。这位工程师为了就便在安装时讲解，有时不去吃饭。他对实习生说：虽然这不在你实习范围之内，但将来你们新的汽车厂一定也要安装许多冲床，现在有机会学了，将来是有用的。
    苏联同志替我国实习生、替我国想得很远。他们十分注意把我国实习生培养成既懂技术又懂理论的人材。有一位学设计的实习生，没有学过汽车理论、汽车计算、汽车结构三门课程；工厂专门为他请了三个教员。工厂给了实习生们到工厂内附设的夜间学院听课的方便。对新近来实习的一批技工，工厂不但教给他们新的操作技术，还要替他们上绘图、机床结构、切削原理、制造方法、金属原料等等课程。苏联同志认为，中国同志回国后还要教别人，所以一定要学会一套理论。
    不论苏联工人还是苏联技术人员，不论在教技术还是在教理论，都是无私地拿出自己的本领，把最新的经验教给我国的实习生。一位在镗床上学习的实习生当了镗床工人的助手。这位苏联工人把自己写在小册子上的经验结晶都教给他。结果他在一个多月中学会了几种式型镗床的基本操作。一位工程师把钢在加热和冷却时的变化的最新技术告诉学习热处理的实习生，并且领他做实验，从理论上讲解实验的结果。
    为人民服务的技术人员，不单要会新技术，而且要有好品质。斯大林汽车厂对于我国实习生是一座很好的品质冶炼炉。斯大林汽车厂职工是出名很会节约的。他们把自己的节约好品质教育了我国的实习生。一位学习量具的实习生奇怪量具用的卡规为什么不磨光。带他的技师说：“我们制造的东西，要好又要便宜；卡规磨光了，容易生锈又费工，所以加以防锈的磷化就可以了。”一位设计师对学习设计的实习生讲解了用较便宜的钢片代替铜片，用钢材代替合金的道理。他说：“在进行大量生产时，每一点节约都会带来很大的积累。节约原则，对苏联、对中国都是通用的。”这位实习生有一次绘制齿轮箱图样，只绘一面。设计师叫他再绘另一面。绘后他才发现两面合不拢来。于是设计师指出，绘图不缜密，会造成严重返工浪费的现象。苏联同志经常教育我国实习生：作为技术人员应该多动手，深入实际，依靠实际经验，技术人员要向工人学习，因为工人是最熟悉实际的。工厂的技术人员许多是经过不断学习提高了自己的技术水平的工人，他们又经常向工人请教，所以从来不脱离实际。实习生们看到，工厂的技术人员有了什么新建议，总是多找有经验的工人商量，共同试验。苏联技术人员这种密切地依靠实际、和工人融洽合拍的作风，深深地感染了我国实习生。斯大林汽车厂也叫我国实习生学习了生产管理的经验，使他们认识到生产管理是重要的领导艺术而不是什么庶务。
    斯大林汽车厂行政和组织无微不至地照顾我国实习生的生活，使他们觉得如同在祖国一样。他们到工厂的饭堂和电影院，一直享受着优先的待遇。休息天，总有人替他们组织参观和游玩。去年我国国庆，各车间都备了礼物和祝辞，向在那车间实习的中国同志致贺。
    在莫斯科斯大林汽车厂学习满一年的八名实习生，最近就要学成回国了。数以百计的大批实习生将要送到斯大林汽车厂来。
    许多我国实习生在苏联的许多厂矿工地学习着。他们像在莫斯科斯大林汽车制造厂的实习生一样，受到苏联共产党、政府和人民的莫大关怀。
    人材是社会主义建设的重要因素，苏联为我国培养着社会主义建设的技术人材。从这里我们也看到了苏联对我国建设的有力援助。
                      二月四日于莫斯科
