Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 20th: "Izvestia" published an editorial, reviewing the results of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference, saying: Before the Berlin Conference and during the Berlin Conference, the Soviet Union once again showed the world that the basic principle of its foreign policy is to consolidate peace and the security of all countries, and to further ease international tensions. The Soviet government previously believed, and still believes, that there is no international issue in dispute today that cannot be resolved by peaceful means. The Berlin Conference once again demonstrated that this view is correct, and proved that it is possible and necessary for major powers to cooperate to prevent the danger of another war and to consolidate peace.

"Izvestia" pointed out: The news that the foreign ministers decided to hold a meeting in Geneva has aroused widespread international reaction. This conference will be attended by representatives from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and representatives from directly relevant countries, in order to help finally resolve the Korean issue and discuss the issue of restoring peace in Indochina. The Geneva Conference will be conducive to the national unification of Korea and will satisfy the desire of the people of Indochina to achieve peace and national freedom. It should be particularly pointed out that the agreement reached at the conference powerfully proves an indisputable fact: it is impossible to solve pressing international issues without the participation of a major country like the People's Republic of China.

"Izvestia" then talked about the situation of the discussion of the German issue at the conference, saying: The Berlin Conference resolutely stated that the proposals put forward by the Soviet government in Berlin paved the way for resolving the German issue and for peace and security in Europe. Western countries rejected the Soviet proposals on the German issue and European security. However, these proposals have been understood and supported by the German people and the broad public in European countries, and are bound to receive even wider support.

"Izvestia" finally talked about the Austrian peace treaty issue, saying: This issue was not resolved at the Berlin Conference because it was blocked by the Western countries' plan to increase the danger of the resurgence of German militarism.

    “消息报”发表社论评柏林四国外长会议
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“消息报”发表社论，回顾柏林四国外长会议的结果说：在柏林会议以前和柏林会议举行期间，苏联再一次向全世界表明，它的外交政策的基本原则是要巩固和平与各国的安全，并进一步缓和国际紧张局势。苏联政府以前认为，现在仍然认为，今天没有一个在争执中的国际问题是不能用和平方法来解决的。柏林会议再一次说明这种观点是正确的，并证明大国有可能也有必要进行合作，来防止另一次战争的危险并巩固和平。
    “消息报”指出：外长们决定在日内瓦举行会议的消息，已经引起了广泛的国际反应。这个会议将由美国、法国、英国、苏联、中华人民共和国的代表以及直接有关的国家的代表参加，以期有助于最后解决朝鲜问题，并讨论恢复印度支那和平的问题。日内瓦会议将有利于朝鲜的国家统一，并将满足印度支那人民实现和平并取得民族自由的愿望。应该特别指出，在会议上达成的协议有力地证明了一个无可置辩的事实，就是：没有像中华人民共和国这样的一个大国的参加，要解决迫切的国际问题是不可能的。
    “消息报”接着谈到会议上讨论德国问题的情形说：柏林会议断然说明：苏联政府在柏林提出的建议，为解决德国问题、为欧洲的和平与安全铺平了道路。西方国家拒绝了苏联关于德国问题和欧洲安全的建议。但是这些建议已得到德国人民与欧洲国家广大公众的了解与支持，并且势必得到更广泛的拥护。
    “消息报”最后谈到对奥和约问题说：这个问题在柏林会议上没有得到解决，是因为受到了西方国家增加德国军国主义复辟危险的那个计划的阻挠。
