Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 13th: Special correspondent report: The U.S. side, in violation of international practice, has unreasonably delayed replying to the proposal by the Korean-Chinese side to resume talks on February 1st, and instead, is creating a tense atmosphere to cover up the U.S. side's insincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

    The U.S. military command in Korea, on the 9th, falsely accused the Korean-Chinese side of violating the armistice agreement by transporting military aircraft into North Korea. The American propaganda machine has been ordered to make a big fuss about this matter. The "New York Times" on the 10th, with affected seriousness, clamored that this was a "new development," saying that "a new view of the situation may be needed." On the same day, International News Service quoted so-called "Western military personnel" as saying that "spring is getting closer and closer, and the climate for combat is approaching." Washington also brought out the report of Alexander Smith, chairman of the Far East Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which was published not long ago, to create an atmosphere. Washington authorities were particularly interested in Smith's report, which stated that "the strengthening of the Manchurian Communist Air Force poses a danger of another Pearl Harbor incident at any time."

    In fact, this accusation by the U.S. side against the Korean-Chinese side is not new. As early as October 1953, the U.S. side raised the same "incident" and requested an investigation, and the investigation by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission proved that the U.S. side's accusations were completely unfounded.

    Washington has released information saying that "the Panmunjom talks will quietly become a relic of history." The purpose of the U.S. side in releasing these smokescreens is to cover up the U.S. side's unreasonable obstruction of the resumption of bilateral talks and to continue to create a tense situation in the Far East. It is not difficult for people to see clearly that the real source of "tension" is in Washington and not elsewhere.

### 美方制造紧张空气拖延双方会谈的恢复

    美方制造紧张空气拖延双方会谈的恢复
   【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者报道：美方破坏国际惯例，对朝中方面所提于二月一日恢复双方会谈的建议无理地拖延不复，反而大肆制造紧张空气，来掩饰美方不愿和平解决朝鲜问题的真意。
    朝鲜美军司令部九日诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定，把军用飞机运入北朝鲜。美国宣传机器已奉命就此事大做文章。“纽约时报”十日煞有介事地叫嚷这是“新的发展”，说什么“可能需要对局势有一个新的看法”。同一天，国际新闻社引所谓“西方军事人士”的话说，“春天愈来愈近而且作战的气候日渐迫近了”。华盛顿还把在不久以前发表的美国参议院外交委员会远东小组委员会主席亚历山大·史密斯的报告拿出来制造空气。史密斯在他的报告中所说的“满洲共产党空军的壮大造成任何时候都可能发生另一次珍珠港事件的危险”一点，特别使华盛顿当局感到兴趣。
    事实上，美方的这次对朝中方面的诬蔑并不新鲜。早在一九五三年十月间美方曾提出同样的“事件”要求调查，而中立国监察委员会的调查证明了美方的指控完全是无中生有。
    华盛顿已放出空气说“板门店会谈将静悄悄地成为历史上的陈迹”。美方施放这些烟幕的目的，就是想掩饰美方无理阻挠双方会谈的恢复，继续制造远东的紧张局势。人们不难清楚地看到，真正的“紧张”的来源是在华盛顿而不是在别的地方。
