Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The US government, disregarding the strong opposition of Asian countries' public opinion, has announced its preparation to grant military "aid" to Pakistan.

According to a USIS dispatch from Washington, US President Eisenhower stated on the 25th: "The Pakistani government has requested military assistance from the United States," and "I am willing to grant Pakistan's request based on the powers granted to me by Congress."

Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, after announcing that an agreement had been reached on the Turkish-Pakistani pact, publicly stated on the 22nd that the Pakistani government had requested military assistance from the United States.

Eisenhower said in his statement: "Turkey and Pakistan announced on February 19th that they intend to study ways to cooperate more closely in all aspects," and he said that the US government "welcomes this action."

Eisenhower made it clear in his statement that the "cooperation" negotiations between Turkey and Pakistan were in line with the US government's intention to organize aggressive blocs. He said: "As I pointed out in my report to Congress on June 30, 1953: We should strengthen the work of regional political, military, and economic integration."

Eisenhower said that the US government has "always been very concerned" about organizing aggressive blocs in the Middle East. He said that for this purpose, the US Congress had already "allocated a sum of money at the last session, ready to assist those countries in the region who wish to receive such assistance."

However, just as some countries in the past were forced to conduct "negotiations" with the United States, selling out their national sovereignty, when accepting US military "aid," Eisenhower, while announcing that he was "willing to grant Pakistan's request," claimed: "But (Pakistan) must (negotiate) the necessary mutual defense assistance agreement (with the United States)."

According to an AFP dispatch from Washington on the 25th: "A White House spokesman announced here today: A US military delegation will soon go to Pakistan to determine the country's military needs within the scope of US assistance."

    艾森豪威尔宣布给巴基斯坦军事“援助”
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国政府不顾亚洲各国舆论的强烈反对，宣布准备给予巴基斯坦以军事“援助”。
    据美国新闻处华盛顿消息，美国总统艾森豪威尔在二十五日发表声明说：“巴基斯坦政府已要求美国给予军事援助”，“我根据国会所授予的权力，愿意答应巴基斯坦的要求”。
    巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里在宣布土巴协定取得协议后，于二十二日就公开声明巴基斯坦政府已要求美国给予巴基斯坦以军事援助。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中说：“土耳其和巴基斯坦曾在二月十九日宣布，它们打算研究在各方面进行更为密切合作的方法”，他说，美国政府“对这一行动表示欢迎”。
    艾森豪威尔在声明中明白表示，土耳其和巴基斯坦的“合作”谈判，是和美国政府组织侵略集团的意旨相吻合的。他说：“我于一九五三年六月三十日在国会中所作的报告曾指出：我们应该加强区域性的政治、军事和经济整体化的工作”。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国政府对于在中东组织侵略集团“一直非常关心”。他说，为了这个目的，美国国会早“在上次会议上已拨出一笔款项，准备援助这个地区中希望得到这种援助”的那些国家。
    但是，正如以前一些国家在接受美国的军事“援助”时被迫和美国进行出卖自己国家主权的“谈判”一样，艾森豪威尔在和宣布“愿意答应巴基斯坦的要求”同时，声称：“但（巴基斯坦）必须（和美国）进行必要的联防援助协定谈判”。
    据法新社华盛顿二十五日消息说：“一位白宫发言人今天在这里宣布：一个美国军事代表团不久将赴巴基斯坦，以确定该国在美国援助范围内的军事需要”。
