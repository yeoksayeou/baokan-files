Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: The continuous victories of the Vietnamese and Laotian People's Armies on various battlefields in Indochina, and the fact that the French army is losing ground and suffering repeated defeats, have forced the U.S. news agencies to openly admit that the French "Navarre Plan" to strengthen the Indochina war, which the United States strongly supported, has completely failed.

The United Press recently reported on the Indochina war situation and admitted gloomily that "the 'Navarre Plan,' which was heavily publicized to reverse the trend of the Indochina war in eight months, has not taken effect. Officials privately believe that the reason for this unprecedented gathering of government officials in Indochina is that they know the plan is not working..." French Defense Minister Pleven, who was granted "full power" to salvage the crisis in Indochina, will discuss the "possible adjustments" to the "Navarre Plan" with U.S. Pacific Army Commander O'Daniel.

The so-called "Navarre Plan" was a military plan formulated by France in 1953 under the urging of the United States to expand the Indochina war of aggression. The aim was to increase the strength of the invading forces by transferring 20,000 French reinforcements from Europe and greatly expanding the puppet armies in Indochina, and to attempt to increase operational mobility and seize the initiative on the battlefield. To support France in implementing this plan, the U.S. government allocated an additional $385 million in "aid." However, the actual result of implementing this aggressive plan, as the United Press admits, is that "since the Navarre Plan began six months ago, the French army has not achieved any significant victories during the combat season"; recently, the French army has mainly been "fighting back" "instead of launching its own offensives."

The United Press said that France's hope to establish a mobile force "capable of crushing the growing threat of the Viet Minh" according to the plan has completely "failed." "The Viet Minh are now able to gather 30,000 to 40,000 troops to surround a single target such as Dien Bien Phu... At the same time, they can fight in several widely separated areas to tie down more than 50 elite French Union battalions—which has broken the plan to establish a defensive reserve. Now all the remaining mobile forces have been mostly transferred to defend the Laotian capital of Luang Prabang and the targets of the recent attacks by the vanguard of the Communist army."

The mobile forces that France painstakingly gathered have been forced to disperse again. The United Press said: "About twelve battalions of French troops are entrenched and besieged in Dien Bien Phu. In addition, twenty battalions of regular and local troops are distributed in the Savannakhet and Thakhek areas of central Laos to prevent the Communist army from cutting the north-south transportation line. The 'Atlantique' campaign on the southern coast of Annam (i.e., central Vietnam) also uses another twelve battalions. The new threat in the Annam highlands around Kontum is holding up another ten battalions."

Regarding the French army's complete loss of initiative and being beaten everywhere, Reuters also believed on the 6th that the Indochinese People's Army "has taken the initiative in a large-scale guessing game-like war" and "is intensifying pressure on the French Union forces throughout Indochina." "Almost all the French Union forces have been thrown into these battles" and have been "firmly tied down."

The Bao Dai puppet army, which constitutes the backbone of the "Navarre Plan," is demoralized and constantly surrendering to the Vietnamese People's Army, which has become something the French aggressors are at a loss to deal with. The United Press lists this as one of the military weaknesses "that are making it difficult for France." It admits that due to the surrender of the puppet army, many strongholds near Saigon in South Vietnam in the past two weeks "fell into the hands of the Vietnamese People's Army without much fighting or without any fighting at all." The United Press also mentioned the fact that last autumn, when the Vietnamese People's Army launched an attack on the lightly armed units of the Bao Dai puppet army in the Bui Chu area in the southern Red River Delta, a large number of puppet troops surrendered to the smaller People's Army units.

The U.S. government is particularly anxious about the morale of the Bao Dai puppet army. The United Press said that Washington is concerned about "how to improve the morale and combat spirit of the Vietnamese forces." U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford said to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 6th that "unless the morale of the Vietnamese forces can be revitalized, serious consequences may result." The large number of casualties among the invading forces on the battlefield also worries the U.S. authorities. The United Press said, "The Department of Defense is also uneasy about the increasing number of casualties suffered by the French and North African forces in Indochina in the fierce battles with the Communists near Luang Prabang and elsewhere recently."

Associated Press reporter Brines wrote that the development of the situation in Indochina has brought the "frustration, despair, and loss of confidence of the French, who have been fighting a seven-year war, to a climax." The United Press said, "Many authorities fear that even a minor setback for France will trigger a wave of calls for peace at any cost, and no government can resist this call, let alone the 'long-outdated' Laniel coalition government."

    美国大力支持下的法国“纳瓦尔计划”破产
    美国官方通讯社承认印度支那法军丧失主动处处挨打
    【新华社十三日讯】越南和寮国人民军队在印度支那各个战场上不断胜利和法国军队丢盔弃甲节节败退的事实，已使美国通讯社不得不公开承认由美国极力支持的法国加强印度支那战争的“纳瓦尔计划”完全破产。
    合众社最近在报道印度支那战局时阴沉地承认，“大肆宣传要在八个月内扭转印度支那战争趋势的‘纳瓦尔计划’并没有生效。官方人士私下认为，这次政府要人们空前的会集于印度支那的原因是：他们知道这个计划不济事……。”被授予“全权”到印度支那挽救危局的法国国防部长普利文，将和美国驻太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔讨论“纳瓦尔计划”的“可能调整”。
    所谓“纳瓦尔计划”，是一九五三年间法国在美国督促下制订的一个扩大印度支那侵略战争的军事计划，目的在通过从欧洲增调两万名法国援军和大量扩充印度支那的傀儡军队的办法来增加侵略军队的兵力，并企图增加作战的机动性，夺取战场上主动权。为了支援法国实行这个计划，美国政府曾增拨三亿八千五百万美元的“援款”。但是，这个侵略计划实行的实际结果，正如合众社所承认的，“自从纳瓦尔计划开始到今天六个月以来，法军在作战季节中并没有取得任何重大的胜利”；最近，法军主要是“还击”，“而不是自己发动攻势”。
    合众社说，法国根据计划企图建立一支“能击溃越盟正在发展的威胁”的机动部队的希望已完全“落空”。“越盟现在能够集结三万到四万名的兵力来包围一个单独的目标如奠边府，……同时，他们还能在几个相隔很远的地区进行战斗以牵制五十多个精锐的法兰西联邦营——这就打破了建立防御预备队的计划。现在所有剩下的机动部队已大部分调去保卫寮国王都琅勃剌邦以及最近共军先头部队进攻的目标。”
    法国处心积虑集结起来的机动部队，又已被迫分散。合众社说：“被包围的在奠边府掘壕据守的法军约有十二个营。另外有二十营正规军和地方部队正分布在寮国中部的沙湾拿吉和他曲地区以阻止共军切断南北交通线。在安南（即中越）海岸南部进行‘阿特朗特’战役也用上另外十二个营。昆嵩周围安南山地高原的新威胁牵制住另外十个营。”
    对于法军的完全丧失主动和处处挨打，路透社在六日也认为，印度支那的人民军队“已在规模庞大的猜谜游戏似的战争中取得了主动”，“在印度支那各处都对法兰西联邦军队加紧施加压力”。“几乎所有的法兰西联邦军队都已投入这些战斗中”，并已“被牢牢地牵住”。
    构成“纳瓦尔计划”脊骨的保大伪军，士气低落，不断向越南人民军投诚，这已成为法国侵略者感到一筹莫展的一件事。合众社把这列为“使法国为难”的军事弱点之一。它承认，由于伪军的投诚，过去两周中在南越西贡附近有许多据点“没有经过什么交锋或根本没有发生战斗”就落到越南人民军手里。合众社并提到去年秋天越南人民军在红河三角洲南部的裴朱地区对保大伪军轻装部队发动进攻时、人数众多的伪军向人数少的人民军部队投降的事实。
    对于保大伪军的士气，美国政府特别焦躁不安。合众社说，华盛顿很关心“怎样提高越南部队的士气和作战精神”。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福六日在参议院军事委员会上说，“除非越南部队的士气能够重新振作起来，否则就可能产生严重的后果。”战场上侵略军死伤的众多，也使美国当局忧虑，合众社说，“国防部对日前在琅勃剌邦附近和其他各地的法国和北非在印度支那的部队，和共产党进行的猛烈的战斗中的愈来愈多的死伤，也表示不安。”
    美联社记者布林斯写道，印度支那的局势的发展，已使进行了七年战争的法国人的“沮丧、绝望和失却信心的情绪发展到了顶点。”合众社说，“许多权威人士害怕即使法国遭受一次小挫折，那也将引起一片要求不惜任何代价取得和平的呼声，而这种呼声没有一个政府能抵挡得了，更不用说拉尼埃的‘寿命早已过期’的联合政府。”
