　　Building Farmland Water Conservancy to Guarantee Increased Production This Year

　　Retrieve 200,000 Jin of Cotton

　　Meishan Island is a small island southeast of Zhenhai County, Zhejiang. Here, more than 600 people are working hard to dredge rivers every day. In less than half a month, they completed more than 32,000 cubic meters of dredging work. Why are the farmers of Meishan Island so enthusiastic about dredging rivers? It turns out that they have a common goal: to retrieve 200,000 jin of cotton. In addition to more than 7,000 mu of paddy fields, Meishan Island also has more than 11,000 mu of cotton fields. Due to the failure to improve farmland water conservancy, it suffered from floods in 1951 and 1952, and about 200,000 jin of ginned cotton were lost in the two years. In 1953, thanks to the government's loan of 200 million yuan, three sluice gates were built, and the flood problem on the island was basically solved, and the yield of rice and cotton recovered to the level of 1950. Educated by this vivid fact, they all realized that they must further improve farmland water conservancy in order to continuously increase production and retrieve the 200,000 jin of cotton lost in the previous two years. (Ke Laiping, Jing Yixian)

　　Jointly Repairing Ponds, Sharing Water

　　Fuxing Township in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, is located in the hilly area on the north bank of Chaohu Lake, and paddy fields mainly rely on ponds and dams for irrigation. However, in the past, ponds and dams silted up every year and could not store water. Although repairs were carried out after liberation, due to decentralized management, there were too few people to repair large ponds, and there was no strength to expand small ponds. For several years, they only repaired ridges and fixed leaks, and always failed to quickly increase the amount of water stored. Therefore, every year, they have to rush to fight drought as soon as they transplant seedlings. From the collective water lifting to fight drought in 1951, the farmers of Fuxing Township experienced the benefits of organizing to share water together, so they implemented joint repair and management of many ponds and dams. They organized the scattered labor force of each pond to restore and expand the original ponds and dams, and those ponds and dams that could be jointly connected were jointly used for water and supported each other. Now, there are a total of twenty-nine organizations in Fuxing Township that jointly repair and manage ponds and dams, with more than eight hundred and ninety households participating. They are repairing various sizes of ponds and dams.

　　Doing the Math, Getting a Shock

　　In Zhangshi Township, Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, 80 percent of the land is terraced fields. Although some ponds and canals have been repaired in the past few years, they still cannot meet the needs of irrigation due to the continuous expansion of rice fields. Therefore, the vast number of farmers urgently demand to build water conservancy and expand production. However, when the water conservancy project started this year, some farmers in Zougang Village of the township were unwilling to participate and demanded to go out to engage in sideline occupations. The township cadres then calculated a detailed account for the farmers: a total of fifty people in the village went out to engage in sideline occupations, earning at most 1.5 million yuan a month, equivalent to 3,000 jin of grain; however, due to the failure to repair the ponds in 1952, 130 mu of land in the village suffered from drought in 1953, with each mu of rice yielding only 150 jin, compared with 450 jin per mu for the land that was not affected by drought, a total loss of 39,000 jin of grain, equivalent to the income of 50 people in the village engaging in sideline occupations for one year and one month. After such a calculation, the masses were shocked. The next day, more than fifty people from the whole village went to dig ponds. The Luo Wenxiang mutual aid group, which had already been engaged in brick and tile sideline occupations, also sent two people back to participate in digging ponds, and the women of the whole village also participated together, digging a new pond in seven days. Other projects are still under construction.

　　Turning Barren Beaches into Fertile Fields

　　The Bailong River flows through the foot of the mountain in Hanping Village, Wudu County, Gansu Province, creating a barren beach of about 1,400 mu. In order to turn this barren beach into fertile fields, the villagers found experienced farmers last spring to study the water flow of the Bailong River and reported their opinions to the higher-level government. In June, the Hanping Township People's Congress also discussed and decided to use the winter to build dikes and turn the barren beaches into fertile fields. In order to help the masses build dikes, the Wudu County People's Government loaned 14 million yuan for water conservancy, and the district also sent people to lead. When the villagers heard the news, some jumped up with joy. They said: The government has given us loans and sent people to help us. We should work hard to build the dikes well. When the project started, more than 160 people from the whole village participated, and everyone was in high spirits. The project was also built very quickly. In just a few days, more than 500 cubic meters of stone walls were built.

　　Expanding River Embankments, Storing Full Winter Water

　　Xinshi Village, Siping Township, Bishan County, Sichuan Province, is a small hilly area, relying entirely on storing winter water to solve irrigation problems. Although there is a small stream in the village and three old embankments, they can only irrigate more than 100 dan of fields due to disrepair. The old pond cannot store water due to poor soil quality. In addition, due to the winter drought this year, more than 450 dan of the village's more than 2,400 dan of fields cannot be guaranteed for planting. Many people have calculated the problem of expanding the river embankment, but because non-beneficiary households are unwilling to do it, beneficiary households are afraid of not being able to pay wages, those near the river are afraid of damaging the small spring crops, and the weather is gradually getting cold, so no one actively advocates it. After the propaganda of the general line, the enthusiasm of farmers to develop production has been significantly improved, and the issue of water conservancy construction has aroused discussion. The working comrades also helped them solve the problems of evaluating work points and burdens, so everyone enthusiastically participated in the work of water conservancy construction, and the entire three-mile-long riverbed was repaired in eight days. The original embankment water cart enters the waterlogged paddy fields and can seep more than 100 dan of fields. The expanded embankment can store 9,000 cubic meters of water and seep more than 500 dan of fields. There are also three ponds and embankments being repaired. In this way, not only can the more than 450 dan of two-season fields that were originally not guaranteed be fully guaranteed, but also more than 1,000 dan of winter water fields can be planted for two seasons. (Zhou Defen, et al.)

　　Starting Early Has Many Benefits

　　The Lianhe, Tuanjie, and Gonghe aqueducts in Babu Township, Ya'an County, Xikang Province, can irrigate more than two-thirds of the fields in the township. These aqueducts were all built with government loans in 1952, but because the bottom of the aqueducts was not firmly built during construction, and they were not well managed and maintained afterward, all the aqueducts had collapses, gaps, and blockages by sand and stones. When the issue of repairing the aqueducts in winter was raised, many people thought: Repairing the aqueducts is a matter for February and March (lunar calendar), why bother now? The cadres used the examples of some fields in the township that had already begun to dry up at that time to explain that if the aqueducts were not repaired earlier, more fields would be damaged by drought in January and February, affecting production. If they can be repaired earlier, more grain will be produced, and it will also avoid conflicts with spring plowing and production in February and March. After such a calculation, everyone realized that there were only benefits and no disadvantages to starting early to repair the aqueducts, so they began to repair the Gonghe aqueduct first. During the repair of the aqueduct, each group and section also proposed challenges and competitions for repairing well and repairing quickly. The enthusiasm of more than 100 farmers in repairing the aqueduct continued to increase, and the entire twelve-mile-long Gonghe aqueduct was quickly repaired. The aqueduct water was also timely diverted to irrigate the fields in Babu and Shigang villages. Now they are also starting to repair the Lianhe and Tuanjie aqueducts. After the aqueducts are repaired, they also plan to study management, maintenance, and water use issues.

　　Building Check Dams to Conserve Water and Soil

　　In order to conserve soil and water loss, Wuhua County, Guangdong Province, built more than 3,900 check dam projects in the upper reaches of the Han River last year, strengthening the foundation of soil and water conservation in the 20-square-kilometer experimental area of the original Wubie River system, and carrying out key demonstration and promotion to the Xinqiao River, Lianxi River and other basins. At the end of May, a mountain flood broke out in the upper reaches of the Han River, and the water level of the Wuhua River was as high as 2.5 meters, but the water levels of the Wubie River, Lianxi River, etc. were significantly reduced. In Yuankeng, 95 mu of farmland have been converted from single-season rice to double-season rice after the construction of check dams, and the water source was still very sufficient during the severe drought in August. This year, Wuhua County will also add and build more than 1,900 various check dam projects. In November last year, a soil and water conservation training class was opened, training more than 40 peasant activists with the equivalent of primary school graduation level, enabling them to carry out simple technical guidance work in the project. Many of these projects have already started one after another. (Xu Yanshou)

    兴修农田水利保证今年增产
      把二十万斤棉花找回来
    梅山岛是浙江镇海县东南边的一个小岛。在这里，每天都有六百多人紧张地进行掏河。不到半个月的时间就完成了三万二千多公方的挖泥工程。梅山岛农民掏河的劲头为什么这样大呢？原来他们有一个共同的奋斗目标：把二十万斤棉花找回来。梅山岛上除了七千多亩水稻田外，还有一万一千多亩棉花地。由于农田水利没搞好，一九五一年和一九五二年连遭水灾，两年中就被水灾卷去了约二十万斤皮棉。一九五三年，由于人民政府贷款二亿元，兴修了三座闸，全岛水患问题已基本解决，稻、棉产量都恢复了一九五○年水平。他们在这一活生生的事实教育下，都认识到必须进一步修好农田水利，才能使产量不断提高，并把前两年损失的二十万斤棉花找回来。（柯来萍荆翼宪）
    联合修塘，共同使水
    安徽巢县的复兴乡，位于巢湖北岸的丘陵地带，水田主要靠塘坝灌溉。可是过去塘坝年年淤浅，不能蓄水。解放后虽然进行整修，但因分散经营，人少修不起大塘，就是扩大小塘也没有力量，几年来只是修修埂、整整漏子，始终不能很快地增加蓄水量。因此，年年都是插下秧就要忙着抗旱。复兴乡农民从一九五一年集体车水抗旱中，体验到组织起来共同使水的好处，便把很多塘坝实行联合修管。他们把各塘分散的劳动力组织起来，恢复和扩大原有的塘坝，把有条件联合起来的塘坝，就联合起来共同使水，互相支援。现在，复兴乡联合修管塘坝的组织共有二十九个，参加的农民有八百九十多户。他们正在修理各种大小塘坝。
    算算账，吃一惊
    江西永新县樟石乡有百分之八十是梯田，几年来虽然修了一些塘、圳，但由于水稻田不断扩大，仍不能满足灌溉需要。因此，广大农民迫切要求兴修水利，扩大生产。但在今年水利工程开始时，该乡邹冈村有一部分农民不愿参加，要求出外搞副业。乡干部便替农民算了一笔细账：全村共有五十人出外搞副业，一个月顶多收入一百五十万元，折谷三千斤；可是全村由于一九五二年没修好水塘，一九五三年就有一百三十亩田受旱，每亩谷子只收一百五十斤，和未受旱的田每亩产四百五十斤相比，共损失谷子三万九千斤，抵上全村五十人搞副业一年零一个月的收入。经过这样一算，群众大吃一惊。第二天全村就出动五十多个人去挖塘。已经出外搞砖瓦副业的罗文祥互助组，也抽两人先回来参加挖塘，全村妇女也一齐参加，在七天内就挖好一口新塘。其他工程还正在修建中。
      把荒滩变成良田
    白龙江流过甘肃武都县汉坪村的山脚下，造成一片约一千四百多亩的荒滩。村里农民为了把这片荒滩变成良田，去年春天就找有经验的农民研究了白龙江的水流情况，并向上级政府反映了意见。六月间，汉坪乡人民代表会议也讨论决定：利用冬季修筑堤坝，变荒滩为良田。武都县人民政府为了帮助群众修堤，贷给了水利款一千四百万元，区里也派人去领导。村上农民听到这个消息，有的高兴得跳了起来。他们说：政府给我们贷款，又派人帮助，我们应当努力修好堤。工程开始时，全村参加的一百六十多人，大家情绪都很高，工程修筑得也很快，几天工夫就筑起了五百多立方公尺石墙。
    扩修河埝，蓄满冬水
    四川璧山县四平乡新四村是一片小丘陵地带，全靠蓄冬水解决灌溉问题。村内虽有小溪一条，旧埝三座，但因年久失修，仅能灌田一百多挑，旧塘一口，因土质差不能蓄水。又加今年冬旱，因而全村两千四百多挑田中就有四百五十多挑不能保证栽插。扩修河埝的问题很多人都盘算过，但因为非受益户不愿干，受益户怕拿不出工资，靠河边的又怕把小春作物搞坏了，而且天气又渐渐寒冷，所以就没有人积极提倡。宣传总路线以后，农民发展生产的积极性有显著提高，对兴修水利问题便引起讨论，工作同志又帮助他们解决了评工记分和负担等问题，于是大家便踊跃参加兴修水利工程的工作，八天就把三里多长的河床全部修好。原有埝水车入囤水田，可渗田一百多挑，扩修后的埝能蓄水九千立方公尺、渗田五百多挑。正在修补的塘、埝还有三个。这样，不但使原来没有保证的四百五十多挑两季田完全有保证，还可使一千多挑冬水田也能栽种两季。（周德芬等）
      早点动手好处多
    西康省雅安县八步乡的联合、团结、共和三条水堰，能灌溉全乡三分之二以上的田地。这几条堰都是一九五二年经人民政府贷款修起来的，但因修时没把堰底修牢，以后又没有很好地管理护养，所以几条堰都有垮塌、缺口和被沙石阻塞的现象。当提出利用冬季修堰问题时，很多人认为：修堰是二、三月（指旧历）的事情，现在何必忙呢？干部便拿当时该乡有些田已经开始干旱的实例，说明如果不早点把堰修好，正、二月间还会有更多的田被干坏，影响生产。若能早点修好，就会多打好多粮食，也免得到二、三月时和春耕生产矛盾。这样一算，大家才认识到早点动手修堰只有好处没有坏处，于是便开始先整修共和堰。修堰中，各组、段又提出修得好、修得快的挑战竞赛，一百多个农民修堰的劲头都不断增涨，很快就把十二里长的共和堰全部修好。并及时把堰水引去灌溉了八步、石缸两村的田，现在又动工修联合、团结两条堰，堰修完后，还准备研究管理护养和用水问题。
    修谷坊保持水土
    广东省五华县为了保持水土流失，去年在韩江上游兴建了各种谷坊工程三千九百多座，加强了原乌陂河水系二十平方公里实验区水土保持的基础，并向新桥河、练溪河等流域进行重点示范推广。五月底，韩江上游山洪暴发，五华河水位高达二公尺半，但乌陂河、练溪河等水位却显著降低，元坑有九十五亩农田在修建谷坊后，已由种单糙改为种双糙，而且在八月旱情严重时，水源仍很充足。今年，五华县还要加建及新建各种谷坊工程一千九百多座。去年十一月间，开办了水土保持训练班，训练了相当于小学毕业程度的农民积极分子四十多人，使他们在工程中进行简单的技术指导工作。这些工程很多都已先后开工。（徐衍绶）
