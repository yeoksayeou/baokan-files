Xinhua News Agency, February 15th, New York dispatch: According to figures announced earlier this month by the US Federal Reserve Board, the industrial production index for December 1953 was 127 (with the average for 1947-49 as 100), a decrease of 4.7% compared to December 1952, and a decrease of 7% compared to July 1953. The bureau's report stated that the production decline was mainly due to the contraction of basic metal industries, electrical machinery industries, and the textile industry. Coal mining, automobiles, papermaking, and household goods industries also experienced production declines. The bureau estimates that the industrial production index for January this year will further decline.

According to a report from the Associated Press, the steel industry has been idle for an average of about one-fourth of each week since the beginning of this year, and January production has fallen to the lowest level since the steel strike in 1952. "The Wall Street Journal" reported that at the end of January, many steel plants were operating at only 70% capacity, and some plants were operating at only half capacity. Another Associated Press report pointed out that large-scale construction contracts in January this year decreased by 49% compared to the same period last year, falling to the lowest level for January of any year since 1949. The situation in the automobile industry is equally dire. According to an Associated Press report on the 7th, Chevrolet, Studebaker, Nash, and Chrysler's DeSoto plant only operated for four days in the first week of this month. Hudson has completely ceased production, and Packard is also preparing to cease production. In the coal mining industry, according to an Associated Press report on the 6th, bituminous coal production in the week ending February 6th decreased by approximately 500,000 tons compared to a year ago.

Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, Washington dispatch: According to the Associated Press, Edwin George, director of the economics department of Dun & Bradstreet, who testified before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Eisenhower's economic message on the 8th, told Congress that all signs indicate that the United States has entered a period of national production decline. He estimates that the annual rate of national production in the last quarter of this year will be $21 billion less than in the second quarter of 1953. He said this is a slow recession.

Another economic expert who testified at the meeting, Stanley H. Ruttenberg, research director of the CIO, criticized the Eisenhower administration's tax plan for "dealing with" the economic crisis. He said that 90% of the tax cuts in the plan currently being discussed by the House of Representatives will flow into the hands of capitalists or "wealthy shareholders" and will not increase people's purchasing power.

Xinhua News Agency, February 15th, London dispatch: In 1953, exports of electrical equipment and automobiles, which occupy an important position in British exports, decreased compared to 1952.

According to the "Financial Times," the electrical products industry, as Britain's second-largest export group, saw its total export value in 1953 decrease by 10 million pounds compared to 1952. The newspaper said, "This is the first decline since the war, and it is expected to continue." The report also pointed out that exports of major electrical equipment, which account for one-third of total exports, rely on orders received two or three years ago, but since that time, the market situation has undergone fundamental changes, and British capital goods are now encountering "terrible challenges" in overseas markets. Due to competition from Western Europe, "fewer and fewer orders are being received, and prices are getting lower and lower" for power generation machinery and auxiliary equipment. Currently, a range of electrical equipment, from light bulbs to transformers, are encountering "sharp competition" in foreign markets. For example, in the field of transformers, Britain is facing particularly fierce competition from Sweden and Switzerland in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, while in markets such as the Middle East, Spain, Portugal, and India, West German competition is also very sharp.

In 1953, British automobile exports also decreased. According to Cook, chairman of the Motor Manufacturers and Traders Association, the total number of British automobile exports in 1953 was 413,000, a decrease of 25,000 compared to 1952. He said that in view of the increasing competition, it will take the greatest effort not only to expand but even to maintain the current level of exports in the next twelve months.

    美国钢铁工业和汽车工业被迫降低开工率
    英国电气器材和汽车的出口遇到了“尖锐的竞争”
    【新华社十五日讯】纽约消息：根据美国联邦储备局本月初宣布的数字，一九五三年十二月的工矿业生产指数为一百二十七（以一九四七—四九年的平均数为一百），即比一九五二年十二月下降了百分之四·七，比一九五三年七月份下降了百分之七。该局的报告说，生产下降主要是由于基本金属工业、电力机器工业和纺织业的萎缩。采煤、汽车、造纸以及家庭用品等工业生产也都下降。该局估计，今年一月份的工矿业生产指数还会进一步下降。
    据美联社的消息说，钢铁工业自今年以来平均每周约有四分之一没有开工，一月份的生产已下降至一九五二年钢铁大罢工以来的最低纪录。“华尔街日报”报道，在一月底时，许多钢铁工厂开工率只有百分之七十，某些工厂只开动一半。美联社的另外一条消息指出，大型建筑合同在今年一月份比去年同期减少了百分之四十九，下降至一九四九年以来每年一月份的最低水平。汽车工业的情况也同样糟糕。据美联社七日消息说，雪佛莱汽车公司，史蒂倍克汽车公司，纳希汽车公司与克莱斯勒汽车公司的迪索图厂在本月第一周只开工四天，赫德逊汽车公司已完全停止了生产，派克公司也正在准备停止生产。在煤矿业方面，据美联社六日消息说，在到二月六日为止的一周内，烟煤生产已比一年前减少了约五十万吨。
    【新华社十二日讯】华盛顿消息：据美联社消息说，出席国会参众两院经济委员会就艾森豪威尔的经济咨文作证的邓—布列德斯特里统计所经济部主任埃德温·乔治八日对国会说：各种迹象显示，美国已经进入全国生产衰落的时期。他估计，今年最后一季的全国生产量年率将比一九五三年第二季减少二百一十亿美元。他说这是一种缓慢的衰退。
    另一位出席会议作证的经济专家、产联研究主任斯坦莱·赫·鲁顿伯格则抨击艾森豪威尔政府“对付”经济危机的捐税计划。他说，众议院目前讨论的计划要削减的捐税，将有百分之九十流入资本家或“富有股东”手中，并不能提高人民购买力。
    【新华社十五日讯】伦敦消息：一九五三年，在英国输出中占重要地位的电气器材和汽车的出口都比一九五二年减少。
    据“金融时报”报道，作为英国第二个最大的出口集团的电气制品工业，一九五三年的出口总值比一九五二年减少了一千万英镑。该报说：“这是战后第一次下降，预期还要继续下降。”该报还指出，占总出口三分之一的主要电气装备的出口是依靠两三年前接到的订货，但从那个时候以来，市场情况已发生了基本变化，英国的资本货物现在在海外市场上遇到了“可怕的挑战”。由于受到西欧的竞争，发电机器和辅助装备的“订货越来越少，价格越来越低”。目前，从灯泡到变压器等一系列电气器材在国外市场上都遇到“尖锐的竞争”。例如在变压器方面，在加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和南非，英国受到瑞典和瑞士的特别激烈的竞争，而在中东、西班牙、葡萄牙和印度等市场上，西德的竞争也非常尖锐。
    一九五三年，英国汽车出口也有所减少。据汽车制造商经售商协会主席库克宣布，一九五三年英国汽车出口总数为四十一万三千辆，比一九五二年减少了二万五千辆。他说，鉴于竞争日趋剧烈，在今后十二个月内，不要说扩大，就是保持目前的出口水平也要尽最大的努力才行。
