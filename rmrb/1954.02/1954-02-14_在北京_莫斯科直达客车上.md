    On the Beijing-Moscow Direct Passenger Train
    He Jiabao
    In a compartment on the first Beijing-Moscow direct passenger train, four Chinese travelers were sitting on two large sofas, chatting. Although the train had been running for more than an hour, they were still enthusiastically discussing the grand occasion of the opening ceremony held at the Beijing Railway Station. As they were chatting lively, the music on the radio stopped and switched to another program: "Central People's Broadcasting Station... now reporting the news... The direct passenger train between Beijing and Moscow departed from the Beijing Railway Station, decorated with lanterns and streamers, at 6:05 this afternoon..." The conversation stopped, they held their breath, listening while signaling each other with smiling corners of their mouths.
    The train is so comfortable and beautiful, with sky-blue walls, maroon carpets, milky-white silk tablecloths, apricot-yellow lampshades, emerald-green velvet curtains; the mercury column on the thermometer in the corridor points to 20 degrees Celsius; each car has an independent heating system that can adjust the temperature at any time; when exchanging air, in order not to suddenly lower the temperature, the electric ventilator can also send in hot air. These vehicles are the latest products of the Yegorov factories in Leningrad and other factories.
    All five passenger cars are single-room bedrooms. Slight laughter came from the front room, two Soviet women were teasing a chubby little girl; in one room, Chinese passengers were playing poker; in another room, a passenger turned down the sound from the radio and quietly lay reclining on a soft sofa reading a book; on the engraved frosted glass window of the washroom, the shadows of people washing up flickered. Soviet train attendants tidied up the bedding, gesticulating, and used simple Chinese words they had just learned to chat cordially with Chinese passengers. Among the passengers were Chinese students going to the Soviet Union, Soviet experts who had helped with China's construction, and envoys promoting economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries;... There was only one Chinese translator on the train. The small number of translators did not prevent passengers from expressing their feelings to each other. "Mao Zedong" and "Malenkov" were their common language; "Moscow-Beijing," a song people were familiar with, made them smile at each other as soon as they heard it here.
    The green signal light welcomed the train into the first stop - Tianjin Station. The crowd on the platform cheered at the people on this brand-new green train. Two girls squeezed out of the crowd and ran to Comrade Balagirev, the Soviet train captain, to offer flowers. Balagirev, solemn in attitude and kind to people, wearing a neat Soviet railway uniform and silver-white second lieutenant epaulettes, accepted the bouquet on behalf of the Soviet crew and shook hands with people affectionately. Sixteen of the eighteen Soviet crew members had participated in the Soviet Patriotic War against German fascism, and Balagirev was one of them; he had been wounded three times in the defense of Leningrad; he had received one medal and one award. After the victory, he participated in peaceful labor and went to work on the railway. The Soviet crew members said that they felt honored to serve on this friendship train.
    The train continues to move forward. A sumptuous dinner was prepared for the passengers in the beautiful dining car. There was roast chicken, tomato cold fish, mixed fresh cucumber and tomatoes, and also Chinese famous dishes that foreign friends love to eat, such as braised sea cucumber and spicy chicken. Passengers drank brandy, wine and Russian wine freely. In the dining car, I met Li Wenyuan, the Chinese passenger train captain, who, together with the Chinese dining car service staff, baggage handlers, doctors and translators, assisted the Soviet crew members on the way from Beijing to Manchuria. He told me how Comrade Balagirev, the Soviet train captain, kindly told him how to work and how to seize free time to rest. In front of the dining car was a baggage car. Here I met the Chinese baggage handlers Wang Yuying and Zhang Fengzhu. They happily told me how to use the mechanical equipment in the baggage car. In this baggage car, things weighing two thousand kilograms can be easily placed in the right position.
    The passengers slept very late. Late at night, the train continued to move forward, passing through Shanhaiguan.
    Waking up, the train was already running on the beautiful Liaodong Plain. After the Soviet train attendants prepared tea, they were using an electric vacuum cleaner to "sweep the floor."
    Dense chimneys, countless buildings and buildings with scaffolding appeared on both sides of the railway. Shenyang arrived. The train stopped in the applause and music of the welcoming crowd. Among the well-wishers, there were representatives of the staff of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, who were presenting a flag to a Soviet expert, Danilichev, who was returning home. The flag read:
    "Long live the eternal friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union!" The train slowly started in the cheers. The departing staff representatives ran after the train, waving; Danilichev also stood at the car door and waved goodbye frequently.
    After a day of travel, the passengers became more familiar with each other. I met a student going to Moscow. His name is Si Youdong. He studied at the Moscow Geological Institute for two years. For the needs of the construction of the motherland, he was transferred back to China last summer; now that the task is completed, he is going to the Soviet Union to continue his studies. He told me that he first went to the Soviet Union on August 13, 1951. At that time, hundreds of classmates who went with him had to wait for and change trains at the Manchurian border. He also told me that Chinese students who go to study in the Soviet Union generally encounter the "Russian Mountain" and the "Philosophy Mountain" first. If you don't learn Russian well, it's like you can't walk; if you don't learn Marxist-Leninist philosophy well, you can't study. Even so, inspired by the construction of the motherland, the students are winning battles in their studies, and many people often maintain a score of five.
    After Shenyang, this section of double-track railway was the original Chinese Changchun Railway. This is a railway that grew up two years ago with the help of more than 1,000 Soviet experts sent by Stalin. Along the way, we saw trains like long snakes, full of wood, coal and machinery, heading to all parts of the motherland.
    At 7:46 in the evening, the train arrived in Harbin. The station was decorated with colorful lights and streamers. This is the location of the former Chinese Changchun Railway Administration. Railway workers who grew up with the help of Soviet experts lined up on the platform to welcome; passengers who were wearing new clothes to go home to celebrate the Spring Festival were also waving at the train. The train left Harbin Station on time at 8:11. More than a hundred hours later, it would bring the Chinese people's confidence and determination to build socialism, and the Chinese people's respect to Moscow.

    在北京—莫斯科直达客车上
    贺家宝
    在第一列北京—莫斯科直达旅客列车上的一个房间里，四位中国旅客正坐在两个大沙发上谈天。虽然列车已经开出一个多钟头了，但他们仍然兴致很浓地谈论着在北京车站举行的通车典礼的盛况。正谈得热闹，收音机里的音乐停止了，换了另外一个节目：“中央人民广播电台……现在报告新闻……北京—莫斯科之间的直达旅客列车，今天下午六点零五分，开出了悬灯结彩的北京车站……”谈话停了下来，他们屏住气，一面听着，一面用微笑着的嘴角相互示意。
    列车是这样的舒适、美丽，天蓝色的墙壁，枣红色的地毯，乳白丝绸桌布，杏黄桌灯纱罩，翠绿色天鹅绒的窗帘，走廊里温度表上的水银柱，指着摄氏二十度；每辆车上都有可以随时调节温度的独立暖房；抽换空气的时候，为了不使温度骤然降低，电动的通风器还可以送进热风。这些车辆是列宁格勒叶果洛夫等工厂的最新产品。
    五节客车全是单间卧房。前面房里发出轻微的笑声，两个苏联妇女正在逗着一个白胖的小女孩玩；一个房间里，中国旅客们在打扑克；另外一个房间，一位旅客调低了收音机发出的声音，安静的斜躺在柔软的沙发上看书；洗脸室的刻花磨光玻璃窗上，闪动着人们洗漱的影子。苏联列车员整理好了卧具，比划着手势，用刚学会了的简单的中国话亲切地和中国旅客交谈。旅客中有到苏联去的我国留学生，有帮助过我国建设的苏联专家，有促进两国经济与文化交流的使者；……列车上只有一个中国翻译，翻译人员少，并不妨碍旅客相互表达自己的心意，“毛泽东”、“马林科夫”是他们的共同语言；“莫斯科—北京”这个人们听熟了的歌子，在这里他们一听到就相视而笑了。
    绿色信号灯把列车迎进了第一个停车站——天津车站。站台上的人群，向着这个崭新的绿色列车上的人们欢呼。人群里挤出两个姑娘，跑到苏联列车长巴拉吉列夫同志跟前献花。态度庄重、待人亲切的巴拉吉列夫，穿着整齐的苏联铁路制服，佩戴着银白色的少尉肩章，代表苏联乘务员接过花束，和人们亲热地握手。十八个苏联乘务员中，有十六个参加过苏联反对德国法西斯的卫国战争，巴拉吉列夫就是他们当中的一个；他在列宁格勒保卫战中负过三次伤；得过一次勋章、一次奖章。胜利以后，他参加了和平劳动，到铁路上工作。苏联的乘务员说：他们能为这个友谊的列车服务，感到很光荣。
    列车在继续前进。漂亮的餐车上为旅客们准备了丰盛的晚饭。有烤鸡、番茄冷鱼、拌鲜黄瓜西红柿，还有外国朋友们爱吃的中国名菜扒海参、辣子鸡。旅客们畅饮着白兰地、葡萄酒和俄斯克酒。在餐车上我遇到了中国旅客车长李文垣，他和中国的餐车服务人员、行李员、医生和翻译，在从北京到满洲里的路上协助苏联乘务员工作。他告诉我，苏联列车长巴拉吉列夫同志如何亲切的告诉他怎样工作，告诉他如何抓紧空闲时间休息。餐车前面是一辆行李车。在这里我遇到了中国行李员王玉营和张凤翥。他们高兴地把行李车上机械设备的使用方法告诉我。在这个行李车上，两千公斤重的东西可以不费劲地放到适当的位置。
    旅客睡得很迟。夜深了，列车经过山海关继续前进。
    一觉醒来，列车已奔驰在美丽的辽东平原上，苏联列车员预备好茶水以后，正在用电动的吸尘器
  “扫地”。
    铁道两旁出现了密密层层的大烟囱，数不清的楼房和搭着脚手架的建筑物。沈阳到了。列车在欢迎人群的掌声和乐声中停下来。在送行的人群中，有沈阳市风动工具工厂的职工代表们，正在向一位回国的苏联专家达尼里且夫献旗，锦旗上写着：
  “中苏两大民族的永恒友谊万岁！”列车在欢呼声中徐徐开动，送行的职工代表们一面跟着列车跑，一面挥手；达尼里且夫也站在车门上频频招手告别。
    一天的旅途生活，旅客们更熟悉起来了。我认识了一位到莫斯科去的留学生。他叫司幼东，在莫斯科地质学院学习过二年，为了祖国建设的需要，去年夏天他被调回国；任务完成了，现在又去苏联继续学习。他告诉我，他第一次去苏联是在一九五一年八月十三日。那时，他们同去的几百个同学到满洲里国境上还要等车、换车。他又告诉我，中国学生到苏联学习一般的说首先遇到“俄文大山”和“哲学大山”，学不好俄文等于不会走路；学不好马列主义的哲学就无法研究学问。虽然如此，在祖国建设的鼓舞下，同学们在学习上是打胜仗的，不少人经常保持着五分。
    过了沈阳，这段双轨铁路，就是原来的中长铁路了。这是两年前在斯大林派来的一千多位苏联专家帮助下，成长起来的一条铁路。一路上我们看到一列列长蛇似的列车，满载着木材、煤炭和机器驶向祖国各地。
    傍晚七点四十六分，列车到了哈尔滨。车站上结彩悬灯。这里是原中长铁路管理局所在地，在苏联专家帮助下成长起来的铁路职工们，在站台上列队欢迎；穿了新衣回家欢度春节的旅客们也在向着列车招手。列车八点十一分，准时开出了哈尔滨车站。一百多小时以后，它就把中国人民建设社会主义的信心和决心，和中国人民的敬意带到莫斯科。
