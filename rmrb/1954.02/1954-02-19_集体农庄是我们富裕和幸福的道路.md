    Collective Farms Are Our Path to Prosperity and Happiness
    Ni Mordovianu, Chairman of the "New Road" Collective Farm in Romania
    Romania today has nearly two thousand collective farms. The "New Road" Collective Farm in Cristin Village, Stalin Region, is one of them. This collective farm was organized in the spring of 1951 by twenty-eight poor and middle peasant households.
    In the first year after we organized, many things did not go very smoothly. The land that joined the collective farm was still cultivated in a backward way. Because the land was barren, the same crop could only be planted once every few years, and because we could not use advanced science and technology, we could not get rich harvests at that time. However, the collective farmers did not lose heart. In order to improve our farm, we solved the work of improving the soil step by step. Thanks to the help of the people's government, the regular guidance of agricultural technicians, the use of agricultural machinery, and the efforts of all the collective farmers, our production has developed steadily year by year, and our farm has become more consolidated. Now it has become a model for individual farmers.
    Agricultural Mechanization Increases Production
    The help of the machine tractor station is an important condition for us to improve production.
    Each agricultural team in our collective farm has signed a labor contract with the machine tractor station. Now our main tasks such as plowing, harrowing, cultivating, sowing, threshing, and harvesting have been mechanized. From an agricultural scientific point of view, machine farming does not harm the fertility of the soil, but greatly reduces the labor of cultivation and saves us a lot of manpower. Therefore, the farm can allocate some people to other production departments—such as orchards and subsidiary enterprises.
    The help of the machine tractor station has enabled us to obtain much more harvest than individual farmers in the same village. For example, the year before last, we planted autumn wheat on twenty-five hectares of land cultivated with tractors, and as a result, we harvested an average of 3,067 kilograms per hectare. However, in the same year, the land that was not cultivated mechanically only harvested an average of 1,385 kilograms per hectare, which was less than half of the average harvest of the land cultivated mechanically. Last year, individual farmers in the village harvested an average of only 1,200 kilograms of wheat per hectare, while in our collective farm, the average yield of wheat was 2,372 kilograms per hectare, rye averaged 2,140 kilograms, and vegetables averaged 2,666 kilograms.
    Last autumn, we completed the seeding preparation work for one hundred and thirty hectares in just over ten days, cultivating two hundred hectares and seeding eighty hectares of land. If these tasks were done by manual labor, it would take more time and reduce the output per work day.
    Development of Various Production Departments of the Collective Farm
    In addition to increasing production due to the mechanization of labor, the collective farm has greatly increased its income due to the simultaneous development of various agricultural production departments.
    In the first year of the organization of the Cristin Collective Farm, we attached great importance to the development of animal husbandry and the establishment of auxiliary production departments. Last year, the area of our farm planted with vegetables has been expanded to thirty-five hectares. In this way, collective farmers can improve the supply of vegetables to residents of nearby towns with more fresh vegetables, and thereby continuously increase their income. All the seedlings we need are cultivated in the greenhouse built in our first year.
    While developing horticulture, collective farmers also pay special attention to animal husbandry. Although in the first year, our collective farm had only one cow, today we can be proud of the continuous development of our animal husbandry. Now we have nine cows, fourteen calves, eighty-eight pigs and three hundred and forty-eight sheep. All these livestock were purchased and bred with loans from the government and the farm's own income.
    In order to ensure the continuous increase of livestock products, the collective farm has prepared feed and housing. The farmers used loans to build a livestock shed, and also built a brick house for 1,500 poultry.
    In order to increase income so as to increase the farm's public property and improve the living standards of each collective farmer, various auxiliary production departments have made great progress. The ironwork and wheel casting workshops equipped with all necessary tools, as well as the collective farm's mill, also earned high incomes every year.
    Continuous Improvement of Collective Farmers' Lives
    The annual grain harvest and the development of other production departments that can obtain high cash income have made the lives of collective farmers better and better. Last year, after our farm paid off its debts to the state and the machine tractor station, and stored seeds for the next year, each collective farmer could still be allocated three lei in cash, 3.3 kilograms of wheat, nearly half a kilogram of rye, 1.6 kilograms of barley, 4 kilograms of potatoes, as well as vegetables, sugar and other products for each work day. The abundance of individual income of collective farmers can be taken as an example by the farmer Victor Kesurete, who received 1,700 kilograms of wheat alone in the labor remuneration he received the year before last; in addition, there were 1,500 lei in cash, 15 kilograms of sugar, and many other products. This enabled him to improve his residence and improve his standard of living. Last year, he received another 964 kilograms of wheat, 125 kilograms of vegetables, 54 kilograms of rye and 120 kilograms of barley.
    There has also been a significant improvement in the cultural life of our collective farm. We have established an agricultural technology research group, where many farmers have learned a lot of scientific agricultural technology knowledge and exchanged their production experience. In addition, there is a dance team, a choir, and a drama group. Young men and women are developing their talents in these groups, and their activities have enlivened the life of the collective farm.
    Although the "New Road" Collective Farm is still in its initial stage, it is rapidly moving forward. This year, we will implement the scientific perennial grass rotation method in the fields, which will increase the fertility of the soil and increase the supply of livestock feed. Due to the gradual improvement of the farming techniques of the collective farmers, the continuous assistance of the government and the hard work of each collective farmer, our "New Road" Collective Farm will develop and prosper more year by year.

### 集体农庄是我们富裕和幸福的道路

    集体农庄是我们富裕和幸福的道路
    罗马尼亚“新路”集体农庄主席  尼·莫尔多维亚努
    罗马尼亚今天已有将近两千个集体农庄。斯大林区克利斯丁村里的“新路”集体农庄就是其中的一个。这个集体农庄是在一九五一年春天由二十八户贫农和中农组织起来的。
    在我们组织起来以后的第一年内，有许多事情是并不怎样顺利的。加入到集体农庄里来的土地，那时还要用落后的方式耕种。因为土地贫瘠，要隔几年才能播种一次同样的作物，又因为不能利用先进的科学技术，所以那时就得不到丰饶的收获。但是集体农民们并不灰心，为了改进自己的农庄，我们一步步地解决了改良土壤的工作。由于人民政权的帮助，农业技术人员们的经常指导、农业机械的利用和全体集体农民们的努力，我们的生产一年一年地稳步发展起来，我们的农庄更加巩固了。现在它已成为个体劳动农民们的一个榜样了。
    农业机械化提高了产量
    机器拖拉机站对我们的帮助，是我们能够提高生产的重要条件。
    我们集体农庄的各个农业小组都和机器拖拉机站签订了劳动合同。现在我们的犁地、耙地、耕地、播种、打谷和收割等主要劳动都已机械化了。从农业科学观点来看，机器耕作并不会损害土壤的肥沃，却大大地减轻了耕作的劳动并使我们节省了许多人力。因此农庄就可以抽出一部分人到别的生产部门——例如果园和附属企业去工作。
    机器拖拉机站的帮助，使得我们比同一个村子里的个体劳动农民得到了多得多的收获。例如，前年我们在用拖拉机耕种过的二十五公顷土地上种植了秋麦，结果，平均每公顷收获了三千零六十七公斤。但同年没有利用机械耕种的土地则平均每公顷只收获到一千三百八十五公斤，还不及利用机械耕作的土地的平均收获量的一半。去年，村里的个体劳动农民平均每公顷只收获一千二百公斤小麦，而在我们的集体农庄里，小麦平均每公顷收获到二千三百七十二公斤，裸麦平均二千一百四十公斤，蔬菜平均二千六百六十六公斤。
    去年秋季，我们只在短短十几天的时间内就完成了一百三十公顷的播种准备工作，耕了二百公顷和播种了八十公顷的土地。这些工作如果用人力劳动，就要花费更多的时间，并且还会减少每个劳动日的生产量。
    集体农庄各生产部门的发展
    除了因劳动机械化而增加生产之外，集体农庄还由于各个农业生产部门的同时发展，大大地增加了收入。
    在克利斯丁集体农庄组织起来的第一年内，我们就十分重视于饲畜业的发展和辅助生产部门的设立。去年，我们农庄种植蔬菜的园地已经扩大到三十五公顷。这样，集体农民们就能够以更多的新鲜蔬菜去改善对附近城镇居民的蔬菜供应，并借此不断地增加自己的收入。我们所需要的一切幼苗，都是在我们第一年内盖成的温室中培植起来的。
    在发展园艺的同时，集体农民们也特别重视牲畜的饲养业。虽然在第一年内，我们的集体农庄只有一头母牛，但在今天我们却已能够以牲畜业的不断发展而骄傲了。现在我们已经有九头母牛、十四头牛犊、八十八只猪和三百四十八只羊。所有这些牲畜都是用政府给我们的贷款和农庄本身的收入所购买和繁殖起来的。
    为了保证牲畜产品的不断增加。集体农庄已准备好了饲料和房舍。农民们曾利用贷款建筑了一个牲畜棚，还为一千五百只家禽建筑了一所砖房。
    为了增加收入以便增加农庄的公有财产和提高每个集体农民的生活水平，各辅助生产部门都有了很大的进展。拥有一切必要工具的铁工和车轮铸造车间以及集体农庄的磨坊，也每年都获得了高额的收入。
    集体农民生活不断改善
    每年的谷物收获和能够获得高额现金收入的其他生产部门的发展，使集体农民们的生活愈来愈好了。去年我们农庄偿清了对国家和机器拖拉机站所欠的债务，并存储了下一年的种籽以后，每个集体农民的每个劳动日还可以分配到现金三个列伊、三点三公斤的小麦、近半公斤的裸麦、一点六公斤大麦、四公斤马铃薯，以及蔬菜、糖和其他产品。集体农民个人收入的丰足情形可以拿农民维克多·克素雷特作为例子，他一个人在前年所得的劳动报酬，只小麦一项就有一千七百公斤；此外还有现金一千五百列伊、糖十五公斤和许多其他产品。这就使得他能够改进自己的住所和提高自己的生活水平。去年，他又获得了九百六十四公斤的小麦、一百二十五公斤的蔬菜、五十四公斤的裸麦和一百二十公斤大麦。
    我们集体农庄的文化生活也有了显著的改善。我们已成立了一个农业技术研究小组，许多农民都在那里学习到了不少科学的农业技术知识，并交流了他们的生产经验。此外，还有一个舞蹈队、一个合唱团和一个戏剧组，青年男女们都在这些团体中发挥着自己的天才，他们的活动活跃了集体农庄的生活。
    “新路”集体农庄现在虽然还处在开始的阶段，但它却正在迅速地向前进展着。今年，我们将在田里实行科学的多年生草木轮种法，它将增进土壤的肥沃，并将增加牲畜饲料的供应。由于集体农民们耕作技术的逐渐改进、政府的经常帮助和每个集体农民的努力工作，我们的“新路”集体农庄将一年比一年更加发展和繁荣起来。（附图片）
