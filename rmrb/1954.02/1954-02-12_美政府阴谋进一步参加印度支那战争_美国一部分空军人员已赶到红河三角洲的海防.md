    U.S. Government Plots Further Involvement in Indochina War
    Some U.S. Air Force Personnel Arrive at Haiphong in the Red River Delta
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 11th] The U.S. authorities are increasingly involving themselves in the Indochina War. The U.S. Far East Air Force Commander, Weyland, arrived in Indochina on the 7th. He will meet with the French Minister of National Defense, Pleven, who is already there, to discuss increasing U.S. "aid." Accompanying Weyland were 105 U.S. Air Force personnel transferred from Japan and the Philippines. This group of U.S. Air Force personnel has already arrived at the Haiphong air transport base in the Red River Delta. It is reported that at least another hundred U.S. Air Force personnel are to be sent. International News Service said that Weyland's activities in Indochina "strongly indicate" U.S. "concern" about the war and "suggest that the United States intends to provide personnel to strengthen its assistance to the French army in this war."
    At the same time, Washington has been brewing plans in recent days to further dispatch U.S. military forces to directly participate in the Indochina War. Many reports from Washington say that this is at the request of the French government. However, the French Foreign Ministry stated on the 9th that it "firmly denies" this, declaring that France has not made such a request. This exposes the truth behind Washington's behind-the-scenes activities: it is the U.S. side that is keen to participate in the war.
    The recent series of developments has caused alarm and dispute within the U.S. ruling group. The New York "Daily News" published an editorial on the 11th saying: "We have suffered greatly in Korea... If the United States directly participates in the Indochina War, the harm will outweigh the benefits." U.S. Democratic Senator Richard B. Russell accused the Republican government of sending air force personnel to Indochina as "a mistake." Another Democratic Senator, Stennis, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that these actions by the U.S. government are "fraught with the most terrible consequences" and are "frivolous actions on the most serious issues in the current situation." Many members of the U.S. Congress also oppose sending Air Force pilots to participate directly in the war and demanded the speedy recall of the U.S. military technicians who have already been sent.
    In this situation, U.S. President Eisenhower vaguely stated on the 10th that he was "keeping the United States from getting involved in a (Indochina) full-fledged war," but he declared that the United States would "do everything possible to support" the war of aggression against Indochina. According to the "New York World-Telegram and Sun," there is "strong American military pressure" in Washington demanding that the United States intervene in the Indochina War. The newspaper also said that U.S. Army Pacific Commander O'Daniel, who is about to be sent to Indochina to meet with French Minister of National Defense Pleven, is advising Washington to "seriously consider limited participation as a start." The U.S. "Newsweek" published on the 10th also revealed that the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff may be strongly advocating that the United States take the following steps: First, the Navy should intensify its blockade of Vietnamese ports; second, fighter-bombers should attack the supply lines of the Vietnamese People's Army; third, landing craft equipped with heavy weapons should be used to attack the hiding places of the Vietnamese People's Army; and fourth, a volunteer force composed of Asians - from Taiwan, the Philippines, and other countries - should be mobilized to support the French Federation forces.

### 美政府阴谋进一步参加印度支那战争  美国一部分空军人员已赶到红河三角洲的海防

    美政府阴谋进一步参加印度支那战争
    美国一部分空军人员已赶到红河三角洲的海防
    【新华社十一日讯】美国当局正一步紧一步地参加到印度支那战争中去。美国驻远东空军司令威兰已在七日赶到印度支那。他将和正在那里的法国国防部长普利文会谈，研究增加美国“援助”的问题。随威兰前去的有从日本和菲律宾等地调集的美国空军人员一百零五人。这批美国空军人员已经赶到在红河三角洲的海防空运基地。据悉：至少还有
  一百名美国空军人员要被继续派去。国际新闻社说：威兰这次赶到印度支那进行活动，“强烈显示出”美国对这个战争的“关切”，“说明美国有意为这个战争提供人员来加强它对法军的援助”。
    与此同时，最近几天华盛顿正酝酿着进一步派遣美国军事力量直接参加印度支那战争。从华盛顿传出的许多消息说，这是应法国政府的要求。但是，法国外交部已在九日表示“坚决否认”，声明法国并没有提出这项要求。这就揭穿了华盛顿的幕后活动的真相，原来热中于参战的是美国方面。
    最近以来一连串的事态的发展已在美国统治集团内部引起了惊慌和争吵。纽约的“每日新闻”在十一日发表社论说：“我们已在朝鲜大大吃了苦头……如果美国直接参加印度支那战争，害处将比益处大得多。”美国民主党参议员理查德·布·鲁塞尔指责共和党政府派遣空军人员到印度支那“是一个错误”。另一个民主党参议员、参院军事委员会委员史坦尼斯说：美国政府这些行动“充满着最可怕的后果”，是“在目前形势下对最严重的事情轻举妄动”。美国国会中还有许多议员也反对派遣空军驾驶员直接参战，并要求从速调回已经派出的美军技术人员。
    在这种情况下，美国总统艾森豪威尔在十日含糊其词地表示他正“使美国避免卷入到（印度支那的）全面战争中去”，但是他声言美国要“尽全力支持”侵略印度支那的战争。据“纽约世界电讯与太阳报”说：在华盛顿“有着‘强烈的美国军事压力’要求美国干涉印度支那战争”。该报并说，即将被派到印度支那去和法国国防部长普利文会谈的美国驻太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔，正在华盛顿建议“认真考虑以有限度地参加作为一个开端”。十日出版的美国“新闻周刊”也透露说：美国三军参谋长可能竭力主张美国采取的步骤是：一、以海军加紧对越南各港口的封锁；二、由战斗轰炸机攻击越南人民军的供应线；三、使用配备重武器的登陆艇来攻击越南人民军隐藏的地方；四、动员一个由亚洲人——来自台湾、菲律宾和其他国家——组成的志愿队来支援法兰西联邦部队。
