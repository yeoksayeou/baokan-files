Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 3rd: The 4th of February is the Tibetan New Year. On the eve of the festival, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni sent telegrams to Chairman Mao respectively to offer their congratulations.

        Dalai Lama's Congratulatory Telegram to the Great Leader Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:

    The Tibetan Water Dragon Year has passed, and the Wood Horse Year is approaching. As we welcome the New Year, we extend to you our heartfelt wishes for a吉祥如意 (good fortune and as you wish) New Year. In the past year, thanks to your correct leadership as the great leader of all nationalities and the increasing strength of the world's peace and democracy camp, the Korean armistice was achieved. This is a great victory and a tremendous achievement for the world's forces of peace and democracy. Under your wise leadership, the Tibetan people and all brotherly nationalities of the motherland have united closely, and the internal unity of the Tibetan people has also achieved new development and consolidation. Developing and building a new Tibet, and constructing the Kangzang Highway, are very important matters. With the special care of the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army in Tibet, who are not afraid of any hardship and actively provide assistance, great achievements have already been made. In the future, the Tibetan local government and the Tibetan people will certainly further assume their real responsibilities and actively participate in and support various construction works. Please rest assured.

        Panchen Erdeni's Congratulatory Telegram to the Respected Chairman Mao:

    On the occasion of the 1954 Tibetan New Year, I, on behalf of all the monks and laypeople of the Tashilhunpo Monastery, wish you good health.

    Under your wise leadership, the first year's task of the first Five-Year Plan of the new China has been successfully completed and great achievements have been made. This is a great and happy event that excites us immensely, and it powerfully encourages our confidence in building a new Tibet together with the People's Liberation Army in Tibet, and in striving for the further realization of the peaceful agreement.

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live the close unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities!

    Panchen Erdeni
