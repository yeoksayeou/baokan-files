Xinhua News Agency, February 26th—The agreement reached at the Berlin Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference regarding the convening of a conference of the five major powers and other relevant countries has been the focus of attention in international public opinion in the week since the conference concluded. This agreement from the Berlin meeting has been widely and enthusiastically welcomed.

    The "Indian Express" stated that the agreement "should be considered a significant gain." The "Hindustan Times" said: "As the Panmunjom negotiations regarding the convening of a Korean political conference, which had reached a deadlock, will resume in Geneva, the world will be relieved of its worries." The "Hindustan Flag Post" pointed out that "a start has been made" in resolving the Far East issue. "We hope that through consultations at this conference, satisfactory decisions can be made and peace in Korea can be achieved."
    Indonesian newspapers all emphasized the significance of this agreement. An editorial in Indonesia's "People's Daily" stated that the outcome of the Berlin Conference was a victory for the cause of peace.
    France's "Le Monde" stated that the Berlin Conference "took a step forward," and the agreement to convene the Geneva Conference "is a stage of development in the development of world politics." Many political figures in France believe that "the agreement to hold an Asian conference is a valuable gain from the Berlin Conference, which lasted for several weeks," and "is encouraging." Mitterrand, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Resistance Union, said: "This five-nation conference to discuss the issues of Korea and Indochina shows progress."
    The British "Manchester Guardian" said: "The Geneva Conference is to be welcomed." Italy's "La Nazione" said: "The agreement on Asian issues at the Berlin Conference is an achievement of great historical significance."
    International public opinion has particularly pointed out the significance of the People's Republic of China's participation in the Geneva Conference.
    An editorial in the Indian bi-monthly "Peace News" stated: No Far Eastern issue can be resolved without holding a conference of the five major powers. India's "Lokmanya" believes that the participation of the People's Republic of China is "one of the main factors in resolving international issues." The newspaper pointed out: "The position taken by the United States, especially Dulles, in refusing to recognize People's China is unfounded." The "Hindu" said: "Let us hope that this conference will be the beginning of a better understanding of China's role in international politics."
    An editorial in Japan's "Mainichi Shimbun" believes that China's "influence in Asia cannot be ignored. Moreover, there are also economic aspects to the issue."
    Thailand's "Liberty Daily" said: The resolution to convene a five-nation conference with China's participation in Geneva is a step towards easing the current tense situation in Southeast Asia.
    A commentary in France's "L'Aurore" believes that "the most important achievement of the Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference is that the negotiations between East and West, which were interrupted five years ago, will now continue, and China will finally participate." A journalist from "Paris-Presse L'Intransigeant" wrote: "The Berlin Conference has opened the way for China to enter the international community, making it possible to ease the situation in the Far East..." French Socialist leader Mollet said: "We have long believed that a five-nation conference with China's participation must be convened to consider resolving Asian issues, and now we have received this promise." Radical Socialist Faurre pointed out: "France must discuss the Indochina issue through a five-nation conference. It would be absurd not to allow China to participate, because it occupies a major position in Asian affairs."
    The British Labour Party's "Daily Herald" pointed out in an editorial that "the first step towards normalizing the situation in the Far East is for the United States to recognize the existence of Communist China."
    Only the newspapers of American monopoly capital expressed a frustrated mood towards this major achievement of the Berlin Conference. They did not hide their dislike of this agreement. Washington's "Daily News" said that the Geneva Conference was a "trouble" for the United States. Washington "Star" reporter Noyes wrote: "From the United States' point of view, the agreement on the Geneva Conference at the Berlin Conference is 'ironic,' because it was Dulles who was determined to come to Berlin only to discuss European issues, and it was also Dulles who resolutely opposed holding a meeting with Communist China when Molotov suggested convening the so-called five-nation conference in his first speech."
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 26th—The latest issue of the Indian All-India Peace Council's official publication, "Peace News," published an editorial refuting the propaganda spread by Western newspapers that the Berlin Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference had completely failed. The editorial said: "The whole world welcomes the Four Power Conference, which has moved a step forward towards a mutually acceptable negotiated solution. The significance of the conference lies in the fact that the four major powers have resumed direct contact, and the four foreign ministers have the opportunity to review several pressing international issues at the conference, the resolution of which is necessary to ease international tensions. The Berlin Conference has prepared the way for a five-nation conference, without which no Far Eastern issue can be resolved."
    Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, February 26th—TASS reports from Bangkok on February 25th: Thai newspapers attach great importance to the results of the Berlin Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference. The "Liberty Daily" said that the Berlin Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference was not without results. The resolution to convene a five-nation conference with China's participation in Geneva is a step towards easing the current tense situation in Southeast Asia.

    各国舆论欢迎召开日内瓦会议
    【新华社二十六日讯】柏林四国外长会议关于召开五大国及其他有关国家的会议的协议，是会议结束一周以来各国舆论注意的中心。柏林会议的这一协议普遍受到热烈的欢迎。
    “印度快报”说，这个协议“应该被认为是显著的收获”。“印度斯坦时报”说：“由于陷入僵局的关于召开朝鲜政治会议的板门店谈判将在日内瓦恢复，全世界将要减轻忧虑。”“印度斯坦旗报”指出，在解决远东问题方面，“已经有了开端”。“我们希望，经过这次会议的协商，可以作出大家满意的决定，并获致朝鲜的和平”。
    印度尼西亚报纸都强调指出这一协议的意义。印尼“人民日报”的社论说，柏林会议的结果是和平事业的胜利。
    法国“世界报”说，柏林会议“向前迈进了一步”，关于召开日内瓦会议的协议“在世界政治的发展中是一个发展阶段”。法国许多政界人士认为，“关于举行亚洲会议的协议，是举行了数星期的柏林会议的有价值的收获”，“令人感到鼓舞”。民主社会抵抗联盟主席密特朗说：“这个讨论朝鲜和印度支那问题的五国会议显示了进步。”
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”说：“日内瓦会议是值得人们欢迎的。”意大利“国家报”说：“柏林会议上关于亚洲问题的协议是一个具有巨大历史意义的成就。”
    各国舆论特别指出中华人民共和国参加日内瓦会议的意义。
    印度“和平新闻”半月刊的社论说：不举行五大国会议，就没有一个有关远东的问题能够得到解决。印度“洛克曼雅报”认为，中华人民共和国的参加，是“解决国际问题的主要因素之一”。该报指出：“美国、特别是杜勒斯所采取的那种不愿意承认人民中国的立场是毫无根据的。”“印度教徒报”说：“让我们希望这次会议成为更好地理解中国在国际政治中的作用的开端吧。”
    日本“每日新闻”的社论认为，中国“在亚洲的影响是不能忽视的。而且问题还有经济的方面。”
    泰国“自由报”说：在日内瓦召开有中国参加的五大国会议的决议是缓和东南亚目前紧张局势的一个步骤。
    法国“义勇军报”的评论认为，“四国外长会议最重要的成果是：五年以前就中断了的东西之间的谈判，现在将继续下去，而且终于中国也参加进来了。”“巴黎急进新闻”记者写道：“柏林会议为中国打通了走向国际社会的道路，使远东局势有可能缓和……。”法国社会党领袖摩勒说：“我们很久以来深信必须召开有中国参加的五国会议来考虑解决亚洲问题，现在我们已经得到这个诺言。”激进社会党人弗尔指出：“法国必须通过五大国会议来讨论印度支那问题。如果不让中国参加，那将是荒谬的，因为它在亚洲事务中处于主要的地位。”
    英国工党的“每日先驱报”在社论中指出，“远东局势正常的第一个步骤是需要美国承认共产党中国的存在”。
    独有美国垄断资本的报纸对柏林会议的这一重大成就表示了沮丧的情绪。它们并不掩饰它们不喜欢这个协议。华盛顿“每日新闻”说，日内瓦会议对美国来说是个“麻烦”。华盛顿“明星报”记者诺伊斯写道：“从美国的观点来看，柏林会议上关于日内瓦会议的协议是‘有讽刺意味的’，因为下定决心到柏林来只讨论欧洲问题的是杜勒斯，而当莫洛托夫在第一次发言建议召开所谓五大国会议时，坚决反对和共产党中国举行会议的也是杜勒斯。”
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】最近一期印度全印和平理事会机关报“和平新闻”半月刊发表社论，驳斥西方国家报纸所散布的说柏林四国外长会议已完全失败的宣传。社论说：“全世界欢迎四国会议，这个会议向能使大家都接受的协商的解决前进了一步。会议的意义在于：四大国已经恢复了直接的接触，四国外长在会议上有可能审查若干迫切的国际问题，这些问题的解决是缓和国际紧张局势所必需的。柏林会议已为五大国会议作了准备，不举行这个会议，没有一个有关远东的问题能够得到解决。”
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社曼谷二十五日讯：泰国报纸非常重视柏林四国外长会议的结果。“自由报”说，柏林四国外长会议不是没有结果的。在日内瓦召开有中国参加的五大国会议的决议是缓和东南亚目前紧张局势的一个步骤。
