Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: Increasingly dissatisfied with France's failures in the Indochina War, the United States is attempting to seize control of the war from France and "take over" the conflict.

The "U.S. News & World Report" weekly published on February 19th stated that "American experts" in Indochina are criticizing the French-led Indochina War and believe that the United States must provide more leadership in the war. The publication said that Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, "is presiding over a policy of gradually taking over the Indochina War." Facts show that the U.S. government is increasingly openly acting as the supreme commander of the Indochina invasion war. According to an announcement by the U.S. Embassy in France on the 16th, U.S. President Eisenhower has requested that French Minister of Defense Pleven, after concluding his trip to Indochina, first go to Washington instead of Paris to discuss "new measures to plan and halt the escalating (Indochina War) crisis."

The U.S.'s "takeover" policy is currently being implemented gradually under the guise of "aid." According to United Press, "The current U.S. policy of providing large-scale financial, material, and technical assistance will continue and be strengthened." "In the fiscal year beginning this July, the United States will provide more money, materials, advice, and technicians to assist the French Union forces in Indochina."

Among the various "assistance" measures taken to implement the "takeover" policy, the United States's main current plan is to expand the power of its "Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in Indochina, particularly to expand and directly train the Bao Dai puppet army under the control of this "Advisory Group." The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door meeting on the 16th to hear reports from Acting Secretary of State Walter Smith and Radford on the Indochina war situation. The committee issued a statement after the meeting stating that "U.S. policy" is to "train sufficient indigenous forces" in Indochina. The statement said that the United States wants to ensure the implementation of the following plan: "In addition to the fifty-four (puppet army) battalions established in 1953, more than sixty additional battalions of troops will be established this year. The United States has promised to provide the funds needed to equip these troops." Furthermore, according to Senator Alexander Smith, chairman of the closed-door meeting, it is now estimated that U.S. financial "aid" to France for the Indochina War will reach 800 million to 1 billion U.S. dollars in the 1954 fiscal year. United Press revealed that the condition for the United States to provide this "aid" is that the French invading forces can "utilize this aid more effectively" under U.S. control to continue the Indochina War.

According to a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman on the 17th, the United States and France are discussing the possibility of sending a U.S. military delegation to Indochina to train local ground forces. He also said that if the United States and France reach an agreement, O'Daniel will serve as the head of the expanded "Military Assistance Advisory Group." United Press also revealed that O'Daniel is currently in Honolulu, busy finalizing the details of the U.S. Department of Defense's proposal to "assist" France in training Indochina puppet troops. He will depart for Indochina in the next few days to discuss the proposal with French Minister of Defense Pleven and Chief of Staff Ely. United Press said, "The (U.S.) Department of Defense believes that the technical knowledge gained by U.S. training experts in Greece and Korea will be very useful in assisting France in training these troops."

Recent reports indicate that Washington is constantly pressuring Paris, attempting to force the French government to accept U.S. "suggestions" and allow the United States to train, expand, and directly control the Indochina puppet army, so that the United States can further "take over" the Indochina War. At the same time, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, who is in charge of the "takeover" policy, is preparing to review "France's recent assessment of the Indochina situation" when French Chief of Staff Ely replaces Pleven to be summoned to Washington and will instruct France on "what actions should be taken" "to achieve a real victory in the post-rainy season battles."

Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: A statement made by U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Weyland in Tokyo, Japan on the 15th indicates that the U.S. Air Force is already involved in the Indochina War.

In his statement, Weyland said, "The Far East Air Force has been ordered to fly B-26 aircraft to Indochina. The first batch of twelve has been transported, and another batch left the Far East Air Force base last Saturday. These aircraft are provided as part of a regular military assistance program for the French forces." Weyland admitted that 250 U.S. Air Force mechanics and technicians "ordered to be dispatched" have been stationed at two air force bases in the coastal areas of Indochina.

In his statement, Weyland confirmed that the U.S. Air Force has established "logistical support" for the French forces in Indochina. He said, "The (U.S. military's) 315th Air Division has expanded the scope of its regular Far East airlift services to include Indochina. As a result of the expanded airlift service, two C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft fly daily from Clark Air Base in the Philippines to Indochina." According to Weyland, the supplies transported by U.S. military transport aircraft include special equipment and parts needed to maintain the various types of U.S.-made aircraft used by the French forces.

What Weyland revealed is only part of the U.S.'s intensified crime of using air power to participate in the Indochina War. According to a United Press report on the 13th, citing the French Air Force Command in Hanoi, "According to a recently reached Washington-Paris agreement," the United States will ship more B-26 bombers and various aircraft parts to the French invading forces in Indochina in the coming months. International News Service also revealed that "the total number of B-26 aircraft shipped by the United States to Indochina is 150." These aircraft were all used by the U.S. military in Korea. At the same time, the United States is also plotting to send U.S. and Japanese Air Force pilots to participate in the war in a disguised manner. According to an Associated Press report on the 16th, Eisenhower has told Republican congressional leaders that he intends to "permit civilians to volunteer as pilots for French aircraft." Prior to this, International News Service revealed on the 15th that "the United States is asking France whether it is willing to use Japanese 'technicians' in Indochina, and the number of these personnel will be greater than the 250 U.S. technicians currently in Indochina."

In order to conceal the truth about the U.S. Air Force's further participation in the Indochina War, the U.S. government recently hastily ordered the U.S. Air Force to block news about airlifts to Indochina. According to an Associated Press report from Manila on the 17th, U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Commander John Seacrest at Clark Air Base "has been ordered not to" "release any information" on the airlift of supplies to Indochina. And "reporters at this base are no longer allowed to watch C-54 transport planes load personnel and equipment to certain airports in Indochina. The U.S. Far East Air Force headquarters in Tokyo also prohibits journalists from riding these transport planes."

    美国图谋“接管”印度支那战争
    美国空军实际上已经参与印度支那战争
   【新华社二十一日讯】对法国在印度支那战争中的失败日益感到不满的美国正力图从法国手中夺取战争指挥权，“接管”这个战争。
    二月十九日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊说：在印度支那的“美国专家”抨击法国指挥的印度支那战争，并认为美国必须对印度支那战争给以更多的领导。该刊说：美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福“正在主持使美国逐渐接管印度支那战争的政策”。事实显示美国政府已愈来愈公然地以印度支那侵略战争的最高指挥者自居。据美国驻法国大使馆十六日宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔已要求法国国防部长普利文在结束印度支那之行后，首先到华盛顿去，而不是到巴黎去，以便与美国“计划制止日趋恶化的（印度支那战争）危机的新措施”。
    美国的“接管”政策，现正假“援助”为名逐步实现。据合众社透露，“美国目前采取的进行大规模财政上、物资上和技术上援助的政策将继续执行下去，并将予以加强”。“在从今年七月开始的会计年度中，美国将拿出更多的金钱、物资、建议和技术人员援助在印度支那的法兰西联邦部队”。
    在各种为了实现“接管”政策而拿出的“援助”之中，美国目前的主要计划是要扩大它驻在印度支那的“军事援助顾问团”的权力，特别是要在这个“顾问团”的控制之下扩充和直接训练保大伪军。美国参议院外交委员会在十六日举行了秘密会议，听取代理国务卿华尔特·史密斯和雷德福关于印度支那战局的报告。委员会在会后发表的声明说：“美国的政策”是要在印度支那“训练足够的土著部队”。声明说：美国要保证实现下列计划：“在一九五三年建立的五十四个（伪军）营之外再在今年建立六十个营以上的军队。美国已答应供给装备这些军队所需的款项。”此外，据担任这次秘密会议主席的参议员亚历山大·史密斯达透露，现在估计，在一九五四财政年度内，美国对法国进行印度支那战争的财政“援助”将达八亿到十亿美元。合众社透露，美国给予这种“援助”的条件是：法国侵略军能够在美国的控制下“大为有效地利用这种援助”来继续进行印度支那战争。
    据美国国防部发言人十七日说，美国和法国就派遣一个美国军事代表团到印度支那去训练当地地面军队的可能性正在进行商谈。他又说：如果美国和法国达成协议的话，奥丹尼尔将担任经过扩大的“军事援助顾问团”的团长。合众社并透露，奥丹尼尔现在正在檀香山忙于最后拟订美国国防部关于“协助”法国训练印度支那傀儡部队的建议的细节。他将在今后几天内动身去印度支那，以便在那里和法国国防部长普利文及总参谋长埃利讨论这个建议。合众社说，“（美国）国防部认为美国训练专家在希腊和朝鲜得到的技术知识对于协助法国训练这些部队是非常有用的”。
    最近的许多消息都说明：华盛顿正在不断对巴黎施加压力企图迫使法国政府接受美国的“建议”，让美国来训练、扩充并直接控制印度支那的伪军，以便由美国进一步“接管”印度支那战争。同时，主持“接管”政策的美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福，正准备在法国总参谋长埃利代替普利文应召到华盛顿时，对“法国最近对印度支那局势的估计”加以审查，并将指示法国应该“采取什么行动”，“以使雨季后的战事获得真正的胜利”。
   【新华社二十一日讯】美国远东空军司令威兰十五日在日本东京发表的谈话表明：美国空军实际上已经参与印度支那战争。
    威兰在谈话中说，“远东空军奉命把B二十六型飞机飞往印度支那。第一批运去了十二架，又一批已在上星期六离开远东空军基地。这些飞机是作为给法军的正规军事援助计划的一部分而提供的。”威兰承认，“奉命派遣”的二百五十名美国空军机械士和技术人员已驻扎在印度支那沿海地区的两个空军基地。
    威兰在他的谈话中证实美国空军已建立对印度支那法军的“后勤支援”。他说，“（美军）第三一五空军师已扩大了它的定期的远东地区空运勤务的范围，把印度支那也包括在内。扩大空运勤务的结果是：有两架C五十四型空中霸王式运输机每天从菲律宾的克拉克空军基地飞往印度支那。”据威兰透露，美军运输机装运的供应品包括保养法军使用的美制各型飞机所需的特殊装备和零件。
    威兰所透露的还只是美国加紧用空军力量参与印度支那战争的罪行的一部分。据合众社十三日引河内法国空军司令部的消息说，“根据最近达成的华盛顿—巴黎协议”，美国将在最近的数月中以更多的B二十六型轰炸机和各式飞机的零件，运交印度支那的法国侵略军。国际新闻社并透露，“美国运往印度支那的B二十六型飞机总数有一百五十架”。这些飞机都是美军在朝鲜使用过的。同时，美国并阴谋以掩盖的手法派遣美国和日本空军飞行员参战。据美联社十六日消息，艾森豪威尔已对共和党国会领袖们表示他打算“许可平民志愿担任法国飞机的飞行员”。在这以前，国际新闻社在十五日透露，“美国正在问法国是否愿意在印度支那使用日本‘技术人员’，这批人员的数目将多于目前正在印度支那的二百五十名美国技术人员。”
    为了掩盖美国空军进一步参加印度支那战争的真相，美国政府最近慌忙命令美国空军封锁有关向印度支那进行空运的新闻。据美联社马尼拉十七日电说，克拉克空军基地的美国第十三航空队司令约翰·赛撤姆斯“已奉命不准”就向印度支那空运供应品的情况“发布任何消息”。而“在这个基地上已不准记者观看C五十四型运输机装载人员和装备到印度支那某些机场去的情形。东京的美国远东空军总部也不准新闻记者搭乘这些运输机。”
