    Shenyang Actively Carries Out Preparatory Work for Basic Construction
    Shenyang City will construct more new-type factories this year. The proportion of factory building projects this year has increased from 19% last year to over 50%. The mechanical installation projects have increased by 260% compared to last year. These key projects not only greatly exceed previous years in quantity, but also have more complex and precise structures, and stricter technical requirements than in previous years.
    In order to ensure the successful completion of this year's arduous tasks, the city is seizing the time and concentrating all its efforts on preparatory work. The Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau has drawn one-fourth of its technical personnel from design companies, and the bureau itself has drawn more than 40 technical and management personnel. The Second Company has also drawn most of its personnel to go deep into the key construction sites to improve grass-roots organizational structures and strengthen grass-roots leadership. Leading cadres of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau have decided to reside at the key construction sites for extended periods to strengthen specific leadership. The Third Engineering Company of the Northeast Construction Engineering Bureau, which undertakes the largest number of key projects in the city, has formulated a relatively detailed plan to expand its organizational structure and increase its technical strength, which has been submitted to higher authorities for review and approval.
    This year, the degree of mechanization in the city's key construction projects has also increased compared to last year. Therefore, there is a requirement to purchase precision construction instruments and machinery. The construction units of various key projects have already sent people to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places to purchase hundreds of types of construction machinery and advanced precision instruments, such as cranes, hoists, mortar mixers, concrete mixers, light transport railways, various vehicles, and vibrators. Various materials such as cement, wood, and steel, which are allocated uniformly by the state, have already begun to be distributed. The Municipal People's Government Finance and Economics Committee has made unified arrangements for bulk materials such as bricks, tiles, sand, and gravel, which are the responsibility of the local government to supply. It has also urged various construction departments to sign production and sales contracts, and production, transportation, and sales contracts, in order to achieve planned supply. Various materials are now being transported to the construction sites one after another. According to statistics from late January, more than 10 million red bricks, more than 6,000 cubic meters of wood, and more than 1,000 tons of cement have been transported to the construction sites. Various steel materials will be transported to the construction sites successively in February, ensuring that the construction period is not delayed.
    In order to cultivate construction forces as soon as possible, the construction units of various key projects have not only started various training classes, but the Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau and the Second Company have also dispatched responsible cadres, section chiefs, and engineers to the First Automobile Factory construction site and a construction site in Beijing three times to learn factory construction experience and design experience. The construction departments that have received drawings have already begun to organize cadres and workers to study the drawings and compile construction organization designs. The construction departments have decided to combine the study of the general line, mobilize workers to discuss new construction quotas, learn and promote advanced experiences, and establish various responsibility systems, so that construction can begin early as soon as the ice and snow melt.

    沈阳积极进行基本建设准备工作
    沈阳市今年将建设更多的新型工厂，今年厂房工程的比重已由去年的百分之十九增加到百分之五十以上，机械安装工程较去年增大了百分之二百六十。这些重点工程不仅在数量上大大超过往年，而且工程结构也比往年更加复杂、精密，技术要求更加严格。
    为保证胜利完成今年的艰巨的任务，该市正抓紧时间，集中全力进行准备工作。沈阳市建筑工程局已从设计公司抽出四分之一的技术力量，局内抽出四十多名技术人员和管理人员，第二公司也抽出大部人力深入重点工程工地，以健全基层组织机构，加强基层领导。沈阳市建筑工程局的领导干部，决定长期住在重点工程工地，加强具体领导。承包该市重点工程数量最大的东北建筑工程局第三工程公司，已作出比较详细的扩充组织机构、增添技术力量的计划，并已送经上级审查、批准。
    今年，该市各重点工程施工机械化程度也比去年提高了，因此要求购制精密施工仪器、机械。各重点工程的施工单位目前已派人到北京、上海、广州等地采购了上百种建筑机械和高级精密仪器，吊车、起重机、砂浆搅拌机、混凝土搅拌机、运输轻便铁道、各种汽车、振动器等仪器和机械。由国家统一调拨的水泥、木材、钢材等各种材料已经开始拨发，由地方负责供应的砖、瓦、砂石等大宗材料，该市人民政府财政经济委员会已作了统一平衡，并督促各施工部门签订了产销合同和产、运、销合同，以便作到有计划供应。现在各种材料正陆续运往工地，据一月下旬统计：已运到工地红砖一千多万块，木材六千多立方公尺，水泥一千多吨。各种钢材二月份即可陆续运到工地，保证不误工期。
    各重点工程施工单位为尽快地培养施工力量，除开办了各种训练班以外，市建筑工程局和第二公司曾先后三次派遣负责干部、科长、工程师，分赴第一汽车厂工地和北京某工地，学习建厂经验和设计经验。已经收到图纸的施工部门已经开始组织干部、工人学习图纸，编制施工组织设计。各施工部门决定结合总路线的学习，发动工人讨论施工新定额，学习推广先进经验，建立各种责任制度，待冰雪初融即提前动工。　（孙雨生）
