    The Issue of Shipping Charcoal from the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region in Guangxi Has Been Resolved

    A letter from the Guangxi Provincial Branch of the People's Insurance Company of China: The People's Daily published a letter on January 15 entitled "Forest Farmers in the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region of Guangxi Request a Solution to the Problem of Shipping Charcoal." We are now informing you of how our company has handled this issue.

    Last August, the Guangxi Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau raised the issue with our company regarding the transportation of charcoal by minority ethnic groups on rafts in the Sanjiang area. At the time, we considered that the Qianjiang River's upper reaches have rapid currents and many shoals, and the Forestry Industry Bureau's rafting workers were temporarily hired, so their skills might not be proficient. If we allowed charcoal to be carried on rafts, it could cause unnecessary damage to people's property and easily lead to the insured unit relying solely on insurance. Although we also considered that if we did not allow ethnic minorities to carry charcoal on rafts, it would affect the interests of the local ethnic minority people, we did not make an appropriate decision in a timely manner. Currently, our company has consulted with the Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau and decided that the Sanjiang branch company will work with the Sanjiang purchasing station of the Forestry Industry Bureau and the local People's Government to jointly study the specific situation. We will strive to take care of the vital interests of the ethnic minorities and meet the supply and demand for charcoal, while preventing excessive charcoal loading that could damage people's property. We will appropriately allow ethnic minority people to carry charcoal for transportation.

### 广西三江侗族自治区柴炭外运问题已经得到解决

    广西三江侗族自治区柴炭外运问题已经得到解决
    中国人民保险公司广西省分公司来信：一月十五日人民日报刊载了“广西三江侗族自治区林农要求解决柴炭外运的问题”一信。现将我公司对这个问题的处理情况告诉你们。
    去年八月广西省森林工业局向我公司提出了三江地区少数民族柴炭搭载木排外运问题。当时我们考虑黔江上游河道水急滩多，而且森林工业局的放排工人是临时雇用的，技术恐不熟练；如准许在木排搭载柴炭外运，可能使人民财产遭受不应有的损失，并容易引起投保单位单纯依靠保险的思想。我们虽然也考虑到如果不准许少数民族在木排上搭载柴炭，会影响当地少数民族人民的利益，但并没有及时作出适当的决定。目前我公司已与省森林工业局共同协商，决定由三江支公司与森林工业局三江采购站会同当地人民政府根据具体情况共同研究，力求能够照顾少数民族的切身利益与满足柴炭的供求，在防止搭载柴炭过多而使人民财产遭受损失的条件下，适当让少数民族人民搭载柴炭外运。
