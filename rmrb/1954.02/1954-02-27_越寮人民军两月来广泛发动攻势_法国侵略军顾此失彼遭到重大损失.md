Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, February 26th: Over the past two months, the Vietnamese and Laotian People's Armed Forces have launched extensive and large-scale campaigns on various battlefields in the Indochina Peninsula, inflicting significant losses on the French aggressor troops and plunging them into a predicament of being spread thin and struggling to cope.

When the spearhead of the Vietnamese People's Army's winter offensive in 1953 was directed at Lai Chau province's capital, the last French stronghold in the Northwest region, the French headquarters hastily airlifted approximately four battalions of troops from the Red River Delta to Dien Bien Phu, on the Vietnamese-Laotian border, to coordinate with Lai Chau and re-invade the Northwest liberated areas. But the French were too late. A lightly armed unit of the People's Army swiftly cut in between Lai Chau and Dien Bien Phu, then advanced towards Lai Chau, annihilating and routing 24 enemy companies in just half a month. By this point, the entire Lai Chau province, except for Dien Bien Phu, was liberated, and the encirclement of Dien Bien Phu was completed.

Subsequently, the Laotian People's Liberation Army launched an offensive in central Laos, eliminating nearly three infantry battalions and two howitzer companies of the French army within three days, liberating most of Khammouane province, and controlling the strategic Route 12. This victory by the Laotian People's Liberation Army greatly shocked the French headquarters, which hurriedly airlifted elite troops from the Red River Delta to central Laos, attempting to consolidate the area with superior forces. However, when the French moved eight mobile battalions from Vietnam and advanced north from Savannakhet to reoccupy Thakhek, the capital of Khammouane province, the Laotian People's Liberation Army seized the opportunity to cut in to the south, clearing some isolated French strongholds and severing another strategic route - Route 9.

At the same time, the Vietnamese People's Army unexpectedly launched an offensive in the strategically important Central Highlands, located at the border of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, liberating Kon Tum province in thirteen days. Later, they advanced towards Pleiku to the south, forcing the French to withdraw the elite troops (including French troops transferred from Korea to Vietnam) who had been sent to invade the coastal liberated areas of central Vietnam, halfway, to this region.

In early February, the Laotian People's Liberation Army launched an offensive in southern Laos, liberating the southeastern part of the Bolaven Plateau and the capital of Attapeu province. Simultaneously with the offensive in southern Laos, the Laotian People's Liberation Army also launched an offensive in northern Laos, annihilating approximately sixteen French companies in four days, liberating a vast area of over 200 kilometers along the Nam Ou River.

In the past winter and spring, in order to cope with the offensives launched by the people's armed forces of Vietnam and Laos on five battlefields in Northwest Vietnam, Central Vietnam, and Central, Southern, and Northern Laos, the French headquarters had to disperse most of its mobile forces to various battlefields far apart. At the beginning of the offensive, the French were forced to withdraw two-fifths of the only forty-four mobile battalions in the Red River Delta to Dien Bien Phu and central Laos, and later transferred ten mobile battalions from South Vietnam to reinforce other hard-pressed areas. This greatly weakened the French military strength in the Red River Delta and the Mekong Delta, where mass guerrilla warfare is now vigorously developing. In the Red River Delta, the People's Army and guerrillas had already removed and forced the retreat of more than twenty French strongholds in less than twenty days in January, making the French situation even more embarrassing; in the Mekong Delta of South Vietnam, the people's armed forces removed and forced the retreat of 72 French strongholds and watchtowers in January, annihilating nearly 2,000 French troops. Recently, the Cambodian People's Armed Forces have also become increasingly active. This forced the French to leave a considerable mobile force to deal with "sudden incidents".

### 越寮人民军两月来广泛发动攻势  法国侵略军顾此失彼遭到重大损失

    越寮人民军两月来广泛发动攻势
    法国侵略军顾此失彼遭到重大损失
    【新华社北越二十六日电】最近两个多月来，越南、寮国人民武装部队在印度支那半岛各个战场上广泛展开规模巨大的战役，已使法国侵略军遭受重大的损失，并陷于左右招架、顾此失彼的困境中。
    当一九五三年冬季越南人民军进攻的矛头指向法军在西北地区最后一个据点——莱州省省会时，法军总部急忙从红河三角洲调集约四个营兵力空降到越、寮边境的奠边府，策应莱州并重新进犯西北解放区。但是法军已经来不及这样做了。人民军以一支轻装部队飞快地插到莱州和奠边府之间，然后向莱州推进，只在半个月内即歼灭和击溃了敌军二十四个连，至此解放了除奠边府以外莱州全省地区，并完成了对奠边府的包围形势。
    接着，寮国人民解放军在寮国中部发起攻势，三天之内就消灭了法军将近三个步兵营和两个榴弹炮连，解放了甘蒙省大部地区，并控制了战略交通线第十二号公路。寮国人民解放军这一胜利，使法军总部大为震动，急忙把红河三角洲的精锐部队空运到寮国中部，企图以优势兵力巩固这个地区。可是当法军自越南调来八个机动营并从沙湾拿吉向北推进要重新占领甘蒙省省会他曲的时候，寮国人民解放军已乘机插到南面去，扫除了法军的一些孤立据点，切断另一条战略交通线——第九号公路。
    与此同时，越南人民军又在具有重要战略意义、处在越、寮、棉三国边界的中越高原地带出其不意地展开攻势，十三天中解放了崑嵩省；以后又向南面的波来古一带推进，逼使法军不得不把派去进犯中越南部沿海解放区的精锐部队（其中包括由朝鲜调到越南的法军）从半路上撤到这个地区来。
    二月初，寮国人民解放军在寮国南部发动攻势，解放了波罗芬高原东南部和阿速坡省会。和在寮国南部发动攻势同时，寮国人民解放军在寮国北部也展开了攻势，在四天中就歼灭法军约十六个连，解放了南乌江沿岸二百多公里长的广大地区。
    在去冬今春，法军总部为了对付越南和寮国两国人民武装在越南西北、中越南部和寮国中部、南部、北部五个战场上所发动的攻势，不得不把大部机动兵力分散到相距遥远的各个战场去。攻势一开始，法军就被迫从红河三角洲仅有的四十四个机动营中抽出五分之二的兵力到奠边府和寮国中部去，以后又从南越抽调十个机动营增援到其他战事吃紧的地方去。这样就大大削弱了法军在红河三角洲和湄公河三角洲的军事力量，而那里的群众性游击战争现正猛烈地开展起来。在红河三角洲，人民军和游击队在一月份不到二十天就已拔除和逼退法军二十多个据点，使法军处境更加狼狈；在南越湄公河三角洲的人民武装在一月份即拔除和逼退法军据点和了望塔七十二处，歼灭法军近二千名。近来高棉人民武装也渐趋活跃。这使法军又不能不留下相当的机动兵力以便应付“突然事故”。
