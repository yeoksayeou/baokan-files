Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 31st: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers held their sixth meeting on January 30th, chaired by Bidault.

The meeting continued to discuss the Soviet delegation's proposal to invite representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the discussion of item two on the agenda, "The German Question and the Tasks of Ensuring European Security."

Chairman Bidault asked: What further comments do the Foreign Ministers have on the Soviet delegation's proposal to invite representatives from East and West Germany? Eden said he did not think it appropriate to invite representatives from East Germany to the meeting.

Molotov said that it must be stated that the Soviet delegation still considered it appropriate to invite representatives from both East and West Germany to the Foreign Ministers' meeting in order to hear their views on the German question.

Dulles said that he did not support Molotov's proposal to invite representatives from East Germany and the Federal Republic. He added that the West German government itself had not expressed a desire to be invited to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting.

Bidault said: "It would be best to wait until a government that can represent all the German people is formed before inviting representatives from West Germany and East Germany." Bidault then, in his capacity as chairman, suggested continuing the discussion on item two of the agenda. Eden said that he had already expressed some views on item two and made some suggestions at the meeting on the 29th. He had nothing further to add. It is known that Eden put forward a British plan for restoring German unity at the meeting on the 29th. This plan is divided into the following "stages": so-called all-German "free elections" conducted under the supervision of the four occupying powers, based on an electoral law formulated by the four powers; convening a national assembly produced by such elections to formulate a constitution, during which time the Bonn Federal Republic government and the German Democratic Republic government would continue to exercise power in the West and East respectively; organizing an all-German government based on the constitution approved by the national assembly, with the Federal Republic government and the German Democratic Republic government transferring all powers to this government; negotiations on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany by the aforementioned all-German government. Eden's plan pointed out that this government "should have the right to enjoy the international rights of the Federal Republic and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, and assume their international obligations." According to Eden's plan, in the above stages, the occupying powers would retain supervisory functions in one way or another, and foreign troops would continue to be stationed on German territory. However, the plan does not mention when or how the occupation of Germany would end.

Molotov then spoke. He said: We already know from the diplomatic documents exchanged between the governments of France, Britain, and the United States and the Soviet government that the Western countries consider the question of so-called free elections in Germany to be particularly important. Mr. Eden mainly spoke about this issue as well. The importance of this issue should not be underestimated. The Soviet government has always considered holding free all-German elections to be of great significance. Free all-German elections are necessary to ensure the stable unification of the two parts of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis.

We are not blind to the fact that the Soviet view on the question of holding free elections in Germany differs in some respects from that of the three Western countries. The Soviet Union is more concerned than the three Western countries with ensuring that the German elections are truly free and democratic, and at the same time promote the further development of a democratic Germany along a peaceful path. The shortcoming of Mr. Eden's all-German election plan is that, according to this plan, the German elections are actually controlled by the occupying authorities, while the Germans themselves are placed under the care of other countries. The shortcoming of this plan is a distrust of the democratic forces in Germany. At the same time, this plan talks too much about how foreign countries, primarily the occupying powers, should do everything possible to supervise the preparation and conduct of the elections. Isn't such a "free election" too lacking in freedom? In any case, the Germans themselves should be asked about this first. It is not known why this is being completely avoided.

There is also another issue that cannot be ignored. After this election that Mr. Eden speaks of, will Germany's internal and foreign affairs obtain true freedom? The Soviet government maintains that the result of the all-German elections must enable Germany to become a truly free country, able to freely carry out its domestic and foreign policies. Mr. Eden's plan cannot achieve this. Mr. Eden's plan points out: "The all-German government should have the right to enjoy the international rights of the Federal Republic and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, and assume their international obligations." This means that Mr. Eden's proposal wants to maintain the obligations imposed on West Germany by the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, and to extend these obligations to East Germany, which is currently not bound by any such obligations. Of course, this is something that many, many Germans cannot agree to. This point has not been given sufficient consideration in Mr. Eden's proposal. The opinions of the Germans, both East and West, must be considered.

Mr. Eden's plan is clearly based on the premise that after the all-German elections, Germany will not be free to decide whether the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, which are now being forced upon West Germany, will remain valid. If this is the case, then there can be no talk of a truly free Germany emerging after such elections! We all know that the Bonn Treaty is intended to maintain a semi-occupied state of Germany for many decades. Therefore, a Germany bound by this treaty cannot freely handle its domestic affairs, its internal policies. As for the Paris Treaty, it directly talks about binding Germany to the chariot of a certain military bloc for fifty years. If Germany is not free to decide whether the Paris Treaty will remain valid after the all-German elections, then what freedom is there to talk about for Germany!

The Paris Treaty on the so-called "European Defense Community" allows German militarism to act freely and makes it possible for them to rebuild the German standing army. This kind of "freedom" does exist. But this has nothing in common with the true freedom of the German people.

The Soviet Union has adopted a different attitude and hopes that the Western countries, guided by the interests of consolidating peace and European security, will agree with this attitude. We should agree that after the all-German elections, Germany will no longer be bound by any treaties with this or that group of countries; Germany must embark on the path of peace and democracy, and not only be able to freely handle its domestic affairs, but also be able to freely handle its foreign affairs.

We should revive Germany as a unified, independent, democratic, and peaceful Germany. Such a truly free Germany will never threaten its neighbors; and, as a great power, it will obtain its due position in the great family of peace-loving nations of Europe.

These are the Soviet delegation's preliminary views on the issue under discussion. Next time, we will also outline our proposals on the German question and put forward some suggestions. Then, Dulles explained the US position on the issue under discussion. He said: History teaches us that the German question and European security must be studied in conjunction. Dulles then turned to the specific steps to resolve the German question. He said he supported the plan put forward by Eden and considered it to be clear, rational, and carefully drafted. Dulles said: In the process of exchanging views, some suggestions can be made to make certain modifications to the details of Eden's plan. But, in general, I agree with the British proposal.

In the next part of his speech, Dulles attempted to prove that the so-called "free elections" stipulated in Eden's plan could ensure that the German people expressed their true will. However, Dulles himself overturned his own argument, emphasizing that these so-called "free elections" must be held under the supervision of the occupying powers.

When talking about the issue of safeguarding European security, Dulles still repeated the already debunked US argument: it seems that as long as the six countries of Western Europe are united in the so-called "European Defense Community," European security can be guaranteed. It is known that the "European Defense Community" allows German imperialists to freely revive the West German revanchist army.

Dulles pointed out that the United States hopes that the "European Defense Community" and another Western military bloc, the North Atlantic Group, will unite.

Then Bidault spoke. He said: The wording of item two on the agenda points out the connection between the German question and the European security question. Bidault said that he did not deny the existence of this connection and said that the French delegation hoped to resolve the German question in a way that would benefit the complete resolution of international security issues. However, Bidault then defended the Western countries' policy of dragging Germany into the so-called European Defense Community, a Western military bloc, insisting that the policy of dividing Germany and Europe was a course of action the Western countries were forced to take. Like the foreign ministers of Britain and the United States, Bidault insisted that to resolve the German question, so-called "free elections" must first be held in Germany. He also tried to make it seem as if the so-called European Defense Community was some kind of "security guarantee" for Europe. Bidault said he supported the main direction of the Eden plan. He insisted that this plan was used to restore the unity of Germany.

After Bidault finished speaking, Eden said that at the next meeting he would respond to the foreign ministers' opinions on the plan he had put forward. Everyone agreed that the next meeting would be held on February 1st at the Soviet High Commissioner's Office on Unter den Linden.

    莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上
    提出解决德国问题的初步意见
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：四国外长于一月三十日举行第六次会议，由皮杜尔担任主席。
    会议继续讨论苏联代表团关于邀请德意志民主共和国代表和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加讨论议程第二项“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”的建议。
    主席皮杜尔问道：外长们对苏联代表团关于邀请德国东部和西部的代表的建议还有什么意见？艾登说，他认为邀请东德代表参加会议是不适宜的。
    莫洛托夫说，必须声明，苏联代表团仍然认为宜于邀请德国东西双方代表参加外长会议，以便听取他们对德国问题的意见。
    杜勒斯说，他不赞成莫洛托夫关于邀请东德与联邦共和国的代表的提议。他又说，西德政府本身都没有表示希望被邀参加四外长会议。
    皮杜尔说：“最好是等到一个能够代表全体德国人民的政府组成后，再邀请西德和东德的代表。”皮杜尔接着以主席身分建议继续讨论议程第二项。艾登说，他在二十九日的会议上已经对议程第二项发表了一些意见，并且提出了一些建议。他已经没有什么可补充的了。大家知道，艾登在二十九日的会议上提出了一个恢复德国统一的英国计划。这个计划分为下列几个“阶段”：根据四国制订的选举法，在四个占领国的监督下进行所谓全德“自由选举”；召开由这种选举产生的国民议会以制订宪法，在制宪期间，波恩联邦共和国政府与德意志民主共和国政府仍然在西东两部继续执行权力；根据国民议会批准的宪法组织全德政府，联邦共和国政府和德意志民主共和国政府把全部权力移交给这个政府；由上述全德政府代表德国进行关于签订对德和约的谈判。艾登的计划指出：这个政府“应有权享有联邦共和国和德国苏占区的国际权利，并承担它们的国际义务”。根据艾登的计划，在上述各阶段中，占领国都以这种方式或那种方式保有监督职能，而外国军队也继续留驻在德国领土之上。但是这个计划只字不提在什么时候以什么方式结束对德占领。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。他说：我们从法、英、美三国政府和苏联政府交换的外交文件中已经知道：西方国家认为在德国举行所谓自由选举的问题特别重要。艾登先生主要也是谈这个问题。这个问题的重要性是不应该轻视的。苏联政府始终认为举行自由的全德选举具有重大意义。为了保证在民主、和平的基础上巩固地统一德国的两个部分，自由的全德选举是必要的。
    我们并没有闭眼不看事实：关于在德国举行自由选举的问题，苏联的看法在某些方面是和西方三国不一致的。苏联比西方三国更关心于使德国的选举成为真正自由的，成为民主的，而同时又能促进民主的德国沿着和平路线进一步发展。艾登先生的全德选举计划的缺点是：根据这个计划，德国选举实际上是受占领当局控制的，而德国人自己则被置于其他国家的照管之下。这个计划的缺点是不信任德国的民主力量。同时，这个计划过多地谈到外国，首先是占领国家，应千方百计地监督选举的筹备工作和选举的进行。这样的“自由选举”难道不是太缺少自由了吗？无论怎样，关于这一点首先应该问问德国人自己。对这一点不知为什么要完全避而不谈。
    另外还有一个不可小视的问题。在艾登先生所说的这个选举之后，德国的内政和外交难道就会得到真正的自由了吗？苏联政府主张：全德选举的结果要能使德国成为一个真正自由的国家，能真正自由地执行它的内政和外交政策。艾登先生的计划是做不到这一点的。艾登先生的计划指出：“全德政府应有权享有联邦共和国和德国苏占区的国际权利，并承担它们的国际义务。”这就是说：艾登先生的建议要维持波恩条约与巴黎条约加在西德头上的义务，而且要把这些义务推广到现在不受任何这类义务约束的东德的头上。当然，这是许许多多德国人所不能同意的。这一点在艾登先生的建议中没有得到足够的考虑。必须考虑德国人的意见，无论是东德的还是西德的。
    艾登先生的计划显然是根据这个前提出发的：全德选举之后，德国不能自由决定现在强加在西德头上的波恩条约和巴黎条约是否仍然有效。既然如此，就谈不到在这种选举之后会出现真正自由的德国了。我们全知道：波恩条约是要保持好几十年的对德国的半占领状态的。因此，受这个条约束缚的德国就不能自由处理它的国内事务，它的内政政策。至于巴黎条约，它直接谈到要在五十年内把德国缚在某种军事集团的战车之上。如果在全德选举之后，德国还不能自由决定巴黎条约是否仍然有效，那又还谈什么自由德国！
    关于所谓“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎条约使德国军国主义行动自由，并且使他们有可能重建德国的常备军。这种“自由”倒是有的。但这与德国人民的真正自由毫无共同之处。
    苏联采取了另外一种态度，并且希望西方国家在巩固和平与欧洲安全的利益的指引下，会赞成这种态度。我们应该同意：在全德选举之后，德国不再受它和这一国家集团或那一国家集团的任何条约约束；德国一定要走上和平与民主的道路，并且不仅能自由地处理自己的内政，而且也能自由地处理自己的外交。
    我们应该使德国复兴，成为一个统一、独立、民主与和平的德国。这样一个真正自由的德国永远不会威胁它的邻国；而且，作为一个大国，它会在欧洲爱好和平的民族大家庭中获得它应有的地位。
    这就是苏联代表团对讨论中的问题的初步意见。下次我们还要概述我们对德国问题的主张，并且提出一些建议。接着，杜勒斯就讨论中的问题说明美国的立场。他说：历史教训我们，德国问题和欧洲安全一定要联系起来研究。杜勒斯接着转而谈到解决德国问题的具体步骤。他说他拥护艾登所提出的计划，并且认为这个计划是明确的、合理的、仔细拟订的。杜勒斯说：在交换意见的过程中，可以提出一些建议，对艾登计划的细节作某些修改。但是，一般地说，我是同意英国的建议的。
    杜勒斯在发言的下一部分企图证明：艾登的计划所规定的所谓“自由选举”，可以保证德国人民表达真正的意志。可是，杜勒斯自己就推翻了自己的论断，他强调这种所谓“自由选举”必须在占领国的监督下举行。
    杜勒斯在谈到保障欧洲安全的问题时，还是重复那早就被揭穿了的美国的论调：似乎只要把西欧六个国家联合在所谓“欧洲防务集团”中，欧洲的安全就可以得到保障。大家知道，“欧洲防务集团”使德国帝国主义分子可以放手复活西德复仇军队。
    杜勒斯指出：美国希望“欧洲防务集团”和西方国家的另外一个军事集团——北大西洋集团——联合起来。
    然后是皮杜尔发言。他说：议程第二项的提法指出了德国问题与欧洲安全问题的联系。皮杜尔说，他不否认这种联系的存在，并且说法国代表团希望以有利于完满解决国际安全问题的办法来解决德国问题。可是皮杜尔接着就替西方国家把德国拉入所谓欧洲防务集团这一西方国家的军事集团的政策辩护，硬说分裂德国和欧洲的政策是西方国家不得已而采取的。皮杜尔也像英国和美国的外长一样，硬说要解决德国问题必须首先在德国举行所谓“自由选举”。他还企图把事情说成这样：所谓欧洲防务集团好像是欧洲的“安全保障”。皮杜尔表示他拥护艾登计划的主要方针。他硬说这个计划是用来恢复德国的统一的。
    在皮杜尔结束了发言之后，艾登说，在下次会议上他要答复各外长对他所提出的计划的意见。大家同意下次会议订于二月一日在菩提树下街苏联驻德高级专员公署举行。
