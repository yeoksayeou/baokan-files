    Production Innovation with a Socialist Labor Attitude
    Wang Haide, Worker at State-Owned No. 1 Rubber Factory, Creates Four Machines
    Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory Successfully Trial-Produces Eight New Products
    Wang Haide, a model worker of Mudanjiang City and foreman of the medicinal material processing workshop at the State-Owned No. 1 Rubber Factory, has carried out production innovation with a socialist labor attitude, successively creating four machines: an electrically operated hard material pulverizer, a sealed electric sieve, an electric cutter (lifting and cutting machine), and a press. These machines have replaced heavy manual labor in the workshop and greatly changed the workshop's production outlook.
    Previously, all the medicinal materials processed in Wang Haide's workshop were handled manually, which was not only inefficient but also detrimental to the health of the workers. For example, smashing rawhide glue involved one person holding a hammer and smashing it on an iron plate. When cutting mixed glue, one person had to pull the glue while another used a knife, cutting a maximum of forty-eight kilograms in eight hours. This heavy manual labor often left workers with sore backs and aching arms. In addition, the dust produced during the processing of medicinal materials was inhaled by the workers, affecting their health. During his years of production in this workshop, Wang Haide, like other workers, deeply felt the pain of manual labor, especially since the supply often could not meet the needs of the next production process, affecting the completion of the production plan. Therefore, encouraged by Zhang Mingshan's advanced deeds in overcoming difficulties to create the "anti-encirclement disc," he was determined to change the old working methods and replace manual labor with machinery. He overcame difficulties such as his low level of education, his inability to draw diagrams, his inability to calculate gear ratios, and his lack of understanding of the size allocation of various machine wheels. With the encouragement of the Party and the help of the workers, he finally succeeded in creating four machines. His ability to create these four machines also stemmed from his careful observation of daily affairs and his willingness to use his brain. Seeing the effort workers expended on smashing aquatic glue, he repeatedly thought: Wouldn't it be great to have an automatic hammer that pounded up and down? Therefore, he associated it with the pestle and mortar for pounding rice, and after painstaking research, he created the hard material pulverizer. The other three machines he created were also successfully researched by emulating the principles of other tools.
    Wang Haide's success has enabled the workshop to process 24 out of the 25 medicinal materials with machines, resulting in an unprecedented increase in production efficiency. Workers said: "We used to smash aquatic glue manually, and at most we could smash 27 kilograms per hour. Now that we have the hard material pulverizer, we can smash at least 170 kilograms per hour." Cutting mixed glue has also increased from just over 4 kilograms per hour to over 40 kilograms per hour, and sieving heavy soda ash has increased from a maximum of 36 kilograms per hour to over 190 kilograms per hour. As a result of machine labor, the disease rate has dropped sharply. For example, in August of last year, the number of sick leave days was 94, in September it was 56, in October 45, and in November it decreased to 31. The attendance rate increased from 93 percent to 96 percent. The number of workers going to cultural centers and recreation rooms has greatly increased.
    Wang Haide has always been actively responsible for production and has made contributions. As a result, he was promoted from an ordinary handyman to workshop foreman, was named a model worker of Mudanjiang City, and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Now that he has studied the general line, he has put forward the determination and plan to continue creating a special electric sieve for zinc oxide, an electric rubber cloth cutting machine, and an electric glue brushing machine, striving to achieve this plan in the first quarter of this year.
    Furthermore, our dispatch: The State-Owned Caijiagang Mining Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced eight new products last year. The use of these new products in coal mines can promote safe production and reduce the physical labor of miners.
    The new products successfully trial-produced by the factory last year mainly include a 200-horsepower axial-flow ventilator, an internal gear winch, a blower, a single-drum electric winch, and a double-drum electric winch. The 200-horsepower axial-flow ventilator is equipment for mine ventilation. It can extract 4,200 cubic meters of dirty gas from the mine in one minute, ensuring that 1,400 workers underground have enough fresh air. Because of the air circulation, the risk of gas explosions underground can also be effectively prevented. The internal gear winch is used to transport timber in narrow coal channels and small coal holes underground. In the past, workers often had to carry pit props weighing more than 100 jin on their backs, climbing up steep coal holes, or dragging them hard with ropes, which was exhausting, dangerous, and inefficient. With the internal gear winch, workers only need to turn on the power, and the heavy pit props can be easily pulled up, more than 2,000 jin at a time. The blower is coal preparation equipment designed to select coking coal for the metallurgical industry. All these new products are trial-produced according to Soviet standards and are sturdy and durable. Some of the successfully trial-produced new machines have been adopted by the Huainan Coal Mine with good results and are welcomed by coal mines across the country.

### 以社会主义的劳动态度进行生产革新  国营第一橡胶厂工人王海德创造四种机械  蔡家岗矿山机械制造厂试制成功八种新产品

    以社会主义的劳动态度进行生产革新
    国营第一橡胶厂工人王海德创造四种机械
    蔡家岗矿山机械制造厂试制成功八种新产品
    牡丹江市劳动模范、国营第一橡胶厂药料加工车间工长王海德，以社会主义的劳动态度进行生产革新，先后创造了以电力操纵的硬质粉碎机、密闭式电筛子、电动切刀机（升降切削机）、压力机等四种机械，使该车间以机械化代替了笨重的体力劳动，大大改变了车间生产面貌。
    王海德所在的这个车间，所有加工的药料以前都是用人力操作，不仅生产效率低，也有损工人健康。如砸牛皮胶，是一个人拿着一把锤子在一块铁板上砸的；切混合胶时，必须一个人扯着胶，一个人用刀拉，每天八小时最多才能切四十八公斤。这种笨重的手工劳动，常使工人累得腰酸胳膊痛，同时在加工药料时，药粉飞扬，工人吸了进去，妨碍健康。王海德在这个车间生产的几年当中，同其他工人一样，深深感到手工劳动的痛苦，尤其是常因供应不上下道工序生产的需要，影响生产计划的完成。因此，他在张明山克服困难创造“反围盘”的先进事迹鼓舞下，决心改变旧式工作方法，要用机械代替人力操作。他克服了因文化程度低而不会画图，不会算齿轮的转数以及不懂各个机械轮大小的配备问题等困难，在党的鼓励和职工们的帮助下，终于先后把四种机械创造成功。他所以能创造这四种机械，还因为他平时对日常事物的细心观察和肯动脑筋。他看到工人砸水胶那样的费力气，就一再想：如果弄出一个自动锤上下捣不就好了吗？因而他又联想到捣米的杵和臼；于是经过苦心钻研创造出硬质粉碎机来。他创造的另三种机械，也是效仿其他工具的原理研究成功的。
    王海德的创造成功，使目前全车间所加工的二十五种药料中，有二十四种药料均能用机器来加工了，因而生产效率空前提高了。工人说：“咱们早先用人力砸水胶，一个钟头顶多砸二十七公斤，现在有了硬质粉碎机，一个钟头至少也能砸一百七十多公斤。”切混合胶也由每小时切四公斤多提高到切四十多公斤，筛重曹更由每小时至多筛三十六公斤提高到一百九十多公斤了。用机器劳动的结果，疾病率直线下降了，如去年八月份，病假日数为九十四天，九月份是五十六天，十月份四十五天，十一月份则减少到三十一天。出勤率由百分之九十三提高到百分之九十六。工人去文化馆、游艺室的大大地增多了。
    王海德一贯对生产积极负责，有贡献，因而由一个普通杂工被提拔为车间工长，又曾被评为牡丹江市劳动模范，并光荣地参加了中国共产党。现在他学习了总路线以后，又提出了继续创造氧化锌专用电动筛子、电动拉割胶布机及电动刷胶机的决心和计划，争取在今年第一季度实现这个计划。
    又讯：国营蔡家岗矿山机械制造厂去年试制成功了八种新产品。煤矿里使用这些新产品，可以促进安全生产和减轻矿工的体力劳动。
    该厂去年试制成功的新产品，主要有二百匹马力轴流式抽风机、内齿轮绞车、送风机、单筒电绞车和双筒电绞车等。二百匹马力轴流式抽风机是矿井通风用的设备，它能在一分钟内抽出井下肮脏的气体四千二百立方公尺，能保证井下一千四百个工人有足够的新鲜空气。因为空气流通，井下还可以有效地防止瓦斯爆炸的危险。内齿轮绞车是在井下窄狭的煤槽和小煤洞里提运木材用的。工人们过去往往要身背一百多斤重的坑木，从很陡的煤洞里向上爬行，或是用绳子硬拖，累得满身大汗，既危险，效率又低。采用内齿轮绞车后，工人只需打开电门，笨重的坑木就能轻便地拉上来，一次可以拉两千多市斤。送风机是选煤设备，是为了替冶金工业选出炼焦煤而制造的一种选煤机械。以上这些新产品都是根据苏联的标准试制的，坚固耐用。有些试制成功的新机械经淮南煤矿采用后，效果很好，并为全国煤矿所欢迎。
