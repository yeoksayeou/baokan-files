Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 23rd: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and the Korean-Chinese side have repeatedly exposed the U.S. side's forced detention of large numbers of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war and illegal import of various combat materials. In order to confuse the public and dilute its own crimes of violating the Armistice Agreement, the U.S. side has counter-accused our side of violating the Armistice Agreement and requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch neutral mobile inspection personnel for investigation. However, all these requests were rejected by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission because they did not comply with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement. The U.S. side's trick of slandering and covering up its various illegal acts of violating the Armistice Agreement was thus shamefully defeated. However, on February 19, the U.S. side sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, saying that the Korean-Chinese side's exposure of the U.S. side's shameless tricks to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission interfered with and violated the rights of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the U.S. side, and made unreasonable accusations and threats against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In response, Li Sang-cho, Lieutenant General and Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to the U.S. side on February 23 to strongly refute it. The full text of Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho's letter of February 23 is as follows:
To Major General Lacy, Senior Member, United Nations Command, Military Armistice Commission:
    I have received a copy of your letter of February 19 to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which was sent by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. That letter is full of slander and distortion and even threatens the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Therefore, it is necessary to refute and expose your letter of February 19 to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Your side has repeatedly falsely accused our side of violating the Armistice Agreement and requested the dispatch of neutral mobile inspection teams for investigation, but all of these have been rejected by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission because they are not in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. The purpose of your false accusations is to reduce the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to your tool to cover up your crimes of violating the Armistice Agreement, to deceive the people of the world, and to create tension. I have repeatedly exposed and refuted your attempt relentlessly. Since you could not find any facts or arguments to defend or whitewash your side, you had to attempt in your letter of February 19 to turn your failure of false accusations into slandering our side for interfering with and infringing upon the rights of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and your side, and further accuse the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission of rejecting your false accusation requests. But the facts cannot be changed, and any slander, distortion, and deception are doomed to fail and will never succeed.
    Our side has always strictly abided by and implemented the Armistice Agreement. This is well known throughout the world and is also publicly acknowledged by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams. Any slander and distortion on your part cannot change this fact. The results of the investigation by the Neutral Nations Mobile Inspection Team sent to Yizhou Airport in October 1953 fully proved that these accusations by your side were completely unfounded and were pure fabrications.
    As I pointed out in my letters to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and to you on January 19, January 27, and February 12, it is in fact your side that is violating the Armistice Agreement. Your violation of the Armistice Agreement and the terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, undermining the explanatory work, and forcibly detaining large numbers of our prisoners of war is a fact known to all and resented by everyone. Your warplanes and military personnel have invaded our area to carry out hostile acts, which have occurred continuously since the armistice. Our side has repeatedly presented clear materials at the Military Armistice Commission and the joint secretaries' meetings. Your side violated the Armistice Agreement, obstructed the work of the Joint Red Cross teams, and even used gas and beatings against the staff of the Joint Red Cross teams, which the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission confirmed after investigation. Shortly after the armistice took effect, your side violated the Armistice Agreement by illegally importing 106 mortars, violating the one-for-one replacement rule; exceeding the number of certain types of combat aircraft imported, and refusing to report the sub-types of combat aircraft belonging to the replacement, in an attempt to undermine the basis of one-for-one, same-type, same-performance replacement. These have been clearly pointed out by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in its analysis report on monitoring rotation and replacement. Your side's handling of parts is even more blatant. On the one hand, your side openly violated the Armistice Agreement by refusing to report the import of parts to the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; on the other hand, it delayed discussions at the meetings and refused to resolve the issue, and then attempted to unilaterally interrupt the discussion on the parts issue in order to simply evade the obligations stipulated by the Armistice Agreement. On September 28, 1953, the Military Armistice Commission adopted the "Measures for Supervising and Reporting Military Personnel and Replacement Items Arriving and Leaving Korea," but your side still does not fully report in accordance with these measures at the southern ports. On November 28, 1953, the Military Armistice Commission adopted a definition of combat aircraft, but your side still does not report some combat aircraft. These are blatant violations of the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements.
    It is precisely because your side intentionally and continuously violates the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements that you have obstructed and interfered with the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams in the South in various ways. On January 20 and 21, 1954, your side prohibited the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams from entering Incheon port to carry out inspection work. Your side instructed the affiliated personnel provided by your side to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to interfere with the work of the team members. The affiliated personnel provided by your side even openly beat Captain Larsson, a Swedish staff member of the Daegu team. Your side even carried out shameless provocative acts such as bribing, insulting, and threatening many members of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, and openly kidnapped Hadukiewicz, a Polish staff member of the Neutral Nations Inspection Team, at Gangneung Airport on September 9, 1953. Your side refused to open boxes containing military supplies at various ports in the South and refused to allow members of the Neutral Nations Teams to board ships for inspection, which greatly hindered the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. These facts are difficult to enumerate one by one, and detailed records can be found in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's records, reports, and other documents.
    The facts are completely clear: our side has always strictly abided by and implemented the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements, while your side has continuously violated the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements, and on the one hand, attempts to reduce the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to your tool for deceiving the people of the world, and on the other hand, obstructs the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in various ways. It is precisely because of this situation that you are afraid of our side's refutations and exposures, and therefore, in your letter of February 19, you arbitrarily claimed that only your side has the right to violate the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements and to slander our side at will, while our side should not expose the truth. Our side's repeated exposure of the truth has bankrupted your conspiracy, precisely to safeguard the obligations and rights of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but you attempt to describe our side's documents exposing the truth as an infringement and interference with the rights of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and your side. This absurd and ridiculous statement is not only a waste of effort, but also further illustrates your side's sophistry and attempts to cover up the truth. In particular, it must be pointed out that you mentioned in your letter of February 19 the "only reason for the continued existence" of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. This is a new means of intimidation taken by your side against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission after your side's repeated attempts to use the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission have failed. Your side's blatant intimidation of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission completely exposes your hypocritical attitude of feigning concern for the obligations and rights of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.
    In order to stabilize the Korean armistice and seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, your side must immediately stop your violations of the Armistice Agreement, strictly implement the Armistice Agreement and bilateral agreements, and publicly confess your past violations of the Armistice Agreement, and stop obstructing, interfering with, manipulating, and threatening the Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

    美方为掩饰其一再违反停战协定的罪行对我方进行诬蔑
    李相朝中将致函美方严加驳斥
    【新华社开城二十三日电】中立国遣返委员会、中立国监察委员会与朝中方面曾一再揭露美方强迫扣留大批朝中被俘人员及非法运入各种作战物资，美方为混淆视听冲淡它自己违反停战协定的种种罪行，竟反诬我方违反停战协定，并要求中立国监察委员会派遣中立国机动视察人员进行调查，但均因这些要求与停战协定的规定不符而为中立国监察委员会所否决，美方进行诬蔑掩饰其违反停战协定的种种非法行为的伎俩从而遭到了可耻的失败。但美方却于二月十九日致函中立国监察委员会，把朝中方面之向中立国监察委员会揭穿美方无耻伎俩说成是干涉与侵犯了中立国监察委员会及美方的权利，并对中立国监察委员会进行无理的指责与威吓，对此，军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将于二月二十三日致函美方严加驳斥。李相朝中将二月二十三日函全文如下：军事停战委员会联合国军方面首席委员拉西少将：
    我收到了中立国监察委员会送来你二月十九日致中立国监察委员会的信件的副本，那封信里充满了诬蔑和歪曲甚至还对中立国监察委员会进行了威吓，因此对你二月十九日致中立国监察委员会的信加以驳斥和揭露是必要的。你方多次诬控我方违反停战协定，要求派遣中立国机动视察小组进行调查，均因与停战协定不符而为中立国监察委员会所否决。你方诬控的目的在于把中立国监察委员会降为你方的工具来掩盖你方违反停战协定的罪行，以蒙骗世界人民，并借此制造紧张局势。对于你方的这一企图我曾经迭次予以无情的揭露和驳斥，你方既找不出任何事实和论据来为你方辩护粉饰，你遂不得不在你二月十九日的信里企图将你方诬控的失败转为诬蔑我方干涉与侵犯了中立国监察委员会及你方的权利，并进而指责中立国监察委员会否决了你方的诬控要求。但是事实不能更改，任何诬蔑、歪曲和蒙骗都是注定要失败决不会成功的。
    我方一贯严格遵守和执行停战协定，这是举世周知也是中立国监察委员会和中立国视察小组所公开承认的，你方的任何诬蔑与歪曲都不能改变这个事实。一九五三年十月派赴义州机场的中立国机动视察小组的调查结果，更充分证明了你方的这些指控毫无事实根据，是彻头彻尾的捏造。
    正如我在一九五四年一月十九日、一月二十七日和二月十二日致中立国监察委员会及你的信里所指出的，事实上违反停战协定的正是你方。你方违反停战协定和中立国遣返委员会的职权范围，破坏解释工作，大批强迫扣留我方被俘人员是举世周知、人人愤慨的事实，你方的作战飞机和军事人员侵入我方地区进行敌对行为，自停战以来不断发生，我方曾在军事停战委员会和双方秘书长会上迭次提出了明确的材料。你方违反停战协定、阻挠联合红十字会小组的工作，甚至对联合红十字会小组工作人员施放瓦斯进行殴击，中立国监察委员会曾在调查后加以证实。停战刚生效不久，你方就违反停战协定非法运进一百零六门迫击炮，违反一对一替换的规定；超额运入某些类型的作战飞机，并拒不报告属于替换的作战飞机的副型，企图借此破坏一对一、同种类、同性能替换的基础。这些都经中立国监察委员会在其关于监察轮换替换的分析报告里明确指出。你方关于零件的处理更是露骨。你方一面公然违反停战协定拒不向军事停战委员会和中立国监察委员会报告零件的运入；一面则拖延会议上的讨论不予解决，并进而企图片面中断关于零件问题的讨论，以便干脆回避停战协定所规定的义务。一九五三年九月二十八日军事停战委员会通过“关于监督与报告到达与离开朝鲜的军事人员与替换物件的办法”，但你方至今在南方口岸并不完全按照该办法提出报告。一九五三年十一月二十八日军事停战委员会通过关于作战飞机的定义，但你方对有些作战飞机至今仍然不提出报告。这些都是对于停战协定和双方协议的公然违反。
    正是因为你方有意地不断违反停战协定和双方协议，你方对于中立国监察委员会在南方的中立国视察小组便多方加以阻挠和干涉。你方在一九五四年一月二十日及二十一日禁止中立国视察小组进入仁川港口进行视察工作。你方指使你方提供给中立国视察小组的附属人员干涉小组人员的工作。你方所提供的附属人员甚至公然殴打大邱小组的瑞典工作人员拉尔逊上尉。你方甚至对许多中立国视察小组的人员进行收买、辱骂和威吓等无耻挑衅行为，并在一九五三年九月九日在江陵机场公然劫持中立国视察小组的波兰工作人员哈都克耶维赤。你方在南方各口岸拒绝打开装有军用物资的箱子，并拒绝让中立国小组人员上船进行视察，使中立国监察委员会的工作遭到很大的障碍。这些事实难以一一列举，中立国监察委员会的记录、报告及其它文件中都有详明的记载可以查考。
    事实完全清楚：我方一贯严格遵守并执行停战协定和双方协议，而你方则不断违反停战协定和双方协议，并一面企图把中立国监察委员会降为你方欺骗世界人民的工具，一面对中立国监察委员会的工作多方加以阻挠。正是由于这样的情况，你才害怕我方的驳斥和揭露，因而在你二月十九日的信里武断地声称，只有你方有权违反停战协定和双方协议，并对我方肆意进行诬蔑，而我方却不应该揭露事实真象。我方迭次揭露事实真象使你方的阴谋破产，正是为了维护中立国监察委员会的义务与权利，你却企图把我方这些揭露事实真象的文件说成是对于中立国监察委员会和你方的权利的侵犯和干涉，这种荒谬可笑的说法不仅是枉费心机，而且更加说明了你方的强词夺理，欲盖弥彰。尤其必须指出的是你在你二月十九日的信里还提到中立国监察委员会“继续存在的唯一的理由”，这是你方多次企图利用中立国监察委员会而遭到失败以后对于中立国监察委员会所采取的新的威吓手段，你方这种公然威吓中立国监察委员会的做法完全拆穿了你方的伪装关心中立国监察委员会的义务和权利的假惺惺的态度。
    为了稳定朝鲜停战以谋取朝鲜问题的和平解决，你方必须立即停止你方违反停战协定的行为，严格执行停战协定和双方协议，并公开交代以往的违反停战协定的行为，停止对中立国监察委员会的阻挠、干涉、玩弄与威吓军事停战委员会。
