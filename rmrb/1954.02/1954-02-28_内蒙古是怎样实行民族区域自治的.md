How Inner Mongolia Implements National Regional Autonomy
Zhou Ming Zhang Lu

Inner Mongolia's national regional autonomy began to be conceived and implemented shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945, and it has been more than eight years now. Over the past eight years, on the general track of the Chinese people's revolution, under the guidance of the great and correct national policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Inner Mongolia has been built into a national autonomous region with a relatively large scale, a long history, and under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. Its construction process can be roughly divided into three periods.
　　(1) From the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Association to the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government (from after Japan's surrender to April 1947). This period was a period of extensively and deeply publicizing the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party, cultivating a large number of ethnic cadres, boldly mobilizing the masses, strengthening the people's strength, and preparing for the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government. In November 1945, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Association was established in Zhangjiakou, carried out mass work in the Xilin Gol League and Chahar League areas, and dissolved the so-called "Inner Mongolia Republic Provisional Government" headed by the Mongolian traitor Buyantai Dalai. On April 3, 1946, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, representatives from eastern and western Mongolia held a meeting in Chengde, reached a consensus on the relationship between the liberation of the Inner Mongolian nationality and the Chinese people's revolution, abolished the Eastern Mongolia Autonomous Government, unified the autonomous movement, and ended the centuries-long division in Inner Mongolian history. After more than a year of autonomous movement, the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference was held in Ulanhot in April 1947. At the meeting, the people's revolutionary line won victory. After democratic elections by representatives, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government, headed by Comrade Ulanhu, was established.
　　(2) From the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government to the founding of the People's Republic of China (May 1, 1947 to October 1949). This period was a period of mobilizing the people to defeat the attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and defend the victorious fruits of the Inner Mongolia people, and it was the period of the great Liberation War. During this period, a united front policy of broadly uniting people of all ethnic groups and strata was formulated and implemented to consolidate national regional autonomy; the old army was transformed into a people's cavalry, which cooperated with the Chinese People's Liberation Army to defeat the Kuomintang bandit gang's frenzied attacks and defend the victorious fruits of the Inner Mongolia people. In order to support the war and improve the people's lives, land reform was carried out in agricultural areas between 1947 and 1948 according to the people's demands, and a large-scale production movement was launched, and agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movements were developed; in pastoral areas, the policies of "free grazing, increasing livestock and protecting livestock," "no struggle, no division, no class demarcation," and "benefits for both herdsmen and herd owners" were implemented, and herdsmen's mutual aid and cooperation were organized, and pastoral production was developed. At the same time, a policy of freedom of religious belief was implemented, temple property was protected, lamas were encouraged to attend school, participate in labor and practice medicine, and lamas were called upon to participate in the patriotic movement.
　　The achievements in this period were the main ones, but there were also some deviations. In particular, in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, due to the influence of the land reform movement in agricultural areas, some cadres in some areas once put forward slogans such as "the tiller owns the land," "the herdsman owns the livestock," and "the resident owns the house." Although they were quickly corrected, the work suffered certain losses as a result.
　　(3) From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the present. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the entire territory of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was liberated. This is a period of large-scale construction carried out by the people of Inner Mongolia on the track of the general line and general task of the state and under the unified policies and steps of the central government. The Central People's Government, based on the national policy of the Common Program, has given correct leadership and great assistance to the construction of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the political, economic, cultural and other aspects, so various constructions have made great progress in the past four years. In addition, through the movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, "three-anti," "five-anti," and increasing production and practicing economy, the people's love for the motherland has been further enhanced, the people's hatred for U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been aroused, patriotism and internationalism have been further promoted, social order has been unprecedentedly stable, and the work enthusiasm of state personnel has been further improved. At present, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are carrying out an increase production and practice economy campaign to further build the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
　　In the process of implementing national regional autonomy and building the autonomous region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has carried out the following main tasks.
　　First, a people's democratic united front policy of uniting people of all ethnic groups and strata was adopted, and an autonomous democratic regime was established to unite all possible people who opposed U.S. imperialism, opposed the Kuomintang reactionaries, and supported democracy and the implementation of national regional autonomy, in order to realize regional autonomy and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship in the autonomous region.
　　In order to implement this policy, first of all, the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in Inner Mongolia was insisted on, and the error of bourgeois nationalism that attempted to replace the Chinese Communist Party with the "People's Revolutionary Party" was opposed; it was insisted that the Inner Mongolia revolution was an inseparable part of the Chinese revolution, and the error of national separatism and national isolationism that attempted to isolate the Inner Mongolia revolution from the Chinese revolution in order to weaken and defeat it was opposed; it was insisted on the policy of winning the help of fraternal ethnic groups, mainly the Han nationality, especially the Han cadres, and the error of xenophobia, which did not distinguish between the reactionary ruling class, the exploiting class, and the working people of the Han nationality, was opposed. At the same time, a policy of boldly mobilizing the masses was adopted, and special attention was paid to the cultivation and training of young intellectuals. Through a group of pure young intellectuals with revolutionary enthusiasm, the ethnic policy of the Communist Party was widely spread among the broad masses of the people, thereby defeating all deceptive propaganda and establishing a solid mass base for the national regional autonomy movement. In addition, a policy of steadily carrying out democratic reforms was insisted on, and the erroneous arguments such as "Inner Mongolia's society is special and there is no need to carry out democratic reforms" and "Inner Mongolia's society has no class and there is no need to carry out land reform" were opposed. According to the people's demands, necessary democratic reforms were steadily carried out. First, land reform was carried out in agricultural areas, eliminating the landlord class, and "free grazing" was implemented in pastoral areas, abolishing feudal privileges and emancipating farmers and herdsmen from feudal political and economic rule and exploitation. In these democratic reforms, steady progress was repeatedly emphasized, so although errors occurred in some areas, they were corrected relatively quickly.
　　Second, the old army was transformed into a people's army, and all the people were mobilized to defeat the attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army and protect the safety of the Inner Mongolia people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the old army was thoroughly transformed into an army of the Inner Mongolia people by means of strengthening political work and carrying out ideological transformation, and it actively participated in the people's liberation war against U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. This army once participated in battles such as the "Changchun-Shenyang," "Liaoxi-Shenyang," and "Pingjin", and underwent severe tests and training in the war. After the nationwide liberation, this army also took on the task of suppressing bandits, and through political disintegration and military suppression, it eliminated the bandits in Inner Mongolia, and has now become a strong component of the Chinese People's Liberation Army that can take on the task of defending the security of the motherland.
　　During the great People's Liberation War, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the CPC and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government led the people to wage a resolute struggle against the betrayal of national interests by those who advocated "neutrality" and "withdrawal from the civil war" and actively participated in and supported the just liberation war. The army and people cooperated closely in combat, defeated the attacks of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army, and defended the cause of national regional autonomy in Inner Mongolia.
　　The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have made great contributions to the Liberation War, and many outstanding figures have emerged. Among the Mongolians was Bai Yinma, a young woman from Chahar League, who remained unyielding when she was killed by the Kuomintang bandit army and defended the dignity of the Inner Mongolia people with her blood. On Naiman Mountain, there were the famous heroes led by Company Commander Wun Batu who sacrificed their lives to fight against the invasion of the Kuomintang bandit army. Their heroic spirit will always be remembered by the Inner Mongolia people. Among the Han people were the female combat hero Guo Junqing and Martyr Xu Hanlin, who gave his life to blow up the enemy's bunker and was commemorated by the people of the whole country. Their heroic achievements will always be remembered in the hearts of the people of Inner Mongolia and the whole country. The people of Inner Mongolia participated in the Liberation War and defended the interests of the motherland and the people of Inner Mongolia. The war also educated the people of Inner Mongolia, strengthened the unity between the Mongolian and Han people, and proved that the interests of the people of Inner Mongolia are inseparable from the interests of the people of the whole of China.
　　Third, develop production, carry out trade and supply and marketing cooperation and material exchange work, and improve people's lives. After land reform in rural areas and the abolition of feudal privileges in pastoral areas, the production enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen was unprecedentedly high. The Autonomous Region People's Government formulated and implemented various production policies based on the different economic conditions. In agriculture, the policy of "organizing" was implemented, and the policy of encouraging intensive cultivation and increasing the yield per unit area was put forward. At the same time, a patriotic production increase competition was launched, which greatly increased agricultural production. In animal husbandry, the call of "prosperity for both people and livestock" was put forward, and the policies of "free grazing, increasing livestock and protecting livestock," "no struggle, no division, no class demarcation," the implementation of the policy of "benefits for both herdsmen and herd owners," and the development of mutual aid and cooperation among working herdsmen and the promotion of settled nomadic policies. In semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the policies of "prohibiting reclamation and protecting pastures," the planned and step-by-step development of animal husbandry production, and the organization of mutual support for industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, especially the policy of agriculture supporting animal husbandry, and light tax policies. The correct implementation of these policies enabled agriculture and animal husbandry to achieve rapid recovery and development. The region's grain output in 1953 exceeded the highest pre-war annual output by 25%. Before liberation, Guandong Che Village in Keshenketeng Banner, Zhaowuda League, had a maximum grain output of 1,000 *shi* (石), but in 1951 it produced more than 3,000 *shi*. At present, there are more than 8 million head of livestock in the region, more than double the number at the time of liberation. Da Xideligele, an old villager in Hulunbuir League, only had 140 sheep in 1946, but in 1953 he owned 1,500 sheep.
　　In terms of trade cooperation, the policy of greatly developing and enlivening the exchange of agricultural and livestock materials between urban and rural areas was implemented. First of all, state-owned trading institutions were vigorously established, and supply and marketing cooperatives serving the vast number of farmers and herdsmen were systematically and universally organized, enlivening the exchange of materials in towns, villages, grasslands, and solving the difficulties of farmers and herdsmen in purchasing and selling, and restricting and banning the past unfair exchange of goods by illegal merchants to the Mongolian people. At present, state-owned trade and cooperatives have penetrated into vast rural areas, grasslands and forest areas. In 1947, there was only one state-owned trade institution, but in 1952 it had increased to 171 units, and the number of supply and marketing cooperative members had reached 1.09 million, accounting for more than 40% of the total population. State-owned trade institutions and cooperatives implemented a policy of plannedly increasing the prices of agricultural products and animal products and reducing the price scissors between industrial products and agricultural and animal products, and purchased a large number of farmers' grain and other by-products and herdsmen's fur and livestock; at the same time, they transported a large number of production tools and daily necessities such as grain, cloth, tea, and tobacco to farmers and herdsmen, reducing the intermediate exploitation of farmers and herdsmen's commodity transactions. In 1947, one ton of sorghum in agricultural areas could only be exchanged for 54 *chi* (尺) of cloth, but in 1951 it increased to more than 359 *chi* of cloth; in pastoral areas, one medium-sized horse could be exchanged for 171 *chi* of twill in 1949, but in 1952 it could be exchanged for more than 900 *chi*. The purchasing power of farmers and herdsmen increased nearly four times in the four years from 1947 to 1951. The lives of farmers and herdsmen have been significantly improved. Since 1948, Xianfeng Village in Tongliao County, Jerim League, has purchased a total of 116 head of cattle, horses, and mules, 109 carts, and built 120 new houses. In the grasslands, most yurts have been replaced with brand-new felt. At the Nadaam Conference in Hulunbuir League in 1952, herdsman Tabuden bought daily necessities worth 4.8 million yuan at one time.
　　In addition to agricultural and animal husbandry production and trade cooperation, attention was also paid to the development of forestry logging industry and other small-scale industries serving agricultural and animal husbandry production, and underground mineral resources are being prospected to prepare for the development of large-scale industries in the future.
　　Fourth, along with the development of economic construction, people's cultural, educational and health work has been carried out. In cultural and educational work, special attention has been paid to the development of ethnic languages ​​and characters, the universal improvement of people's cultural level, and the training of technical talents. In the past, under the reactionary rule, national culture was extremely seriously devastated. The reactionary rulers restricted the working people from going to school, resulting in an illiteracy rate of more than 90% of the population, causing extreme backwardness in Inner Mongolian national culture. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, primary and secondary schools have greatly developed, and children of working people have had the opportunity to receive education. At present, there are more than 3,700 primary schools, 30 secondary schools and secondary technical schools, and three higher education institutions (including one Mongolian language specialized school) in the entire autonomous region. In Mongolian schools, Mongolian language and writing are generally used for teaching. Translation work has also made great progress in recent years. In 1952, the Mongolian single-volume edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was published, enriching the content of the political and cultural life of the Inner Mongolian nationality. Mongolian newspapers and periodicals include Mongolian "Inner Mongolia Daily", "Ximeng Herdsman News", "Inner Mongolia Pictorial", "Inner Mongolia Propagandist" and other types. The second channel of Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station has regular Mongolian broadcast programs every day. In terms of health work, the policy of "prosperity for both people and livestock" was implemented and various corresponding tasks were carried out. In recent years, a large number of health cadres have been trained, and the number of health personnel at all levels in the region has increased by 63 times compared with before liberation; sexually transmitted diseases have been generally treated in some areas, other infectious diseases have been prevented and controlled, and maternal and child health work has been greatly improved. Before liberation, Inner Mongolia had no health facilities to serve the people at all, and syphilis seriously threatened the survival of the Inner Mongolian nationality. The population situation was an inverted pyramid: the older the population, the more there were, and the younger the population, the fewer there were. Now, after the herdsmen suffering from syphilis have been treated, people who have been unable to walk for more than ten years can walk again, and many women who have never given birth have also had children. For example, the birth-death ratio in Chenbalhu Banner in 1949 was 100 to 130; after syphilis was eradicated, by 1951, the birth-death ratio had changed to 100 to 61. The population in pastoral areas has stopped declining and has begun to rise, giving the Inner Mongolian nationality the atmosphere of "population prosperity."
　　Fifth, vigorously cultivate ethnic cadres and local cadres. This is a fundamental key to Inner Mongolia's ability to do a good job in recent years. Under the policy of universally cultivating, extensively cultivating and boldly promoting and using them, more than 30,000 cadres of various ethnic groups who have close ties with the people have been cultivated in recent years. In addition to ethnic cadres, a group of local Han cadres have also been cultivated, which is also a valuable backbone for doing a good job in Inner Mongolia. Regarding cadre training, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has adopted a method of combining old cadres taking apprentices as the foundation and training. At the beginning, it was training, and then they were sent out to work. After working for a period of time, they were trained again; or they were trained in the course of work. Training, work, retraining, and re-working, learning at work, and improving at work and learning, make the broad masses of cadres progress day by day.
　　Sixth, propaganda and education work on Marxism-Leninism, especially on the party's policies and guidelines, has been carried out among cadres and the masses of the people. In the early stage, cadres were organized to universally study Chairman Mao's works "Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy" and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, so that the broad masses of cadres understood the nature and tasks of the Chinese revolution and the relationship between the Inner Mongolia revolution and the Chinese revolution, and criticized the errors of great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism. After that, taking the Yugoslav incident as a lesson, patriotic and internationalist education was carried out, so that cadres fundamentally understood many basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on ethnic issues. Later, after the promulgation of the Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China, another ethnic policy study movement was launched, and leading cadres checked past ethnic work during this study.
　　Seventh, with the development of various tasks, the Communist Party has been developed, and the organizations of trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation and other people's organizations have been established, and the construction of people's armed forces began in 1950. Through these tasks, the organization and awareness of the masses of the people have been greatly strengthened and improved, which has played a role in promoting and ensuring various tasks.
　　As a result of the implementation of national regional autonomy, the ethnic relations in Inner Mongolia and the production and life of the various ethnic groups have undergone fundamental changes. The old ethnic relations of ethnic oppression and discrimination caused by the ruling class in the past between fraternal ethnic groups, especially between the Mongolian and Han nationalities, have been changed into new ethnic relations of ethnic equality, close unity, mutual assistance, and common development. Within the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, all ethnic groups have equal rights to participate in politics. The representatives of the People's Representative Conference are elected according to the proportion of the population. In order to take care of the minority ethnic groups, it was stipulated that minority ethnic groups with less than one-third of the population will send one-half of the representatives, those with less than one-fifth of the population will send one-third of the representatives, those with more than one-tenth of the population will send one-fifth of the representatives, and those with less than one-tenth will send at least one representative. This enables ethnic groups with a larger population to have representatives in the construction of political power that are roughly commensurate with the population of their ethnic group; it also prevents minority ethnic groups from losing their right to participate in political power due to their small population. National regional autonomy has also been implemented in ethnic minority areas. The Oroqen nationality living in the Greater Khingan Mountains has established a national autonomous banner.
　　The change in ethnic relations is manifested not only in politics but also in production. In the past, Chahar League was a region with deep divisions between Mongolians and Han Chinese and deep contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry. Due to the correct implementation of ethnic policies, new changes have taken place in ethnic relations in production. In 1951, Shangdu and Xianghuang Banner in Chahar League suffered a severe drought, and livestock could not survive the winter, and the lives of herdsmen were greatly threatened. At this time, the Han farmers in Huade and Baochang carried forward the spirit of high ethnic friendship, automatically prepared houses and sheds for the herdsmen, and welcomed them to spend the winter, which greatly solved the production difficulties of the herdsmen. In order to thank the farmers for their help, in July 1952, the herdsmen specially organized a consolation team, bringing dairy products and curd produced by themselves, to Huade and Baochang to visit the Han farmers. In Keyouqian Banner, Xing'an League, the Mongolian-Han joint production mutual aid group of Li Jinming and the mutual aid group of Mongolian, Han, and Korean farmers of Bayantebusge Gacha, farmers of all ethnic groups learned rice cultivation, dryland farming, and grazing techniques in the spirit of mutual assistance. They worked closely together like a family. As a result of political and production unity and cooperation, a new spirit of helping each other in times of difficulty and sharing weal and woe has emerged among the various ethnic groups. In 1953, when the Mongolian and Solon people of Altanutuke, Moridawa Banner, suffered a flood, the Han people of Taiping Nutuke automatically rushed to the rescue overnight and brought rice and flour to express their condolences; when the Korean people of Hangguerhe Nutuke suffered a flood, the Mongolian and Han people of Buxi District immediately rushed to the rescue, and 130 Korean disaster victims were well settled. When the Korean disaster victims returned, the Mongolian and Han people automatically donated money and prepared a lot of food.
　　The unity within the Mongolian nationality has also been greatly strengthened. In the past, in the era of feudal separatism, there were deep divisions within the nation, and there was no unity between them. The livestock of one banner could not be grazed in another banner. After the abolition of feudal privileges in pastoral areas, the implementation of the "free grazing" policy, and the patriotic and internationalist education of close unity and development of production, the Mongolian working people realized the harm of the past divisions within the nation. Now they have united closely and eliminated mutual discrimination between local and "foreign" areas. Pastures can be widely adjusted and used, and herdsmen can graze freely. In the winter of 1952, hundreds of thousands of livestock in the pastoral areas of Hulunbuir League moved to different banners for grazing and were able to spend the winter safely. This kind of thing had never happened in history.
　　After Suiyuan Province was placed under the jurisdiction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a unified Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with Guisui as its center and an area of ​​more than one million square kilometers was formed. At this point, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of further construction. The cadres and people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are better strengthening their unity, following Chairman Mao's instructions on the general line and general tasks of the state's transition period, gradually developing the autonomous region's economic construction, and at the same time developing political, cultural, educational and health undertakings, eliminating the backwardness in all aspects left over from history, and working together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country to build a great socialist industrialized motherland and strive for a gradual transition to a socialist society.

    内蒙古是怎样实行民族区域自治的
    周明　张鲁
    内蒙古民族区域自治，从一九四五年日本投降后不久即开始酝酿实行，到现在已经八年多了。八年来，在中国人民革命的总轨道上，在中国共产党和毛主席的伟大的正确的民族政策指导之下，内蒙古已建设成为全国规模较大、历史较久的、在中央人民政府统一领导下的一个民族自治区。其建设过程大体上可分三个时期。
      （一）从内蒙古自治运动联合会成立到内蒙古自治区人民政府成立的时期（日本投降后到一九四七年四月）。这个时期是广泛深入地宣传中国共产党的民族政策，大量培养民族干部，放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，准备建立内蒙古自治区人民政府的时期。一九四五年十一月，内蒙古自治运动联合会成立于张家口，开展了锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟地区的群众工作，解散了以蒙奸补英达赉为首的所谓“内蒙古共和国临时政府”。一九四六年四月三日，在中国共产党的领导与帮助下，东西蒙的代表在承德举行了会议，对内蒙古民族的解放与中国人民革命的关系问题取得了一致认识，取消了东蒙自治政府，把自治运动统一了起来，结束了内蒙古历史上数百年来的分裂局面。经过了一年多的自治运动，至一九四七年四月，在乌兰浩特召开了内蒙古人民代表会议。会议上人民革命路线取得了胜利，经过代表民主选举，成立了以乌兰夫同志为首的内蒙古自治区人民政府。
    （二）内蒙古自治区人民政府成立后到中华人民共和国成立的时期（一九四七年五月一日到一九四九年十月）。这个时期是发动人民打垮蒋匪军进攻，保卫内蒙人民胜利果实的时期，是伟大的解放战争时期。这个时期制订并执行了广泛团结各民族、各阶层人民的统一战线政策，以巩固民族区域自治；改造旧军队使之成为一支人民骑兵，配合中国人民解放军打垮了国民党匪帮的疯狂进攻，保卫了内蒙人民的胜利果实。为了支援战争和改善人民生活，按照人民的要求，在一九四七年到一九四八年间，在农业区进行了土地改革，并开展了大生产运动和发展了农业生产互助合作运动；在牧业区实行了“自由放牧、增畜保畜”“不斗不分、不划阶级”与“牧工、牧主两利”政策，并组织牧民互助合作，发展了牧业生产。同时实行了信教自由的政策，保护庙产，奖励喇嘛入学、参加劳动与行医，号召喇嘛参加爱国运动。
    这个时期成绩是主要的，但也出了些偏差。特别是半农半牧区由于农业区土地改革运动的影响，部分地区的少数干部曾提出过“耕者有其田”、
  “牧者有其畜”、“住者有其房”的口号，虽然很快即予以纠正，但因此曾使工作受到了一定损失。
    （三）中华人民共和国成立到现在。中华人民共和国成立之后，内蒙古自治区全境得到解放。这是内蒙人民在国家总路线总任务的轨道上，在中央统一政策、统一步调下进行大规模建设的时期。中央人民政府根据共同纲领的民族政策，对内蒙古自治区政治、经济、文化等项建设事业，给予了正确的领导与大力的帮助，因而四年多来各种建设均有了长足的进步。再加以经过抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”、增产节约等运动，更增强了人民对祖国的热爱，激发了人民对美帝国主义与蒋匪帮的憎恨，爱国主义与国际主义精神更加高涨，社会秩序空前稳定，国家工作人员的工作积极性更加提高。目前内蒙古自治区各族人民正在开展增产节约竞赛运动，进一步建设内蒙古自治区。
    在实行民族区域自治和建设自治区的过程中，内蒙古自治区进行了如下的主要工作。
    首先，采取了团结各民族、各阶层的人民民主统一战线政策，建立了自治的民主政权，把反对美帝国主义、反对国民党反动派以及赞成民主与实行民族区域自治的一切可能团结的人都团结起来，以实现区域自治，巩固自治区的人民民主专政。
    为了贯彻这一政策，首先坚持了中国共产党对内蒙古的领导，反对了那些企图用“人民革命党”来代替中国共产党的、实质上是资产阶级的民族主义的错误；坚持了内蒙革命是中国革命的不可分离的一部分，反对了那些企图把内蒙革命从中国革命孤立出来以削弱内蒙革命、使内蒙革命失败的民族分裂主义和民族孤立主义的错误；坚持了争取兄弟民族，主要是汉族，特别是汉族干部的帮助的方针，反对了那些排外主义的、不区别汉族的反动的统治阶级、剥削阶级与汉族的劳动人民的错误。同时又采取了放手发动群众的方针，特别注意了对青年知识分子的培养与训练。通过一批纯洁的有革命热情的青年知识分子，共产党的民族政策在广大人民群众中得以广泛传播，从而击败了一切欺骗宣传，使民族区域自治运动建立了雄厚的群众基础。此外，又坚持了稳步地进行民主改革的方针，反对了
  “内蒙社会特殊，不必进行民主改革”、“内蒙社会无阶级不必进行土地改革”等错误论调，按照人民的要求，稳步地进行了必要的民主改革。首先是农业区进行了土地改革，消灭了地主阶级，牧业区实行了“自由放牧”，废除了封建特权，使农牧民从封建的政治经济统治剥削下获得解放。在这些民主改革中，再三强调稳步进行，因此，虽然曾在部分地区发生过错误，但都较迅速地纠正了。
    其次，是改造旧军队为人民军队，动员全体人民打退蒋匪军的进攻，保卫内蒙人民的安全。在中国共产党的领导下，用加强政治工作、进行思想改造的办法，把旧军队彻底改造成为一支内蒙古人民的军队，并积极地参加了反对美帝国主义和蒋匪军的人民解放战争。这支军队曾经配合兄弟部队参加了“长沈”、“辽西”、“平张”等战役，在战争中经受了严重的考验和锻炼。全国解放之后，这支部队又担负了剿匪的任务，经过政治瓦解与军事清剿，肃清了内蒙境内的土匪，现在已成为能够担负起保卫祖国安全的坚强的中国人民解放军的一个组成部分。
    在伟大的人民解放战争时期，中共内蒙党委与内蒙古自治区人民政府，领导着全体人民与那些主张“中立”“退出内战”的投降主义者的叛卖民族利益的行为，做了坚决的斗争，积极地参加和支持了正义的解放战争，军民密切配合作战，打垮了蒋匪军的进攻，保卫了内蒙古民族区域自治的事业。
    内蒙蒙汉各族人民曾经对解放战争作了伟大的贡献，并出现了许多优秀人物。在蒙族中有察哈尔盟的女青年白音玛，当她被国民党匪军杀害时，坚贞不屈，用鲜血维护了内蒙人民的尊严。在奈曼山上，出现了著名的以乌恩巴图连长为首的为打击国民党匪军的侵犯而牺牲的英雄们，他们的英雄气概，将永远为内蒙人民所记忆。在汉族中，有女战斗英雄郭俊卿，有舍身炸敌堡为全国人民所纪念的徐汉林烈士，他们的英雄业绩将永远记在内蒙和全国人民的心中。内蒙人民参加了解放战争，保卫了祖国和内蒙人民的利益，战争又教育了内蒙人民，加强了蒙汉人民的团结，证明了内蒙人民的利益是和全中国人民的利益不可分割的。
    第三，发展生产，开展贸易供销合作与物资交流工作，改善人民生活。经过农村土地改革，牧区废除封建特权之后，农牧民的生产情绪空前提高，自治区人民政府根据各种经济的不同情况，制订并实行了各项生产政策。在农业上贯彻了“组织起来”的方针，提出奖励精耕细作，提高单位面积产量的政策，同时开展了爱国增产竞赛运动，因而大大提高了农业生产量。牧业上提出了“人畜两旺”的号召，贯彻了“自由放牧、增畜保畜”“不斗不分、不划阶级”实行“牧工、牧主两利”的政策，及发展劳动牧民的互助合作和提倡定居游牧的政策。在半农半牧区则实行了“禁止开荒、保护牧场”、有计划有步骤地发展牧业生产的政策，以及组织工、农、牧业的相互支援，特别是以农助牧政策和轻税政策。这些政策的正确贯彻，使农牧业获得迅速的恢复和发展，全区的粮食产量一九五三年已超过战前最高年产量百分之二十五。昭乌达盟克什克腾旗关东车村，解放前全村最多打过一千石粮，而一九五一年打了三千多石。目前全区已有八百余万头牲畜，较解放时增加了一倍多。呼纳盟达喜德力格勒老乡，一九四六年才有一百四十只羊，一九五三年已拥有一千五百只了。
    贸易合作方面，贯彻了大量发展与活跃城乡农牧物资交流的方针。首先大力建立了国营贸易机构，并有步骤地普遍组织了为广大农牧民服务的供销合作社，活跃了城镇、农村、草地的物资交流，解决了农牧民购销的困难，限制与取缔了过去不法商人对蒙古人民严重的不等价交换。目前国营贸易与合作社已深入广大的农村、草地和林区。一九四七年国营贸易机构还只有一处，一九五二年已增至一百七十一个单位，供销合作社社员已达一百零九万人，约占总人口的百分之四十以上。国营贸易机构和合作社执行了有计划地提高农产品与畜产品的价格、缩小工业品与农产品、畜产品之间的剪刀差的政策，大批收购农民的粮食及其他副产品和牧民的皮毛牲畜；同时，输送给农牧民大量的生产工具和粮、布、茶、烟等生活必需品，减少了农牧民商品交易上的中间剥削。一九四七年农业区一吨高粱只能换五十四尺布，一九五一年即提高到三百五十九尺多布；牧区一匹中等马一九四九年换一百七十一尺斜纹布，一九五二年便可换到九百多尺。农牧民的购买力从一九四七年到一九五一年的四年间，提高将近四倍。农牧民的生活得到了显著的改善。哲里木盟通辽县先锋村自一九四八年开始到现在，全村共计买进牛、马、骡一百一十六头，车一百零九辆，盖新房一百二十间。在草地里多数蒙古包都换上了崭新的毡子。一九五二年呼纳盟那达慕大会上，牧民塔不登一次就买了价值四百八十万元的日用物品。
    除农牧业生产与贸易合作事业外，还注意发展了森林采伐工业与其它为农牧业生产服务的小型工业，并正着手勘察地下的矿产，为将来发展大的工业作准备。
    第四，随着经济建设的发展，开展了人民的文教卫生工作。在文教工作方面，特别注意了发展民族语言文字和普遍提高人民文化水平、培养技术人材的工作。过去在反动统治时代，民族文化受到了极端严重的摧残。反动统治者限制劳动人民上学，致文盲占人口的百分之九十以上，造成内蒙民族文化的极度落后。自治区人民政府成立后，中小学校大大发展，劳动人民的子弟都有了受教育的机会。目前全自治区有小学校三千七百多所，中等学校和中等技术学校三十所，高等学校三所（其中有蒙文专科学校一所）。在蒙古族学校里面，普遍使用蒙古语文进行教学。语文翻译工作，几年来也有很大发展。一九五二年出版了“毛泽东选集”的蒙文单行本，丰富了内蒙古民族政治和文化生活的内容。蒙文报刊有蒙文“内蒙古日报”、“锡盟牧民报”、“内蒙画报”、“内蒙古宣传员”等多种。内蒙人民广播电台第二台每天有固定的蒙语广播节目。在卫生工作方面，执行了“人畜两旺”的政策和进行了与此相适应的各项工作，几年来培养了大批卫生干部，全区各级卫生人员比解放前增加了六十三倍；在部分地区普遍治疗了性病，防治了其它传染病并大大改进了妇幼卫生工作。解放以前，内蒙古根本没有为人民服务的卫生设备，梅毒严重地威胁着内蒙古民族的生存。人口的状况是倒装金字塔：越年老的越多，越年幼的越少。现在，患梅毒的牧民经过治疗以后，十几年不能走路的人也能走路了，过去从未生育的妇女，有不少人也生了孩子。如陈巴尔虎旗一九四九年生死比例是一百比一百三十；经过驱梅以后，到一九五一年，生死比例已经变为一百比六十一了。牧业区人口已从停止下降进而开始上升，使内蒙古民族开始有“人口兴旺”的气象。
    第五，大力培养民族干部和地方干部。这是内蒙几年来能以做好工作的一个根本关键。在普遍大量培养和放手提拔使用的方针下，几年来已培养出了与人民群众有密切联系的各民族干部三万余人。除了民族干部外，还培养了一批当地的汉族干部，这同样是做好内蒙工作的宝贵骨干。关于干部培养，内蒙古自治区采取了以老干部为基础带徒弟和训练相结合的方法。开头是训练，然后派出去工作，工作一个时期后又训练；或者在工作中培养训练。训练、工作、再训练、再工作，在工作中学习，在工作和学习中提高，就使广大干部一天一天更加进步。
    第六，在干部和人民群众中进行了马克思列宁主义特别是关于党的政策方针的宣传教育工作。初期是组织干部普遍学习毛主席著的“中国革命和中国共产党”“新民主主义论”与毛主席的民族政策，使广大干部懂得了中国革命的性质、任务和内蒙革命与中国革命的关系，批判了大民族主义与狭隘民族主义的错误。其后是以南斯拉夫事件为教训，开展了爱国主义与国际主义的教育，使干部从根本上理解了许多马克思列宁主义民族问题的基本道理。再后，中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要公布后，又开展了一个民族政策的学习运动，领导干部并在这个学习中检查了过去的民族工作。
    第七，随着各种工作的开展，发展了共产党，建立了工会、青年团、妇联和其它人民团体的组织，并于一九五○年开始进行了人民武装的建设工作。经过这些工作，大大加强与提高了人民群众的组织性和觉悟程度，对各种工作起了推进和保证的作用。
    实行民族区域自治的结果，内蒙的民族关系和各民族的生产和生活的面貌已发生了根本性的变化。兄弟民族之间，特别是蒙汉民族之间，已由过去统治阶级所造成的民族间压迫歧视的旧民族关系，改变为民族平等、亲密团结、互相帮助、共同发展的新的民族关系。在内蒙古自治区境内，各民族都有平等的参政权利。人民代表会议的代表按人口的比例选举，为了照顾少数，曾规定少数民族不到三分之一人口者，出二分之一的代表，不到五分之一人口者，出三分之一的代表，十分之一以上者，出五分之一的代表，十分之一以下者，最少出代表一人。这就使人数较多的民族在政权建设上有与其民族人口大体相适应的代表；又使少数民族不致因人口少而失去参加政权的权利。在少数民族聚居区并实行了民族区域自治，居住在大兴安岭的鄂伦春族已建立起民族自治旗。
    民族关系的改变，不但在政治上而且在生产上也表现出来。察哈尔盟过去是蒙汉隔阂、农牧矛盾很深的地区，由于正确地贯彻了民族政策，民族关系在生产上发生了新的变化。一九五一年察哈尔盟商都、镶黄旗遭受严重旱灾，牲畜过不了冬，牧民生活受到很大威胁。这时化德、宝昌的汉族农民发扬了高度的民族友爱精神，自动为牧民准备了房子和圈棚，欢迎他们来过冬，使牧民的生产困难得到很好的解决。为了答谢农民的帮助，一九五二年七月间，牧民还特地组织了慰劳队，带着自己生产的奶皮和奶豆腐，到化德、宝昌去慰问汉族农民兄弟。在兴安盟科右前旗，李金铭的蒙汉联合生产互助组及白音特布斯格嘎查的蒙、汉、朝鲜族农民的互助组，各族农民都在互相帮助的精神下，学会了种水稻、种旱田和放牧等技术，他们亲密合作，像一家人一样。政治上、生产上团结合作的结果，各民族间出现了患难相扶、同甘共苦的新精神。一九五三年当莫力达瓦旗阿尔拉努图克的蒙族和索伦族人民遭到水灾时，太平努图克的汉族人民自动连夜去抢救，并带着米面去慰问；汗古尔河努图克的朝鲜族人民遭水灾，布西区的蒙、汉族人民立即去车救援，使一百三十名朝鲜族灾民得到很好的安置。当朝鲜族灾民返回时，蒙汉族人民又自动捐钱，并准备了很多食物。
   　蒙古民族内部的团结也大大加强了。过去在封建割据时代，民族内部存在着很深的隔阂，相互间不团结，这一旗的牲畜不能到那一旗去放牧。在牧区废除了封建特权，施行了“自由放牧”政策，并进行了亲密团结、发展生产的爱国主义与国际主义教育后，蒙古劳动人民认识了过去民族内部隔阂的坏处，现在他们已经紧密地团结起来，消除了本地与“外地”之间的互相歧视，牧场可以广为调剂使用，牧民可以自由放牧了。一九五二年冬，呼纳盟牧业区就有几十万头牲畜在旗与旗之间移场放牧，得以安全过冬。这种事情在历史上是不曾有过的。
    绥远省划归内蒙古自治区以后，以归绥为中心的、面积达百万余平方公里的、统一的内蒙古自治区形成了。至此，内蒙古自治区进入了进一步建设的新阶段。内蒙古自治区各族干部和人民，正在更好的加强团结，遵照毛主席关于国家过渡时期总路线和总任务的指示，逐步发展自治区的经济建设，同时发展政治和文教卫生事业，消灭历史上遗留下来的各方面的落后状态，与全国各族人民一道，建设社会主义工业化的伟大祖国，为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
