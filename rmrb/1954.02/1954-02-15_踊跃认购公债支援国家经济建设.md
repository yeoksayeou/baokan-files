Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Bonds to Support National Economic Construction
Use your savings to buy national bonds and let the country use them to develop industry

A letter from Qin Yuanhong of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: Hao Yusheng, the bugler in our unit, that young man who is disabled in one hand but is always full of energy, ran to our associate's office to subscribe to one million yuan of national bonds. He took out the money and put it on the table, and then said, "This is the allowance I have been saving since July last year, plus the disability pension I recently received. We have food and clothing here, what's the point of keeping the money on me? Buy national bonds and let the country use it to develop national industry."

Hao Yusheng suffered a lot in the past: In the twelfth lunar month of 1939, Hao Yusheng's father was forced to death by the landlord. Hao Yusheng, only nine years old, had to go to the landlord's house to work. He suffered from cold and hunger and worked hard, and soon fell ill. The landlord was afraid of paying for the coffin, so he drove him out. He crawled back barefoot and in thin clothes in the snow like knife blades, step by step. It was not until he was fifteen years old that the Eighth Route Army came, and Hao Yusheng saw the light of day. He resolutely joined the revolutionary army. He made a second-class merit in the Baoji battle; and a third-class merit in the suppression of bandits in the Southwest. Unfortunately, one of his hands was disabled in a battle, but he was so optimistic and still happily dedicated his strength for the benefit of the people. At this time, our associate held his hand tightly. Hao Yusheng said with a smile: "I will continue to save from all aspects in the future to accumulate capital for the country's industrial construction."

Our convalescents also contribute
a bit of strength to national construction

A letter from Shi Yingjie, Gao Xinghai, Wei Liuzhu, and Su Tingfang of the Logistics and Health Department of the North China Military Region: We are soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but we have been lying in bed for convalescence for more than two years. The leadership takes very good care of us. However, when we hear the good news from the national economic construction front, we think that the people of the whole country are actively producing, and we feel anxious and uneasy just lying here for convalescence.

We were so happy to hear the news of the issuance of national bonds. We always thought about how to contribute to the country's economic construction, and buying national bonds is really a good opportunity. The four of us immediately bought one million two hundred thousand. Old Wei accounted for one million of it. He said: "I have been convalescing for almost three years now, and the expenses are all borne by the leadership. Although my allowance is not much, I usually save it up. This time, the issuance of national bonds allows us convalescents to contribute a bit of strength to national construction."

"Let us convalescents also contribute a bit of strength to national construction!" Old Wei's words expressed the hearts of the four of us. We have now each bought a pair of headphones, and in the afternoon we listen exclusively to the broadcast programs about learning the general line. We must study the general line well, and we must concentrate on recuperating and strive to recover our health as soon as possible. At that time, we will work together with everyone to actively dedicate more strength to the construction of the motherland.

For the sake of national construction, for ourselves
future happiness

A letter from Huang Ruiming and Guo Hongli of the Beijing Petroleum Geological Exploration School: Peng Shouyi, the school doctor in our school, subscribed to ten million yuan of national bonds. This matter spread in the school. Someone talked to her about it, and she said: "This money was saved by my husband over many years before his death. Of course, if this money is used on myself, my life will be more comfortable. However, the better the motherland is built, the better the lives of the people of the whole country will be. My whole family has received the kind care of the motherland and deeply understands how lovable the motherland is. I buy national bonds for the construction of the motherland, which is also for my own future happiness. Don't look at my age, I will still live to see socialist society!"

Peng Shouyi is a 52-year-old returned overseas Chinese. After their family returned to China in 1950, they received the kind care of the People's Government and deeply felt how warm life was in the motherland where the people are the masters. Now her eldest son has joined the army, her second son is a glorious Communist Party member, and her daughter has also been approved as a member of the Communist Youth League. Her husband, Cai Xiguang, worked as a school doctor in our school after returning to China and unfortunately passed away in October last year. At the time of his death, he repeatedly said to Peng Shouyi: "I love these young students, and I hope you will inherit my work." After Peng Shouyi came to work at our school, she was very concerned about the health of the students. This time, her patriotic action of actively purchasing national bonds has made the students even more respect and love her.

For the sake of all the people of the country to live a happy life as soon as possible

A letter from Ye Boxiang of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union: In February last year, I learned from Comrade Bo Yibo's "Report on the National Budget for 1953" that the state was going to issue national bonds. Since then, I have been saving my extra money in preparation. For more than four years since liberation, with the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, my personal income has also gradually increased, and my life has also improved. I remember when I first started working, I only had one quilt, but soon I added a new one; last year I moved into a new dormitory and bought a bicycle. In addition to my own living expenses and a portion that I send to my mother every month, I can save a portion of my income in the bank. Sometimes I also plan to use this money, but I always feel that it is not right to excessively improve my living enjoyment. Especially after studying the general line, I felt extremely excited that the great prospect of the motherland's socialist industrialization was in sight. I thought: The large-scale economic construction of the motherland requires everyone to carry forward the spirit of hard work. If I covet excessive personal enjoyment and waste money, how ashamed and ridiculous it would be! Buying national bonds and investing the money in the motherland's construction cause is for the sake of industrializing the motherland as soon as possible, which is also for the sake of making the people live a happy life as soon as possible. Now, in addition to first using all my savings of two million eight hundred thousand to buy national bonds, I also plan to use the one million two hundred thousand that I may save in the next few months to buy national bonds.

As long as the country is well built, individual life
is guaranteed

A letter from Xie Yuquan of the Hangzhou Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Department Store: Gao Shuanglin, the warehouse keeper in our agency, subscribed to one million yuan of national economic construction bonds. This money was saved by him before the announcement of the issuance of national bonds for "personal construction". Before liberation, Gao Shuanglin often couldn't find work, and his family had no food or clothing, and his life was very miserable. After liberation, he and his brother both joined the workforce, and his sister-in-law also entered the factory, and their family life immediately improved. He said: "I have suffered and been frightened in the past, and now I should save some money." So, he planned to save a sum of money month by month.

When the news of the issuance of national bonds came, he was stunned: "Is it necessary to invest this money in the national construction cause?" The lighthouse of the general line illuminated his heart, and he finally realized that "as long as the country is well built, individual life is guaranteed." Therefore, he took one million yuan from his savings to buy national bonds, leaving only a portion of the money to prepare for the purchase of daily necessities.

Women should also buy national bonds to support national
construction

A letter from reader Jiang Xinghua: After the women in Qidaogou Street, Tonghua City, heard the news of the issuance of national bonds, they actively subscribed. The woman Lü Changrong recalled the painful life of not having enough to eat and wear during the puppet Manchu regime, and said: "Now I can live a good life, thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; in the future, when the country is well built, our lives will get better and better. Although my husband bought 100,000 yuan, our women must participate in national construction just like men. I will take 100,000 yuan from my income from making parts and sewing clothes for others to subscribe to national bonds. I have bought national bonds once in the past, and now the principal has been repaid and I have received interest. In this way, buying national bonds not only helps the country's construction but also facilitates personal savings, which is really a win-win situation. Our women must enthusiastically subscribe." The twelve women in our entire street subscribed to a total of 420,000 yuan. They unanimously said: Although the amount of money for buying national bonds is not much, we have contributed our hearts to support the country's economic construction according to our own economic strength.

### 踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设

    踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设
    把积余的钱买公债，让国家用来发展工业
    中国人民解放军某部秦元洪来信：我们部队里的司号长郝玉生，那个残废了一只手，却终日精神饱满的小伙子，跑到我们协理员的办公室认购了一百万元公债。他掏出钱来放在桌上，接着说：“这是我从去年七月开始储蓄起来的津贴费，加上最近发下的残废金。这儿有吃有穿，钱放在身上干啥，买公债，让国家用来发展国家工业。”
    郝玉生过去受的苦可不少：一九三九年的腊月天气，郝玉生的爹被地主逼死了。才九岁的郝玉生不得不到地主家去干活。他受冻挨饿出力气，不久便得了病。地主怕贴棺材，把他赶了出来。他赤脚、单衣，在刀片子似的雪花中一步一步地爬着回去。好容易熬到十五岁，八路军来了，郝玉生才见了天日。他坚决地参加了革命军队。在宝鸡作战中，他立下了二等功；在西南剿匪时，又立下三等功。他的一只手不幸在一次战役中残废了，可是他是多么乐观，仍然愉快地为了人民的利益而献出自己的力量。这时，我们协理员紧紧地握了握他的手。郝玉生笑容满面地说：“我今后还要从各方面来节约，为国家积累工业建设的本钱。”
    我们休养员也为祖国建设
        使上一分力
    华北军区后勤卫生部施英杰、高兴海、魏留柱、苏廷芳来信：我们是中国人民解放军的战士，但躺在床上休养已经有二年多了。上级对我们照顾得非常好。可是，当我们听到祖国经济建设战线上传来的捷报时，就想到全国人民都在积极生产，而我们光躺着休养，真觉得焦急和不安。
    听到发行公债的消息后，我们四个人可高兴了。往日里总想着怎样给祖国经济建设尽一分力，如今买公债，这可真是个好机会。我们四个立即买了一百二十万。这里头，老魏占了一百万。他说：“我休养到现在快三年了，费用都是上级负担，我自己所得的津贴虽不多，平时都积储起来了。这次发行公债，可让我们休养员也为祖国建设使上一分力。”
    “让我们休养员也为祖国建设使上一分力！”老魏这话，可道出了我们四个人的心意。我们现在每人买了一付耳机子，下午就专听关于学习总路线的广播节目。我们一定好好学习总路线，并且要安心养病，争取早日恢复健康。那时，我们将和大家一起，积极为祖国的建设而献出更多的力量。
    为了祖国建设，为了自己
        未来的幸福
    北京石油地质探勘学校黄锐铭、郭宏礼来信：我们学校里的校医彭寿仪认购了一千万元的公债。这事在学校里传开了。有人和她谈起这件事，她说：“这笔钱是我丈夫生前多年积蓄下来的。当然，把这钱用到自己身上，自己生活会过得更舒服。但是，祖国能建设得更好，全国人民的生活也就会更好。我全家都受到祖国的亲切照顾，深深体会到祖国的可爱。我买公债是为了祖国建设，也就是为自己未来的幸福。别看我年纪大啦，我还会过到社会主义社会的生活呢！”
    彭寿仪是一个五十二岁的归国华侨。她们全家在一九五○年回国后，受到人民政府的亲切的照顾，深深感到在人民当家作主的祖国生活是如何的温暖。如今她的大儿子参了军，二儿子是光荣的共产党员，女儿也被批准为青年团员了。她的丈夫蔡锡光，回国后就在我们学校里当校医，不幸在去年十月去世了。临终时，他再三对彭寿仪说：“我热爱这群青年学生，望你继承我的工作。”彭寿仪到我校工作后，非常关心同学们的健康。这次，她积极购买公债的爱国行动，使同学们更加尊敬和爱戴她了。
    为了全国人民早日过幸福生活
    中国邮电工会山东省委员会叶伯翔来信：去年二月，我从薄一波同志“关于一九五三年国家预算的报告”中知道了国家要发行公债。从那时起，我就把多余的钱积蓄起来准备着。解放后四年多以来，随着国家经济的迅速恢复和发展，我个人的收入也逐步提高了，生活也改善了。想起我刚参加工作时只有一条被，不久就添置了新的；去年我搬进了新宿舍，还买了一辆脚踏车。我的收入，除了自己生活费用和每月寄给母亲一部分外，还能多余一部分存在银行里。有时我心里也打算动用这些钱，但总觉得过分提高生活享受是不应该的。特别是学了总路线，感到祖国社会主义工业化的这个伟大远景已经在望，兴奋极了。我想：祖国大规模经济建设需要每个人发扬艰苦努力的精神，我如果贪图个人过高的生活享受，把钱浪费，这是多么惭愧可笑！买公债，把钱投到祖国建设事业中去，使祖国早日工业化，也就是为了使人民早日过幸福生活。现在，我除了先把我全部存款二百八十万元买公债外，还准备有计划地把今后几个月内可能积余下来的一百二十万元也买公债。
    只要国家建设好了，个人生活
        就有保障
    中国百货公司杭州采购供应站谢玉泉来信：我们机关的仓库保管员高双林认购了一百万元国家经济建设公债。这笔钱，是他在发行公债的消息公布以前，为了“个人建设”而储蓄起来的。解放前，高双林经常找不到活干，一家吃穿无着，光景很惨。解放后，他和哥哥都参加了工作，嫂子也进了工厂，一家生活马上改善了。他说：“以往受苦受怕了，现在该存一些钱。”于是，就有计划地逐月积蓄起一批钱来。
    公债发行的消息传来时，他可愣住了：“是不是要让这笔钱投到国家建设事业中去呢？”总路线的灯塔照亮了他的心，他最后终于认识了“只要国家建设好了，个人生活就有保障。”于是，他就在存款中拿了一百万元买公债，只留下一部分钱准备添置生活必需品。
    妇女也要买公债，支援国家
        建设
      读者姜星华来信：通化市七道沟街妇女听到发行公债的消息后，都积极认购。妇女吕长荣想起在伪满时吃不饱、穿不暖的痛苦生活，说：“现在我能过好日子，都亏得共产党、毛主席领导得好；今后国家建设好了，我们的生活也就越来越好，虽我的丈夫买了十万元，但我们妇女也要和男人一样来参加国家建设。我要从给别人作零件、缝衣服的收入中拿出十万元认购公债。过去我也曾买过一次公债，现在已经还了本，又拿了利息。这样，买了公债既帮助国家建设，又便于个人储蓄，真是一举两得，我们妇女一定踊跃认购。”我们全街十二个妇女一共认购了四十二万元。她们一致说：买公债的钱数虽然不多，但我们根据自己的经济力量，支援国家经济建设，尽了我们的心意。
