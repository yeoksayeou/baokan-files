Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Bonds to Support National Economic Construction
Use your savings to buy national bonds and let the country use them to develop industry

A letter from Qin Yuanhong of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: Hao Yusheng, the bugler in our unit, that young man who is disabled in one hand but is always full of energy, ran to our associate's office to subscribe to one million yuan of national bonds. He took out the money and put it on the table, and then said, "This is the allowance I have been saving since July last year, plus the disability pension I recently received. We have food and clothing here, what's the point of keeping the money on me? Buy national bonds and let the country use it to develop national industry."

Hao Yusheng suffered a lot in the past: In the twelfth lunar month of 1939, Hao Yusheng's father was forced to death by the landlord. Hao Yusheng, only nine years old, had to go to the landlord's house to work. He suffered from cold and hunger and worked hard, and soon fell ill. The landlord was afraid of paying for the coffin, so he drove him out. He crawled back barefoot and in thin clothes in the snow like knife blades, step by step. It was not until he was fifteen years old that the Eighth Route Army came, and Hao Yusheng saw the light of day. He resolutely joined the revolutionary army. He made a second-class merit in the Baoji battle; and a third-class merit in the suppression of bandits in the Southwest. Unfortunately, one of his hands was disabled in a battle, but he was so optimistic and still happily dedicated his strength for the benefit of the people. At this time, our associate held his hand tightly. Hao Yusheng said with a smile: "I will continue to save from all aspects in the future to accumulate capital for the country's industrial construction."

Our convalescents also contribute
a bit of strength to national construction

A letter from Shi Yingjie, Gao Xinghai, Wei Liuzhu, and Su Tingfang of the Logistics and Health Department of the North China Military Region: We are soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but we have been lying in bed for convalescence for more than two years. The leadership takes very good care of us. However, when we hear the good news from the national economic construction front, we think that the people of the whole country are actively producing, and we feel anxious and uneasy just lying here for convalescence.

We were so happy to hear the news of the issuance of national bonds. We always thought about how to contribute to the country's economic construction, and buying national bonds is really a good opportunity. The four of us immediately bought one million two hundred thousand. Old Wei accounted for one million of it. He said: "I have been convalescing for almost three years now, and the expenses are all borne by the leadership. Although my allowance is not much, I usually save it up. This time, the issuance of national bonds allows us convalescents to contribute a bit of strength to national construction."

"Let us convalescents also contribute a bit of strength to national construction!" Old Wei's words expressed the hearts of the four of us. We have now each bought a pair of headphones, and in the afternoon we listen exclusively to the broadcast programs about learning the general line. We must study the general line well, and we must concentrate on recuperating and strive to recover our health as soon as possible. At that time, we will work together with everyone to actively dedicate more strength to the construction of the motherland.

For the sake of national construction, for ourselves
future happiness

A letter from Huang Ruiming and Guo Hongli of the Beijing Petroleum Geological Exploration School: Peng Shouyi, the school doctor in our school, subscribed to ten million yuan of national bonds. This matter spread in the school. Someone talked to her about it, and she said: "This money was saved by my husband over many years before his death. Of course, if this money is used on myself, my life will be more comfortable. However, the better the motherland is built, the better the lives of the people of the whole country will be. My whole family has received the kind care of the motherland and deeply understands how lovable the motherland is. I buy national bonds for the construction of the motherland, which is also for my own future happiness. Don't look at my age, I will still live to see socialist society!"

Peng Shouyi is a 52-year-old returned overseas Chinese. After their family returned to China in 1950, they received the kind care of the People's Government and deeply felt how warm life was in the motherland where the people are the masters. Now her eldest son has joined the army, her second son is a glorious Communist Party member, and her daughter has also been approved as a member of the Communist Youth League. Her husband, Cai Xiguang, worked as a school doctor in our school after returning to China and unfortunately passed away in October last year. At the time of his death, he repeatedly said to Peng Shouyi: "I love these young students, and I hope you will inherit my work." After Peng Shouyi came to work at our school, she was very concerned about the health of the students. This time, her patriotic action of actively purchasing national bonds has made the students even more respect and love her.

For the sake of all the people of the country to live a happy life as soon as possible

A letter from Ye Boxiang of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union: In February last year, I learned from Comrade Bo Yibo's "Report on the National Budget for 1953" that the state was going to issue national bonds. Since then, I have been saving my extra money in preparation. For more than four years since liberation, with the rapid recovery and development of the national economy, my personal income has also gradually increased, and my life has also improved. I remember when I first started working, I only had one quilt, but soon I added a new one; last year I moved into a new dormitory and bought a bicycle. In addition to my own living expenses and a portion that I send to my mother every month, I can save a portion of my income in the bank. Sometimes I also plan to use this money, but I always feel that it is not right to excessively improve my living enjoyment. Especially after studying the general line, I felt extremely excited that the great prospect of the motherland's socialist industrialization was in sight. I thought: The large-scale economic construction of the motherland requires everyone to carry forward the spirit of hard work. If I covet excessive personal enjoyment and waste money, how ashamed and ridiculous it would be! Buying national bonds and investing the money in the motherland's construction cause is for the sake of industrializing the motherland as soon as possible, which is also for the sake of making the people live a happy life as soon as possible. Now, in addition to first using all my savings of two million eight hundred thousand to buy national bonds, I also plan to use the one million two hundred thousand that I may save in the next few months to buy national bonds.

As long as the country is well built, individual life
is guaranteed

A letter from Xie Yuquan of the Hangzhou Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Department Store: Gao Shuanglin, the warehouse keeper in our agency, subscribed to one million yuan of national economic construction bonds. This money was saved by him before the announcement of the issuance of national bonds for "personal construction". Before liberation, Gao Shuanglin often couldn't find work, and his family had no food or clothing, and his life was very miserable. After liberation, he and his brother both joined the workforce, and his sister-in-law also entered the factory, and their family life immediately improved. He said: "I have suffered and been frightened in the past, and now I should save some money." So, he planned to save a sum of money month by month.

When the news of the issuance of national bonds came, he was stunned: "Is it necessary to invest this money in the national construction cause?" The lighthouse of the general line illuminated his heart, and he finally realized that "as long as the country is well built, individual life is guaranteed." Therefore, he took one million yuan from his savings to buy national bonds, leaving only a portion of the money to prepare for the purchase of daily necessities.

Women should also buy national bonds to support national
construction

A letter from reader Jiang Xinghua: After the women in Qidaogou Street, Tonghua City, heard the news of the issuance of national bonds, they actively subscribed. The woman LÃ¼ Changrong recalled the painful life of not having enough to eat and wear during the puppet Manchu regime, and said: "Now I can live a good life, thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao; in the future, when the country is well built, our lives will get better and better. Although my husband bought 100,000 yuan, our women must participate in national construction just like men. I will take 100,000 yuan from my income from making parts and sewing clothes for others to subscribe to national bonds. I have bought national bonds once in the past, and now the principal has been repaid and I have received interest. In this way, buying national bonds not only helps the country's construction but also facilitates personal savings, which is really a win-win situation. Our women must enthusiastically subscribe." The twelve women in our entire street subscribed to a total of 420,000 yuan. They unanimously said: Although the amount of money for buying national bonds is not much, we have contributed our hearts to support the country's economic construction according to our own economic strength.
