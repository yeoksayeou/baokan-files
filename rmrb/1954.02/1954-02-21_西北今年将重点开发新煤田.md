To meet the ever-increasing demand for coal in industry, the Northwest Coal Mining Administration will continue to strengthen geological exploration this year and has decided to start renovating old mines and building new ones. It is estimated that after these projects are completed, coal production will be more than three times higher than in 1953.

The Northwest Coal Mining Geological Exploration force previously had a very weak foundation. In 1953, the Bureau established a geological survey team and a drilling team in Tongchuan, Shaanxi, and Aganzhen, Gansu, respectively. In October of the same year, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Coal Mine Administration Bureau, in order to accelerate the development of coal deposits in the Northwest, transferred two drilling teams from the Northeast to strengthen the geological exploration force in the Northwest coalfields. Over the past year, the geological survey teams and exploration teams affiliated with the Northwest Coal Mining Administration have conducted geological reconnaissance, detailed surveys, and precision surveys in Tongchuan, Shaanxi, and Aganzhen, Gansu, respectively, completing geological surveys and topographic surveys of more than 100 square kilometers. The drilling projects completed 114.78% of the annual task, and the core recovery rate of rock and coal both exceeded the national standards. It is estimated that the above two locations have reserves of approximately 20 million to 30 million tons.

Based on the increasing demand for industrial coal in the Northwest, the Northwest Coal Mining Administration will devote great efforts to focusing on developing new coalfields in 1954. The workload of geological exploration and drilling will be even heavier, with the planned topographic and geological survey this year being approximately three times that of 1953, and drilling projects increasing by approximately one and a half times. At the same time, it will also concentrate its main efforts on the renovation projects of existing mines and the construction projects of new mines. Currently, geological reports and drilling design data from Shaanxi, Gansu, and other regions are nearing completion. It is expected that the project task books for the new construction and renovation projects in these two regions will be delivered to the construction units in mid-March, and construction engineering teams will be established in Shaanxi, Gansu, and other regions. Capable cadres will be assigned to each construction unit to plan for the preparation work before construction.

### 西北今年将重点开发新煤田

    西北今年将重点开发新煤田
    西北煤矿管理局为满足工业用煤不断增长的需要，今年将继续加强地质勘探，并决定开始改建旧井和建设新井。预计这些工程完成后，煤的产量将比一九五三年提高三倍以上。
    西北煤矿地质勘探力量以往的基础非常薄弱。一九五三年该局在陕西铜川和甘肃阿干镇两地各建立了一支地质调查队和钻探队。同年十月，中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局为加速开发西北煤藏，又由东北调来两个钻探队伍，壮大和加强了西北煤田地质勘探的力量。一年来，西北煤矿管理局所属地质调查队和勘探队，分别在陕西铜川和甘肃阿干镇两地进行了地质普查、详查和精查工作，完成了一百多平方公里的地质调查和地形测量任务，钻探工程完成了全年任务百分之一百一十四点七八，岩、煤芯采取率均超过了国家规定的标准。上述两地据估计约有二千万吨到三千万吨的储藏量。
    根据西北工业用煤的不断增长，西北煤矿管理局一九五四年将用很大力量有重点的开发新煤田。地质勘察、钻探工作量将更加繁重，计划今年地形地质的调查约等于一九五三年的三倍，钻探工程约增加一倍半。同时，还将集中主要力量进行现有矿井的改建工程和新矿井的建设工程。现在，陕西、甘肃等地的地质报告和钻探设计资料即将完成，预计三月中旬可将这两地的新建和改建工程计划任务书交到施工单位，并将建立陕、甘等地区的建井工程队，为各建井单位配备得力干部，以筹划施工前的准备工作。
