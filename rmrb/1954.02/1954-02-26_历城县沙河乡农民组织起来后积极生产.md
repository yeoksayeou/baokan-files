Farmers in Shahe Township, Licheng County, Actively Produce After Organizing

The nine newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Shahe Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, were all completed by the end of January this year. After the leading cadres of the cooperatives were initially assigned their duties, they organized the agricultural and sideline production teams of each cooperative and quickly transitioned into winter production. At the same time, they began to formulate production plans for the entire year of 1954 and for the spring season, preparing for spring production. Currently, there are a total of ten cooperatives in the township, including the original Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative. In order to plant various crops in a planned and localized manner this year, each cooperative has conducted surveys of land quality, surveys of the quantity of various crops to be planted in each production season throughout the year. The labor, animal power, fertilizer, and seeds required for each production season throughout the year have also been carefully calculated. Specific inspections have been made of existing fertilizers, seeds, and farm implements. At present, each cooperative is actively accumulating fertilizer, adjusting seeds, and repairing farm implements while also seizing the time before spring plowing to actively repair land, build water conservancy projects, and engage in various sideline productions.

In the process of establishing new cooperatives, expanding old cooperatives, and consolidating mutual aid groups, Shahe Township promptly promoted the Party's general line during the transition period to the farmers and conducted production education, making the farmers understand that in order to live a better life than they do now, they must participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and take the socialist road; they must actively produce. During discussions on how to build a socialist society, farmer Li Shengzhong said, "A socialist society is not something that comes by waiting; we must work hard. Only by working harder in the fields and applying more fertilizer can we harvest more grain. Tractors have to be dug out with hoes; they don't fall from the sky." Farmer Guo Shoubin said, "To reach a socialist society, we must produce in a regular manner (referring to planned production), without exploitation, without lazy people, and everyone must unite to turn yellow soil into gold."

During the discussions, the farmers automatically examined their own work attitudes. Jia Minggui, a member of the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative, had planned to make fourteen grass sacks per day in the sideline production plan she made last fall, but she checked and found that she had only made four hundred in eighty days. She said, "I can only complete one day's plan in three days. Chairman Mao calls on us to work hard. At the rate I'm working, when will we reach a socialist society! I must work harder from now on and strive to complete thirty days' worth of production plans in twenty-nine days." Some members of the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative did not go to the fields early in the morning last year. Wang Chaoguang, a member of the cooperative, criticized this, saying, "We must strive to achieve a socialist society as soon as possible, and we must change the habit of not going to the fields early in the morning. A production team of fourteen people has five tasks assigned each day. If we don't do the morning task, isn't that like having three people resting all the time? This year, everyone must go to the fields early in the morning to complete the production plan ahead of schedule and strive to reach a socialist society as soon as possible."

In order to strive for the early arrival of a socialist society, the farmers of Shahe Township are working extra hard this year. Every morning before dawn or at ten o'clock at night, one often encounters people taking advantage of the moonlight to collect manure. The nine newly established agricultural production cooperatives have all reached more than ninety percent of the area that should be cultivated for winter plowing and have also leveled sixteen mu and five fen of land. The Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative has reached one hundred percent of the winter plowing area, and nine mu of land have been improved. In order to strive for a bumper harvest in the entire year of 1954, a fertilizer accumulation campaign has been launched throughout the township. The nine newly established agricultural production cooperatives have already pulled 1,225 carts of soil. The Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative can accumulate 620 carts of soil fertilizer, 40 carts of dry ash fertilizer, and 20 carts of urine-soil fertilizer by the end of February. Last year, they applied an average of four carts of soil fertilizer per mu as base fertilizer; this year, they will apply eight carts per mu. The Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative alone can save 20,000 jin of grain for buying chemical fertilizer this year and will also ensure that the land is more fertile than last year.

The farmers of Shahe Township are working hard in all aspects to increase income and prepare funds to expand agricultural production. Sideline production is the main source of income for the farmers of Shahe Township and supports agricultural production. All 101 grass sack making machines in the township are in operation. The Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to buy ten head of livestock this year. Their two sideline production teams have 26 grass sack making machines. Making 10,000 grass sacks can yield a net profit of 10 million yuan, which is enough to buy ten head of livestock. Currently, they have already made 8,000 grass sacks. The newly established Shahe Township Woodworking Handicraft Production Cooperative completed an order of 1,000 pieces of equipment before October last year. They have also signed a contract with the four district supply and marketing cooperatives of Licheng County to manufacture 1,600 pieces of farm implements, which are about to be completed soon.

The farmers of Shahe Township understand that building a socialist society is a long-term, arduous, and glorious undertaking. Starting last year, they are carrying out water conservancy construction work in a planned manner. Even in the deep winter, members of the Wang Chaoyou Agricultural Production Cooperative and members of other cooperatives and mutual aid groups braved wind and snow to begin building a canal and a small stone bridge about six li southeast of Shahe Township. In three years, this project will benefit 150 mu (large mu, each mu is equivalent to 2.61 mu) of land in Shahe Township. (Zhang Rongan)

    历城县沙河乡农民组织起来后积极生产
    山东省历城县沙河乡新建立的九个农业生产合作社，已在今年一月底全部建成。社的领导干部初步分工后，便把各社农、副业生产队编好，很快转入了冬季生产；同时开始制订一九五四年全年的和春季的生产计划，为春季生产作了准备。现在全乡连原有的王朝佑农业生产合作社共十个社。为了在今年有计划地因地制宜种植各种庄稼，各社已经进行了土地质量排队、全年各生产季节种植各种农作物数量的排队；全年各生产季节所需的人工、畜力、肥料、种籽也都计算妥当；对现有的肥料、种籽、农具都作了具体的检查。目前各社一面积极进行积肥、调剂种籽、修理农具，一面抓紧春耕前这段时间，积极修整土地、兴修水利和进行各种副业生产。
    沙河乡在建立新社、扩大旧社和整顿互助组的过程中，及时对农民宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，进行生产教育，使农民们了解到要过比现在更美好的光景，就要参加互助合作组织走社会主义的道路；就要积极生产。在讨论如何建设社会主义社会时，农民李盛中说：“社会主义社会不是等来的，得要下劲干。只有在田里多加工、多上粪，才能多打粮食。拖拉机要用镢头刨出来，不能从天上掉下来。”农民郭守斌说：“要到达社会主义社会，就得规规矩矩的生产（指有计划的生产），没有剥削，没有懒汉，大家团结起来劳动把黄土变成金子。”
    在讨论中，农民们自动检查了自己的劳动态度。王朝佑农业生产合作社社员贾明桂去年秋天订的副业生产计划是每天打十四个草包，她检查了
  一下，八十天却只打了四百个。她说：“我一天的计划，三天才能完成，毛主席号召我们努力干，照我这样劳动，什么时候才能到达社会主义社会！我往后一定要加劲干，争取二十九天完成三十天的生产计划。”王朝佑农业生产合作社有些社员去年早晨不下地，社员王朝广提出批评说：“咱们要争取社会主义社会早实现，得要改改早晨不下地的毛病。一个生产小队十四个人，每天规定五段活，早晨这一段不干，这不就是经常有三个人歇着吗？今年咱们每个人早晨都下地，要提前完成生产计划，争取早日到达社会主义社会。”
    为着争取社会主义社会早到来，沙河乡农民今年生产格外起劲了。每天早晨天不亮或夜里十来点钟，时常碰到有人趁着月色拾粪。九个新办的农业生产合作社，今年的冬耕地都到达应耕面积的百分之九十以上，还修平土地十六亩五分。王朝佑农业生产合作社冬耕地到达百分之百，有九亩地改良了土壤。为着争取一九五四年全年丰收，全乡开展了积肥运动。九个新办的农业生产合作社已拉土一千二百二十五车。王朝佑农业生产合作社到二月底可积土肥六百二十车，积干灰肥四十车，积尿土肥二十车。去年他们平均每亩地上土肥四车作基肥，今年每亩地要上八车。光王朝佑农业生产合作社今年就可以节省买化学肥料的粮食两万斤，还要保证土地比去年肥壮。
    沙河乡农民正从各方面努力增加收入，准备扩大农业生产的资金。副业生产是沙河乡农民增加收入，支援农业生产的主要来源。全乡一百零一架打草包机正开动着。王朝佑农业生产合作社计划今年买十头牲口，他们的两个副业队，有二十六架打草包机，打一万个草包能得纯利一千万元，就足够买十头牲口了，目前他们已经打了八千个草包。新成立的沙河乡木器手工业生产合作社去年十月前就完成了一千件机关订货。他们又和历城县四个区供销合作社订立了制造一千六百件农具的合同，眼看又快全部完成了。
    沙河乡农民懂得了建设社会主义社会是长期、艰苦的光荣事业，他们从去年开始，正有计划地进行水利建设工作。还在深冬的时候，王朝佑农业生产合作社社员和别的社的社员、互助组组员们冒着风雪，在沙河乡东南约六里的地方，开始修建一道水渠和一座小石桥。三年后这项工程可使沙河乡有一百五十亩（大亩，每亩合二亩六分一厘）土地得到好处。　（张荣安）
