    How the Xuan Yumin Agricultural Cooperative Improved Relations with the Masses
    Chen Chang, Wu Guanghuan

    Last year, the Xuan Yumin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yingshoubaozi Village, Liaoyang County, Liaodong Province, earnestly studied the mutual aid and cooperation policies, actively united the masses to improve production, thoroughly changed its past style of being divorced from the masses, and truly established prestige among the masses.

      The Model Mutual Aid Team Became Divorced from the Masses
    In 1952, when the Xuan Yumin Agricultural Production Cooperative was still a mutual aid team, it had a very poor relationship with the masses for a time. Many team members thought, "We are a model mutual aid team led by a provincial cotton planting model, famous throughout the province." Therefore, they behaved arrogantly in front of the masses. Liu Hongzhang, the Chinese Communist Party village branch secretary, also led a mutual aid team, but the members of the Xuan Yumin team looked down on them. Cadres from the Northeast Region, province, county, and district came directly to the Xuan Yumin team, making other mutual aid teams very "envious." Reports often published the model deeds of the Xuan Yumin team, and almost all mutual aid teams in the county learned from them, but the farmers in their own village did not. Some said, "You be your model, no one will learn from you!" Especially because some farmers did not understand the agricultural burden policy, after the cotton field production was set, they all said, "It was caused by the cotton planting model, otherwise the output wouldn't have been set so high." They complained that Xuan Yumin made them pay more public grain. Sometimes, when Xuan Yumin heard the masses talking about them behind their backs, he criticized the masses for having "backward ideas" and "taking the road of rich peasants," which made the masses even more dissatisfied. Their interactions with the masses became less and less. The team's livestock were full in the pen, but even if some of the masses had difficulty pushing the millstone, they rarely came to borrow. Some of the masses said, "People's big mutual aid team is beyond our reach, and besides, there are too many opinions, if you are OK he might not be!" Sometimes, when the masses were chatting together, the team members would pass by, and they would stop talking. The team members were puzzled, searching for the root cause of the problem. Xuan Yumin said, "Where is the problem? It's obvious that there are different paths of development, this is a struggle!" With this statement, the real root cause could not be found, and a model mutual aid team became seriously divorced from the masses.

      The Root Cause Was Found
    Last spring, starting with the Xuan Yumin mutual aid team's transition to a cooperative, the Chinese Communist Party district committee discovered this situation and clearly recognized the importance of mutual aid teams and cooperatives uniting the masses. They understood that cultivating models in isolation would inevitably lead to separation from the masses, because models come from the masses and are models for the masses, not models for the government. The district committee understood these principles. During the transition to a cooperative, the district committee secretary, Jiang Yonghan, personally took charge, patiently educating the village branch secretary and party members, making them realize that the party's central task in rural areas was to lead mutual aid and cooperation, improve production, and cultivate models, use model examples to educate farmers, and help models lead the masses. In this way, these policies were first correctly understood within the village branch. Later, the district committee conducted political education in the cooperative on "uniting the masses, improving production, and improving relations with the masses." The district committee also focused on publicizing the mutual aid and cooperation policy and the burden policy to the masses in the village. This improved the political and ideological awareness of the masses, changed their view of the Xuan Yumin Cooperative, and made them understand the burden policy, so they no longer complained about Xuan Yumin. At the same time, the members of the cooperative realized that they were wrong to be divorced from the masses. They found that the root cause of their past problems was: they had not taken the initiative to unite the masses in all aspects, and to help other mutual aid teams, individual farmers, especially poor households, to improve production. Branch secretary Liu Hongzhang also examined the shortcomings of the branch's past relaxation of leadership.

    The Party Branch Strengthened Leadership
    After branch secretary Liu Hongzhang ideologically recognized that the party's central task in rural areas was to lead production and mutual aid cooperation, he often participated in the cooperative's meetings and consciously helped them improve their relationship with the masses. In the spring, team member Zhang Yongzeng withdrew from the cooperative because he had a lot of land, only one labor force, and was afraid of losing out. The branch learned about this and educated him. As a result, Zhang Yongzeng's thinking was straightened out, he returned to the cooperative, and became a backbone member. The branch also frequently provided individual help to cooperative director Xuan Yumin. Cooperative member Luo Chunyang said, "Secretary Liu branch used to never even ask us, but he's really changed this year! He really cares about us." The cooperative's production has always been at the forefront, and it uses new technologies comprehensively. The branch seized the cooperative's advanced examples, publicized them at mass meetings, and promoted the masses. Cotton topping and removing soil leaves were new methods, and the masses were afraid that it would damage the cotton, so the cooperative did it first. The branch organized more than 30 people to visit the cooperative for on-site demonstrations. The village technician and propagandist also quickly learned it, doing it themselves while publicizing it, and later guiding the masses to do the same. Thinning, topdressing, etc., were also done by the cooperative first, organizing the masses to visit, and then promoting it. The masses visited a total of eight times. Since then, the cooperative has become a banner for the village's production.

    In the past, many of the masses believed that cooperatives were a "heap together," which resulted in suffering for nothing and no distribution of goods. In response to this idea, the branch used specific examples of cooperative members at mass meetings to publicize the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, which operate according to labor remuneration, land shares, and unified management. They also used the fact that the cooperative's crops grew well piece by piece to educate the masses. This slowly eliminated the masses' doubts and slowly changed their views.

    Uniting the Masses in Production
    Under the leadership of the district committee and the village branch, the attitude of the cooperative members towards the masses also greatly changed. During the spring plowing last year, the farmer Li Yuzhang could not hire a cattle plow, and he was worried that the land would not be planted. When team member Xuan Zemin learned about this, he discussed it with the team, and the members said, "We must help him plant the land. The cooperative should unite the masses to improve production, especially since he is a poor household!" The team decided to exchange work with him. Li Yuzhang's 5.7 mu of land required 11 workdays for plowing in the spring plowing stage, but the cooperative used large livestock and finished plowing in six workdays. According to "equal exchange and mutual benefit," this was equivalent to a total of 7 labor days. When Li Yuzhang returned the work, because he plowed well, his plowing for the cooperative was rated at 11 or 12 points, and he paid it back in five or six days. He said, "If it weren't for the cooperative this year, I would have had to abandon this land."

    During the summer weeding, individual farmer Sun Yanchang had not paid the cash for hiring someone to plow the land in the spring, so when it came time to hoe the land, others refused to do it for him. Sun Yanchang was worried about his crops. When the team members learned about this, they went back to the management committee for discussion, and everyone agreed to help him hoe the land. Sun Yanchang happily said, "If the cooperative didn't help me, I wouldn't be able to finish hoeing this land!" During thinning, Liu Hongzhang's mutual aid team had few women and couldn't thin the land, and the grass and seedlings were growing together. The team immediately sent five strong female team members to assist them. Originally, the female team members in Liu Hongzhang's team only talked about equal pay for equal work, not equal work, and were all rated at 10 points like the men. This time, the team members helped them thin the seedlings while discussing how women in the cooperative were scored and recorded. Female team leader Shang Demin told them the principle of equal pay for equal work in the team. Since then, Liu Hongzhang's team corrected its past problems, and women were scored according to the amount and quality of their work, and the men had fewer opinions about the women. Many of the masses said, "The cooperative not only has good production themselves, but also sends people to help others improve production."

    Last year, the crops in the cooperative were all good. The masses commented, "The cooperative's land has a different color: talking about cotton, that piece has more and bigger bolls; talking about sorghum, that piece is thick and black; the millet is tall and the ears are big as well." Not only was the cooperative's land good, but the land next to the cooperative was almost as good. The reason was: when Xuan Yumin and the team members saw that the masses were not using new technologies properly in the fields, they always went to tell them how to do it. Liu Qingmian's team didn't know how to apply ammonium sulfate, and sometimes applied it to the cotton leaves. Xuan Yumin went to his field, applied it himself as an example, and taught him how to do it. Sun Wenyan's wife was thinning cotton seedlings in the field, but she was thinning them too densely and not evenly spaced. Xuan Yumin also thinned it himself as an example, and explained the benefits of equal spacing, thinning, and close planting. Farmer Li Yuge's land was next to the cooperative's land, and the cotton grew almost as well as the cooperative's. Li Yuge said, "I'll do whatever you do, if you can have a bumper harvest, we will too." Therefore, many of the lands next to the cooperative were cultivated using the new cultivation methods of the cooperative, and the crops grew well.

    宣裕民农业合作社怎样改善了和群众的关系
    陈昌　吴光焕
    去年，辽东省辽阳县英守堡子村宣裕民农业生产合作社，认真学习了互助合作政策，积极团结群众共同搞好生产，彻底改变了过去脱离群众的作风，在群众中真正树立了威信。
      模范互助组脱离了群众
    一九五二年，宣裕民农业生产合作社还是互助组的时候，有一度和群众的关系很不好。许多组员都认为：“咱们是省植棉模范领导的模范互助组，名闻全省。”所以，在群众面前处处表现很高傲。中共村支部书记刘洪章也领导着一个互助组，可是宣裕民组的组员就瞧不起他们。东北区、省、县、区的干部，来时都是直接到宣裕民组里，使得别的互助组十分“眼气”。报上常登宣裕民组的模范事迹，全县的互助组差不多都学习，可是本村的农民就不学。有的说：“你模范你的，谁照你们学！”特别因为有些农民对农业负担政策不了解，棉田定产以后，都说是“叫植棉模范给连带的，不然产量定不了这么高。”抱怨宣裕民使他们多出了公粮。宣裕民有时听到群众在背后说他们，他就批评群众有“落后思想”“走富农道路”，群众听了更加不满。他们和群众的来往越来越少。组里牲口满圈，有的群众推碾拉磨虽有困难，也很少来借。有的群众说：“人家那大互助组，咱们‘够不上’去借，再说，人多嘴杂，你行他还不行呢！”有时群众在一起闲谈，组员一走过，就住了话尾。组员们都纳闷，寻找病根究竟在什么地方。宣裕民说：“在什么地方？明摆着是两条道路发展不同，这是斗争！”这样一说，真正的病根子越找不到了，一个模范互助组却严重地脱离了群众。
      找到了病根
    去年春天，从宣裕民互助组转社起，中共区委发现了这种情况，明确认识到互助组、合作社团结群众的重要性，了解了孤立地培养模范一定脱离群众，因为模范是从群众中来的，是群众的模范，不是政府的模范。区委把这些道理想通了。转社时，区委书记姜永汉就亲自掌握，耐心地对村支部书记和党员进行教育，使他们认清党在农村的中心任务就是领导好互助合作，搞好生产，并且要培养模范，利用模范事例教育农民，帮助模范带动群众。这样，首先在村支部内部对这些政策有了正确认识。以后区委又在社里进行“团结群众，搞好生产，改善群众关系”的政治教育。区委还在该村对群众着重宣传了互助合作政策、负担政策。提高了群众的政治思想觉悟，使他们改变了对宣裕民社的看法，明白了负担政策，再不抱怨宣裕民了。同时，合作社的社员认识到自己脱离群众的不对。他们找到了过去的病根是：没有主动从各方面去团结群众，帮助其他互助组、单干农民、特别是贫困户搞好生产。支部书记刘洪章也检讨了过去支部放松领导的缺点。
    党支部加强了领导
    支部书记刘洪章，从思想上认识了党在农村的中心任务是领导好生产，领导好互助合作后，就经常到社里参加他们的会议，有意识地帮助他们改进和群众的关系。春天，社员张永曾因为地多，只一个劳动力，怕吃亏，退了社。支部知道了就对他进行教育。张永曾因此思想通了，又回到社来，并且成了骨干。支部还经常对社主任宣裕民进行个别帮助。社员罗春阳说：“刘支部书记在早连问都不问咱们，今年可真变了啊！对咱们真关心。”社里生产一贯走在前头，又全面使用新技术，支部就抓紧了合作社的先进事例，在群众会上宣传，推动群众。棉花打水杈、撸土叶是新办法，群众怕打了损害棉花，合作社就先做。支部组织了三十多人去社内实地参观表演，村技术员、宣传员也很快学会，一面自己做，一面宣传，后来引导群众都照着做了。间苗、追肥等也都是由合作社先做，组织群众参观，然后推广。群众前后共参观了八次。从此，使合作社变成了全村生产上的旗帜了。
    过去，有很多群众认为合作社是“归大堆”，白挨累，分不着东西。支部就针对这种思想，在群众会上用社员的具体例子，宣传农业生产合作社按劳取酬、土地入股、统一经营的优越性；并拿合作社庄稼块块长得好的事实进行教育。这才使群众的疑虑慢慢消除，看法也慢慢改变了。
    团结群众生产
    在区委和村支部的领导下，社员对群众的态度也大大改变了。去年春耕时，农民李玉章雇不上牛犋，眼瞅着地就种不上了。社员宣泽民知道后，回社一谈，社员们就说：“要帮他把地种上。合作社应该团结群众搞好生产，何况他又是贫困户！”社里决定和他换工。李玉章五亩七分地，春耕阶段计算，牛犋得十一个工，合作社用大牲口，六个工就种完了。按“等价互利”来说，共折七个人工。李玉章还工时，因他扶犁扶得好，给社里犁地评到十一、二分，五、六天就还上了。他说：“今年若不是合作社，我这地就得扔。”
    夏锄时，单干户孙延昌因为春起雇别人牛犋没付现钱，到?地时，别人就不给?了。孙延昌瞅着庄稼发愁。社员知道了，回去开管理委员会研究，大伙都同意帮他?地。孙延昌乐得说：“不叫合作社帮助，我这地铲完就?不上啊！”间苗时候，刘洪章互助组妇女少，间不过来，草苗齐长。社里马上派了五名强壮的女社员去援助他们。原先刘洪章互助组的女组员在劳动上光讲同酬，不讲同工，一律和男的评十分。这回社员帮他们一边间苗，一边谈论合作社中妇女怎样评分记分。女组长尚德敏给她们讲社里同工同酬的道理。从此，刘洪章组纠正了过去的毛病，妇女按做的活多少、好坏评分，男的对妇女们的意见也就少了。不少群众说：“合作社不但自己生产好，还抽人帮别人搞好生产。”
    去年合作社的庄稼块块都好。群众评论：“合作社的地有记色：讲棉花，那块桃多、桃大就是；讲高粱，那块又粗又黑就是；谷子又高，穗又大的也是。”不但社的地好，挨着合作社的地，差不多也好。原因是：宣裕民和社员在地里干活，看见群众运用新技术不合适时，总是要亲自去告诉他们怎样做。刘庆绵组追硫铵不会追，有时追到棉花叶子上，宣裕民就到他的地里，自己追个样子，教给他。孙文言老婆在地里间棉苗，间得太密，又不等距，宣裕民也亲自给她间个样子看，并给她讲等距、间苗和密植的好处。农民李玉阁的地挨着合作社的地，棉花长得和社的差不多。李玉阁说：“你怎么做，我就怎么做，你能丰产，咱也要丰产。”所以挨合作社的地，有很多都照合作社使用的新耕作法做了，庄稼长得都好。
