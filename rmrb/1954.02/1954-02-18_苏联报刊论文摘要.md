Urgent Tasks of Soviet Trade Workers

    The "Pravda" published an editorial on January 16, pointing out that Soviet trade workers must safeguard the interests of customers and actively promote the improvement of product quality by industrial departments in a principled manner. The abstract is as follows:

    Every Soviet trade worker has the responsibility to insist that industrial departments expand the production of those products with the most popular designs and styles. It is necessary, based on research into consumer needs and in conjunction with industrial workers, to regularly review and improve the types of goods supplied to the broad market, replace unwanted goods with new ones, and prevent industrial enterprises from reducing the production of popular goods without reason. We should stand in the interests of consumers and make more extensive and better use of the industrial ordering system.

    Trade workers should establish closer and more lively ties with production departments. Experience shows that meetings between trade workers and enterprise workers, their mutual undertaking of socialist obligations, and the joint holding of customer representative conferences can help to more fully consider consumer needs, promote the improvement of product types, and improve the work of sending goods to the trade network.

    Strictly checking the quality of goods prepared for sale to residents is a primary responsibility of trade workers. Unlike the widespread sale of shoddy goods and counterfeits prevalent in capitalist trade, Soviet trade provides consumers with high-quality goods. It has every possibility to prevent defective products from entering the trade network, while actively influencing industrial departments to further improve the quality of daily necessities.

    However, until now, some trade workers have taken a compromising attitude towards the fact that individual enterprises supply inferior goods. Take the Gubyshev Department Store as an example. When the staff of this company received leather shoes from the "May 1st" Shoe Factory and the New Style Leather Shoe Factory, they "did not find" any defects in these shoes. However, when other trade organizations carefully inspected the products of these factories, they found that 11 percent did not meet standards. This shows that the workers of the Gubyshev Department Store have forgotten their responsibility to customers.

    Some trade workers also do not exercise their ruble supervision rights, preferring to "not argue" or "not spoil relations" with suppliers. The Gubyshev City Industrial Trading Company, "Clothing Trading Store and other trade organizations, avoid sanctions against suppliers of substandard goods," and often only limit themselves to exchanging the substandard goods for other products from the original supplier.

    This kind of bad practice has nothing in common with the principle of economic accounting, and it will only harm the cause of striving for the production of high-quality goods. Relations with suppliers should be established on a highly principled basis. It must be firmly remembered that workers in Soviet trade organizations and workers in industrial departments have only one common goal and one common national interest, which is to care for the well-being of the people.

Resolutely Reduce Circulation Costs in Retail Trade

    The "Pravda" published on January 30 an article by A. Belov and V. Sokolov, senior researchers at the Soviet Institute of Scientific Research of Commerce and Public Catering, on reducing circulation costs in retail trade. The abstract is as follows:

    Economization is the main lever for further improving our national economy. In the struggle to implement economization, reducing the circulation costs of retail trade is of great significance. These costs are a kind of social expenditure for guiding goods from production to consumers. They are mainly composed of the expenses of trade organizations for purchasing, storing, and selling goods.

    In terms of the amount of social labor spent in the circulation field, Soviet trade is the most economical trade in the world. According to the estimates of bourgeois economists, commercial costs in the United States account for half of the value of goods. The general level of circulation costs of department stores in the United States is equivalent to 37 percent of the price of goods. In comparison, the circulation costs of the Moscow Central Department Store in 1952 accounted for only 2.76 percent of the retail commercial trade volume.

    The circulation costs of Soviet trade also differ in content from those of capitalism. The majority of the circulation costs of Soviet trade are related to the continuation of the production process in the circulation field (storage, packaging, transportation of goods, etc.), while the characteristic of capitalist trade is the large amount of expenditure determined by the anarchy of production, crises, and capitalist competition: such as the expenses required for the transfer of goods, advertising, and speculative trading.

    Soviet trade has great potential for further reducing circulation costs.

    Trade organizations have the possibility to greatly reduce transportation costs, which account for a major part of their total expenditures. Currently, transportation costs are high mainly because the work of transporting goods to the retail trade network is not well organized: for example, allowing cars to wait excessively at some warehouses and freight yards for the dispatch of goods; not adhering to the specified time standards for loading and unloading goods; not fully utilizing the loading capacity of cars; and the delivery routes of goods are often artificially lengthened.

    Selling goods in the form of pre-packaged quantities is also an effective method of reducing commercial costs. This will improve the labor efficiency of counter staff, reduce the loss of goods, and improve the level of trade. Experience shows that goods that have been pre-packaged and weighed, as well as packaged products, are often three to five times more efficient when given to customers.

    Reducing the loss of goods during transportation, storage, and sale can also greatly save on circulation costs. From the study of the causes of loss of goods, it is known that the current standards for natural loss of food products and the procedures for applying these standards need major revisions. Taking the natural loss standards for railway and waterway transportation as an example, they are surprisingly high. For example, in the transportation of goods such as salt, fish, and vegetable oil, the natural loss standards for railway and waterway transportation are even higher than the combined standards for cart transportation, warehouse storage, and retail. This is because the natural loss standards for railway and waterway transportation are formulated regardless of the distance of transportation and the length of time the goods are en route.

    It is important to correctly formulate the plan for circulation costs themselves. It is well known that the total expenses of trade organizations are basically composed of the expenses for individual goods. At the same time, the proportion of expenses for various goods in the retail price is also different. Therefore, in order to correctly determine the average standard of circulation costs for each trade organization, it is necessary to be familiar with and thoroughly study the circulation costs of certain individual goods. This research is a necessary condition for correctly determining the size of its commercial discounts according to the goods, so as to ensure that the trade institutions obtain legitimate profits under strict observance of the economization system.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏维埃贸易工作人员的迫切任务
    “真理报”一月十六日发表社论，指出苏联贸易工作者必须维护顾客的利益，积极地以原则性的态度促进工业部门提高产品的质量，摘要如下：
    每一个苏维埃贸易工作人员都有责任坚持使工业部门扩大生产那些最受欢迎的花色和式样的产品。必须根据对消费者的需要的研究，同工业工作人员一道来定期重新审查和改进供应广大市场的货物种类，用新货物来代替那些不合需要的，并使各工业企业不要无故缩减畅销货物的生产。应当站在消费者的利益上，更广泛和更好地利用工业的订货制度。
    贸易工作人员应该同生产部门建立更密切更生动的联系。经验指出，贸易工作者和企业工作者的会晤，他们相互间承担社会主义义务，以及共同举办顾客代表会议，可以帮助更充分地考虑消费者的需要，促进产品种类的改进和发送货物到贸易网去的工作。
    严格地检查准备售给居民的货物的质量，是贸易工作者的一个首要职责。同资本主义贸易中广泛流行的出售劣货及伪造品的情况不同，苏维埃贸易供给消费者以优等质量的货物。它具有一切可能来防止废品流入贸易网，同时积极影响工业部门进一步改进日用品的质量。
    但是直到现在仍有一些贸易工作者对个别企业供应劣货的事实采取妥协态度。以古比雪夫市的百货公司为例，这个公司的工作人员在收到“五一”鞋厂和新式皮鞋工厂的皮鞋时，“没有发现”这些皮鞋有任何缺陷。但是另外一些贸易组织在仔细检查这些工厂的产品时，却发现有百分之十一不合标准。这说明古比雪夫百货公司的工作人员忘记了自己对顾客所负的责任。
    还有一些贸易工作者不行使他们的卢布监督权，而宁愿与供货者“不争吵”，或“不搞坏关系”。也是这个古比雪夫市的市工业贸易公司，“服装贸易店和其它一些贸易组织，避免对劣货供应者进行制裁”，而常常只限于把劣货向原供货者换取其他制品。
    这种恶劣作风和经济核算制原则决无共同之点，它只会给争取生产优等质量货物的事业带来损害。对供应货物者的关系应当建立在高度原则性的基础上。必须牢牢记住，苏维埃贸易机构的工作者和工业部门的工作人员只有一个共同目的，一个共同的全国整体利益，这就是关怀人民的福利。
    坚决降低零售贸易中的流转费用
    “真理报”一月三十日刊载了苏联商业和公共饮食业科学研究所高级研究员亚·别洛夫和甫·索柯洛夫论降低零售贸易中的流转费用的论文，摘要如下：
    节约制是进一步提高我国国民经济的主要杠杆。在争取实行节约制的斗争中，降低零售贸易的流转费用具有重大的意义。这些费用是把货物由生产引导至消费者手中的一种社会开支，它们主要是由收购、保管和销售货物的贸易组织的经费构成的。
    从社会劳动在流通领域中的耗费的数量看，苏维埃贸易是世界上最节约的贸易。根据资产阶级经济学者的估计，美国的商业费用要占商品价值的一半。美国各百货公司的流转费用的一般水平相当于商品价格的百分之三十七。与之相较，一九五二年莫斯科中央百货公司的流转费用只占零售商业贸易额的百分之二点七六。
    苏维埃贸易的流转费用在内容上也和资本主义的不同。苏维埃贸易的流转费用的大部分是和生产过程在流通领域中的继续（货物的保管、包装、运输等）联系着的，而资本主义的贸易特点则是为生产的无政府状态、危机、资本主义竞争所决定的大量支出：如货物转手、广告、投机买卖等所需的费用。
    苏维埃贸易拥有进一步降低流转费用的巨大潜力。
    各贸易组织有可能来大大缩减在它们总开支中占主要部分的运输费用。目前运输费用之所以高，基本上是因为对于把货物运输到零售贸易网中去的工作没有进行良好地组织：例如，听任汽车在一些仓库和货栈等候货物的发付而作过多的停歇；不遵守规定的时间标准装卸货物；没有充分利用汽车的装载能力；货物的运送途程常常被人为地延长。
    采用定量包装的形式出售货物也是降低商业费用的一个有效方法。这样会提高柜台工作人员的劳动效率，减少货物的损耗，并提高贸易的水平。经验证明，经过事先包装并称过重量的货物，以及成件的制品，在付给顾客时，其效率往往快三到五倍。
    减少货物在运输、保管和出售时的损耗，也可以大大节省流转费用。从研究造成货物损耗的原因，知道现行的食用品的自然损耗标准和运用这些标准的程序，都需要重大的修正。以铁路和水路运输的自然损耗标准说，就高得惊人。例如在运输盐、鱼、植物油等货物方面，铁路和水路运输的自然损耗标准，甚至比马车运输、仓库保管和零售三者合起来的标准还要高。这是因为铁路和水路运输的自然损耗标准是不顾运输里程的远近和货物在途中时间的长短而制订的。
    正确地制订流转费用本身的计划是很重要的。大家知道，贸易组织的总开支基本上是由用于个别货物的费用组成的。同时，各种货物的费用在零售价格中所占的比例也是不同的。因此，为要正确地替各贸易组织确定它的流转费用的平均标准，就必须熟悉并缜密地研究某些个别货物的流转费用。这种研究乃是正确地按照货物决定它的商业折扣大小，以便保证各贸易机构在严格遵守节约制的条件下，取得正当赢利的必要条件。
