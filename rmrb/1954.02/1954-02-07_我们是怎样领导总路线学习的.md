How We Led the General Line Study
Northwest Administrative Committee Public Security Bureau Party Committee Learning Office

We began studying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period on November 15th of last year. Before the study began, the Party Committee, based on the specific situation within the bureau, researched and discussed the study plan of the superior Party Committee, adjusted the study time, rectified the organizational leadership, and convened a joint meeting of Party branch secretaries, propaganda and education committee members, Communist Youth League general branch secretaries, and amateur political school class leaders on November 14th. The Party Committee's Secretary and Deputy Secretary conducted deployment and mobilization, clearly pointing out the significant meaning of this study, calling on all comrades to actively participate, and especially emphasizing the leading exemplary role of Party members. After the meeting, each unit conducted separate mobilization and discussed the study plan. Some units also held discussions on how to study well. The comrades all felt that this study was timely and necessary, and therefore their enthusiasm for studying was high. However, at the beginning of the study, due to the Party branches not playing their core leadership role, the study focus was not clear, the problems were too big and difficult to grasp, the documents were scattered, and there was a lack of concrete help for comrades with lower cultural levels. These problems were not promptly researched and resolved, so some comrades reflected that they couldn't get into the study, and some individuals showed signs of slackening. The Bureau's Party Group and Party Committee conducted specific research on this situation and convened another general meeting of all cadres. The Director and Deputy Director further conducted in-depth mobilization, emphatically pointing out: The process of studying the general line and general task is a process of raising thinking and improving work efficiency. Each unit must combine the study with checking work and thinking, criticizing capitalist ideology, drawing a clear ideological line between socialism and capitalism, and raising our work and thinking a step further. After the meeting, a joint meeting of Party branch propaganda and education committee members, Communist Youth League general branch secretaries, and amateur political school class leaders was convened. A key review was made of the previous stage of study, and specific research was conducted on existing problems. It was particularly emphasized that the Party branches must conduct specific leadership and supervision of this study. Only in this way could the study be vigorously carried out.

We adopted the following measures in leading the study:

I. Under the direct leadership of the Party Committee, five comrades were organized to form a temporary study office to specifically supervise and inspect the implementation of the study plan, understand ideological trends and problems existing in the study, and promptly research and resolve them. The study office also formulated study focuses and discussion focuses before each unit of study and designated the main documents and reference materials for reading. During the study process, learning experiences and methods were exchanged in a timely manner through reports, research meetings, and circulars. Up to now, three report and research meetings of Party branch secretaries, propaganda and education committee members, and amateur political school class leaders have been held. The Communist Youth League General Branch held two report meetings of Communist Youth League branch secretaries and propaganda and education committee members. The study office also organized inspections of each branch twice. Six circulars on relevant leadership of the study were issued, thus powerfully promoting the progress of the study.

Each branch also convened an enlarged meeting of the branch committee, forming a study leadership core led by the Party branch and absorbing relevant comrades such as the Communist Youth League branch secretary and the amateur political school class leader, to study specific methods for strengthening the study leadership and formulate several systems. For example: formulating specific study methods for each unit, designating someone to explain to the elementary group, regularly convening report and research meetings, checking notes and speaking outlines, and some units also stipulated a registration system for late arrivals and early departures. As a result, the comrades' attitude towards learning became more serious, the focus of learning became clearer, and they also developed an interest in studying problems.

II. In order to enhance the tutoring strength of the intermediate and elementary groups, in addition to the original twelve tutors, cadres at or above the level of department director who participated in the advanced group were also designated as tutors for this study. Their tasks are: 1. Pointing out the focus of study and introducing reference materials; 2. Answering difficult questions; 3. Participating in and guiding group discussions. They generally conduct tutoring through writing study outlines, making enlightening speeches, answering specific questions, and making conclusions at discussion meetings. Some important difficult questions and ideological problems are discussed and researched in the advanced group meetings to reach a unified understanding before being resolved separately in each unit. In addition to participating in the intermediate group's study and discussions, the comrades in the elementary group are also organized by the branch to hold separate symposiums for tutoring. For some of the comrades with lower cultural levels and poor comprehension ability, designated personnel provide specific assistance, pointing out the center of the problem for them, explaining them paragraph by paragraph in simple terms, and answering difficult questions, thus solving the difficulties these comrades encountered in self-study.

Experience from this stage of study proves that doing so is of great help to the comrades. For example, the director of the Bureau Office (tutor) wrote a relatively clear study outline when studying the socialist transformation of agriculture and the grain problem. The comrades responded very well, believing that it provided clues for everyone to study the problem. The vice president of the Public Security School (tutor) made a summarizing speech on the disputed issues at the discussion meeting, so that the issues disputed by the comrades could be resolved. With the help of tutors, some units did a good job in preparing for the discussion meeting, so the center of the discussion was clear, the debate was lively, and the problems were discussed more deeply.

III. Regarding the general line study for service personnel, communicators, etc., in addition to formulating a separate plan and having three comrades specifically responsible for leading it, five Party member cadres at the level of section and division chiefs are also designated to give them popular explanations on five issues: the general line and basic tasks of the first five-year plan during the transition period, the industrialization of the socialist state, the socialist transformation of agriculture, the grain problem, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Before the explanation, a lecture outline is written and given after being reviewed by the Party Committee Study Office. Two issues have now been lectured according to plan, and the general effect is good.

In addition, in order to meet the comrades' requirements for increasing study time, in addition to studying for one hour every morning as stipulated, four hours were also added to the weekly spare time. In order to supervise everyone's study and understand the study results of each comrade, it is stipulated that a temporary test will be held after each unit is completed. Judging from the results of the first test in six units, the excellent accounted for 59.5% of the total number, the medium accounted for 38.6%, and the poor accounted for only 1.9%.

Due to the strengthening of specific leadership of the study, in the two months of study, the comrades have achieved a lot, clarifying the specific path for our country to gradually transition to a socialist society, recognizing that our current new democratic society is the society of the transition period, and correcting some vague concepts that existed in past ideological understanding. For example, some comrades in the past only knew that our country was going to realize a socialist society, but they were confused in their minds about how to realize it. Some thought that when new democracy developed to a certain extent, it would be socialism as long as an order was announced. After studying, they had a clear understanding of these issues. Everyone felt that their eyes were brightened and their minds were clear. After initially clarifying the spiritual essence of the general line, many comrades further examined their own work and criticized various non-proletarian ideologies. For example, some comrades in the past were not at ease with their work and wanted to transfer to other departments. After studying, they realized the importance of public security work during the transition period, began to love their work, and corrected their work attitude. Because their ideological awareness gradually improved in the study, they also began to actively strive to realize the general line in their actual actions. For example, some comrades in the past could not understand eating coarse grains ideologically. After studying the grain problem, they felt happy. The amount of savings in the agency also increased significantly month by month, accounting for 25.69% of the wages payable in October last year, which increased to 31.41% in November, and then increased to 79.31% in December. Many comrades wrote letters to their families or relatives and friends, mobilizing them to participate in mutual aid and cooperation and sell surplus grain to the state. For example, 14 of the 25 cadres from rural families in the Bureau Office wrote letters to their families or talked to them face to face, and 7 others were also preparing to send letters.

Although we have achieved some of the above achievements, this is only the beginning. At present, there are still many shortcomings in the study, mainly that the drilling is not deep, the connection with reality is not enough, and the guidance and tutoring work cannot meet the requirements of the comrades. The development between the various units is not balanced. All these need to be continuously improved in the future study process. In order to further closely combine the study of the general line with the improvement of work, the Bureau Party Group is currently conducting inspections of the work of each department and section, requiring that some key issues be resolved from this inspection, and the leadership thinking and business level be effectively improved a step further.

    我们是怎样领导总路线学习的
    西北行政委员会公安局党委学习办公室
    我们于去年十一月十五日开始了国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的学习。在学习开始前，党委根据局内的具体情况，对上级党委的学习计划作了研究和讨论，调整了学习时间，整顿了组织领导，并于十一月十四日召开党支部书记、宣教委员、团总支书记、业余政治学校班干事联席会议，由党委正副书记进行了布置和动员，明确指出这次学习的重大意义，号召全体同志积极参加，特别强调党员的带头模范作用。会后各单位又分别作了动员，讨论了学习计划，有的对怎样学好的问题也进行了座谈。同志们都认为这次学习是适时和需要的，因而学习热情很高。但在学习之初，由于党支部没有发挥核心领导作用，学习重点不明确，问题大，啃不动，文件零散，对文化较低的同志缺乏具体帮助等问题，没有及时进行研究解决，因而有些同志反映学不进去，个别人有松劲的表现。局党组、党委会对这一情况作了具体研究，又召开了一次全体干部大会，由正副局长进一步作了深入的动员，着重指出：总路线总任务的学习过程，就是提高思想、提高工作效率的过程。各单位在学习中必须结合检查工作和思想，批判资本主义思想，划清社会主义与资本主义的思想界限，把我们的工作和思想提高一步。会后并召开了党支部宣教委员、团总支书记、业余政治学校班干事联席会议，将前一阶段学习作了重点检查，对存在的问题进行了专门研究，特别强调党支部对这次学习必须进行具体领导和督促检查，这样才使学习热烈地开展起来。
    我们在领导学习中采取了下列措施：
    一、在党委直接领导下，组织五位同志，成立了临时学习办公室，专门督促检查学习计划的执行情况，了解思想动态和学习中存在的问题，及时研究解决。学习办公室并在学习每一单元前拟定学习重点和讨论重点，指定阅读的主要文件和参考材料。在学习过程中通过汇报、研究会和通报等形式，对学习经验与方法及时进行交流。到现在为止，共召开党支部书记、宣教委员、业余政校班干事的汇报研究会议三次。团总支召开团支部书记、宣教委员汇报会议两次。学习办公室并有组织地到各支部检查过两次。印发了有关领导学习的通报六则，因而有力地推动了学习的进展。
    各支部也召开了支委扩大会议，组成以党支部为主并吸收团支部书记和业余政治学校班干事等有关同志参加的学习领导核心，研究了加强学习领导的具体办法，制订了若干制度。如：拟定每一单元的具体学习方法，指定专人给初级组讲解，定期召开汇报和研究会议，检查笔记和发言提纲，有的单位还规定了迟到早退登记制度等。这样，同志们的学习态度更加认真了，学习重点明确了，对问题也有了钻研的兴趣。
    二、为了增强中、初级组的辅导力量，除原有的十二个辅导员外，并确定参加高级组的处长级以上干部均为这次学习的辅导员。他们的任务是：一、指出学习重点，介绍参考材料；二、解答疑难问题；三、参加并指导小组讨论会。他们一般是通过写学习要点、启发性的发言、专门问题的解答、讨论会上作结论等形式进行辅导。对一些重要的疑难问题和思想问题，均在高级组会议上进行讨论和研究，取得统一认识后再分别回各单位进行解决。初级组的同志除参加中级组的学习和讨论外，并由支部给他们单独组织座谈会进行辅导。对其中一些文化较低和理解能力差的同志，指定专人具体帮助，给他们指出问题中心，逐段作通俗讲解，解答疑难问题，因此解决了这些同志自学中的困难。
    从这一阶段的学习中证明，这样做给同志们帮助很大。如局办公室主任（辅导员）在学习农业社会主义改造和粮食问题时，写出了较为明确的学习提纲，同志们反应很好，认为对大家钻研问题提供了线索。公安学校副校长（辅导员）在讨论会上对争论的问题作了带总结性的发言，使同志们争论的问题能够得到解决。有的单位在辅导员的帮助下对讨论会的准备工作做得好，因而讨论的中心明确，争论热烈，问题谈得也比较深刻。
    三、关于勤务员、通讯员等的总路线学习，除另外制订计划，由三位同志具体负责领导外，并指定五个处、科长级党员干部，分别按照过渡时期的总路线和第一个五年计划的基本任务、社会主义国家工业化、对农业进行社会主义改造、粮食问题、对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造等五个问题给他们作通俗讲解。讲解前并写出讲课提纲，经党委学习办公室审阅后开讲。现已按计划讲了两个问题，一般收效还好。
    此外，为了满足同志们对增加学习时间的要求，除按规定每天早晨学习一小时外，并在每周业余时间又增添了四个小时。为了督促大家的学习和了解各个同志的学习成绩，规定每学完一单元后举行一次临时测验。从六个单位第一次测验的成绩来看，上等的占总数的百分之五十九点五，中等的占百分之三十八点六，下等的只百分之一点九。
    由于加强了学习的具体领导，在两月来的学习中，同志们已取得了不少收获，明确了我们国家逐步过渡到社会主义社会的具体道路，认识到我们目前所处的新民主主义社会就是过渡时期的社会，纠正了过去思想认识上存在的一些模糊观念。如：有的同志过去光知道我们国家要实现社会主义社会，但如何实现，思想上却糊里糊涂。有的认为新民主主义发展到一定程度，只要宣布一道命令就是社会主义了。通过学习以后，对这些问题才有了明确的认识。大家都感到眼睛亮了，头脑清醒了。在初步明确了总路线的精神实质以后，许多同志进一步检查了自己的工作，批判了各种各样的非无产阶级思想。如有的同志过去不安心自己的工作，想转到别的部门去，经过学习以后，认识到公安工作在过渡时期的重要性，开始热爱自己的工作，端正了工作态度。由于在学习中思想觉悟逐渐提高，在实际行动中也开始积极地为实现总路线而努力。如有的同志过去对吃杂粮，思想上搞不通，学了粮食问题以后，心里觉得愉快了。机关中储蓄金额也逐月显著增加，去年十月份占应领工资数的百分之二十五点六九，十一月份即增加到百分之三十一点四一，十二月份则增为百分之七十九点三一。很多同志纷纷给家庭或亲戚朋友写信，动员他们参加互助合作，将余粮卖给国家。如局办公室二十五个从农村家庭出来的干部中有十四人给家里写过信或面谈过，还有七人也准备发信。
    虽然我们已取得了以上一些成绩，但这仅是开始。目前在学习中还存在着不少缺点，主要是钻的不深，联系实际不够，指导和辅导工作上还不能满足同志们的要求，各单位之间发展还不平衡。所有这些都须今后在学习过程中继续努力改进。为了进一步把学习总路线与改进工作密切结合起来，目前局党组正在进行检查各处、科的工作，要求从这次检查中解决若干关键问题，把领导思想和业务水平切实提高一步。
