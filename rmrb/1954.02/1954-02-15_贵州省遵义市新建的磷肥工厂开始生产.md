    The newly built local state-owned phosphate fertilizer factory in Zunyi, Guizhou Province, has begun production, which is good news for the vast number of farmers in Guizhou Province. Currently, this factory produces more than ten tons of apatite powder per day, and it is estimated that the annual output this year can reach more than ten thousand tons. This fertilizer can be applied to general farmland, enabling crops to mature earlier and produce more plump fruits.
    Tens of millions of tons of phosphate rock are deposited in the Zunyi area. Phosphate rock is a very good raw material for manufacturing chemical fertilizers. Therefore, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry decided to build a phosphate fertilizer factory here. The construction of this factory began in August of last year, and partial production began in late January of this year.

    贵州省遵义市新建的磷肥工厂开始生产
    贵州遵义市新建的一座地方国营磷肥工厂开始生产了，这是贵州省广大农民的喜讯。目前这个工厂每天约生产十多吨磷灰石粉，预计今年一年内的产量可以达到一万多吨。这种肥料可以施用在一般的田地上，它能使农作物提早成熟，果实结得更加饱满。
    在遵义一带蕴藏着几千万吨的磷矿石，磷矿石是制造化学肥料的很好的原料，因此，贵州省人民政府工业厅决定在这里建设磷肥工厂。这座工厂在去年八月开始建设，到今年的一月下旬就开始局部生产了。
