    How the Communist Party Branch of Laozhuangzi Village Led Farmers to Establish Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    Wang Lin Guo Zhanyan
    The Communist Party Branch of Laozhuangzi Village in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, vigorously publicized the General Line. Therefore, after selling surplus grain to support national industrial construction, the farmers of the entire village launched a high tide of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After deliberation, an agricultural production cooperative has now been established, with 31 farmer households participating, accounting for more than 48% of the total number of farmer households in the village.
    How did the Laozhuangzi Village Party Branch lead the farmers to establish the agricultural production cooperative? First, ideological unity was achieved within the Party. At that time, there were two kinds of erroneous thinking within the Party: one, represented by Party members Ma ?, Ma Xianwu, etc., was greedy for big size and quick results, advocating large-scale development. These people believed that last year the number of farmer households organized in the entire village accounted for 96% of the total number of households, the masses have the habit of mutual aid and cooperation, and there is a demand for establishing a cooperative, so they can "develop boldly, the more households the better"; the other, represented by Branch Secretary Jiang Cun and Wang Shouchun, etc., were timid and afraid to develop. These people believed that establishing a cooperative was a new job, without experience, advocating "the fewer households, the more reliable," so when the cooperative developed to eleven households, it stagnated. At this time, the difference in understanding of the cooperative within the Party had become an obstacle in leading the masses forward.
    In view of this situation, the branch led everyone to discuss how to implement the cooperative building policy of "active leadership, steady progress," and mobilized everyone to check their own thinking in connection with reality. In the discussion, Branch Secretary Jiang Cun first reviewed his own timid thinking, saying: "I misunderstood the spirit of the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, thinking that the small number of households in the initial establishment of the cooperative was considered 'steady', in fact, as long as there are conditions, we can boldly develop, do not be impetuous and rash, but also do not be timid, that is the real steady development." Ma ? also reviewed his blind and impetuous mood, saying: "At first, I always thought that it would be good for everyone in the village to join the cooperative, so that socialism would come faster. Now I understand that this kind of thinking is not right, if we develop blindly, it will not be consolidated even if it is established." Other Party members also checked their own "left" or right-leaning ideological tendencies. Through discussion, everyone unified their understanding of the meaning of "active leadership, steady progress."
    After the Party's ideological understanding was unified, the work of building a cooperative was officially carried out among the masses, a mass meeting was held, and the masses were called upon to sign up to join the cooperative. At that time, only seven or eight households signed up, and they were all widowers, widows, and those who lacked labor. This aroused the attention of the branch. Why were there so many people who wanted to join the cooperative during the deliberation stage, but so few people signed up now? So the branch called on Party members to go deep among the masses to understand the ideological situation of the masses, and to conduct individual visits to key households. Old middle peasant Ma Xiankuan had been inquiring about joining the cooperative in the past, but now he did not sign up. The branch sent Party member Ma Xianwu, who got along well with Ma Xiankuan, to visit him. When Ma Xianwu mentioned "What do you think of our village's cooperative?" Ma Xiankuan said: "In my opinion, this cooperative of ours will sooner or later respond to an old saying: a rabbit's tail—it won't last long. Take Jiang Xingyi, for example, he is single, cultivating twenty-two mu of land, and he also has chronic asthma. If he joins the cooperative, the cooperative will not be able to take care of him even if it only takes care of him, so how can it increase production! Look at the few households who signed up later, Wang Yunge, over fifty years old, barely counts as half a labor force, and he can't even manage his own five mu of land. Wang Jiwu left production to become a cadre, and only a woman is left to take nine mu of land into the cooperative. Counting down, which family is not like this!" Wang Shouzhai went to visit Wang Shouying. Wang Shouying is a member of the Communist Youth League, and he performed well in publicizing the General Line and purchasing grain, but he lagged behind in building the cooperative. After understanding, he himself was willing to join the cooperative, but his mother believed that "nothing should be rushed. After joining the cooperative, the family's life will be entrusted to the cooperative. We have to see how the leaders of the cooperative are, and see what kind of households have joined." The thinking of the general public is also very complicated. Some want to see who the head of the family is, and whether they can run the family well; some want to see who has joined the cooperative, and whether these people are compatible with themselves; some want to see whether the rules and regulations of the cooperative are reasonable. Those with good production conditions are afraid of suffering losses if they join the cooperative; those with bad production conditions are afraid that the cooperative will not want them; those with little or no labor are afraid of not being able to get food; some are also afraid of being a cadre after joining the cooperative and worrying. After the branch understood these ideological concerns of the masses, it studied the methods to solve them. The branch believed that the masses of the whole village have realized that socialism is the goal of everyone's common struggle; the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives have been affirmed in the minds of the masses, and the reason why there are still these ideological concerns on the issue of joining the cooperative is that the thinking of the masses has improved, there is a demand to join the cooperative, but the specific issues within the cooperative are not clear. This is the inevitable law of the development of mass thinking. The branch decided to educate the masses and solve the ideological concerns of the masses by dealing with specific issues in the process of building the cooperative. Therefore, it led the nineteen households who had already signed up to join the cooperative to negotiate and discuss, and elected the fair and capable Ma Xianwu, Ma ?, and Wang Shouchun to serve as the director, deputy director, and accountant respectively, and drafted the articles of association of the cooperative. When the entire cooperative discussed and adopted the articles of association, it absorbed non-cooperative members to attend as observers. When the masses saw that the elected cooperative cadres were exactly what they wanted, and the issues such as share dividends were also stipulated very carefully and reasonably in the articles of association, no one could suffer losses, no one could take advantage of it, and democratic management and various systems were also clearly stipulated. The ideological concerns of the masses began to dissipate, and they signed up to join the cooperative one after another after the meeting. For some farmers who wanted to join the cooperative but were not very clear about certain specific issues, the branch sent Party members to explain them individually. For example, after Ma Xiankuan participated in the meeting, although his thinking of being afraid of suffering losses had begun to reverse, he still could not figure out how much grain he could get after joining the cooperative. Party member Wang Shouren helped him calculate the accounts: Ma Xiankuan has a total of twenty-two mu of land, one strong male labor force and one female labor force. If he joins the cooperative, he can do at least four hundred workdays throughout the year. This year's preliminary production plan for the cooperative is to reach four hundred and fifty jin per mu. According to the cooperative's regulations that labor force is divided into dividends at 55%, it is not lower than his actual income in previous years. At this time, he completely understood his thinking, not only signed up to join the cooperative himself, but also mobilized Ma Xianchun, Ma Xianhua, Ma Xianwen and other middle peasants with good production conditions in his mutual aid group to join the cooperative. Finally, the number of cooperative members reached thirty-one households. The remaining thirty-three farmers who did not participate in the cooperative also established four perennial mutual aid groups under the leadership of the branch.

    中共老庄子村支部是怎样领导农民建立农业生产合作社的
    王林　郭占岩
    中共河北省遵化县老庄子村支部，大张旗鼓地宣传了总路线，所以全村农民在出售余粮，支援国家工业建设之后，又掀起了互助合作运动的高潮。经过酝酿，现已建立起一个农业生产合作社，参加社的农民共有三十一户，占全村农户总数百分之四十八以上。
    在老庄子村支部是怎样领导农民建立农业生产合作社的呢？首先在党内统一了思想。当时在党内存在着这两种错误思想：一种是以党员马?、马显武等为代表，贪大、图快，主张来个大发展。这些人认为去年全村组织起来的农户已占总户数的百分之九十六，群众有互助合作习惯，又有建社的要求，可以“放手发展，户数越多越好”；另一种是以支部书记姜存和王守臣等为代表，束手束脚不敢发展。这些人认为建社是件新的工作，没经验，主张“户数越少越牢靠”，因此当社发展到十一户的时候，就停顿下来。这时党内对建社认识上的分歧，已成了领导群众前进中的障碍。
    根据这种情况，支部就领导大家讨论如何贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的建社方针，并发动大家联系检查自己的思想。在讨论中，支部书记姜存首先检讨了自己的束手束脚思想，他说：“我把上级党委指示的精神领会错啦，认为开头办社户数少就算是‘稳步’，其实只要有条件，就可以大胆发展，不要急躁冒进，但也不要束手束脚，这才算真正的稳步发展。”马?也检讨了自己的盲目急躁情绪，他说：“最初，我总认为全村人都入社才好，那样，社会主义就会来的快些。现在我才明白了，这种思想不对头，如果盲目发展，建立起来了也不会巩固”。其他党员也都检查了自己的偏“左”或是偏右的思想情绪。经过讨论，大家统一认识了“积极领导，稳步前进”的意义。
    党内思想认识统一后，便正式在群众中进行建社工作，召开群众大会，号召群众报名入社。当时报名的只有七、八户，并且都是鳏、寡及缺劳动力的。这就引起了支部的注意。为什么在酝酿建社时要求入社的人很多，而现在报名时就这么少？于是支部号召党员，分头深入群众，了解群众思想情况，并选择重点户进行个别访问。老中农马显宽过去一直打听入社的事情，现在也不报名。支部派了和马显宽合得来的党员马显武去访问。当马显武提到“你看咱村的合作社咋样”的时候，马显宽说：“依我看哪，咱这社早晚得应了一句老古话：兔子尾巴——长不了。就拿姜兴义说吧，光棍一人，种着二十二亩地，他还有老喘病。让他入了社，社里光给他收拾也顾不过来，那还能增产！再看后来报名的那几户吧，王云葛，五十多岁，凑合着给他算上半个劳动力，光他自己那五亩地也莳弄不过来呀。王继武脱离生产当了干部，也是只剩下一个妇道人家带着九亩地入了社。挨着往下数，哪家不是这样呢！”王守斋去访问王守英。王守英是个青年团员，在宣传总路线和购粮工作中表现很好，但在建社中他却往后蹭，经了解，他本人倒愿入社，就是他母亲认为“啥事也不能乱抢先。入社后，一家人的生活就托靠给社了。咱得看看社的领导人如何，看看入社的户又是个咋样。”一般群众的思想也很复杂，有的要看看当家人是谁，能不能当好家；有的要看看都是谁入了社，这些人和自己投不投脾气；有的要看看社的制度规定的合理不合理。生产条件好的怕入了社吃亏；生产条件坏的怕社里不要；劳动力少或没有劳动力的怕分不上粮食；也有的人还怕入社后当干部操心。支部在了解群众的这些思想顾虑以后，便研究解决的方法。支部认为全村群众都已认识到社会主义是大家共同奋斗的目标；农业生产合作社的好处已在群众认识中肯定下来，当时在入社问题上所以还存在着这些思想顾虑，是在群众思想提高，有了入社要求，但又对社内的具体问题认识不清的情况下产生的。这是群众思想发展的必然规律。支部决定在建社过程中通过具体问题的处理，教育群众，解决群众思想顾虑。于是便领导已经报名入社的十九户，进行协商讨论，选举了公正能干的马显武、马?和王守臣分别担任正副社长及会计，草拟了社章。全社讨论通过社章时，吸收社外群众列席参加。当群众见到选出的社干部正合自己的心意，入股分红等问题，也都在社章中规定的很周到、很合理，谁也吃不了亏，谁也沾不了便宜，民主管理及各种制度也都规定的清清楚楚。群众的思想顾虑开始消释了，会后纷纷报名入社。有些想入社，但对某些具体问题还不甚清楚的农民，支部又派党员进行个别解释。比如马显宽参加大会后，他的怕吃亏的思想虽已开始扭转，但对入社后究竟能分多少粮食还摸不着底。党员王守仁就帮助他算了一下账：马显宽共二十二亩地，一个硬棒的男劳动力和一个女劳动力，如果入了社，全年起码能做四百个劳动日，今年社里的初步生产计划，每亩产量要达到四百五十斤，以社内规定的劳力按百分之五十五分红来计算，并不低于他往年的实际收入。这时他才彻底搞通了思想，不光自己报名入了社，并且动员他所在的互助组里生产条件好的中农马显春、马显华、马显文等也入了社。最后社员达到了三十一户。其余没有参加合作社的三十三户农民也在支部领导下分别成立了四个常年互助组。
