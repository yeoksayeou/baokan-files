Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: The amount of housing in the Eastern European People's Democratic countries is increasing every year, which is an important sign of the gradual improvement of the living standards of the working people.

In the nine years from 1945 to 1953, Poland repaired and built a total of 1.2 million houses. As early as 1945 and 1946, Poland repaired more than 235,000 houses. However, large-scale housing restoration and construction work actually began in the first few years of the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955). 66,000 houses were built in 1949, but 135,000 houses were built in 1953, more than doubling the amount. In the next two years, the construction area of houses will increase by 20% compared to 1953. The residential construction in cities such as Gdansk, Bydgoszcz, Poznan, Czestochowa, Wroclaw, and Jaworzno has exceeded the figures stipulated in the Six-Year Plan. The reconstruction of Warsaw, the capital of Poland with a population of over 900,000, has made great achievements.

During the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), hundreds of thousands of employees in Czechoslovakia received new housing, and a large number of new houses were built throughout the country. For example, the Ostrava region built 28,000 new houses in the past five years, accommodating more than 100,000 people; the Usti region built more than 6,000 new houses; and Bratislava built more than 4,000 houses and student dormitories for 2,000 people. The Prague region also built new houses for 30,000 people in the past five years. In 1954, the number of new houses in Czechoslovakia will increase further, with 40,000 houses and 10,000 single dormitories being built throughout the year.

During the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), Romania planned to build houses with a total construction area of 2.8 million square meters. Now, houses with a construction area of 1.73 million square meters have been built. The total construction area of the houses completed in 1953 was approximately twice that of 1952. By the end of 1955, 50,000 new houses for workers' families will be built. At the same time, the People's Government has also allocated large sums of money to help the working people build private houses, with 120 million lei (Romanian currency) allocated between 1952 and 1953 alone.

Hungary built 23,000 new houses in 1953. This year's housing construction plan is 150% larger than that of 1953. The state and private sectors will build 40,000 houses throughout the year, and 16,000 are currently under construction. The government continues to encourage and help private individuals build houses. In 1953 alone, miners and workers in state-owned farms and machine tractor stations built 1,621 private houses. Recently, the Hungarian Council of Ministers issued measures to give preferential treatment to private housing construction, providing long-term loans for housing construction, the amount of which accounts for 75% of the cost of private housing construction. This year, the government is lending 80 million forints (Hungarian currency) to agricultural workers to build private houses.

In order to vigorously improve the living conditions of the working people, Bulgaria built houses with a construction area of 3.4 million square meters in the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953). During the second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), Bulgaria will build new houses with a construction area of more than 2.2 million square meters. The investment in housing construction in 1954 will be twice that of 1953.

During the Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), the average annual housing construction expenditure in Albania was approximately twelve times that of the pre-war year of 1938. In 1953 alone, more than 1,000 houses were built for miners, light industrial workers, and construction workers. This year, the funds allocated for building houses are 19% more than last year.

    在生产发展的基础上逐步提高人民的生活水平
    东欧人民民主国家逐年增建新的住宅
    【新华社二十四日讯】东欧人民民主国家的住宅年年都在增加，这是劳动人民生活水平逐步提高的一个重要标志。
    波兰在一九四五年到一九五三年的九年中，总共修复和新建了一百二十万间房屋。早在一九四五年和一九四六年，波兰就修复了二十三万五千多间房屋。但大规模的住宅恢复和建筑工作，实际上是在六年计划（一九五○—一九五五年）的头几年才开始的。一九四九年建筑了六万六千间房屋，但在一九五三年就建筑了十三万五千间，即增加了一倍多。在今后两年内，房屋的建筑面积还将比一九五三年多百分之二十。革但斯克、比得哥煦、波兹南、捷斯托科发、弗罗茨拉夫和雅沃日诺等城市的住宅建筑，都已超过六年计划所规定的数字。拥有九十多万人口的波兰首都华沙的重建工作已取得了巨大成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克在第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）期间，共有数十万职工得到了新住宅，全国各地都建成了大批新房屋。例如俄斯特拉发州在过去五年中共建筑了两万八千所新住宅，可住十万多人；乌斯蒂州建成了六千多所新住宅；布拉迪斯拉发建造了四千多所住宅和可容两千人的学生宿舍。布拉格州在过去五年中也建造了可容三万人的新住宅，一九五四年，捷克斯洛伐克新住宅的数目还要增加，全年将建造四万所住宅和一万所单人宿舍。
    罗马尼亚在五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）期间，计划要建造总建筑面积达二百八十万平方公尺的住宅。现在已建成了建筑面积达一百七十三万平方公尺的住宅。一九五三年落成的房屋的总建筑面积约为一九五二年的两倍。到一九五五年年底以前，将再兴建五万个工人家庭的新住宅。与此同时，人民政府还拨出大笔款项帮助劳动人民建筑私人住宅，单是一九五二和一九五三年间，就拨出了一亿二千万列伊（罗币）。
    匈牙利在一九五三年建设的新住宅有两万三千幢。今年的房屋建设计划比一九五三年扩大百分之一百五十。全年国家和私人将建造四万幢住宅，现在正在建筑的有一万六千幢。政府不断鼓励和帮助私人建筑住宅。一九五三年，单是矿工和国营农场及机器拖拉机站的工人们，就建筑了一千六百二十一幢私人住宅。最近匈牙利部长会议颁布了优待私人建筑住宅的办法，发放住宅建筑的长期贷款，其数额占私人住宅建筑费的百分之七十五。今年政府贷给农业劳动者建筑私人住宅的贷款就达八千万福林（匈币）。
    为了大力改善劳动人民的居住条件，保加利亚在第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）的头四年中，共建造了建筑面积达三百四十万平方公尺的房屋。在第二个五年计划（一九五三—一九五七年）期间，保加利亚将兴建建筑面积达二百二十万平方公尺以上的新房屋。一九五四年住宅建设的投资将增为一九五三年的两倍。
    阿尔巴尼亚在五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）期间，平均每年的房屋建筑费约为战前一九三八年的十二倍。一九五三年单为矿工、轻工业工人和建筑工人就建造了一千多所房屋。今年拨作建筑住宅的款项比去年多百分之十九。
