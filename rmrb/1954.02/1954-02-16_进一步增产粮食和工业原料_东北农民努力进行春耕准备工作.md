    To Further Increase Grain and Industrial Raw Material Production
    Northeast Farmers Strive to Prepare for Spring Plowing

    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 15) Northeast farmers are striving to prepare for spring plowing in order to further increase grain and industrial raw material production this year.

    Recently, the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee sent eight work teams to various provinces to inspect spring plowing preparations. The inspection results show that, encouraged by the general line propaganda, farmers in Northeast China are showing unprecedented enthusiasm in participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and expanding production. Various localities, in conjunction with consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations, have started spring plowing preparations early. To improve agricultural productivity, farmers in various places are actively adding carts and buying horses. According to a survey by supply and marketing departments in Heilongjiang Province, the province supplied farmers with 6,600 large carts, 3,600 sets of rubber tires, and more than 13,000 head of draught animals during the grain purchase period. Farmers in Rehe Province have recently purchased 2,183 iron and wooden carts, and are still purchasing more. Farmers in Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, have recently purchased more than 2,000 draught animals and more than 800 carts. Farmers in various places generally attach great importance to increasing the application of manure and selecting improved varieties. Farmers in Tonghua County, Liaodong Province, have accumulated more than 300,000 cartloads of manure; farmers in seven counties, including Zhuanghe, Haicheng, and Gaiping, have transferred 4.83 million jin of improved varieties of various crops from the people's government. Farmers in Rehe Province have accumulated enough fertilizer to fertilize about 80 percent of the arable land. Farmers in Luanping, Longhua, and Chengde counties in the province have already transported one-third of the fertilizer to the fields. Farmers in Lalin, Bayan, Wuchang, Mulan and other counties in Songjiang Province have selected more than 500,000 jin of various crop seeds. In addition, most counties in the provinces have held meetings of agricultural labor models to summarize last year's agricultural technology reform work, focusing on promoting the Fengchan experience of Guo Houqi, and have determined this year's agricultural technology reform measures. Most provinces have completed the centralized training of agricultural technology promotion station cadres to further guide farmers in the use of horse-drawn farm implements. Most of the 3,000 sets of horse-drawn farm implements planned for promotion throughout the region this year have now been shipped to various places. Most of the more than 4,600 sets of horse-drawn farm implements that have been promoted in the past have also been overhauled.

    The work teams of the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee also discovered some problems during the inspection of spring plowing preparations in various provinces. The main problems are that some areas have insufficient manure preparation, some areas do not attach enough importance to summarizing and promoting Fengchan experience, and the production materials prepared in some areas cannot meet the requirements of farmers to expand reproduction. Therefore, in addition to instructing various localities to seriously study and solve the above problems, the Agricultural Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee is also preparing to send more cadres to various localities to supervise and promote the work, striving to complete the spring plowing preparations in a timely manner throughout the region and create favorable conditions for further increasing grain and industrial raw material production.

    进一步增产粮食和工业原料
    东北农民努力进行春耕准备工作
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北农民为今年进一步增产粮食和工业原料，正在努力进行春耕准备工作。
    最近，东北行政委员会农业局派出八个工作组，分赴各省检查了春耕准备工作。检查结果显示：今年东北各地农民在总路线宣传的鼓舞下，参加互助合作运动和扩大生产的积极性空前高涨。各地结合整顿和发展互助合作组织，纷纷提早进行春耕准备工作。为提高农业生产力，各地农民积极添车买马。据黑龙江省供销部门调查：全省在购粮期间供应农民大车六千六百辆，胶皮轮带三千六百付，耕畜一万三千多头。热河省农民在最近一个时期已买进铁车、木车二千一百八十三辆，目前还在添购。松江省五常县农民最近添买了二千多头耕畜和八百多辆车。各地农民一般都很重视增施粪肥和选用优良品种。辽东省通化县农民积肥已达三十多万车；庄河、海城、盖平等七县农民将从人民政府调剂到各种作物的优良品种四百八十三万斤。热河省农民已积聚的肥料，估计足够百分之八十左右的耕地施用。该省滦平、隆化和承德等县农民已把三分之一的肥料送到地里。松江省拉林、巴彦、五常、木兰等县农民共已选出各种作物的种籽五十多万斤。此外，各省大部县份都已开过农业劳动模范会议，以推广郭后旗丰产经验为中心，总结了去年的农业技术改革工作，确定了今年的农业技术改革措施。各省大多已完成对农业技术推广站干部的集中训练，以进一步指导农民使用马拉农具。今年全区计划推广的三千套马拉农具，现在大部已运发各地。过去已推广的四千六百多套马拉农具，也已大部完成检修。
    东北行政委员会农业局工作组在检查各省春耕准备工作中也发现了一些问题。其中主要是有些地区粪肥准备不足，有些地区对总结推广丰产经验重视不够，有些地区准备的生产资料还不能满足农民扩大再生产的要求等。因此，东北行政委员会农业局除指示各地认真研究解决以上问题外，还准备再派干部到各地督促和推动，争取全区及时完成春耕准备工作，为进一步增产粮食和工业原料创造有利条件。
