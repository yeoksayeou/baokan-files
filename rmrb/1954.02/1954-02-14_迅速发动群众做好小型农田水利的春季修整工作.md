    Quickly Mobilize the Masses to Do a Good Job in Spring Repair of Small-Scale Farmland Water Conservancy
  　Wu Jiaxiang

    Drought and waterlogging are serious problems that have long threatened agricultural production in our country. Since last autumn, rainfall has been scarce in various parts of the southwest, and the water levels of many rivers and lakes have dropped significantly compared to the same period in previous years. For example, the water level of Dianchi Lake in Yunnan in November was about two meters lower than in the same period in 1952, and the water inlet pipes of many mechanical pumping stations along the lake were exposed above the water surface. In Sichuan Province, the water storage in ponds, dikes, and winter paddy fields was more than 30 percent less than in previous years. According to meteorological records from fifteen locations in the northeast, north China, Inner Mongolia, northwest China, and Shandong in the northern regions, the total precipitation from the beginning of December last year to January 18 this year was mostly below 10 mm (only Xi'an in Shaanxi and Mudanjiang in Songjiang exceeded 10 mm). Judging from these situations, the spring drought in these areas this year is likely to be severe again. Although spring droughts do not often occur in the east and central south regions south of the Huai River, they are prone to spring floods, and are easily attacked by drought in summer and autumn.

    Since last winter, many regions have not universally carried out winter farmland water conservancy repairs because they did not combine grain purchase and requisition work well with winter production work. The postponement of winter water conservancy repairs has aggravated the task of spring water conservancy repairs throughout the year, and has become an urgent problem to be solved in the current agricultural production work.

    To solve this problem, we must first solve the problem of combining farmland water conservancy construction with other work. At present, the grain purchase work in various regions has basically ended, and it is turning to the work of developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Moreover, after the beginning of spring, various regions will begin spring plowing. Therefore, the rural work in the coming period will be busier than in the previous period. If we cannot coordinate well in work arrangements and labor allocation, it will have an adverse impact on this year's agricultural production. Developing mutual aid and cooperation and building water conservancy can not only be closely integrated; but also, water conservancy construction must be based on mutual aid and cooperation to drive the broad masses of farmers to carry it out. According to the experience of Sui County, Hubei Province, in last year's winter water conservancy project: the better the mutual aid groups were, the better the water conservancy in that area was developed. At the same time, the mutual aid and cooperation movement can be vigorously carried out through water conservancy construction. Taking Changshan District of the county as an example, three townships in the district have given full play to the role of mutual aid groups and have now completed 33 ponds and weirs. At the same time, driven by water conservancy construction, 44 temporary labor exchange mutual aid groups have also been developed. In last year's winter repairs, Shatian Township in the 18th District of Ningxiang, Hunan also had such a situation. Four of the sixteen mutual aid groups in the township that had collapsed were restored in this winter repair. In addition, fifty-two temporary mutual aid groups were organized. Due to the mutual aid and labor exchange improving work efficiency, the whole township has repaired four ponds, two dams, and five river embankments, and also dug tens of thousands of dan of pond mud.

    The second issue is that we must clearly explain the policy of water conservancy construction to the masses. In some areas, the policy explanation was not clear when deploying water conservancy projects. Some township cadres misinterpreted the "self-repair as the mainstay" policy for small-scale water conservancy as "no mutual assistance." Some emphasized that small-scale water conservancy was entirely the responsibility of the masses and no loans were provided, while some of the masses had the idea of simply relying on the government. All of these are incorrect. When mobilizing the masses to build farmland water conservancy, the leading departments of water conservancy at all levels must explain to the masses: the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy is mainly based on the masses organizing themselves and relying on their own strength, but this does not mean that the government will not help. The government can provide certain support in terms of technology and loans depending on the specific situation. With this explained clearly, the masses will be easily mobilized, and it will be easier to consolidate once mobilized. The masses in Rong'an Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, decided that the township's flood control dike project expenses would no longer be fully requested from government loans, but would be partially raised by the masses themselves after understanding the policies of the People's Government. This is a clear example. However, in the work of repairing small-scale farmland water conservancy, special attention must be paid to implementing the policy of reasonable burden, where those who benefit more bear more, those who benefit less bear less, and those who do not benefit do not bear. At the same time, there must also be a relatively reasonable system for assessing and recording work. In Yanggang Township, Zhegao District, Chao County, Anhui Province, when mobilizing the masses to repair ponds, regardless of the strength of the labor force and how much work was done, whether good or bad, it was all counted as one work unit. As a result, the strong labor force was unwilling to carry more, and families with strong labor forces also called children or the elderly to mix work on the pond. As a result, after three years of repairs, even the pond leaks were not repaired. This lesson should be well remembered in future construction work.

    Again, we must strengthen the ideological leadership of water conservancy technical cadres. In terms of technical guidance, all regions have attached importance to it, and many technical cadres have gone deep into the countryside to assist farmers in the design and construction of farmland water conservancy. However, a small number of technical cadres in some areas cannot be down-to-earth and start from the needs of the masses, but are looking for large projects in small-scale water conservancy. Often, because the projects are large, the time required is long, and the technical strength cannot keep up, resulting in a waste of technical strength and nothing is achieved. Some technical cadres waste their energy on trivial designs and calculations, which are of no benefit to practical work. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological leadership of these technical cadres so that they can better play their technical capabilities in the projects urgently needed by the masses, and at the same time, they can be improved in practical work exercises.

    The spring plowing season is coming soon. All regions should immediately seize the opportunity, lead the masses to do a good job in farmland water conservancy repairs according to different circumstances, and at the same time pay attention to doing a good job in management and maintenance, so as to create more favorable conditions for increasing grain and cotton production in 1954.

### 迅速发动群众做好小型农田水利的春季修整工作

    迅速发动群众做好小型农田水利的春季修整工作
  　吴家骧
    干旱和水涝是长期威胁着我国农业生产的一个严重问题。西南各地从去年秋天以来，雨量稀少，许多河流湖泊水位均较往年同期显著下降。如云南滇池十一月份水位，较一九五二年同期减低约两公尺，沿湖机械提水站抽水机进水管口多已露在水面以上，四川全省塘埝和冬水田蓄水较往年减少了百分之三十以上。北部地区根据东北、华北、内蒙、西北和山东十五个地点的气象纪录，从去年十二月初到今年一月十八日的总降水量，大多在十公厘以下（只有陕西西安和松江牡丹江两处超过十公厘）。根据这些情况来看，这些地区今年春旱又很可能是严重的。淮河以南的华东、中南地区，虽然不常发生春旱，但却容易发生春涝，而且每到夏秋两季，又容易遭受干旱袭击。
    去年冬天以来，许多地区由于在进行购粮征粮时，没有很好结合冬季生产工作，农田水利冬修工作都没有普遍开展。由于水利冬修时间的推迟，这就加重了各地全年水利春修的任务，并且已经成为当前农业生产工作中一个急待解决的问题。
    解决这个问题首先要解决兴修农田水利和其他工作的结合问题。目前各地的购粮工作已基本结束，正转向发展互助合作组织的工作，而且，立春以后各地就要开始春耕，因此今后一个时期的农村工作比前一个时期会更加繁忙，如果在工作安排和劳力调配等方面不能很好地互相配合，就会对今年的农业生产发生不利影响。发展互助合作和兴修水利不仅完全可以密切结合；而且兴修水利必须以互助合作作基础带动广大农民群众来进行。根据湖北省随县在去年冬修水利工程中的经验：那个地方的互助组搞的好，那个地区的水利就开展的好，同时通过兴修水利并可以大力的开展互助合作运动。以该县长山区为例，该区有三个乡由于充分发挥了互助组的作用，现已完成塘堰三十三处，同时由于兴修水利的推动，还发展了四十四个临时换工互助组。湖南宁乡十八区沙田乡在去年冬修中也有这样的情况，该乡十六个互助组中的四个垮了台的组，在这次冬修中又恢复了，此外还组织了五十二个临时互助组，由于互助换工提高了工作效率，全乡已修好四口塘、两座坝、五处河堤，同时还挑出几万担塘泥。
    其次一个问题是必须向群众交代清楚兴修水利的政策。有些地区在布置水利工程时，政策交代不明确，有的乡干部把兴修小型水利的“自修为主”的方针，误解为“不要互助”，有的强调小型水利完全由群众负责不给贷款，而群众方面有的却有单纯依赖政府的思想。这些都是不对的。各级水利工作领导部门在发动群众兴修农田水利时，必须向群众讲明：兴修小型农田水利主要是在群众组织起来的基础上，依靠群众自己的力量来进行，但是这并不是说政府就不帮助了，政府可根据具体情况在技术方面和贷款方面给以一定的支持。这样讲清楚了，群众就容易发动，发动起来了也容易巩固。福建省闽侯县榕岸乡群众了解了人民政府的政策后，决定该乡的防洪堤工程经费，不再完全要求政府贷款，而由群众自筹一部分，就是显明的例子。但是在修整小型农田水利工作中，必须特别注意贯彻受益大的多负担，受益小的少负担，不受益的不负担的合理负担政策，同时还要有比较合理的评工记工制度。安徽省巢县柘皋区杨岗乡，在发动群众修塘时，不管劳力强弱和做活多少、好坏都算一个工，以致劳力强的不愿多挑，家中有强劳力的也叫小孩子或老年人到塘上混工，结果修了三年，连塘漏也没修好。这个教训在今后兴修工作中应该很好记取。
    再次是必须加强对水利技术干部的思想领导。在技术指导方面，各地均已重视，很多技术干部已深入农村协助农民进行农田水利的设计施工工作。但有少数地区的技术干部不能脚踏实地从群众的需要出发，而是在小型水利里找大工程。往往由于工程大，需时长，技术力量赶不上，结果造成技术力量的浪费，而一无所成。还有一些技术干部把精力浪费在琐细的设计和计算中，对实际工作毫无补益。因之必须加强对这些技术干部的思想领导工作，使他们能够更好地在群众迫切需要的工程中发挥他们的技术能力，同时也可以使他们能够在实际工作锻炼中得到提高。
    春耕季节很快就要到来了，各地应立即抓紧时机，根据不同情况，领导群众做好农田水利修整工作，并同时注意做好管理养护，为一九五四年粮棉增产创造更有利的条件。
