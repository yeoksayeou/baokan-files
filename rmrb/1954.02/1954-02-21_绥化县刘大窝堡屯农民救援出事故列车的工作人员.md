    Farmers from Liu Dawo Fort Village in Suihua County Rescue Staff from Accident Train
    Song Yingfan from the Political Department of the Suihua Railway Sub-bureau writes: On the morning of January 31st, freight train 757, traveling from Suihua to Hailun, unfortunately derailed at kilometer 173, meter 780 between Zhangweitun and Suiling due to a broken rail. The two conductors and three staff members on the train were thrown down the embankment, two meters high and ten meters away, and were injured. The conductor, Guo Fuchun, was the most severely injured, having been burned unconscious by the fire from the stove. At this moment, farmers Ji Guanghe, Lu San, and Brother Wang, from Liu Dawo Fort Village in Zhangwei District, Suihua County, rushed to the scene from the village, which was more than a mile away. They quickly carried the injured to the home of the village head, Ji Dianchen, and six militiamen guarded the site. Three hours later, the Suihua Sub-bureau's rescue train arrived. The farmer brothers harnessed a large cart with four horses and safely transported the injured onto the rescue train. The actions of the farmer brothers, showing care for the people's railway work and love for the worker elder brothers, greatly moved the crew of train 757. They expressed: in the future, they must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, work hard, and strive for an early transition to socialism.

    绥化县刘大窝堡屯农民救援出事故列车的工作人员
    绥化铁路分局政治处宋英范来信：一月三十一日早晨，由绥化开向海伦的七五七次货车行到张维屯、绥棱间一百七十三公里七百八十公尺处时，不幸因钢轨折断，造成了列车颠覆事故。车上的两个车长和三个职员翻到两公尺高十公尺远的道台下，受了伤。其中以车长果福纯受伤最重，被炉火烧得昏迷不醒。正在这时，绥化县张维区刘大窝堡屯的农民季广和、陆三、王大哥等，从一里多远的屯里赶到现场。他们很快把伤者抬到村长季殿臣家里，并由六个民兵在现场守护。三个钟头后，绥化分局的救援列车赶到。农民兄弟们套了四个马的大车，把伤者安全地送上了救援列车。农民兄弟这种关怀人民铁路工作、热爱工人老大哥的行动，大大地感动了七五七次列车的乘务人员。他们表示：今后一定要加强工农联盟，努力工作，争取早日过渡到社会主义。
