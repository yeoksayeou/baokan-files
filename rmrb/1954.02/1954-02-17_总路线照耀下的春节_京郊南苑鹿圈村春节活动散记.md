    Spring Festival Illuminated by the General Line
    ——A Chronicle of Spring Festival Activities in Lucun Village, Nanyuan, a Suburb of Beijing
    Wu Fang
    This year's Spring Festival activities in Lucun Village, Lucun Township, Nanyuan District, began with the publicity of the general line of the state. The term "socialism" began to be on the lips of everyone, old and young, and everyone's heart brightened: life is not limited to three earthen houses and ten acres of land, and Chairman Mao will lead everyone to take the socialist road. The village's main production is cotton. Last year, the villagers who harvested around two hundred catties per mu were already beaming, and some were even selected as labor models for the entire village, but now they themselves know that this yield is still far from enough. Tractors came to the village a while ago, and everyone knows that this rare visitor will become a capable assistant for the farmers.
    The film projection team came to the village a few days before the Spring Festival, when people were busy slaughtering pigs and tearing flower cloth. The supply and marketing cooperative was busy selling goods, and the credit cooperative was busy recovering loans. Films such as "Spark Collective Farm" and "Chinese Farmers Visiting the Soviet Delegation" were close to the farmers' hearts. The Huo Fengqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in the village absorbed new members before the Spring Festival, and cadres from the district came to help expand the cooperative. Everyone knew that this was related to themselves and to the state's general line. Over the winter, the cooperative increased from thirty-three households to sixty-two households. The cooperative's livestock house was crowded and noisy; five mules, five donkeys, and four cows were all working hard. The cooperative wants to expand the planting area of ​​fruits and vegetables, and grape seedlings have already been stored; it also wants to build its own brick kiln to build houses.
    All of this has already become the top news in the village. Socialism is flooding into Lucun like water from an opened river gate. People are talking about the prospects of socialism in meetings and on the heated brick beds: everyone must be "collective," must use machine production, and make the output higher and higher and the life better and better, just as the foreign guests who often come to Lucun congratulate them.
    Before the Spring Festival, some vacationing workers and students also returned to the village, and the topic of conversation between the returnees and their relatives and friends could not be separated from "going social." Everyone sees how great the changes in the village are. The highway surveying team came a long time ago, and the canal will also flow through here. The activists in the village are not only young people; elderly military family members or people who have become grandparents are also "taking the lead" here.
    The Beijing Workers' Delegation also came from the city to visit the agricultural production cooperative before the Spring Festival, bringing banners and medicines to prevent cotton insects, and held a warm brotherly meeting at the township people's government. The friendship between workers and peasants was exchanged, and the village theater troupe temporarily performed songs and dances to welcome the worker elder brothers to the village. The cooperative sent two large bags of peanuts and several bundles of green onions to the worker delegation. Huo Fengqi, a Beijing model worker, was also invited to the city to meet with the worker and peasant labor models in Beijing, exchange production experience, and take a group photo before returning. All of these added to the festive atmosphere in Lucun Village before the Spring Festival. On New Year's Eve, the villagers played chess and cards and listened to gramophone records at the cultural station for most of the night.
    The young people are even more enthusiastic and actively engaged in the rural amateur theater troupe. They had previously done temporary performances in conjunction with tasks. This winter, a comrade from the Music Group of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture came to teach everyone to sing, and a comrade from the Central Experimental Opera House came to help rehearse the play. On the second night of the Lunar New Year, although the weather was very cold, the open-air performance of the village theater troupe still attracted 1,600 to 1,700 spectators. In addition to singing and clapper talk, there were small ensemble performances of "Good Sisters," "Liberation Bridge," and Ping Opera "Women Representatives." The artistic level has been improved a step further on the original basis. The audience gained an understanding of the themes of the worker-peasant alliance, collectivism, and good family relations expressed in the performance. The actors also thanked the professional art troupes for their help. With their guidance, the actors have initially gained some stage knowledge and can understand the plot to create roles. Actor Meng Guangzhen said: "I have performed some plays in the past, but I didn't quite understand the plot after the performance. This time, after the director's guidance, I understand a lot more." She is a graduate of the quick literacy class and is now qualified to read scripts by herself.
    The village theater troupe also went to Nanyuan for a joint performance during the Spring Festival, saw the performances of other rural amateur theater troupes, and received some encouragement. This time, they want to work hard to prevent the theater troupe from collapsing and make the theater troupe a powerful propaganda and education assistant for the Party and the government in the village, and play a role in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. The local directing talents were also trained this time.
    Not many days after the Spring Festival, the cultural life of the farmers in Lucun Village added another lively event: the Central Experimental Opera House came to Lucun to perform. Li Bo and Guo Lanying, who won awards at the World Youth and Student Peace Festival, also came. The villagers warmly welcomed them and took photos from the cover of "People's Songs" to compare with their faces. The performance team of forty-seven people brought so much joy to the villagers, and the two-day performance attracted tens of thousands of spectators from all directions.
    People appreciated the folk dance "Running Donkey," Hunan Flower Drum Opera "Liu Hai Cutting Firewood," and New Ping Opera "The Sky Clears After the Rain" with great interest. Some villagers said: "Running Donkey"? Don't sing? They like the national form of singing and dancing. Guo Lanying's "Liu Hai Cutting Firewood," which she learned in three days, was well received by everyone. "Even the fox spirits love the working people. This is not superstition, this is valuing our working people." The young farmers laughed. Wang Shuping and Yin Yunhan, who have been singing new operas for many years, rushed to rehearse the new Ping Opera "The Sky Clears After the Rain" in more than twenty days for the Spring Festival performance in the countryside, because they knew that the farmers in Lucun and other suburbs of Beijing were more familiar with Ping Opera and the singing was easy to understand. They did not disappoint the farmers of Lucun. The idea of ​​"working alone is not as good as mutual assistance, and mutual assistance is not as good as cooperation" running through this script is obvious and easy to understand. The audience said: "Look at that husband's dead brain, he is not as progressive as his wife!" "After suffering some hardships, he finally turned around!" They liked these plots of joys and sorrows. In Lucun Village, some farmers are still drumming in their hearts about mutual aid and cooperation. Now, all sixty-two households in the cooperative only account for one-seventh of the total village population. Everyone still has some concerns about the fact that the land dividend is small, they must go to work on time, and they are afraid that they will get less if they go to work less... The immediate interests are blocking everyone's vision. What impact this play will have on the audience's minds will gradually become apparent in the future.
    Huo Fengqi, 58, likes to listen to storytelling, but is not enthusiastic about watching operas. On the first day, such a good opera was performed in the village square, and he and his son went to the cellar to pound Chinese cabbage. He said: "Our farmers put labor first. I only think about the general line of the country and concentrate on running the cooperative well." The next day, people from the theater troupe came to invite him to watch the opera. After watching the opera, he realized that there was also mutual aid and cooperation and Chairman Mao's leadership in the opera.
    In the past, Lucun was the hunting area of ​​the royal family, with a small population and more residents moved in from neighboring villages. People guarded this alkaline land with poor output, working for the landlords, unable to take care of food and clothing, and folk art did not develop. They could not even perform dragon lanterns and lions during the Spring Festival. Now the township people's government plans to let the two farmers in the village who can tell stories show their skills and tell stories to the villagers to try. The cultural station's house is too narrow and they also plan to move.
    The farmers in Lucun all said that this Spring Festival was much livelier. Not only did every household buy a few New Year pictures, eat dumplings and pay New Year's greetings, but they also watched movies and operas, and the movies and operas were closely related to their lives. Some people have also visited the exhibition on the general line in Nanyuan Town. The land of the agricultural production cooperative has been expanded from more than 500 mu to nearly 1,000 mu. The cooperative members are busy cutting grass and accumulating fertilizer, and everyone has full confidence that this year's output will be higher than last year's. This year, we will increase mechanized farming, and the cooperative's production plan and new rules have already been finalized. Huo Fengqi is discussing with the cooperative's committee members that when building the cooperative's houses in the future, the office and the cultural club should be built together, so that the cultural life of the whole village will be more meaningful and lively, and the cooperative members should attend civil schools even more. He said: "If they are all illiterate, they will not be able to reach socialism."

### 总路线照耀下的春节——京郊南苑鹿圈村春节活动散记

    总路线照耀下的春节
    ——京郊南苑鹿圈村春节活动散记
    吴方
    今年南苑区鹿圈乡鹿圈村的春节活动是从国家总路线的宣传开始的。“社会主义”这个名词开始挂在老老小小的口上，大家心上亮了：日子不停在三间土房、十来亩地上，毛主席还要领导大家走社会主义的道儿。村里的主要生产是棉花，去年每亩收得二百斤上下的庄稼主已经眉开眼笑，甚至被选为全村劳动模范，可是现在他们自己也知道这产量还差得远。拖拉机早来过村子里，大家知道这位稀客将要变作农民得力的助手。
    电影放映队在春节前几天就到村里来了，那时候，人们正忙着宰猪，扯花布。供销合作社忙于销货，信用合作社忙于收回贷款。“星火集体农庄”和“中国农民访苏代表团”等电影对农民是亲切的。村里霍凤岐农业生产合作社在春节前吸收新社员，区里来了干部帮助扩大合作社，大家知道这是关系自己，又关系国家总路线的事。一个冬天下来，合作社由三十三户增加到六十二户。合作社的牲口房里挤得紧叫得欢；五头骡子、五头驴子、四头牛，没有一头闲着。合作社要发展水果蔬菜的种植面，葡萄秧子早已存下；要自烧砖窑盖房子。
    这一切，已经构成村里的头等新闻了。社会主义像开了河闸的水似的在涌进鹿圈来。人们在片会上、在炕头上谈社会主义的远景：大家必须“集体”、必须使上机器生产，作到产量越来越高，日子过得越来越好，就像时常来鹿圈的外宾们所祝贺的那样。
    春节前，村里也回来一些休假的职工和学生，还乡人和亲友的话题也离不了“走社会”的事儿。大家眼瞅着村子里的变化有多么大，公路测量队早来过了，运河也要流过这里。村里的积极分子不只是青年人，上了岁数的军属或是当了爷爷奶奶的人，也在这儿“带头”。
    北京市的工人代表团也在春节前从城里来访问农业生产合作社，给带来了旗帜和防治棉虫的药品，在乡人民政府里开了一个热烈的兄弟见面会。工人农民的情谊得到交流，村剧团临时演了歌舞欢迎工人老大哥到村里来。合作社送了两大袋花生和几捆大葱给工人代表团。霍凤岐是北京市劳动模范，还应邀进城和北京市的工人农民劳动模范们见了面，交流了生产经验，照了合影回来。这些，都增加了鹿圈村春节前的欢乐气氛。除夕晚上，老乡们在文化站上玩了大半宵的棋、扑克，听留声机唱片。
    青年人兴致更高，积极地搞起农村业余剧团。他们过去曾经结合任务作过临时演出。这个冬天，北京市文化处音乐组来了一位同志教大家唱歌，中央实验歌剧院来了一位同志帮助排戏。年初二晚上，虽然天气很冷，村剧团的露天演出，还是吸引了一千六七百观众，除了歌唱、快板以外，有小演唱“好姊妹”、“解放桥”和评剧“妇女代表”，艺术水平都在原有基础上提高了一步。观众对演出中表现的工农联盟思想、集体主义精神以及搞好家庭关系的主题都有了体会。演员也感谢专业文艺团体的帮助。由于他们的辅导，演员们初步获得了一些舞台常识，能够体会剧情去创造角色了。演员孟广贞说：“过去演过些戏，演过了对剧情还不太理解，这次经过导演的辅导，懂得多些了。”她是速成识字班的毕业生，如今已具备自己读剧本的条件了。
    村剧团在春节还去南苑会演过，看到了其他农村业余剧团的演出，得到一些鼓舞。他们这次想努力不使剧团垮台，使剧团成为党和政府在村子里的有力宣传教育的助手，在推动农业的社会主义改造上发挥一些力量。本村的导演人材，这次也进行了培养。
    过了春节没有几天，鹿圈村农民的文化生活又添了一件热闹事：中央实验歌剧院到鹿圈来演出了。在世界青年与学生和平联欢节上得奖的李波和郭兰英也来了，老乡们热烈地欢迎她们，拿了“人民歌声”封面上的照片来对她们的脸。四十七个人组成的演出队给老乡们带来多少欢乐，两天演出，从四面八方吸引来了上万的观众。
    人们以很大的兴趣，欣赏了民间舞蹈“跑驴”、湖南花鼓戏“刘海砍樵”和新评剧“雨过天晴”。有的老乡说：“跑驴”?不唱呢？他们喜欢且歌且舞的民族形式。郭兰英用三天功夫学的“刘海砍樵”受到大家的欢迎。“狐狸精都喜爱劳动人民，这不是迷信，这是看重咱劳动人民哩。”青年农民们笑了。演唱新歌剧多年的王淑萍和殷韵含，这次为了春节下乡演出，用二十多天赶排了新评剧“雨过天晴”，因为她们知道，鹿圈农民和北京其他郊区农民一样，比较熟悉评剧，唱念好懂。她们没有叫鹿圈的农民失望。贯穿在这个剧本中的“单干不如互助、互助不如合作”的思想是明显易懂的，观众们说：“瞧那个丈夫死脑筋呀，不如他媳妇进步哩！”“吃了些苦头，这才转过来了！”他们喜欢这些悲欢离合的情节。在鹿圈村子里，对于互助合作，有些农民们还在心里打着鼓，如今全社六十二户，也只占全村人口的七分之一。大家对于土地分红少、必须按时出工、怕出工少了分得少……还有些顾虑，眼前的利益遮拦了大家的视线。这一个戏在观众们心里起什么影响，以后会逐渐显露出来。
    五十八岁的霍凤岐喜欢听评书，对看戏不热心。头一天村里广场上演了这么好的戏，他和儿子到窖里捣白菜去了。他说：“咱们庄稼人劳动第一啊，我只盘算着国家总路线，一心要把合作社办好。”第二天剧团来人请他去看戏，看了戏他才明白：原来戏里面也有互助合作，也有毛主席的领导。
    过去鹿圈是皇家的猎区，人口稀少，自邻村移来的居民较多。人们守着这片出产不丰的碱性土地，给地主劳动，顾不上吃穿，民间艺术不发展，过春节连个龙灯狮子也耍不起来。如今乡人民政府打算让村里能说评书的两位农民露露本事，给村里人说说试试，文化站的房子太窄，也打算搬家。
    鹿圈农民们都说，这个春节过得热闹多了，不只家家买几张年画、吃饺子拜年，还看了电影看了戏，电影和戏又密切地联系着他们的生活。有人还去南苑镇上看过有关总路线的展览会，农业生产合作社的土地由五百多亩扩充到近千亩了，社员们正忙铡草积肥，大家具备了今年产量比去年更高的饱满的信心。今年要增加机耕，社里的生产计划和新社章也早订妥了。霍凤岐在和社里委员们商议，将来盖社里房子时，要把办公室和文化俱乐部盖到一起，让全村的文化生活搞得更有意义、更热闹，社员们更应该上民校。他说：“全是些文盲的话，是走不到社会主义的。”
