Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Under the powerful pressure of the Soviet Union's peace policy and the people of all countries' demands for peaceful negotiation, the United States had no choice but to agree to hold the Four Foreign Ministers Conference and had to reach some agreements on negotiated settlement of disputes. However, the real purpose of the United States was not to further ease international tensions. The United States' aim to obstruct the Berlin conference from achieving results on a comprehensive settlement of international disputes, in order to maintain international tensions, was fully exposed by the propaganda organs of the Western three countries before and during the conference.

More than a month before the conference, Agence France-Presse said that so-called American authoritative figures "are not at all enthusiastic about the prospect of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Berlin on January 4." The British "Times" also said that the United States regards the Four Foreign Ministers Conference "as something to be concluded as soon as possible in order to clear the way for the European Defense Group." The United States' Associated Press even openly revealed the United States' intention on January 25, the day the conference was held, saying: "To be honest, the United States does not expect any miracles to happen. It is here to negotiate, hoping that if the negotiations really fail, the free world will be convinced that the hope of ending the Cold War is still very slim, and thus convinced that the West must proceed with important plans such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Army." In another telegram, the Associated Press also said that Eisenhower, Dulles, and American "authoritative figures" had made "considerable efforts in the weeks before the meeting to mentally prepare the United States to expect very little constructive results from this meeting."

Dulles, who attended the conference with such aims and plans, adopted an unreasonable attitude of refusing to negotiate from the beginning. Even the British "Manchester Guardian," which sympathized with Dulles, said that Dulles' speech would have been more suitable if it had been given at the American Legion convention. British Labor MP Donnelly also said: "Dulles' attitude at the Berlin conference was the most absurd manifestation of political irresponsibility."

In this situation, a strange phenomenon appeared at the meeting: on the one hand, the United States repeatedly stated before the meeting that the main issue to be resolved at this conference was the German question; on the other hand, the United States and its British and French partners failed to put forward a truly positive plan to solve the German question throughout the conference. In order to rebuild German unity and ensure European security, the Soviet Union successively put forward many important proposals, but Dulles' answer was only a "no." The only "magic wand" used by the United States, Britain, and France to block the Soviet proposals was the "Eden Plan," which only contained some technical things and no substantive content.

During the conference, the American propaganda machine tried its best to spread pessimistic air outside the meeting, publicizing that the meeting would not have any results. Just as the discussion of the German question at the conference was unable to make progress due to the stubborn obstruction of the United States, Britain, and France, the United States' Associated Press said gleefully on February 7: "Now Americans believe that the failure of the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference is almost a foregone conclusion. …People's emotions may be generally relieved, because some people with subjective wishes have eliminated their unrealistic and dangerous illusions." Under the instigation of the United States, West German newspapers close to the Bonn government also constantly publicized that the conference had fallen into a "dead end" and that the conference had "insurmountable difficulties."

However, the United States' "wishful thinking" did not come true. The meeting did not develop entirely according to the United States' predetermined route. Because the Soviet Union's proposal on convening a five-power conference and the proposals on unifying Germany and guaranteeing European security were in line with the interests of the people all over the world, they had a huge impact in Europe and the world. This situation made the United States dare not unilaterally interrupt the meeting, and had to reach some agreements. Scripps-Howard newspaper commentator Shackford, in describing the United States' dilemma, admitted that this was due to "the public opinion of some Western countries being so difficult to deal with." But the United States is very afraid of the huge impact of a comprehensive agreement. Washington "Star" reporter Noyes revealed this worried mood, saying: "The hope for reconciliation between East and West has had such an impact that the political situation in Western Europe has been paralyzed," "If this hope continues... it may have fatal consequences."

### 在柏林四国外长会议开会前后  美国一贯散布悲观空气害怕会议获得成果

    在柏林四国外长会议开会前后
    美国一贯散布悲观空气害怕会议获得成果
    【新华社二十日讯】美国在苏联和平政策和各国人民要求和平协商的强大压力下，不得不同意举行四国外长会议，并且不得不在协商解决争端上达成一些协议，但是美国的真实目的并不是想使国际紧张局势进一步趋于缓和。美国竭力阻挠柏林会议就全面解决国际争端获得成果，来保持国际紧张局势的目的，在会议以前和会议中间早已由西方三国的宣传机构充分暴露出来。
    法新社早在会议召开的一个多月以前，就曾说过：美国所谓权威人士“对于一月四日在柏林召开四国外长会议的前景，一点都不热心。”英国“泰晤士报”也说：美国把四国外长会议看作“是大可尽快了结的事情，以便为欧洲防务集团廓清道路。”美国合众社更在一月二十五日即会议召开的那一天公开透露美国的用心说：“说实话，美国并不希望会发生什么奇迹。它到这里来谈判，是希望：如果谈判真的失败，那么自由世界将深信结束冷战的希望仍然很少，并从而深信西方必须着手推行北大西洋公约组织和欧洲军等重要计划。”合众社在另一条电讯里还说，艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯和美国“权威人士”在会议举行以前的几个星期中，就曾“作了相当的努力，使得美国在思想上有所准备，期待这次会议产生很少建设性的结果。”
    抱着这样目的和计划来参加会议的杜勒斯，一开始就采取了不讲理的拒绝协商的态度。对于杜勒斯的这种态度，连对他表同情的英国“曼彻斯特卫报”也说，杜勒斯的发言如果在美国退伍军人团代表大会上讲还更合适些。英国工党议员唐纳利也说：“杜勒斯在柏林会议上所采取的态度，是在政治上不负责任的最荒谬的表现。”
    在这种情况下，会上曾出现了一种奇怪的现象：一方面美国在会前口口声声说这次会议主要必须解决德国问题，另一方面，美国及其英、法伙伴在整个会议期间竟然提不出一项真正解决德国问题的积极方案。苏联为了重建德国统一和保障欧洲安全，接连提出了许多重要建议，杜勒斯的回答却只有一个“不”字。美、英、法三国用来阻挡苏联建议的“魔杖”，只有一个“艾登计划”，而这个
  “计划”又只包含一些技术性的东西，没有实质的内容。
    会议期间，美国宣传机器在会外竭力散布悲观空气，宣传会议不会有什么结果。正当会议对德国问题的讨论在美、英、法三国的顽固阻挠之下无法获得进展时，美国合众社在二月七日兴高采烈地说：“现在美国人已认为柏林四国外长会议将陷于失败简直已是预定的结局了。……人们的情绪可能将普遍感到欣慰，因为某些抱着主观愿望的人们已经消除了他们的不现实的和危险的幻想。”在美国指使之下，接近波恩政府的西德报纸也不断地宣传说：会议已陷入“绝境”，会议有“无法解决的困难”。
    然而，美国的“如意算盘”并不如意。会议并没有完全按照美国的预定路线发展。由于苏联关于召开五大国会议的建议和统一德国、保障欧洲安全的建议符合全世界人民的利益，在欧洲和世界上产生了巨大的影响。这种情况使得美国不敢片面中断这次会议，并且不得不达成一些协议。美国斯克里浦斯—霍华德系报纸评论员沙克福在描述美国这种进退两难的处境时承认：这是由于“某些西方国家的舆论那么让人难以应付”。但是美国对于全面协议将会带来的巨大影响是十分惧怕的。华盛顿“明星报”记者诺伊斯就曾透露这种忧心忡忡的情绪说：
  “对东西方之间和解的希望产生了这样一种影响，使西欧的政治局面为之瘫痪”，“这种希望再继续下去……可能产生致命的后果。”
