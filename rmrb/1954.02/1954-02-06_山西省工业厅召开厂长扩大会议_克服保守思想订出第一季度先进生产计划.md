The Shanxi Provincial Industrial Department convened an expanded meeting of managers and directors of industrial bureaus from various special districts' enterprise companies, as well as factory directors and mine managers under its jurisdiction, on January 14th. Based on the spirit of ensuring that the industrial production in the first quarter of this year should not be lower than the actual level of the fourth quarter of last year, the meeting mobilized everyone to make careful calculations, deeply explore potential capabilities, and formulated an advanced production plan and guarantee measures for the first quarter, exceeding the actual production level of the fourth quarter of last year by 1.34%.

At the end of last year, various factories and mines had made full preparations for the production in the first quarter of this year, specifically studying issues such as mobilizing the masses to formulate guarantee plans, raw material supply, product sales, and ensuring attendance during the Spring Festival. However, due to the fact that many seasonal production units would suspend production in the first quarter, and that the leading cadres of some factories and mines underestimated the potential capabilities of the enterprises and the labor enthusiasm of the workers after the in-depth education of the General Line, they only felt that the first quarter had four fewer working days, and that low attendance during the Spring Festival was a long-standing historical habit. Therefore, the result of the plan preparation was more than 50 billion yuan less than the actual total output value of the fourth quarter of last year. After announcing the plan preparation situation of various units at the meeting, everyone was asked to examine their work based on the General Line, formulate advanced plans for the first quarter, and earnestly assume the role that local state-owned industries should play during the transition period.

Initially, some cadres had ideological resistance. Some comrades said: The first quarter has four fewer working days, coupled with the Spring Festival, which will inevitably lead to a high rate of absenteeism. How can we maintain the actual level of last year? Some comrades also believed that the leadership asked us to advance steadily, and also asked us to increase efficiency at a high speed, improve quality, and increase output. Are these requirements somewhat contradictory? Still others felt that the plan was just a plan, and whether it could be completed was another matter. In response to these ideological situations in the meeting, after helping everyone realize that the production in the first quarter being no lower than that of the fourth quarter of last year was of political significance concerning the speed of national industrialization, the current favorable conditions were analyzed, and concrete solutions were given. After the general meeting report and group discussions, it was unanimously clarified that the favorable factors in our enterprises can overcome all difficult conditions. The vast number of workers, after the publicity and education of the General Line, have greatly improved their labor enthusiasm for building a socialist society, which will be the force to overcome all difficulties. In addition, the production in the first quarter is being carried out on the basis of the increase production and practice economy campaign last year, so we can guarantee that the level of enterprise management will continue to improve. Secondly, various units, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, have made fuller preparations for the production in the first quarter than in any previous year. The promotion of various decisive advanced experiences is steadily deepening. Most of the capital construction projects in 1953 will be put into production in the first quarter. All of these are the material conditions for improving the production level in the first quarter of this year. As long as we are good at leveraging these favorable factors, it is entirely possible to achieve the goal of increasing production. On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, each unit, according to its own conditions, calculated efficiency in detail day by day, calculated the role of each technical organizational measure, and as a result, formulated a more advanced and feasible plan: 9.6% higher than the original quarterly plan, exceeding the actual level of the fourth quarter of last year by 1.34%.

In order to ensure the realization of this task, the meeting made specific arrangements for the work of various enterprises in the first quarter. In addition, it also required some seasonal production units to continue to strengthen their business operations. The egg product industry and the building materials industry will strive to put into production in March in the first quarter, depending on the region. After the meeting, the specific difficulties and individual problems of each unit were resolved separately.

    山西省工业厅召开厂长扩大会议
    克服保守思想订出第一季度先进生产计划
    山西省工业厅于一月十四日召开各专区企业公司工业局经理、局长及所属厂矿厂长扩大会议，根据今年第一季度工业生产不低于去年第四季度实际水平的精神，发动大家算细账，深掘潜在能力，订出了第一季度的先进生产计划及保证措施，超过去年第四季度的实际生产水平百分之一点三四。
    去年底，各厂矿对今年第一季度的生产已进行了充分的准备工作，专门研究了发动群众订保证计划、原材料供应、产品销售，以及保证春节出勤等问题。但由于好多季节性生产单位在第一季度将要停产，及某些厂矿的领导干部，对企业的潜在能力和经过总路线深入教育后，职工的劳动热忱估计不足。只感到第一季度少四个工作日，春节出勤低是历史上的老习惯，所以计划编制的结果，较去年第四季度实际总产值少了五百多亿元。会议中宣布了各单位编制计划的情况后，要求大家根据总路线来检查工作，订出第一季度的先进计划，切实担负起地方国营工业在过渡时期应起的作用。
    开始，一些干部思想上有抵触。有的同志说：第一季度少四个工作日，加上过春节，势必造成缺勤多的现象，怎能保持住去年的实际水平？也有的同志认为领导上叫我们稳步前进，又要叫我们高速度地提高效率，又要提高质量，又要增加产量，这样的要求是否有些矛盾？还有的人感到计划只是计划，完成完不成再说。会议中针对这些思想情况，从帮助大家认识了第一季度不低于去年第四季度的生产是关乎着国家工业化速度的政治意义后，分析目前的有利条件，切实具体给予解决。经过大会报告及小组讨论，一致明确了我们企业中的有利因素可胜过一切困难条件。广大职工经过总路线的宣传教育，大大提高了建设社会主义社会的劳动热忱，这将是克服一切困难的力量，加之第一季度的生产是在去年增产节约竞赛运动的基础上进行的，因而能获到企业管理水平不断提高的保证。其次各单位遵照省委指示，对第一季度生产的准备工作较之任何一年都进行得充分。各种具有决定性的先进经验的推广正在稳步的深入下去。一九五三年的基本建设工程大部将在第一季度投入生产。所有这些都是今年第一季度提高生产水平的物资条件，只要善于发挥这些有利因素，是完全可以达到提高生产的目的的。在统一思想认识的基础上，各个单位按照自己的条件，逐日详细的计算效率，计算每个技术组织措施的作用，结果制定出了较为先进可行的计划：比原来的季度计划提高了百分之九点六，超过去年第四季度实际水平百分之一点三四。
    为保证这一任务的实现，会议中对各个企业第一季度的工作，又作了具体安排。此外并要求一些季节性生产的单位继续加强经营工作。蛋品业、建筑材料业根据地域在第一季度三月份先后争取投入生产。会后对各单位的具体困难及个别问题，都分别作了解决。
