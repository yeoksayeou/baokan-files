The herdsmen of Guinan County, Qinghai Province, under the leadership of the People's Government, for the first time took up hoes and dug 143 wells, 223 cellars, and 24 ponds, and also built 7 reservoirs and 17 canals. Now, in front of tents everywhere in Guinan County, there is a constant flow of spring water, and Tibetan women no longer have to carry water from afar; after grazing, cattle and sheep can find pools of water just by turning around. They are also building the Qubucang Canal, to divert water to the Baluo Hutang grassland, which is 562 square kilometers in size.

Guinan County is a new county established in July last year in the Hainan pastoral area of Qinghai. In May and June of last year, the Hainan pastoral area was threatened by a severe drought, and large areas of grassland were bare without a single blade of grass, and springs and small canals were dry. Not to mention that people and livestock had difficulty drinking water, even the marmots on the grasslands died in whole nests. At that time, the Tibetan people suspected: "If the agricultural area suffers from drought, the government can allocate grain for relief, but if the grassland doesn't grow grass, can the Communist Party also allocate rain from the sky?" The Party and the local autonomous government promptly led the herdsmen to move their tents, find places with grass to graze their livestock, and if there was no water, they started digging cellars, wells, and canals. The Party and the government also educated the herdsmen to earnestly protect the winter and spring pastures. Many areas implemented seasonal rotational grazing, and the use of grasslands was fully rationalized.

After the Tibetan cadres discussed the work of production and animal husbandry protection in the county, they fully realized the significance of this work and consciously and voluntarily carried out the work, which powerfully promoted the mass animal husbandry protection movement. Responsible cadres of the Dacang, Xiangqian, and Wanxiu tribes all personally participated in digging cellars, repairing canals, and digging wells. When repairing the Qubucang Canal, Xiang Qian (formerly a Dacang official), the deputy captain of the district work team who was over sixty years old, and Tong Zengba (Dacang official) personally took up hoes and went into the water to dig the canal, insisting on leading more than 100 herdsmen to repair the canal for ten days, and finally built the five-mile-long canal.

In the pastoral areas, due to the influence of habit and superstition, some herdsmen believed that springs could not be dug. The Guinan County Committee of the Communist Party of China paid attention to uniting religious circles and, with the support of religious circles, carried out the work smoothly. Gao Fengqi, the secretary of the county party committee, personally visited Nie Erfo (vice chairman of the Guinan Consultative Committee) who was ill, explaining that the current drought was serious, and if it was not resolved, the livestock would be in great danger. When the well-digging work began, many herdsmen did not dare to start, fearing that they would offend the scriptures, and went to ask the Living Buddha. Nie Erfo said: "The scriptures have been chanted, but the rain has not fallen. Since the government asks you to dig wells, you should dig." Some herdsmen were still afraid, but after seeing the cadres taking the lead in digging wells, the herdsmen felt relieved.

The People's Government praised the herdsmen who dug wells in a timely manner. Two years ago, a herdsman named Zhuo Majia in Guinan County accidentally dug a well, and Zhang Zhongliang, chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, personally praised him at the joint meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the autonomous region. In May of last year, the Northwest Region issued Zhuo Majia a medal, a certificate, and a bonus of two million yuan. After this news spread, it further promoted the mass movement of digging wells and springs.

    贵南县牧民再不相信泉水是挖不得的了
    李根蒂
    青海省贵南县的牧民们，在人民政府领导下，第一次拿起镢头挖了一百四十三眼井、二百二十三个窖、二十四个涝池，还修了七个蓄水池、十七条水渠。现在，贵南县各地帐篷跟前都有了长流不息的泉水，藏民妇女再不必到远处去背水吃；牛羊吃过草后，只要转一下就能找到有水的池子。他们还正在兴修曲卜藏渠，要把渠水引到五百六十二平方公里的巴洛忽滩的草原去。
    贵南县是青海海南牧区在去年七月新成立的一个县。去年五、六月，海南牧区遇到严重的旱象威胁，大块的草原上光秃秃地没有一根青草，水泉和小渠都干涸了。不要说人和牲口发生饮水困难，就是草原上的?獭也整窝整窝地死去了。当时藏民们怀疑：“农业区受了旱，政府能调拨粮食救济，难道草原不长草，共产党也能调来天雨吗？”党和当地自治政府及时领导牧民转移帐篷，找有草的地方放牲口，没有水就动手挖窖、打井和修渠。党和政府还教育牧民，切实做到保护冬窝子和春窝子。许多地区实行四季分段轮牧，对草场的使用，充分做到合理。
    藏民干部在县里讨论生产保畜工作以后，充分认识了这个工作的意义，自觉自愿地进行工作，有力地推动了群众性的保畜运动。大仓、项谦、万秀等族的负责干部都亲自参加挖窖、修渠、打井工作。挖修曲卜藏渠时，六十多岁的区工作队副队长项欠（原大仓官人）、同曾巴（大仓官人）亲自拿上镢头下水挖渠，坚持领导一百多牧民修了十天水渠，终于把五里长的水渠修了起来。
    在牧区，由于习惯和迷信的影响，有些牧民认为泉是挖不得的。中共贵南县委注意团结宗教界，通过宗教界的支援，把工作顺利开展起来。县委书记高凤岐曾亲自看望病中的聂耳佛（贵南协商委员会副主席），说明目前旱象严重，如果不解决，牧畜就要遭到很大危险。打井工作开始时，许多牧民不敢动手，怕触犯了经，去问活佛。聂耳佛说：“经也念了，雨还是没下，既然政府叫打井，你们就挖。”有些牧民还是害怕，以后看见干部先动手挖井，牧民们才放下心。
    人民政府对打井的牧民，适时地进行了表扬。前年贵南县有个叫卓麻加的牧民偶尔打了个井，青海省省人民政府张仲良主席在自治区主席、副主席联席会上亲自表扬了他。去年五月西北区又给卓麻加发了奖章、奖状和二百万元的奖金。这个消息传开以后，更推动了群众性打井挖泉运动。
