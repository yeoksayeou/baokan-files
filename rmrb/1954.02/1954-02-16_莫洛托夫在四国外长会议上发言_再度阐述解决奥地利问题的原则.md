Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 15th: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting continued its discussion on the third item on the agenda, "The Question of the Austrian State Treaty," on the 14th, with Molotov as chairman.

According to the decision of the 13th session, the meeting first studied the discussion procedure for the third item on the agenda. Dulles spoke and put forward a suggestion that the four foreign ministers should adopt the clauses of the draft Austrian State Treaty that had already been agreed upon by the four foreign ministers' assistants. Dulles also suggested adopting the Soviet Union's proposals on certain clauses made in previous negotiations by the four foreign ministers' assistants. Dulles also suggested adopting the Soviet amendment to Article 35, which stipulated that Austria could use goods to repay the compensation due to the Soviet Union for former German assets. Dulles avoided mentioning the part of the Soviet proposal on quickly restoring Austria to a free and independent state, and suggested taking measures to have the Austrian State Treaty signed on February 18th. Bidault and Eden expressed their agreement with Dulles's suggestion.

Molotov spoke and pointed out that the previous differences between the four countries regarding the Austrian State Treaty have now been almost completely eliminated, but not entirely. The Soviet delegation noted Dulles's suggestion, and also noted Bidault and Eden's agreement with this suggestion. Molotov hoped that agreement could be reached on individual clauses where consensus has not yet been reached. The Soviet delegation believes that the fact that the United States, Britain, and France have withdrawn their objections to the Soviet amendments, which they have insisted on for several years, is of positive significance. This would facilitate the swift conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty, without having to task the four foreign ministers' assistants to study the differences regarding the Austrian State Treaty again. Of course, if the suggestions made by the Soviet Union are taken into consideration, we can agree that the four foreign ministers can reach a final agreement on the text of the Austrian State Treaty at this meeting.

Molotov then pointed out that Dulles had neglected a question that was and is of great significance to the Soviet Union, namely that the new treaty should be a truly enforceable treaty. We have always believed that the implementation of the relevant articles on Trieste in the Italian Peace Treaty is abnormal. The United States and Britain, who signed this treaty, have not fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the aforementioned articles. Trieste still has American and British military bases, which not only openly violates the Italian Peace Treaty, but also violates the interests of European peace. We believe that this foreign ministers' meeting cannot ignore this issue. Therefore, we suggest passing the following resolution on the Trieste issue: "The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France recommends that the Security Council resume discussions on the implementation of the part of the Italian Peace Treaty concerning the Free Territory of Trieste."

Molotov said that the Soviet delegation would like to remind the meeting to pay special attention to two suggestions from the Soviet delegation. The first suggestion was put forward by the Soviet delegation at the meeting on the 12th, which stipulates that a supplementary Article 4b should be included in the draft Austrian State Treaty: Austria shall guarantee not to participate in any alliances and military alliances aimed at opposing any country that has sent troops to participate in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria. Austria shall also not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory, and shall not allow foreign military instructors and military experts to work in Austria. The second suggestion of the Soviet delegation stipulates that Article 33 of the draft Austrian State Treaty (i.e., the article on the withdrawal of occupying forces) should be amended. According to the Soviet suggestion, the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have the right to temporarily postpone the withdrawal of their respective occupying forces from Austria after the Austrian State Treaty comes into effect, until the German Peace Treaty is concluded. The troops can postpone their withdrawal from Austria, but shall not perform occupation tasks, shall not interfere in Austria's internal affairs, and shall not interfere in its social and political life.

Molotov then explained why the Soviet Union is making the above suggestions now, and not five years ago when the four foreign ministers' assistants discussed the Austrian State Treaty. Molotov said that this is because five years ago, there were not hundreds of American military bases on European soil as there are now. Another reason worthy of special attention is that there are currently plans to establish a "European Defense Community" aimed at restoring West German militarism. Molotov pointed out that the Soviet Union's proposals regarding Article 33 and Article 4b contain the Soviet government's minimum desire to guarantee European security, and these proposals are put forward in the hope of taking care of the legitimate demands of the Austrian people and the Austrian government for the swift conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty. Molotov said that the Soviet government suggests that after making the necessary revisions to the Austrian State Treaty this week, it should be signed immediately. The Soviet proposal for the immediate signing of the Austrian State Treaty means immediately ending the occupation of Austrian territory by foreign troops, and immediately transferring former German assets to Austria in accordance with the provisions of the Austrian State Treaty. Molotov pointed out that the Soviet proposal also stipulates that Austria will still be subject to certain restrictions for the time being, due to the need to temporarily leave a small number of foreign troops on Austrian territory. Molotov said that of course, it would be best if we could avoid doing this, but the above-mentioned special circumstances are necessary because the current situation makes the center of Europe unstable, and this situation cannot adequately guarantee European security due to the delay in the conclusion of the German Peace Treaty (which is not the fault of the Soviet Union). Molotov finally hoped that the suggestions made by the Soviet delegation would receive due attention and be discussed.

After Molotov's speech, he handed over the full text of the Soviet delegation's various suggestions to the foreign ministers of France, Britain, and the United States: a draft resolution on the Trieste issue, a draft clause supplementing Article 4b of the Austrian State Treaty, and draft amendments to Article 33 and Article 35f of the Austrian State Treaty.

The head of the Austrian government delegation, Figl, expressed his opinion, saying that the Austrian government agreed with the suggestion put forward by Dulles on the 14th. He also agreed with the Soviet amendment to Article 35 of the draft treaty. Regarding the suggestions made by the Soviet delegation regarding Article 4b and Article 33, Figl said that he could not express the Austrian government's attitude because his government had not authorized him to express an attitude.

Dulles then spoke. He said that he could not yet express his opinion on all the suggestions of the Soviet delegation, only some general opinions. He attempted to distort the clear and specific Soviet suggestions. He once again attempted to distort the facts and portray the Soviet suggestion, which was put forward to prevent a new German-Austrian merger, namely to postpone the withdrawal of the four countries' troops stationed in Austria until after the conclusion of the German Peace Treaty, as a continuation of the occupation of Austria. In fact, the Soviet suggestion means ending the occupation of Austria, because the suggestion stipulates that the four countries' troops temporarily stationed in Austria shall not perform occupation tasks and shall not interfere in Austria's social and political life. Dulles attempted to defend the presence of American troops on foreign territory, insisting that those countries themselves requested the United States to send troops. Dulles expressed his disagreement with the amendments proposed by the Soviet delegation to Articles 4 and 33 of the draft treaty.

Bidault, who spoke next, opposed the adoption of the Soviet suggestion. Eden spoke to distort the essence of the Soviet suggestion, insisting that the Soviet delegation did not want to sign the Austrian State Treaty. According to Eden, the Soviet suggestion was unacceptable to Austria.

Molotov then made supplementary remarks on some of the opinions raised at the meeting. He pointed out that there were inconsistencies between Figl and Eden in clarifying Austria's position.

Eden said that Austria could not accept the Soviet suggestion, but Figl did not say that. He said that the Austrian delegation only had certain, limited powers. He also said that the Austrian government was not yet aware of the suggestions made by the Soviet delegation on February 12th, so the Austrian delegation had no right to reply to these suggestions.

Molotov responded to the speeches of Dulles, Bidault, and Eden. Molotov proved that Dulles's claim that the Soviet suggestion to temporarily leave troops in Austria who would not perform occupation tasks was equivalent to a long-term occupation of Austria was groundless.

Molotov said that it is said that European countries welcome the establishment of American military bases on their territory. However, not everyone feels that the establishment of American military bases in France, Italy, or Iceland, for that matter, is welcome. Everyone knows that in order to obtain the right to establish American military bases, measures are often taken to exert economic, political, and other pressures.

Molotov further pointed out that the temporary stationing of the four countries' troops in Austria must be conditional on the exclusion of the existence of the occupation system. He said that if the Soviet suggestion on this issue is not clear enough, the Soviet delegation is prepared to accept other suggestions to improve its draft.

Molotov said that we suggest that we should reach an agreement here on terms that we can all accept, that do not violate the interests of any of the four countries, and that conform to the wishes of the Austrian people. Such an understanding will be in the interests of consolidating peace.

Molotov said that the Soviet delegation was particularly surprised by Eden's speech. Several claims made by Eden regarding the Soviet attitude are fundamentally untrue. Eden insisted that the Soviet delegation had put forward four conditions for agreeing to sign the Austrian State Treaty: reaching an agreement on the Trieste issue; concluding the German Peace Treaty; abandoning the plan to establish a "European Defense Community"; and abolishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation did not put forward these conditions. Some people also insisted that the Soviet delegation had advocated that our proposal for a pan-European treaty on guaranteeing European collective security required the abolition of the North Atlantic Treaty as a prerequisite. However, this is just a rumor. We did not say that.

Molotov talked about the conclusions the Soviet delegation drew from the discussion. He said that the Soviet delegation's suggestion is appropriate. This suggestion is based on the current international situation in Europe, and is based on the fact that the conclusion of the German Peace Treaty has been shelved, and therefore the danger of a German-Austrian merger has increased. Passing the Soviet suggestion is in the interests of Austria, and refusing to accept this suggestion only benefits certain foreign countries. By passing the Soviet suggestion, the Austrian State Treaty issue can be resolved, and we can sign it this week. Molotov hoped to end the discussion of the meeting in a constructive way, that is, to finally sign the Austrian State Treaty based on terms that are acceptable to all participants and with the consent of the Austrian government.

Before the end of the meeting, Molotov, in his capacity as chairman, moved that the Austrian State Treaty be discussed again at a future meeting. No one opposed this motion. Molotov announced that the morning and afternoon sessions of February 15th would be held at the Soviet High Commissioner's Office in Germany, and the meeting on the 16th would be held at the former Allied Control Council Building. Molotov also announced that an agreement had been reached that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting would end on February 18th.

    莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上发言
    再度阐述解决奥地利问题的原则
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林十五日讯：四国外长会议在十四日继续讨论第三项议程“关于对奥和约问题”，由莫洛托夫任主席。
    根据十三日会议的决定，这次会议首先研究第三项议程的讨论程序。杜勒斯发言提出一项建议，建议四国外长通过已经四国外长助理同意的对奥和约草案条文。杜勒斯并建议通过苏联在以前四国外长助理谈判中提出的关于某些条文的建议。杜勒斯并建议通过苏联提出的对第三十五条的修正，其中规定奥地利可以用商品来偿付应向苏联偿付的抵偿前德国资产的款项。杜勒斯对苏联建议中关于从速使奥地利恢复成为一个自由与独立国家的部分避而不谈，而建议采取措施使对奥和约在二月十八日签字。皮杜尔及艾登表示同意杜勒斯的建议。
    莫洛托夫发言指出，四国关于对奥和约上以前所存在的分歧，目前几乎已完全消除，但还未完全消除。苏联代表团注意到杜勒斯的建议，也注意到皮杜尔和艾登同意这项建议。莫洛托夫希望，在尚未取得一致意见的个别条款上能取得协议。苏联代表团认为，美国、英国和法国已撤回它们几年来一直坚持的反对苏联诸修正案的意见，这是具有积极意义的。这样就便于迅速缔结对奥和约，而无需再责成四国外长助理来研究对奥和约方面的分歧了。当然，如果苏联提出的建议得到考虑的话，我们可以同意：四国外长在这次会议上就可以在对奥和约本文上达成最后协议。
    莫洛托夫接着指出，杜勒斯忽略了一个过去和现在都对苏联具有重大意义的问题，即新的条约应当是真正能够实行的条约。我们过去和现在一直认为，对意和约中有关的里雅斯特的条款的执行情况是不正常的。在这个条约上签字的美国和英国没有执行上述条款所规定的义务。的里雅斯特仍然有着美英军事基地，这不仅公开破坏对意和约，而且违反欧洲和平的利益。我们认为，这次外长会议不能忽略这个问题。因此，我们建议就的里雅斯特问题通过下列决定：“苏联、美国、英国、法国四国外长会议建议安全理事会恢复讨论关于执行对意和约中有关的里雅斯特自由区部分的问题。”
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团提醒会议特别注意苏联代表团的两项建议。第一项建议是苏联代表团在十二日会议上提出的，这一建议是规定在对奥和约草案中列入补充的第四条乙款：奥地利应保证不参加任何旨在反对任何曾派遣军队参加对德战争和解放奥地利的战争的国家的联盟和军事同盟。奥地利也不得允许在其领土上建立外国军事基地，不得利用外国军事教官和军事专家在奥地利工作。苏联代表团的第二项建议规定要修改对奥和约草案第三十三条（即关于撤退占领军队的一条）。按照苏联的建议，美、英、法、苏四国政府在对奥和约生效后有权暂时延期撤退四国在奥地利的各自的占领区内的占领军队，直到对德和约缔结为止。军队可以延期自奥地利撤退，但不得执行占领任务，不得干涉奥地利的内政，不得干涉其社会与政治生活。
    莫洛托夫接着解释，为什么苏联在目前提出上述建议，而不在五年以前四国外长助理讨论对奥和约时提出这些建议。莫洛托夫说，这是因为五年以前，欧洲土地上不像现在一样有着上百个美国军事基地。另外一个值得特别注意的原因是：目前有人在计划建立一个旨在恢复西德军国主义的“欧洲防务集团”。莫洛托夫指出，苏联关于第三十三条和第四条乙款所提出的建议中包含着苏联政府对保障欧洲安全的最低限度的愿望，提出这些建议是希望照顾奥地利人民和奥地利政府对从速缔结对奥和约的正当要求的。莫洛托夫说，苏联政府建议在本周内就对奥和约作必要的修改后，立即签字。苏联关于立即签订对奥和约的建议意味着马上结束外国军队对奥地利领土的占领，意味着根据对奥和约的规定，立即将前德国资产移交给奥地利。莫洛托夫指出，苏联的建议同时规定，由于必须暂时留一少部分外国军队在奥地利领土上，奥地利暂时还要受到一些限制。莫洛托夫说道，当然，最好我们能不这样做，但是上述的特殊情况是必要的，因为目前的情况使欧洲中心不稳定，这种情况由于拖延缔结对德和约（这并非苏联的过错）就不能适当地保障欧洲的安全。莫洛托夫最后希望苏联代表团提出的建议会得到应有的注意并加以讨论。
    莫洛托夫发言后，将苏联代表团各项建议的全文交给法国、英国和美国外长：关于的里雅斯特问题的决议草案，补充入对奥和约第四条乙款条文草案，对奥和约第三十三条和第三十五条己款的修正条文草案。
    奥地利政府代表团团长费格尔发表意见说，奥地利政府同意杜勒斯在十四日提出的建议。他也同意苏联对和约草案第三十五条的修正。关于苏联代表团提出的关于第四条乙款及第三十三条的建议，费格尔说他不能表明奥地利政府的态度，因为他的政府没有授权他表示态度。
    杜勒斯接着发言。他说，他还不能对苏联代表团的全部建议表示意见，只表示一些一般的意见。他企图曲解明确而具体的苏联建议。他再次企图歪曲事实，把苏联为了防止新的德奥合并而提出的建议，即延至对德和约缔结以后再撤退四国驻奥地利军队的建议，说成是继续对奥地利的占领。其实，苏联的建议就意味着终止对奥地利的占领，因为建议规定暂时留驻奥地利的四国部队不得执行占领任务，并且不得干涉奥地利的社会与政治生活。杜勒斯企图为美国军队驻在外国领土上而辩护，硬说是那些国家自己要求美国派军队去的。杜勒斯表示不同意苏联代表团对和约草案第四条和第三十三条提出的修正。
    接着发言的皮杜尔反对通过苏联建议。艾登发言歪曲苏联建议的实质，硬说苏联代表团不想签订对奥和约。据艾登说，苏联的建议是奥地利所不能接受的。
    接着莫洛托夫就会上所提出的一些意见作了补充发言。他指出，费格尔和艾登在阐明奥地利的立场方面有不一致的地方。
    艾登说奥地利不能接受苏联的建议，但费格尔并没有这样说。他是说，奥地利代表团只有一定的、有限制的权力。他又说，苏联代表团在二月十二日提出的建议，奥地利政府尚未得悉，所以奥地利代表团无权对这些建议作答复。
    莫洛托夫回答了杜勒斯、皮杜尔和艾登的发言。莫洛托夫证明杜勒斯所谓苏联的暂时留下不执行占领任务的军队在奥地利境内的建议就等于长期占领奥地利的说法，是毫无根据的。
    莫洛托夫说，据说，欧洲国家欢迎在它们领土上建立美国军事基地。然而，并不是大家都觉得美国在法国、意大利、或者说在冰岛建立军事基地是很受欢迎的。大家知道，为了得到建立美国军事基地的权利，时常采取加以经济、政治和其他压力的措施。
    莫洛托夫进一步指出：四国军队的暂时留驻奥地利，必须要以排除占领制度存在为条件。他说：如果苏联关于这个问题的建议拟得不够明确的话，苏联代表团准备接受别的建议来改进它的草案。
    莫洛托夫说：我们建议应该在这里就我们都能够接受的、不违反四国中任何一国利益并且符合于奥地利人民愿望的条款达成协议。这种谅解将符合于巩固和平的利益。
    莫洛托夫说：苏联代表团尤其对艾登的发言感到惊奇。艾登所举出的关于苏联态度的几个提法是根本不符合事实的。艾登硬说苏联代表团提出了它同意签订对奥和约的四个条件：就的里雅斯特问题取得协议；缔结对德和约；放弃建立“欧洲防务集团”计划；取消北大西洋集团。莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团并没有提出这些条件。也有人硬说苏联代表团曾主张我们关于保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议要求以废除北大西洋公约作为先决条件。然而这只是造谣。我们并没有这样说过。
    莫洛托夫谈到苏联代表团从讨论中得出的结论。他说，苏联代表团的建议是适当的。这种建议是从当前欧洲国际局势出发，是从下列事实出发的，即对德和约的缔结被搁置起来了，因此德奥合并的危险增加了。通过苏联的建议是符合奥地利的利益的，而拒绝接受这个建议，只不过对某些外国有利而已。通过苏联的建议，就可以解决对奥和约问题，我们在本周就可以签字。莫洛托夫希望，以建设性的途径结束会议的讨论，也就是说最后根据与会者都能接受的条款，并取得奥地利政府的同意，签订对奥和约。
    在会议结束前，莫洛托夫以主席的身份动议，主张在以后某次会议上再讨论对奥和约。这个动议无人反对。莫洛托夫宣布二月十五日的上午会议和下午会议在苏联驻德高级专员公署举行，十六日的会议在前盟国管制委员会大厦举行。莫洛托夫又宣布：大家获得协议，四国外长会议在二月十八日结束。
