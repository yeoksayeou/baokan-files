Lhasa Wool Textile Factory
Uses Treadle Spinning Machines for Production
    The first small wool textile factory established by the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Lhasa is now using treadle spinning machines for production. The factory has 58 Tibetan and Han workers and 50 treadle spinning machines. Each worker's daily productivity is more than ten times that of local Tibetan people's hand-spinning, and the quality is also better. Tibet produces a large amount of wool, but there has never been a processing factory. Therefore, the establishment of this wool textile factory will gradually improve the quality of local woolen products. When this small factory was first established, it absorbed a group of Tibetan workers to participate in learning. Han workers from the mainland patiently taught them the operating techniques of treadle spinning machines. Some Tibetan workers learned to operate the spinning machines in three or four days, and their work efficiency has been increasing daily. Now, the daily production of the wool textile factory is three times higher than when it was first established two months ago.

    拉萨毛纺织厂
    使用脚踏纺线机生产
    中国人民解放军西藏军区在拉萨成立的第一座小型毛纺织厂，现已使用脚踏纺线机进行生产。这座工厂有五十八名藏、汉族工人，五十部脚踏纺线机，每个工人每天的生产率等于当地藏族人民手工捻线的十多倍，质量也比较好。西藏地区出产大量的羊毛，但是从来没有一个加工工厂，因此这座毛纺织厂的建立，将逐步改进当地毛织品的质量。当这座小型工厂刚建立时就吸收了一批藏族工人参加学习，由内地来的汉族工人耐心地把脚踏纺线机的操作技术教给他们，有些藏族工人在三、四天内就会操作纺线机，工作效率日益提高。现在毛纺织厂每天的生产量比两个月前刚成立时提高了三倍。
