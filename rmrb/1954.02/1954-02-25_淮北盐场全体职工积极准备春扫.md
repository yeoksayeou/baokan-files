The entire staff of the state-owned Huaibei Salt Field has made full preparations for this year's spring sweeping. This year, the state has assigned Huaibei Salt Field a production target that is 39% higher than last year's actual output. To strive to complete and overfulfill this task, the salt field leadership first drew on the successful experiences of past production and attached importance to the work of salt pan management. As soon as last year's autumn sweeping ended, the entire field immediately began the work of drawing in tidal water and managing the salt pans. At the same time, it also specifically convened a meeting of advanced producers to systematically exchange advanced experiences in pre-sweeping operations. In addition, a training class for 537 production cadres was held to strengthen grassroots leadership.

During the preparatory work before the sweeping, the entire field also carried out in-depth propaganda and education on the General Line, enabling the vast number of cadres and salt workers to further realize the importance of pre-production preparation for completing tasks. Many teams changed the lax phenomenon of winter idleness and devoted themselves to intense preparation work. Since the beginning of this year, despite the unfavorable conditions of bad weather and weak tides, thanks to the efforts of the broad masses of workers, by the end of January, the entire field had completed 108% of the first phase of the water pumping plan, of which Guanxi Field had completed all of its spring water pumping plan. Salt workers at Fangyang Institute in Tainan Field and Duixi Institute in Guandong Field even launched a labor emulation campaign for pre-sweeping operations such as water pumping and salt pan management. Salt workers at Yangtuo Institute in Qingkou Field completed a comprehensive operation plan before the Spring Festival. In order to produce more salt, they continued to work barefoot in the ditches in the cold weather. Under the slogan of ensuring "not a drop of water is missing and not a single salt pan is dry" when the spring sweeping fully starts, the salt workers not only filled each pond with concentrated brine, but also dug 2,727 earthen brine ponds, which were also filled with fresh brine before February 10th. At present, the water and brine sources of the Huaibei Salt Field are more abundant than in previous years, which has prepared good conditions for this year's production. (Liao Shoukang)

    淮北盐场全体职工积极准备春扫
    国营淮北盐场全体职工已为今年春扫做了充分的准备。今年国家交给淮北盐场的生产任务，比去年实际产量提高百分之三十九。盐场领导上为了争取完成和超额完成这一任务，首先吸取了历年来生产上的成功经验，重视了盘卤的工作。去年秋扫刚一结束，全场就立即开始了引积潮水和盘卤工作。与此同时，又专门召开了先进生产者会议，比较系统地交流了开扫前作业的先进经验。此外，还开办了五百三十七人的生产干部训练班，加强了基层领导力量。
    在开扫前的准备工作期间，全场又深入地展开了总路线的宣传教育，使广大的干部和盐工更加认识到了生产前准备工作对完成任务的重要性，很多小组均改变了冬闲的松懈现象，投入紧张的准备工作中。今年以来，虽然是处于气候不好、潮水不旺的不利情况，但由于广大职工们的努力，到一月底，全场已完成第一阶段打水计划百分之一百零八强，其中灌西场则已完成了全部春季打水计划。台南场方洋所和灌东场堆西所的盐工，更开展了开扫前打水盘卤等作业的劳动竞赛。青口场杨坨所盐工，在春节前就完成了全面的作业计划，他们为了能产更多的盐，又紧接着在大冷天赤着脚在水沟里继续工作。就这样在保证春扫全面开始时不缺“一滴水、不干一块晒格”的口号下，盐工们不仅把每个塘都盘满了成头卤，并且还挖了两千七百二十七个土卤塘子，这些土卤塘子也在二月十日前盘满了新卤。目前淮北盐场的水源、卤源都比往年充足，已为今年生产准备了良好条件。　（廖寿康）
