    Northeast Region to Vigorously Promote the Use of Cement Mixed with Additives
    The Northeast Financial and Economic Committee convened a "Conference on Promoting Advanced Experience in the Use of Multi-Variety and Multi-Grade Cement" in late January. The Northeast is the earliest and largest region in the production and use of multi-variety and multi-grade cement, and has achieved great results. In the past two years, the increased production of cement mixed with additives by state-owned cement plants in the Northeast is approximately equal to the output of three newly built cement plants, meeting the needs of capital construction. Some units have improved the quality of their projects and reduced project costs by using this type of cement. At Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in various capital construction projects, including the completed large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel pipe plant, and the thin plate rolling mill under construction, the correct use of multi-variety and multi-grade cement has not only yielded good technical results (concrete strength generally exceeds design requirements, some exceeding by 37%), but has also saved approximately 3 billion yuan in concrete costs. Last year, the Third Engineering Company of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau mainly constructed multi-story buildings. Shale cement and other cement mixed with additives accounted for 80% of the total cement used. The concrete projects not only did not experience corner chipping or peeling, but the strength generally exceeded design requirements by 20%.
    However, many units still have incorrect perceptions about cement mixed with additives, and many construction workers regard it as inferior cement and are unwilling to use it. They also lack experience in the technology, and last year, many concrete projects experienced quality accidents such as peeling, corner chipping, cracking, and sanding.
    The representatives of various units listened to the reports at the meeting and conducted discussions, which greatly improved their understanding of cement mixed with additives. The attending representatives also gained a more systematic understanding of the characteristics, usage scope, and construction precautions of various cements. Some construction workers said: "The problems that occurred in past projects were not caused by the new varieties of cement being bad, but by our blindly using them and not learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and adopting appropriate operating methods." Representatives from various regions expressed their determination to implement the spirit of the conference in their practical work. (Chen Changxiong)

    东北区将大力推广使用掺混合材料水泥
    东北财经委员会在一月下旬召开了“使用多品种多标号水泥先进经验推广大会”。东北是生产与使用多品种多标号水泥最早最多的地区，已取得了很大成绩。过去两年，东北国营水泥厂生产掺混合材料水泥所增产的水泥数量，约等于新建三个水泥厂的产量，满足了基本建设的需要。有些单位使用这种水泥，工程质量有了提高，并降低了工程成本。鞍山钢铁公司在各项基本建设工程上，包括已建成的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和正在建设的薄板轧制厂等工程，由于正确地使用了多品种多标号水泥，不但收到了良好的技术效果（混凝土强度普遍超过设计要求，有的超过百分之三十七），还节约混凝土成本约三十亿元。沈阳市建筑工程局第三工程公司去年承建的工程多是楼房，所用水泥中页岩水泥和其它掺混合材料水泥占全部水泥量的百分之八十，混凝土工程不但没有发生脱角脱皮等现象，而且强度一般都超过设计要求百分之二十。
    但是很多单位对掺混合材料水泥还存在着错误的看法，不少施工人员把掺混合材料的水泥看作是劣等水泥，不愿使用。在技术上也缺少经验，去年有不少混凝土工程发生了脱皮、掉角、裂缝和起砂等质量事故。
    各单位的代表在会上听了报告，并进行了讨论，大大提高了对掺混合材料水泥的认识。到会代表对各种水泥的特性、使用范围及施工注意事项也有了比较系统的认识。有的施工人员说：“过去工程中所发生的问题，原来并不是新品种水泥不好，而是我们盲目使用，没有学习苏联的先进经验，采取适当的操作方法所造成的。”各地代表纷纷表示要把大会精神贯彻到实际工作中去。（陈长熊）
