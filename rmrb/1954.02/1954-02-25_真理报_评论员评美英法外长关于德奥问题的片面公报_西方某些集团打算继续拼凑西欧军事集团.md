Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 22nd: The "People's Daily" published an article by its commentator, titled "Striving for International Cooperation, Opposing Divisive Policies," commenting on the one-sided communiqué issued by the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers on February 19th after the Berlin Conference regarding the German and Austrian question.

The commentator wrote: The results of the recent Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference have become the focus of attention in current international public opinion. Those forces that oppose improving international relations did not achieve the results they expected. They had openly boasted that they would sabotage the Berlin Conference, thereby creating conditions for the ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties. The Berlin Conference has shown, more clearly than ever, that it is now possible and necessary to take immediate measures to ease international tensions. The issues that were not resolved at the Berlin Conference have not been removed from the agenda. Peace-loving forces in Europe and around the world will continue to work even more resolutely to resolve these issues.

The commentator pointed out that this factor is precisely what European newspapers are emphasizing today. This reaction of European public opinion has caused panic among American aggressive groups. They are doing everything possible to weaken the impression that the Berlin Conference has made on broad sections of people around the world. In this regard, we cannot but pay attention to the lengthy communiqué issued by the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers on the morning of the closing day of the Berlin Conference. This one-sided communiqué made no mention whatsoever of the resolutions adopted by the Berlin Conference, attempting to create the impression that, in general, the Berlin Conference made no decisions at all. The document only discusses two issues: the German question and the Austrian question, and attempts to portray the failure to reach agreement on these issues as not the responsibility of the Western representatives.

The final part of the communiqué explains for itself the purpose of their distorting the truth. The drafters of the communiqué make no secret of their concern that the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation "would undermine" the military system that the Western countries are striving to establish. Therefore, it is quite clear that the drafters of this one-sided communiqué intend to continue pursuing a policy of assembling a military bloc of six West European countries in opposition to other European countries.

The commentator pointed out that the one-sided communiqué of the three Western countries can only be regarded as an expression of the intention of certain Western groups to continue pursuing a policy of undermining international cooperation. However, the people of all countries, regardless of the social system to which they belong, hope that the international situation will develop in a completely different direction. They hope that the major powers will work together to safeguard peace and security. They believe that the Berlin Conference has taken an important step in this direction.

The commentator concluded by writing: Time will tell whether the governments of the Western countries will continue to follow this path, or continue to pursue their old policies, namely, the policy of dividing the world and using a group of several countries to oppose other countries.

    “真理报”评论员评美英法外长关于德奥问题的片面公报
    西方某些集团打算继续拼凑西欧军事集团
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十二日讯：“真理报”刊载了该报评论员一篇题为“争取国际合作，反对分裂政策”的文章，评论美英法三国外长二月十九日在柏林会议结束后就德奥问题发表的片面公报。
    评论员写道：最近柏林四国外长会议的结果成为目前国际舆论注意的中心。那些反对改善国际关系的势力没有达到他们所预期的结果，他们曾公开地大吹大擂要破坏柏林会议，从而为批准波恩和巴黎条约创造条件。柏林会议再明显不过地表明，现在已经是能够而且应当刻不容缓地采取措施以缓和国际紧张局势的时候了。柏林会议上没有解决的问题并没有从日程上除掉。欧洲和全世界的爱好和平的力量将继续更加坚决地为解决这些问题而努力。
    评论员指出，这一因素正是欧洲报纸今天所强调的。欧洲舆论的这种反应在美国侵略集团中间引起了惊慌。他们竭尽全力来减弱柏林会议对全世界广大阶层人民产生的印象。在这方面，我们不能不注意美、英、法外长在柏林会议闭幕的那一天早上所发表的长篇公报。这个片面的公报丝毫没有提到柏林会议所通过的决议，试图造成一种印象，仿佛一般说来，柏林会议并没有作出什么决定似的。这个文件只谈到两个问题：德国问题和奥地利问题，而且试图把事情说成是：在这些问题上未能达成协议，不能由西方代表负责。
    公报的最后部分自己说明了他们歪曲真相的目的在那里。公报的起草人毫不掩饰地表示担心：苏联代表团提出的建议“会破坏”西方国家努力要建立的军事体系。因此，十分明显，这个片面公报的起草人打算继续奉行拼凑西欧六国的军事集团，以反对欧洲其他国家的政策。
    评论员指出，西方三国的片面公报，只能被认为是表示西方某些集团打算继续奉行破坏国际合作的政策。但是，各国人民，无论是属于那个社会制度的，都希望国际形势朝着完全另外一个方向发展。他们希望大国共同努力来保障和平与安全。他们认为柏林会议在这方面走了重要的一步。
    评论员最后写道：时间将表明，西方国家的政府是继续沿着这条道路走呢？还是继续奉行它们的老一套的政策，即分裂世界、以一个若干国家组成的集团去反对别的国家的政策呢？
