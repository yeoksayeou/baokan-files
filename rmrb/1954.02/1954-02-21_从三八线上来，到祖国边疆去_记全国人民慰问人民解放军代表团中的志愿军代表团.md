From the perpetually snow-capped Changbai Mountains to the evergreen shores of the South China Sea, from the roof of the world, the Pamir Plateau, to the undulating waves of the Pacific coast, across our vast homeland, as 500 million people are celebrating a peaceful and happy Spring Festival, we cannot help but think of those who have protected and continue to protect our peaceful and happy lives. Thus, shortly after the Third Chinese People’s Delegation to Korea returned, the National People’s Delegation to Comfort the People’s Liberation Army set off again. In this unprecedentedly large delegation, there were also representatives from the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army from the 38th Parallel in Korea.

The heroes who vigilantly guard the northern edge of the military demarcation line in Korea clearly know, as they celebrate this year's Spring Festival with the hearts of victors, that in the past, it was because the motherland gave them all their strength that they were finally able to defeat the cunning enemy with superior equipment, together with the Korean People's Army. However, it was also because of the People's Liberation Army comrades who guarded the coasts and borders of the motherland day and night, that the imperialists did not dare to offend, and the motherland was able to be safe and prosperous. They deeply know that their great victory in Korea cannot be separated from the heroic PLA defending the motherland.

On every heroic front line, in every branch of service, and on the steel transportation lines, the soldiers were still talking about how, during the war, the PLA elder brothers’ great spirit of heroic fighting and self-sacrifice over the past twenty years directly inspired them to achieve victory in battle. The PLA comrades who have guarded the coasts and borders of the motherland year after year, their spirit of high loyalty to the motherland, has inspired them to advance bravely in the past, and inspires them now to monitor the enemy. The spirit of hard struggle of the PLA comrades on the Kangzang Plateau and the southwestern border also inspired the infantry to build tunnels, and inspired the engineers to build roads and open mountains....

In order to thank the PLA elder brothers for their strength, and to learn from their noble qualities and advanced experience, the units on all fronts in Korea and the various branches of service on the east and west coasts selected their most outstanding representatives to return home to participate in the comfort activities. The heroic unit in the Shangganling battle selected Yi Caixue, the commander who commanded the battle, and combat hero, to participate. The unit that participated in the Jincheng counterattack selected Zhang Furong, the flag bearer who planted the red flag on the Jiaoyan Mountain. The artillerymen selected Liu Si, the anti-aircraft gunner who shot down and damaged 28 enemy planes. The armored unit selected Yang Aru, the tank commander of Tank No. 215, who continuously destroyed enemy positions. The railway unit selected Zhao Hongjun, the meritorious worker who rushed to repair the lines under frozen conditions. The engineers selected Zhang Chuanxin, the model worker who opened mountains, built roads, built bridges and repaired tunnels. The transportation unit selected Lu Yaowen, the driver who saved a huge amount of gasoline. The field hospital department also selected Zhao Huijuan, Zhu Yong and other meritorious workers.... These comfort representatives excitedly talked about the glory and joy they felt in being able to personally comfort the elder brothers, report to them, and learn from them, and talked about the thousands of words of entrustment from their comrades and leaders when they left Korea. Cai Xinghai, a second-class combat hero who participated in the Shangganling battle, said: "When I left, my comrades sent me a long way, and repeatedly urged me, first, never forget: when you see the elder brothers, tell them that we all send our warm greetings to them, thank them for defending the motherland, so that the motherland fully supported us and enabled us to achieve victory. Second, we must bring back their spirit of hard struggle and loyalty to the motherland, and their experience in building a modern and regular national defense force. Third, tell the elder brothers that we are a hundred times more vigilant, and if the enemy dares to invade, we will eliminate him on the front lines. Please don't worry, elder brothers. Also, how much encouragement the general line for the transition period has given us! We have all bought construction bonds...." It should also be mentioned that Liu Shaoyin, a first-class meritorious worker, carefully took out a set of color postcards given to him by the delegation to comfort the troops in Korea from his bag, and Zhao Huijuan, a female meritorious worker, also brought a corner of a captured American nylon flak vest, ready to give it to the respected PLA elder brothers stationed on the border. They originally kept these things as the most memorable items.

"What other gifts should we offer to the PLA elder brothers?"

The various fronts and units in Korea selected their own created war-time song and dance to participate in the comfort activities. These songs and dances include "One Thousand and Eight," which reflects the battle of Shangganling, "Red Flag Planted on 'Old Baldy Mountain'," which reflects the battle of "Old Baldy Mountain," "Before the Expedition," "A Bottle of Wine," and "Glorious Canteen," which reflect combat life. There are songs praising heroes such as "Mei Huaiqing" and "Ban Xincheng." What is particularly noteworthy is that the warrior performance team performed more than 100 programs, such as "Flower Tea Cup," performed in the form of Hunan flower drum opera by five Hunan soldiers. These programs with rich national characteristics reflect the rich combat life of the Volunteer Army in many ways, giving people an optimistic, heroic, and tremendous infectious power.

They also brought the national songs and dances of our close brother country, Korea, including elegant and refreshing Korean classical dances, "Silla Warriors," which reflects Korean patriotic men of insight, and the famous Korean folk songs "Spring Plowing Ballad" and "Along the Nakdong River."

More than 600 Volunteer Army comfort personnel from various fronts and branches of service in Korea, carrying the infinite thoughts of the entire Volunteer Army, have followed the National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army to the coastal defense and border areas for comfort activities. For four years, the heroic People's Liberation Army comrades who have diligently stationed on the border and defended the security of the motherland! The people of the whole country and our great leader Chairman Mao are thinking of you. The fraternal units in Korea are thinking of you. Salutations to you! Our country's endless mineral treasures need to be explored and mined, and boundless barren mountains and fertile soil need to be developed and sown. Farmers need to use tractors to cultivate the land, workers need to manufacture more machines and daily necessities, fishermen need to fish quietly along the coast and in inland rivers, and herdsmen need to breed cattle and sheep on the vast grasslands. The children of the motherland need to go to school to study, and mothers need to raise their beloved children. However, all this can only be achieved under conditions without gunfire and artillery fire. The coast and border of the motherland need our heroic army to defend them more vigilantly. Yang Yucai, a first-class combat hero from the Jincheng front, excitedly said after listening to the report of General Đoàn trưởng Đổng Bì Wǔ, "Let the PLA elder brothers guard the territorial waters, airspace and borders of the motherland, and we will closely monitor the enemy in Korea, so that our motherland can advance toward the bright road of socialism under the light of the general line."

    从三八线上来，到祖国边疆去
    ——记全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团中的志愿军代表团
    连云山
    从终年积雪的长白山，到四季长春的南海边，从世界屋脊帕米尔高原，到碧浪起伏的太平洋畔，在我们祖国这样辽阔广大的土地上，当五万万人民正在欢度和平幸福的春节时，饮水思源，不能不想起保卫了和在继续保卫着自己和平幸福生活的人们。于是，中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团回来不久，全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团又出发了。在这个规模空前的代表团里，也有来自朝鲜三八线上的中国人民志愿军的代表们。
    警惕地守卫在朝鲜军事分界线北缘各部战线的英雄们，当他们怀着胜利者的心情，欢度今年这个春节的时候，他们清楚地知道：在过去，因为祖国给了他们一切力量，使他们终于和朝鲜人民军一起，战胜了优势装备的狡猾的敌人，但是，也正是因为有解放军战友们日日夜夜地守卫着祖国的沿海和边疆，使帝国主义者不敢来冒犯，祖国才能够安全和繁荣。他们深深知道，自己在朝鲜所取得的伟大胜利，是和英雄的解放军捍卫祖国不能分开的。
    在各个英雄阵地上，在各兵种和钢铁运输线上，战士们还谈论着：战争时期，解放军老大哥二十年来英勇战斗，自我牺牲的伟大精神，成了直接鼓舞自己取得战斗胜利的力量，经年累月地守卫在祖国沿海和边疆的解放军战友们，他们那种高度忠于祖国的精神，在过去鼓舞着自己奋勇前进，在现在鼓舞着自己监视敌人；在康藏高原，在西南边防的解放军战友们他们的艰苦奋斗的精神，也曾经鼓舞着步兵们修筑坑道，鼓舞了工兵们筑路开山……。
    为了感谢解放军老大哥给他们的力量，并学习他们的高贵品质和先进经验，朝鲜各部战线，东西海岸的各兵种部队选派了自己最优秀的代表，回国来参加慰问。上甘岭作战中的英雄部队选派了指挥这次战斗的指挥员和战斗英雄易才学，参加金城反击战的部队选派了把红旗插上轿岩山的旗手张福荣，炮兵们选派了击落击伤敌机二十八架的高射炮手刘四，装甲部队选派了连续摧毁敌阵的二一五号坦克车长杨阿如，铁道部队选派了在地冻冰封的条件下抢修线路的功臣赵鸿钧，工兵选派了开山筑路架桥修洞的模范张传新，运输部队选派了节省巨量汽油的司机卢耀文，野战医院部门也选派了功臣赵惠娟、朱勇等人……。这些慰问代表们兴奋地谈论着自己能亲自去慰问老大哥，向他们汇报，向他们学习所感到的光荣和喜悦，谈论着离开朝鲜时战友和首长们千言万语的嘱托。参加上甘岭作战的二级战斗英雄蔡兴海说：“我临走时，战友们把我送了很远，还三番五次地叮嘱我，第一，一定不要忘记：见了老大哥们，说我们全体亲切的问他们好，感谢他们捍卫了祖国，使祖国全力支援了我们，使我们取得了胜利。第二，就是要把他们艰苦奋斗，忠于祖国的精神和建设现代化正规化国防军的经验带回来。第三，要告诉老大哥们，我们百倍地警惕着，假如敌人胆敢进犯，就把他消灭在前沿阵地上，请老大哥不要惦念。还有，国家在过渡时期的总路线给我们多大鼓舞啊！我们都买了建设公债……。”还应该提到：一等功臣刘少银从包包里小心地拿出一套赴朝慰问团送他的彩色明信片，女功臣赵惠娟也带着一角缴获的美军尼龙避弹衣，准备送给驻守边防的敬爱的解放军老大哥们。这些东西，他们原是作为最有纪念意义的东西保存起来的。
    “我们还应该献给解放军老大哥什么礼物呢？”
    朝鲜各战线各部队选拔了自己创作的战地歌舞参加慰问。这些歌舞，有反映上甘岭战斗的“一千八”，有反映“老秃山”战斗的“红旗插上‘老秃山’”，有反映战斗生活的“出征之前”“一瓶酒”和“光荣食堂”。有歌唱英雄的“梅怀清”和“班新成”，特别引人注意的是战士演出队里由五个湖南籍战士用湖南花鼓戏形式演出的“花茶缸”等一百多个节目，这些富有民族色彩的节目，都多方面地反映了志愿军丰富的战斗生活，给人以乐观、豪迈的巨大的感染力量。
    他们还带着我们亲密的兄弟国家——朝鲜的民族歌舞，有优雅清爽的朝鲜古典舞，有反映朝鲜爱国志士的“新罗勇士”，还有著名的朝鲜民歌“春耕谣”和“洛东江边”等。
    来自朝鲜各战线，各兵种的六百多名志愿军慰问人员载负着全体志愿军的无限心意，已经随着全国人民慰问解放军代表团分赴海防和边疆慰问去了。四年来，辛勤地驻守边防、捍卫了祖国安全的英雄的人民解放军同志们！全国人民和我们伟大领袖毛主席怀念着你们。朝鲜的兄弟部队怀念着你们。向你们致敬！我们祖国无尽的矿山宝藏要勘探要开采，无边的荒山沃土要开发要播种。农民要用拖拉机种地，工人要制造更多的机器和日用品，渔民要在沿海和内河安静地捕鱼，牧民要在辽阔的草原上繁殖牛羊。祖国的孩子们要上学去念书，母亲们要抚育爱儿。但是，这一切：必须在没有枪声炮声的条件下才能实现。祖国的沿海和边疆需要我们英雄的军队更警惕地捍卫她。来自金城前线的志愿军一级战斗英雄杨育才，听了董必武总团长的报告后兴奋地说，“让解放军老大哥们守住祖国的领海领空和边疆，我们在朝鲜严密地监视着敌人，好让我们的祖国在总路线光芒的照耀下，向社会主义的光明大道前进。”
