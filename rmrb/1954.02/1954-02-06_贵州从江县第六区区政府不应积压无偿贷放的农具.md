Reader's Letters Abstract:

    The Sixth District Government of Congjiang County, Guizhou Province, Should Not Hold Up Uncompensated Loans of Farm Tools
    Lu Zhaohua from the Sixth District Government of Congjiang County, Guizhou Province, writes: In order to support the Miao, Dong, and other ethnic minority farmers in our county who lack farm tools, and to change the backward production situation of "slash-and-burn" cultivation, the higher-level People's Government allocated over 330 million yuan in uncompensated agricultural tool loans to our county in early April last year. After the county uniformly purchased farm tools, it distributed a total of more than 1,200 pieces of plows, harrows, sickles, hoes, axes, etc., to the Sixth District, and specified that they should all be distributed to the farmers by the beginning of June 1953 at the latest. However, until now, about 700 pieces of the uncompensated farm tools that many farmers have been waiting for day and night are still locked in the Sixth District Government. Some farm tools are left in the courtyard, exposed to the sun and rain, and no one cares about them. I believe that the Party and the People's Government are distributing uncompensated farm tools to help fraternal ethnic groups with production, which is a work of great significance. The leading comrades and relevant personnel of the Sixth District Government do not care about the interests of fraternal ethnic groups and have not distributed all the farm tools to the farmers in a timely manner, which is very wrong. The Congjiang County People's Government is also wrong for only making arrangements for this work and not checking on it. They should conduct a review and quickly distribute this batch of stockpiled uncompensated farm tools to the minority ethnic farmers.

专栏：读者来信摘要

    贵州从江县第六区区政府不应积压无偿贷放的农具
    贵州省从江县第六区区政府卢兆华来信：为了扶持我县苗、侗等族少数民族农民缺乏农具的困难，改变落后的“刀耕火种”的生产状况，去年四月初上级人民政府分配我县无偿农具贷款三亿三千余万元。县里统一购成农具后，分配给第六区犁、耙、镰刀、锄、斧子等共一千二百余件，并指定至迟在一九五三年六月初全部发到农民手里。但是直到现在，许多农民朝夕等待着的无偿农具，还有七百件左右被锁在第六区区政府里。有些农具丢在院子里，任凭日晒雨淋，也无人过问。我认为：党和人民政府发放无偿农具帮助兄弟民族生产，这是一件有重大意义的工作。第六区区政府领导同志和有关人员不关心兄弟民族的利益，没有及时地把全部农具发放给农民，这是十分错误的。从江县人民政府对这个工作只布置，不检查，也是不对的。他们应该进行检讨，并迅速把这批积压着的无偿农具发给少数民族农民。
