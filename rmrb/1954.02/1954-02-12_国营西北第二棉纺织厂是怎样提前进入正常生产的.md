Like other newly built modern factories, the transition process of the State-Owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory (hereinafter referred to as the State Cotton No. 2 Factory) from capital construction to production is a complex one. The original work (capital construction) has not yet ended, but the new work (production) is about to begin. In the process of transferring these two tasks, a series of measures must be taken urgently and in a planned manner, relying on the enthusiasm of the workers, grasping and solving key problems, and quickly seeking coordination and synchronization of various tasks to avoid unnecessary confusion or prolong the state of confusion, and strive to start all operations ahead of schedule and transition into normal production. It was precisely because of this approach that the State Cotton No. 2 Factory achieved this goal. The factory started all its machines forty-two days ahead of schedule, increasing production and saving 41,237 bolts of cotton cloth for the country.

The State Cotton No. 2 Factory is one of the largest modern textile factories in the Northwest. It has a total of 50,800 spindles and 2,016 looms, and the cloth produced annually can make 13 million new suits of clothes. The factory started construction in July 1952 and began installation in July 1953. By late September of the same year, the construction project had been 91.45% completed, and the machine installation project had been 96.46% completed. From mid-August to late September, one-third of the machines (20,000 spindles, 684 looms) had been put into production. During this period, construction, installation, and production were carried out simultaneously, with many loose ends; moreover, the production organization was not yet complete, most of the systems had not been established, and there was no overall plan. Therefore, in the initial stage of the transition to production, the state of confusion was quite serious. At that time, the national campaign to increase production and practice economy had already begun, but some leading cadres of the State Cotton No. 2 Factory believed that the factory had not yet officially started production and could only save money and could not increase production. They did not realize that starting all machines ahead of schedule was the biggest increase in production and savings, so they lacked concrete measures to strive for starting all machines ahead of schedule. They only set a general goal of starting all the looms by December 20, and the plans for training new workers and machine maintenance were also very unsound and quite conservative. If these situations were not changed quickly, it would inevitably prolong the state of confusion in production, delay the start-up time, and cause losses to the country. To this end, starting from the end of September, the Party and government leadership of the factory, with the assistance of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC's Increase Production and Practice Economy Work Group, concentrated more than 40 cadres, unified arrangements, and repeatedly studied the following specific steps and measures to start all machines ahead of schedule and transition into normal production:

First, improve the training methods for new workers and improve their ability to manage machines, in order to prepare the basic conditions for full operation. All the shift workers in the factory were new workers, and most of them came from rural areas. Among them, 40% of the workers had just entered the factory in August and began to learn basic movements; the other 60%, although they had been trained for three to five months and had participated in production or started managing machines, were not skilled enough. The average machine management capacity of weaving workers was only 8.2 machines, and the average spindle management capacity of fine yarn workers was only 265 spindles. The factory determined that if the average machine management capacity of weaving workers was increased to 11.5 machines and the spindle management capacity of fine yarn workers was increased to 360 spindles, all machines could be started by early November. However, if trained by general methods, it would be difficult to meet the above requirements. Therefore, the following three methods were adopted: 1. The original two-shift system was changed to a three-shift system, so that the number of machines and spindles managed by each person increased by one-third, and four hours per shift could be used for technical lessons, learning and doing at the same time; 2. The "little teacher" assistance system, in which new workers with good academic performance in the first and second phases assisted in teaching the new workers in the third phase, solved the difficulty of the lack of teachers at that time; 3. Cooperate with teaching, conduct examinations and commendations to improve the learning enthusiasm of new workers. In this way, by the end of October, the average machine management capacity of weaving workers reached 12 machines, and the spindle management capacity of fine yarn workers reached 400 spindles, both exceeding the original plan.

Second, rely on the strength of the masses, accelerate the progress of maintenance, and start all machines ahead of schedule. The original plan stipulated that two fine yarn machines should be repaired every day, which would take more than a month to complete all repairs. Later, the leadership decided to repair 15 fine yarn machines in two days. After discussion by the workers, rationalization proposals were put forward to accelerate the maintenance, and the two mixed maintenance teams were changed to specialized teams with division of labor, and a maintenance competition was launched. The workers gave full play to their labor enthusiasm and creativity, and repaired six machines on the first day and nine machines on the second day, and they were in good working order. The leadership used this fact to educate everyone, revised the entire maintenance plan, accelerated the maintenance progress, completed the maintenance by the end of October, and ensured the quality.

Secondly, the original plan was to set the full start-up time to December 20, which was already relatively conservative, but the cloth workshop engineer still believed that this was "cutting the feet to fit the shoes" and was "wishful thinking." He believed that the preparation workshop was backward and could not supply enough. In fact, he underestimated the progress of the preparation workshop and did not understand the situation clearly. He said: the speed of warping was only 2,000 yards per hour (actually it had reached 2,600 yards), the speed of drawing-in was only three or more per loom in ten hours (actually it had reached four and a half), and each worker could only warp forty beams (actually it had reached seven or eighty, and the highest had reached one hundred and forty). The leadership used factual materials to show that the progress of the preparation workshop could be supplied, and persuaded the technical personnel. After several studies, the date of full start-up was finally changed to November 10. In fact, all the machines were started by November 8, 42 days ahead of the original plan.

Third, mobilize workers to discuss production plans, identify key issues, and quickly improve quality. When the plan was first made in early October, because all the workers were new workers, most of them did not know the meaning of making plans, how to make them, and how to guarantee them. Some even did not know what a plan was. The leadership gave popular explanations and mobilized everyone to discuss, and then adopted the method of typical demonstration, through the production team leaders, to help the more advanced workers make plans as examples for everyone to follow. However, it was later discovered that the plans were all the same and did not pay attention to quality. Therefore, the workshop was first helped to identify the main problems, study the causes and solutions, and then make plans for demonstration. For example, when summarizing the fine yarn production in October, it was found that the quality was not good, and an average of 103 "feather yarns" were removed from each yard of warping, and a total of 1,149 kilograms of bad yarn were returned for the whole month. The reason was that the cleaning work and work methods were not done well. In view of the above shortcomings, when making the November plan, the slogan "Do three cleans (clean the machine surface, clean the drafting, clean the belly of the machine), reduce ends down, eliminate five harms (feather yarn, slub yarn, loose yarn, tight yarn, poorly formed yarn), and improve quality" was put forward, and measures to improve work methods were proposed. Everyone made personal plans according to their own specific situation and launched a red flag competition. In this way, the feather yarn in November was indeed reduced to about 60, and the bad yarn was reduced to 798 kilograms. This fact broke the conservative view of some people that the new factory had a poor foundation, new workers had low skills, and there was no experience in everything, making it difficult to make plans.

Fourth, promote the workshop operation plan and gradually move towards balanced production. Before November, although the masses were mobilized to discuss and formulate production plans, the operation plans of the various workshops were not integrated and balanced, resulting in supply imbalance and disconnection. If there was too much roving, it would be accumulated; if there was too little, the fine yarn would stop. The phenomenon of cloth workshop stopping for material was also quite serious. Some leading cadres in the factory also had a conservative idea at the beginning, believing that the new factory was busy and chaotic, with many loose ends and a poor foundation, so the operation plan could not be implemented. From November onwards, the workshops were helped to calculate detailed accounts one by one, and operation plans were tried out, and a factory-wide calendar schedule was made. Although the results were not great, some experience was gained. In December, the factory director took the lead and transferred a few people to specialize in helping the weaker departments to prepare operation plans. First of all, the reasons for the failure to complete the output and quality plan of the cloth workshop in November, especially the quality, and the second-class cloth reached 20% to 25%, were checked. The workshop director, however, blamed it on "the unevenness of the yarn in the yarn workshop." After inspection, it was found that the cloth workshop had not studied the quality problem, and it was also found that four-fifths of the second-class cloth was the responsibility of the cloth workshop. Therefore, these two facts were used to educate and persuade the workshop cadres to make a calendar schedule including quality for December. At the same time, the four workshops of carding, preparation, fine yarn, and opening were mobilized to formulate the operation plan of the workshop according to the plan of the cloth workshop, and a weekly inspection system was established, so that each workshop basically achieved daily balanced production. By December 20, the second-class cloth of the two kinds of cotton cloth had dropped to 7%, a decrease of more than two-thirds compared with November. This fact shows that in the initial stage of the transition to production in a new factory, as long as the leadership pays attention to it, breaks the conservative view, deeply discovers problems, grasps the key, and educates cadres, it is possible and necessary to implement the operation plan as early as possible.

Fifth, establish necessary systems in the preliminary stage, first of all the responsibility system. After the transition from capital construction to production, the focus shifted and the organization changed. Therefore, it is necessary to establish some necessary systems in a timely manner, especially the responsibility system. The administrative responsibility system (workshop, section, office, production team leader, etc.) has been initially established. The worker handover system has been discussed and established by the workers, and good results have been received, eliminating the phenomena of confusion, disconnection, and irresponsibility at the beginning. For example, Li Cong, a worker in the Jia shift of the fine yarn workshop, used to produce about three kilograms of white flowers every day, but after the establishment of the handover system, it has dropped to about ten ounces.

The process of the State Cotton No. 2 Factory's transition from capital construction to production is also a process of continuously educating cadres and educating workers. With the assistance of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Work Group, a series of ideological work was first carried out on the responsible cadres of various departments, and then on the workers of the entire factory. In addition to the political education courses in the new worker training and the daily education in the factory, in the increase production and practice economy campaign, especially in combination with the formulation of production plans, several factory-wide reports and studies on the significance of increase production and practice economy, labor discipline, patriotism, and the general line of the country in the transition period were conducted, greatly improving the political consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the workers in the entire factory. The workers realized the bright future of socialism and their glorious tasks in industrial construction, which played an encouraging role in the implementation of the aforementioned five specific measures, thus ensuring that the factory started all operations ahead of schedule and transitioned into normal production.

    国营西北第二棉纺织厂是怎样提前进入正常生产的
    陶信镛　樊养学　张定照
    和其他新建的近代化工厂一样，国营西北第二棉纺织厂（以下简称国棉二厂）从基本建设转入生产的过程，是一个错综复杂的过程。原有的工作（基本建设）尚未结束，新的工作（生产）却要开始。在这两项工作转移过程中，必须紧张而有计划地采取一系列的措施，依靠职工群众的积极性，抓住和解决关键问题，迅速求得各项工作的协同一致、合拍进行，避免不必要的混乱状态或延长混乱状态，争取提前全部开工并转入正常生产。国棉二厂正是由于这样作而达到了这个目的。该厂已提前四十二天开齐全部机器，为国家增产节约了棉布四万一千二百三十七匹。
    国棉二厂是西北现有最大的现代化纺织厂之一。共有五万零八百枚纱锭，二千零一十六台布机，每年所生产的布匹，可作一千三百万套新衣服。该厂于一九五二年七月施工，一九五三年七月开始安装，同年九月下旬，建筑工程已完成百分之九十一点四五，机器安装工程已完成百分之九十六点四六。从八月中旬起到九月下旬，已有三分之一机台（两万纱锭，六百八十四台布机）转入生产。这一时期，建筑、安装和生产三项工作交叉进行，头绪多端；而且生产机构尚不完备，各种制度大部尚未建立，没有全盘计划。因此，转入生产的初期，混乱状态是相当严重的。当时，全国增产节约运动已开始，但国棉二厂某些领导干部认为该厂尚未正式生产，只能节约，没法增产，没有认识到提前全部开车就是最大的增产节约，因此对于争取提前全部开车，也缺乏具体措施。他们只确定了十二月二十日开齐布机的笼统目标，新工人的训练和机器检修等计划也很不健全并且相当保守。如果不迅速改变这些情况，就势必延长生产的混乱状态和延缓开工时间，给国家造成损失。为此，从九月底起，该厂党政领导方面便在中共中央西北局增产节约工作组协助下，集中四十余干部，统一安排，反复研究，为了提前开齐全部机器、转入正常生产，采取了以下几方面的具体步骤和措施：
    第一，改进对新工人训练方法，提高看台能力，为全部开工准备好基本条件。该厂值车工全部是新工人，且大部来自农村。其中百分之四十的工人八月才进厂，开始学习基本动作；另外百分之六十虽已训练了三至五个月，已参加生产或开始值车，但技术不够熟练。机织工人看台能力平均只达八点二台，细纱工人看锭能力平均只达二百六十五锭。该厂研究确定，将机织工人看台能力平均提高到十一台半，将细纱工人看锭能力提高到三百六十锭，则十一月初即可开齐全部机器。但如果照一般方法训练，就难达到上述要求，因此，采用了下面三个办法：一、将原来的两班制改为三班制，使每人看台、看锭数增加三分之一，每班可抽四小时上技术课，边学边做；二、“小先生”辅助制，由第一、第二期中学习成绩好的新工人协助教第三期的新工人，解决了当时老师缺乏的困难；三、配合教学，进行考试表扬，以提高新工人的学习情绪。这样，到十月底，机织工人看台能力平均达到了十二台，细纱工人看锭能力达到了四百锭，都超过了原订计划。
    第二，依靠群众力量，加速检修进度，提前全部开车。原计划规定每天检修细纱机两台，需一个多月才能全部检修完毕。后来领导方面决定要在两天检修好十五台细纱机。经工人讨论、提出了加速检修的合理化建议，将两个混合检修组改为分工专业组，展开检修竞赛，工人们发挥了劳动积极性和创造性，第一天即修好了六台，第二天检修好了九台，而且运转良好。领导方面用这一事实教育了大家，重新修订全部检修计划，加速了检修进度，提前到十月底检修完毕，并保证了质量。
    其次，原计划把全部开车时间订为十二月二十日，这已经是比较保守的了，但布场工程师还认为这是“削足适履”，是“打如意算盘”。他认为是准备车间落后，供应不上。其实是对准备车间的进度估计太低，情况也不清楚。他说：整经每台时只达两千码，（实际上已达二千六百码），穿筘机每架十小时只能穿三个多（实际上已达四个半），上轴每工只能上四十个（实际上已达七、八十个，最高曾达一百四十个）。领导方面用实际材料说明准备车间的进度是供应得上的，说服了技术人员。经过几次研究，最后将全部开车的日期改为十一月十日，实际上到十一月八日就开齐了车子，比原计划提前了四十二天。
    第三，发动工人讨论生产计划，找出主要问题，迅速提高质量。十月初开始订计划时，由于全部工人是新工人，多数不知道订计划的意义、怎样订法和怎样保证，有的甚至不知道什么是计划。领导上就进行通俗讲解，并发动大家讨论，然后采取典型示范的办法，通过各生产组长，帮助较先进的工人订出计划作榜样，让大家效法。但以后又发现计划订得千篇一律，而且没有注意质量，于是首先帮助车间找出主要问题，研究出原因和办法，再订计划示范。例如总结十月份细纱生产时发现质量不好，整经每码平均剔出一百零三根“羽毛纱”，全月共退回坏纱一千一百四十九公斤，原因是清洁工作和工作法等作得不好。针对上述缺点，在订十一月份计划时提出“作好三洁（车面清洁、牵伸清洁、车肚清洁）、降低断头、消灭五害（羽毛纱、竹节纱、松纱、紧纱、成形不良纱），提高质量”的口号，并提出改进工作法的措施，大家按照自己的具体情况再订出个人计划，并展开红旗竞赛。这样，十一月份的羽毛纱果然减少到六十根左右，坏纱减少到七百九十八公斤。这一事实，打破了有些人认为新厂基础差，新工人技术低，事事无经验，难以订计划的保守观点。
    第四，推行车间作业计划，逐步走向均衡生产。在十一月份以前，虽然发动群众讨论和制订了生产计划，但对各车间作业计划没有加以综合和平衡，因而产生了供应失调、互相脱节的现象。粗纱多了便积压，少了则细纱停车，布场停车待料现象也相当严重。厂内有些领导干部开始也有一种保守思想，认为新厂工作忙乱、头绪多、基础差，还不能推行作业计划。从十一月份起，逐一帮助车间算细账，试订作业计划，并制出全厂日历进度表，虽然收效不大，但摸到了一些经验。十二月份以厂长为首，抽调了几个人，专门帮助较弱的部门编制作业计划。首先检查了布场十一月份没有完成产量、质量计划的原因，尤其是质量，次布达百分之二十至二十五。车间主任却把责任推给“纱场的纱不均匀”。经过检查，发现布场车间没有研究过质量问题，同时发现次布中有五分之四是属于布场的责任。于是用这两件事实进行教育，说服车间干部订出十二月份的包括质量的日历进度表。同时，发动整理、准备、细纱、清花等四个车间，根据布场计划订出本车间的作业计划，建立了每周检查制，各车间就基本上达到了逐日均衡生产。到十二月二十日为止，两种棉布的次布降到百分之七，比十一月降低了三分之二以上。这一事实说明：新建厂在转入生产的初期，只要领导重视，打破保守观点，深入发现问题，抓住关键，教育干部，是可能而且必须及早推行作业计划的。
    第五，初步建立必要制度，首先是责任制。由基本建设转入生产后，重心转移，机构变动，因此，必须及时建立一些必要的制度，特别是责任制，行政责任制（车间、科、室、生产组长等）已初步建立。工人交接班制度经工人讨论、建立后，已收到良好成绩，消除了开始时交接混乱、脱节，不负责任等现象。例如细纱车间甲班工人李聪过去每天出白花三斤左右，建立交接班制度后，已降至十两左右。
    国棉二厂由基本建设转入生产的过程，同时也是不断教育干部、教育工人的过程。在增产节约工作组协助下，首先对各部门负责干部、然后对全厂职工进行了一系列的思想工作，除新工训练中的政治教育课程和厂内日常教育外，在增产节约运动中，特别是结合生产计划的制订，先后进行了关于增产节约的意义、劳动纪律、爱国主义和国家在过渡时期的总路线等几次全厂的报告和学习，大大提高了全厂职工的政治觉悟和劳动热忱，使职工认识了社会主义的光辉前途以及自己在工业建设中的光荣任务，对前述五项具体措施的实现起了鼓舞作用，从而保证了该厂提前全部开工并转入正常生产。
