The realization of the Korean armistice has brought some relaxation to the tense situation in the Far East. Peace-loving countries and people in the Far East and the world sincerely hope that after the Korean armistice, the Far Eastern situation can move towards relaxation through consultation. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has also proposed at the Berlin Conference the "Measures to Ease International Tension and Convening a Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China." However, while the United States had to discuss this proposal at the Berlin Conference, its warmongers are carrying out a series of bellicose activities in the Far East, attempting to continue maintaining and creating tension in the Far East. This policy of the American aggressors cannot but arouse the attention and vigilance of the people of all countries.

The United States openly used force to seize prisoners of war, destroying the agreement between the two sides on the issue of prisoners of war. Now it is deliberately delaying the resumption of bilateral talks in order to continue obstructing the convening of the Korean political conference. The U.S. side made an excuse on December 12th last year to unreasonably interrupt the bilateral talks for arranging the political conference. At the meeting of liaison secretaries between the two sides, which began on January 14th this year, it unreasonably rejected the suggestions for the resumption date proposed by the Korean and Chinese sides three times, and now it has violated international norms by not responding for a long time to our side's suggestion to resume bilateral talks on February 1st. This fully exposes its consistent and despicable attempt to avoid convening a political conference. While deliberately delaying its response to our side's suggestion regarding the resumption date, the United States has also coerced many countries in the United Nations to overturn India's suggestion that the United Nations General Assembly reconvene on February 9th, in order to prevent the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the serious situation of the Korean issue. The United States' delay in convening the political conference and reconvening the United Nations General Assembly is clearly aimed at preventing a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and continuing to maintain the state of tension in Korea.

Not only that, but the U.S. side is also desperately expanding the Syngman Rhee puppet army, and condoning the Syngman Rhee group's continuous war cries, in order to increase the difficulty of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. According to the "New York Times," Syngman Rhee also threatened that the Korean issue "If a 'satisfactory' peace agreement cannot be reached in the spring, he will 'march north.'" The U.S. side is also directly violating the armistice agreement, sending U.S. planes to frequently intrude into the airspace over the demilitarized zone for provocative reconnaissance activities, and arbitrarily disassembling war materials into parts and transporting them into South Korea. The U.S. side groundlessly accused the Korean and Chinese sides of violating the armistice agreement by disassembling war materials into parts and transporting them into Korea. This accusation has been unanimously refuted as baseless by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. However, the U.S. side's representative publicly contradicted himself on the Military Armistice Commission, and unreasonably argued that war materials can be disassembled into parts and transported into Korea, and that this does not constitute a violation of the armistice agreement. Obviously, the U.S. side is attempting to amass a large amount of military equipment and materials in order to strengthen the Syngman Rhee puppet army. The United States is delaying the convening of the political conference, preventing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and actively supporting the Syngman Rhee puppet army to prepare for adventures to threaten the implementation of the Korean armistice. This makes the Korean situation even more serious.

While the United States is making every effort to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it is also desperately obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue. It is forcing the French government to disregard the peace wishes and propositions of the French and Indochinese peoples, and to prolong the war of aggression against Indochina in accordance with the intentions of the American war group. When U.S. Vice President Nixon conducted conspiratorial activities in Vietnam last November, he openly stated: "Under no circumstances should negotiations be held" to end the Indochina war. Recently, the U.S. "New York Times" more bluntly wrote that the United States "has exerted tremendous pressure on France" to continue the war against the Indochinese people "instead of negotiating with them."

In order to drive France to wage the unpopular "American war" in Indochina and to expand the United States' aggressive forces in Southeast Asia, the United States is providing the French aggressor troops with large amounts of dollars and military "aid," and is preparing to directly "aid" the puppet regimes in Indochina. In the fiscal year 1954, the United States "aid" to France's military expenditures in Indochina amounted to 785 million U.S. dollars. On January 21st, U.S. "Foreign Operations Administration" Director Stassen also claimed: "France will receive increased aid in the fiscal year 1955 that is roughly the same as that in 1954." Recently, the U.S. government has intensified its involvement in the war of aggression against Indochina at all costs. The U.S. President openly dispatched hundreds of U.S. Far East Air Force "technicians" to Indochina, and pilots of the so-called "Civil Air Transport Company" headed by war profiteer Chennault are also preparing to join the war. According to Agence France-Presse, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford, when reporting on the situation in Vietnam to the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 5th, "proposed suggestions to strengthen the nature of the French and Vietnamese armies," which "means an additional effort by the United States." Currently, U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Weyland and French Defense Minister Pleven have both rushed to Saigon, and U.S. Pacific Army Commander O'Daniel will also go to hold a meeting to discuss "the United States' new and larger aid plan for Indochina," forcing France to continue the desperate war. At the same time, the U.S. Navy Department announced that the U.S., British, and French fleets will hold arrogant and provocative "exercises" in the South China Sea near the coast of Indochina. This series of activities by the U.S. government clearly harbors a new anti-peace and aggressive conspiracy of the United States in Southeast Asia, which seriously threatens the peace and security of the Far East and Asia.

Recently, U.S. military officials have conducted frequent activities in the so-called "key areas" of the "new Pacific defense plan" in the Philippines, Taiwan, Okinawa, Japan, and South Korea, nakedly exposing the conspiracy of the U.S. authorities to piece together a Pacific aggressive bloc. After the U.S. Senate approved the U.S.-Rhee "mutual defense treaty," U.S. Far East Commander Hull immediately discussed with Syngman Rhee plans to expand the Rhee puppet army. U.S. Army Secretary Stevens also personally inspected the bases in South Korea, Taiwan, and Okinawa successively, and held talks with Hull and Philippine President Magsaysay "to exchange views on the U.S. military assistance plan to the Philippines under the mutual defense treaty," attempting to expand the military bases in the Philippines. At the same time, according to U.S. news agencies, Hull and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Allison will participate in a series of military and diplomatic "high-level meetings" in Washington to discuss "the situation of the United States' new defense plan in Asia and the issue of signing a joint security treaty with Japan." People know that in addition to betting its adventurous stakes in the Far East on human scum such as the Syngman Rhee group and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the United States is actively reviving Japanese militarism, attempting to use Japan as the core of the Pacific aggressive bloc.

All these undeniable facts have made the peaceful rhetoric of American diplomats a lie. The United States' criminal policy of continuing to maintain and create tension in the Far East completely violates the vital interests of peace and security of Asian countries and only meets the needs of the U.S. monopoly capital group in seeking maximum profits. The British "New Statesman and Nation" weekly of January 9th wrote: "If the currently declining U.S. economy turns into a major recession, this situation may induce some powerful leaders to try to draw people's attention to foreign affairs. Of course, this does not mean war, but it may mean a recurrence of tension." In order to rely on war to maintain high profits, the U.S. monopoly capital group drove hundreds of thousands of American youths to make dishonorable sacrifices on the Korean battlefield. Now, this ugly motive of pursuing huge profits is obstructing the true realization of peace in Korea, endangering the peace and security of Asia, and obstructing the establishment of normal political and economic relations between Asian countries. The United States' bellicose policy of creating tension in Asia is bound to be resolutely opposed by the Asian people.

Whether in the world or in Asia, the legitimate desire of the people to ease tension, remove the threat of new wars, and consolidate peace and security cannot be ignored. The Korean issue and other disputes in Asia must be resolved through consultation. Any practice that violates the people's demands and maintains the Far Eastern tension through arbitrary obstruction policies and aggressive policies will sooner or later end in failure. The Chinese and Korean governments have made sincere efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and advocate the immediate resumption of bilateral talks to promote the rapid convening of the Korean political conference. At the same time, the two governments have repeatedly declared that in view of the international tension caused by the U.S. pursuit of aggressive policies in Korea, Asia, and around the world, it is necessary to convene a five-power conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and the People's Republic of China to review and resolve the current urgent international issues. The Chinese and Korean governments and people will unswervingly work with peace-loving countries and people around the world to fight to the end for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and other international issues through consultation.

    反对美国继续保持和制造远东紧张局势
    谢昆
    朝鲜停战的实现，使得紧张的远东局势有了一些缓和。远东和世界爱好和平的国家和人民都衷心企望在朝鲜停战之后，经过协商方式使远东局势能够朝着缓和的方向前进。苏联莫洛托夫外长并已在柏林会议上提出了“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”的建议。可是，美国虽然一方面不得不在柏林会议上讨论这个建议，但另一方面它的好战分子却又在远东进行一系列的好战活动，企图继续保持和制造远东紧张局势。美国侵略者的这种政策，不能不引起各国人民的注意和警惕。
    美国方面公开用武力劫夺战俘、破坏双方关于战俘问题的协议。现在又故意拖延双方会谈的恢复，以继续阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开。美方于去年十二月十二日制造借口无理地中断了安排政治会议的双方会谈，在今年一月十四日开始举行双方联络秘书会议上又无理地拒绝了朝中方面三次提出的复会日期的建议，现在竟违反国际常轨对我方谈判代表提出在二月一日恢复双方会谈的建议长时间不予答复。这充分地暴露了它一贯不愿召开政治会议的卑鄙企图。美国在故意拖延答复我方关于复会日期的建议同时，并挟持联合国中许多国家，推翻了印度提出的联合国大会在二月九日复会的建议，以阻止联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的严重局势。美国拖延政治会议的召开和联合国大会的复会，目的显然是要阻止朝鲜问题的和平解决，继续保持朝鲜的紧张状态。
    不仅如此，美方还正在拚命扩大李承晚傀儡军队，纵容李承晚集团不断发出战争叫嚣，以增加朝鲜问题的和平解决的困难。据“纽约时报”说，李承晚又扬言朝鲜问题“如果在春天不能获致‘令人满意的’和平协议，他将‘向北进军’。”美方更直接违反停战协定，派遣美机不时侵越非军事区上空，进行挑衅性的侦察活动；并任意把作战物资拆卸成零件运入南朝鲜。美方曾毫无道理地诬控朝中方面违反停战协定，把作战物资拆成零件运入朝鲜。这种诬控并已被中立国监察委员会一致斥为毫无根据。但是美方代表却在军事停战委员会上公然自相矛盾，蛮横无理地主张作战物资可以拆成零件运入朝鲜，不算违反停战协定。显然，美方是企图调集大量军火物资以加强李承晚伪军。美国一方面拖延政治会议的召开，使朝鲜问题不得和平解决，一方面积极扶植李承晚伪军作冒险的准备，以威胁朝鲜停战的实施，这就使得朝鲜局势更加严重。
    美国在竭力阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的同时，又拚命阻挠印度支那问题的和平解决。它逼迫法国政府不顾法国人民和印度支那人民的和平愿望与主张，而按照美国战争集团的意图，延长侵略印度支那的战争。美国副总统尼克松在去年十一月到越南进行阴谋活动时即曾公开说：“在任何情况下都不应举行谈判”来结束印度支那战争。最近，美国“纽约时报”更露骨地写道：美国“已对法国施以巨大压力”，使它继续进行反对印度支那人民的战争，“而不去与他们谈判”。
    美国为了驱使法国在印度支那进行不得人心的“美国人的战争”，并扩张美国在东南亚的侵略势力，正以大量的美元和军火“援助”法国侵略军，并准备直接“援助”印度支那的傀儡政权。在一九五四年会计年度，美国“援助”法国在印度支那的军费达七亿八千五百万美元。一月二十一日，美国“援外事务管理署”署长史塔生又声称：“法国在一九五五年会计年度将会获得和一九五四年大体差不多的增加了的援款”。最近，美国政府更不顾一切地加紧参与侵略印度支那的战争。美国总统公然派遣数百名美国远东空军“技术人员”前往印度支那，以战争贩子陈纳德为首的所谓“民用航空运输公司”的驾驶员也准备参战。据法新社称，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福，二月五日向参议院军事委员会报告越南形势时，曾“提出加强法越军队的性质的建议”，这“意味着由美国作一种额外的努力”。现美国驻远东空军司令威兰和法国国防部长普利文已先后赶到西贡，美国驻太平洋陆军司令奥丹尼尔也将前往，他们将举行会议，讨论“美国对印度支那的新的、规模更大的援助计划”，强使法国继续进行绝望的战争。同时，美国海军部宣布，美英法舰队将在印度支那海岸附近的南中国海举行狂妄的挑衅性的“演习”。美国政府的这一连串活动显然包藏着美国在东南亚一个新的反和平的侵略阴谋，它严重地威胁着远东和亚洲的和平与安全。
    最近，美国军事负责人物在所谓“新的太平洋防务计划”中的“关键地区”菲律宾、台湾、冲绳岛、日本和南朝鲜，进行了频繁的活动，赤裸裸地露暴了美国当局企图拚凑太平洋侵略集团的阴谋。美国参议院批准了美李“共同防御条约”后，远东美军总司令赫尔即与李承晚商谈扩充李伪军计划。美国陆军部部长斯蒂文斯，也亲自先后视察了南朝鲜、台湾和冲绳岛基地，并曾和赫尔与菲律宾总统麦格赛赛举行会谈，“就根据两国共同防御条约美国对菲律宾军事援助计划的问题交换意见”，企图扩大在菲律宾的军事基地。同时，据美国通讯社报道，赫尔和美国驻日大使艾利逊将参加华盛顿举行一系列军事和外交的“高级会议”，讨论“美国在亚洲新的防务计划的形势以及与日本签订一个共同安全条约的问题”。人们知道，美国除了把它在远东的冒险赌注押在李承晚集团和蒋介石匪帮之流的人类渣滓身上以外，就积极复兴日本军国主义，企图把日本作为太平洋侵略集团的核心。
    这一切不容掩盖的事实，已使美国外交家们的和平言论成为谎言。美国在远东继续保持和制造紧张局势的罪恶政策，完全违反亚洲各国和平与安全的切身利益，而只是美国垄断资本集团为谋求最大利润所需要的。一月九日的英国“新政治家与民族”周刊写道：“如果目前在走下坡路的美国经济变成一种大衰退的话，这种情况可能诱使某些有势力的首脑设法引起人们对国外事务的注意。当然，这并不就意味着战争，但也许意味着重新发生紧张局势。”美国垄断资本集团为了依靠战争来维持高额利润，曾驱使数十万美国青年在朝鲜战场上作了不名誉的牺牲。现在，这种追求庞大利润的丑恶动机又在阻挠朝鲜和平的真正实现，危害亚洲的和平与安全，并阻挠着亚洲各国政治和经济的正常关系的建立。美国这种在亚洲制造紧张局势的好战政策是不能不受到亚洲人民的坚决反对的。
    不论是在全世界或是在亚洲，人民要求缓和紧张局势，解除新战争威胁及巩固和平与安全的正当愿望，都是不容漠视的。朝鲜问题和亚洲其他争端必须遵循协商途径解决，任何违反人民要求，以专横的阻挠政策和侵略政策来维持远东紧张局势的做法，迟早都将归于失败。中朝两国政府已经为和平解决朝鲜问题作了真诚的努力，主张立即恢复双方会谈，以促使朝鲜政治会议的迅速召开。同时，两国政府并一再声明鉴于美国在朝鲜、亚洲以及世界各地推行侵略政策所造成的国际紧张局势，有必要召开苏联、美国、英国、法国和中华人民共和国的五大国会议，来对当前迫切的国际问题加以审查和解决。中朝两国政府和人民将坚定不移地和世界爱好和平的国家及人民一道，为以协商方式和平解决朝鲜问题及其他国际问题而奋斗到底。
