　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 5th – Due to pressure from the U.S. side, the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission rejected the request from the Korean and Chinese sides to immediately dispatch a mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team to Incheon to investigate the U.S. side's serious violation of the Armistice Agreement in preventing the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team from performing its duties.

　　News from American news agencies confirms that the reason the U.S. side prohibited the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team from entering the port of Incheon to perform its inspection duties on the afternoon of January 20th and the morning of January 21st was because the U.S. side was at that time loading more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war onto U.S. warships in the port of Incheon to be sent to Chiang Kai-shek as cannon fodder. The U.S. side, fearing the exposure of its criminal act of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, openly violated the Armistice Agreement, deprived the Neutral Nations Inspection Team of its right to inspect the port of Incheon, and is now obstructing the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from investigating this incident.

　　General Li Sang-cho, Chief Commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, wrote a letter on January 22nd requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to investigate this incident. According to the reply received today from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission by the Korean and Chinese side, and the commission's minutes of the meeting, the Czechoslovak and Polish members believe: "In view of the fact that the letter from the Chief Commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side is in full compliance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, a mobile inspection team should be dispatched immediately to Incheon to investigate the alleged violations of the Armistice Agreement mentioned in the letter." At the same time, since the personnel of the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team are the main witnesses to this incident, it is obviously not possible for the Incheon team to conduct this investigation themselves. However, the Swedish and Swiss members disregarded the facts and refused to send a mobile inspection team.

　　The reply from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also stated: "The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has taken steps to clarify the circumstances of the Incheon incident and will submit its judgment to the Military Armistice Commission at an appropriate time." On January 27th, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dispatched its four Neutral Nations alternate members to Incheon to investigate the obstruction of the Incheon Neutral Nations Inspection Team from performing its duties by the U.S. side. However, after staying in Incheon for five days, the alternate members returned to Panmunjom on January 31st and have so far been unable to submit a joint report. This shows that the alternate members' investigation work has also been obstructed. The U.S. side's repeated obstruction and interference with the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission proves that the U.S. side's criminal activities of forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and forcing them to serve as cannon fodder for Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek cannot stand the light of day.

### 美方违反停战协定在仁川运走志愿军战俘  又阻挠仁川中立国视察小组执行视察任务

    美方违反停战协定在仁川运走志愿军战俘
    又阻挠仁川中立国视察小组执行视察任务
       【新华社开城五日电】由于美方的压力，中立国监察委员会的瑞典和瑞士委员否决了朝中方面关于立即派遣机动中立国视察小组前往仁川，调查美方严重违反停战协定、阻止仁川中立国视察小组执行任务的事件的请求。
    美国通讯社的消息证实，仁川中立国视察小组在一月二十日下午和二十一日上午被美方禁止进入仁川港口执行其视察任务，就是因为美方当时在仁川港口把一万四千多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员押上美军舰船运给蒋介石当炮灰。美方害怕暴露了它的强迫扣留战俘的罪恶事实，因此公然违反停战协定、剥夺中立国视察小组在仁川港口视察的权利，现在又阻挠中立国监察委员会对这一事件进行调查。
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在一月二十二日写信要求中立国监察委员会对这一事件进行调查。根据朝中方面今天收到的中立国监察委员会的复信及委员会的会议记录，捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员认为：“鉴于朝中方面首席委员的来信完全符合停战协定的规定，应立即派遣一个机动视察小组前往仁川，调查该信中所提出的据称的违反停战协定事件。”同时，由于仁川中立国视察小组人员是这一事件中的主要证人，因此显然不能由仁川小组自行进行此项调查。但瑞典和瑞士委员却不顾事实，拒绝派出机动视察小组。
    中立国监察委员会的复信并说：“中立国监察委员会已采取步骤澄清仁川事件的情况，并将在适当的时候向军事停战委员会提出其判语。”中立国监察委员会在一月二十七日曾派出其四名中立国候补委员前往仁川，调查仁川中立国视察小组被美方阻挠执行其任务的情况。但各候补委员在仁川停留五天后已在一月三十一日返回板门店，迄今并未能提出一份共同报告。这表明候补委员的调查工作，也同样地受到阻挠。美方一再阻挠和干涉中立国监察委员会的工作，证明美方强迫扣留朝中战俘并强迫他们充当李承晚和蒋介石的炮灰的罪恶活动，是完全见不得人的。
