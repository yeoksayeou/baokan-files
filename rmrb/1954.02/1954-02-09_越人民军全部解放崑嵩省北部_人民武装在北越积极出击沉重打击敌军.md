Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: According to Vietnam News Agency on February 7th: Under the offensive of the Vietnam People's Army, the enemy was forced to withdraw from three important strongholds in the northern part of Kontum Province in central and southern Vietnam. Thus, the entire northern region of Kontum Province, located between the border of Quang Ngai Province and the southern border of Laos, has been completely liberated.

Since the Vietnam People's Army annihilated more than 1,100 enemies and liberated the northeastern region of Kontum Province in late January, the defending troops of the enemy strongholds in the northern part of Kontum Province have become even more panicked. In the three days up to February 4th, the enemy hastily withdrew from three important strongholds on Highway 14. These three strongholds are Dak Sut, Dak Pet, and the military sub-district command post Dak To (all place names are transliterations), located 40 to 80 kilometers north of the provincial capital of Kontum Province. The People's Army is now pursuing the retreating enemy.

In addition, on January 27th, the Vietnam People's Army eliminated an enemy stronghold defended by a company near An Khe, southeast of the provincial capital of Kontum Province, seizing one mortar, 54 machine guns and rifles, and all of the enemy's ammunition and military equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, February 8th: According to Vietnam News Agency, from January 20th to early February, the Vietnam People's Army and People's Armed Forces actively fought in various parts of North Vietnam, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

On January 30th, the enemy dispatched a battalion-plus of troops from Dien Bien Phu—the enemy's last stronghold in northwestern Vietnam—under the cover of tanks, attempting to occupy Hill 836. However, they were met with heroic resistance from a platoon of the People's Army defending this hill. As a result, the enemy's seven consecutive fierce attacks all failed. On February 1st, the enemy again gathered three European-African battalions and nine tanks to attack this hill, but were again repelled. In the aforementioned battle, this platoon of the People's Army annihilated three European-African platoons belonging to the 2nd and 13th Foreign Legions. The General Command of the Vietnam People's Army has awarded this platoon of the People's Army a First-Class Combat Medal. At the same time, on January 31st, the Vietnam People's Army, in a battle to intercept two companies of enemy troops advancing eastward from Dien Bien Phu, annihilated two enemy squads and routed the rest of the enemy.

In the Red River Delta, on February 1st, the Vietnam People's Army launched a surprise attack on an enemy outpost 500 meters from the provincial capital of Ninh Binh Province, completely annihilating two enemy companies. Two days prior to this, the People's Armed Forces of Ninh Binh Province, in an anti-mopping-up operation in An Mo County, captured an enemy battalion commander and seven other enemy soldiers, killed 50 enemy soldiers (including one lieutenant), and seized a large quantity of enemy weapons and ammunition.

On January 25th, the Vietnam People's Armed Forces attacked an enemy stronghold located 23 kilometers northwest of Phu Ly, the provincial capital of Ha Nam Province, capturing 70 enemy soldiers, killing seven enemy soldiers including one lieutenant, and seizing 96 machine guns and rifles, two mortars, and 28 boats loaded with medicine and military equipment. The next day, the People's Armed Forces launched a surprise attack on the enemy stronghold of An Duyen, located 20 kilometers north of Phu Ly, killing 22 enemy soldiers and seizing 17 machine guns and rifles. At the same time, on January 20th, local troops of the People's Army of Bac Ninh Province intercepted an enemy transport convoy on the river 12 kilometers south of Hoa Nhai, sinking and damaging two enemy speedboats and killing 63 enemy soldiers.

    人民武装在北越积极出击沉重打击敌军
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社七日讯：在越南人民军的攻势下，敌军被迫撤出了中越南部崑嵩省北部的三个重要据点。至此，位于广义省边境和寮国南部边境之间的崑嵩省整个北部地区完全解放。
    自从越南人民军在一月下旬歼敌一千一百多名并解放崑嵩省东北地区后，崑嵩省北部敌军据点的防守部队更加惶恐不安。在到二月四日为止的三天中，敌人仓皇撤出了第十四号公路上的重要据点三处。这三处据点是：位于崑嵩省省会以北四十公里到八十公里处的达克苏特、达克培特和军分区指挥据点达克陶（三地名均译音）。现人民军正追击撤退的敌人。
    此外，一月二十七日，越南人民军拔除位于崑嵩省省会东南安溪附近由一连人防守的敌军据点一处，缴获迫击炮一门、机枪和步枪五十四挺（支）以及敌军的全部弹药和军事装备。
    【新华社八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：从一月二十日到二月初，越南人民军和人民武装在北越各地积极作战，使敌人遭受重大损失。
    一月三十日，敌人从奠边府——敌人在越南西北地区的最后一个据点——派出一营多部队，在坦克的掩护下出犯，企图占领八三六高地。但是遭到保卫这个高地的一排人民军的英勇阻击。结果，敌人连续七次的猛攻都失败了。二月一日，敌人又集结了三个欧非营和九辆坦克再度进攻这个高地，但是又被击退。在上述战斗中，人民军这个排就歼灭了属于第二和第十三外籍军团的三个欧非排。越南人民军总司令部已授予这排人民军一级战斗奖章。同时，越南人民军一月三十一日在截击从奠边府向东出犯的两连敌军的战斗中，歼灭敌军两个班，并击溃其余的敌军。
    在红河三角洲，越南人民军二月一日奇袭距宁平省省会五百公尺的敌军前哨据点一处，全歼敌军两个连。在这前两天，宁平省的人民武装在安谟县的一次反扫荡战中，俘掳敌军营长一名及其他敌军七名，击毙敌军五十名（内有中尉一名），并缴获敌军大量的武器和弹药。
    一月二十五日，越南人民武装进攻位于河南省省会府里西北二十三公里的一处敌军据点，俘掳敌军七十名，击毙包括中尉一名在内的敌军七名，缴获机枪和步枪九十六挺（支）、迫击炮二门、满载药品和军事装备的船只二十八艘。第二天，人民武装奇袭位于府里以北二十公里的敌军据点安缘，毙敌二十二名，缴获机枪和步枪十七挺（支）。同时，北宁省的人民军地方部队于一月二十日在化乃以南十二公里处的河上截击敌军的运输船队，击沉和击伤敌军汽艇两艘，毙敌六十三名。
