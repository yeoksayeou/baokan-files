    Rural Credit Work in Heilongjiang Has Developed Greatly in Recent Years

    Rural credit cooperative work in Heilongjiang Province has developed greatly in recent years. At present, there are 662 credit departments and 14 credit cooperatives in the province. These credit organizations are scattered throughout the countryside, and approximately 300,000 farmers across the province have established credit relationships with credit departments and credit cooperatives.

    Since the development of rural credit cooperation, the superiority of socialist collective economic organizations has been greatly demonstrated. It has played a significant role in supporting production, revitalizing the rural economy, assisting impoverished farmers, combating usurious exploitation, and promoting the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Statistics from the end of the third quarter of last year show that the total amount of deposits and loans through credit cooperative organizations reached 35.555 billion yuan. A large amount of means of production has been added to help impoverished farmers. In terms of draught animals alone, there were 2,852 head. In addition, farmers were loaned more than 1,500 pieces of agricultural equipment, 8.37 million catties of seeds, and food grain. There were also materials such as horse hay, horse feed, and fertilizer to help farmers overcome many difficulties in production and life.

    Many villages have benefited from credit cooperation. For example, in Jubaopen Village, Jingxing County, 77 households in the village lacked draught animals last year, and 17 households had insufficient draught animals. Now, thanks to the assistance of loans, 28 of these 77 households have bought cattle, 21 have bought horses, 3 have bought donkeys, 9 have sold donkeys and bought cattle, 7 have sold cattle and bought horses, and 1 has sold a donkey and bought a horse. Zhongyi Village in Nehe County suffered a disaster, and the credit department immediately loaned 28.8 million yuan to help the disaster-stricken farmers to help themselves through production. The farmers used the loans to purchase draught cattle, carts, and fishing gear to overcome the difficulties.

    In areas where credit organizations have developed, usurious exploitation has been basically eliminated. Before the establishment of the credit cooperative in Yong'an Village, Anda County, more than 20 of the 155 households in the village engaged in usury, lending out 180,000 catties of grain throughout the year. More than 80 farmers in the village had to borrow grain from usurers. The highest interest rate was double, and the lowest was half. Farmer Wang Qingxiang borrowed a small amount of grain from a usurer, which quickly snowballed to more than 120 shi (each shi being 450 catties). Wang Qingxiang was even driven to attempt suicide by the creditors. After the establishment of the credit cooperative in 1952, no farmer borrowed grain or money from usurers anymore. Eight hundred and twenty-five farmers from seven villages, including Yong'an and Yongli, established credit relationships with the credit cooperative, with deposits and loans reaching 550 million yuan, eliminating usurious exploitation. Last year, farmers saved 201.18 million yuan in interest alone (calculated at the general usurious interest rate of 6% per month). The farmers in the village happily said, "This time, usury is finished!" Wang Yongfa, a farmer who had been exploited by usury in the past, said, "In the past, working hard all year round was not enough to repay usury. From now on, we will no longer be subject to this exploitation."

    Credit cooperation, a socialist collective economic organization, has brought great benefits to farmers and has established prestige among the masses. Many farmers actively deposit their surplus grain and money in credit cooperatives and credit departments. Last year, the average deposit of each of the more than 600 credit departments and credit cooperatives in the province was only 16 million yuan, but now it has increased to 30 million yuan. Many farmers also request to re-deposit when their deposits mature. In Nenjiang County, the number of re-deposits in the nine credit departments in October last year was 36 million yuan.

    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has also gained a lot of experience in leading credit cooperative work: 1. Conscientiously implementing the policy of voluntary mutual benefit is the key to doing a good job in credit cooperation. It is necessary to ensure that loans are recovered on time, deposits are repaid on time, and credit is observed. Only in this way can we develop business and achieve the task of supporting and developing production. Wherever the policy of voluntary mutual benefit is not well implemented, the masses will doubt the Party's credit policy, their thinking will be confused, they will fear "not being able to repay on time," and credit business will not be able to develop, and the requirements of supporting and developing production and promoting mutual aid and cooperation will not be met. 2. Conscientiously publicize the credit policy, explain the credit policy clearly, and explain clearly that the credit department is the economic organization of the working people themselves, that deposits and loans are convenient, the interest rate is appropriate, there is borrowing and repayment, and there is no chaotic accounting; emphasize that when deposits mature, the principal and interest are guaranteed to be repaid; credit cooperation is the new road—mutual assistance and mutual benefit to develop production. 3. Continuously improving the level of credit cooperative cadres is also an important key to doing a good job in credit cooperative work. Last year, 31 counties in the province conducted 40 days of cadre training starting in July. A total of 551 cadres were trained. Through study, the Party's comprehensive credit policy in rural areas was further implemented, and the policy thinking of taking the state bank as the leader, actively and steadily developing credit cooperation, and promoting legitimate private and reasonable lending to develop agricultural production and promote the cooperative mutual aid movement was established. The trained cadres also clearly recognized that loans must be based on supporting laboring farmers and supporting the development of agricultural production. All local laboring people who need loans should be given loans; and priority should be given to helping impoverished farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperation who urgently need loans in production; under the same conditions, members have priority, and other principles. 4. Actively carry out deposit and loan business, and fully support production development. Supporting production is one of the fundamental tasks of credit cooperative work. The experience in developing deposits: First, expand the source of deposits, mainly relying on the surplus funds of the vast number of farmers, as well as the food grain cultivated on behalf of single soldiers, village government expenses, women's small portion of money, and the accumulation of orphans and widows. Second, adapt to the needs of the masses, handle cash deposits and withdrawals, cash deposits for physical objects, and according to conditions, also handle fixed deposits, current deposits, large deposits, small deposits, and lump-sum deposits, and lump-sum withdrawals. For this reason, it is necessary to abide by credit and repay loans on time to establish prestige and expand deposits. And mobilize cadres, Party and Youth League members, activists, etc. with surplus funds to take the lead in depositing first to drive the masses. The experience of doing a good job in lending: First, vigorously support the production of impoverished farmers, prevent the problem of scattered and evenly distributed loans, and educate farmers to overcome the idea of ​​simple dependence. The loan term must be adapted to production turnover and seasonal needs. 5. Credit cooperation work must be developed and improved under the leadership of the Party committee, government, and state financial institutions. Facts have proved that the development of credit cooperation cannot be done well without the support and assistance of the Party committee, government, and state bank. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and government, closely rely on the state bank, and do a good job in rural credit work. 6. To correctly lead the small-peasant economy to the road of credit cooperation, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of active leadership and steady progress. In the past, errors of coercion and command occurred in some counties. After criticism, there was a tendency for no one to be responsible for credit work and letting things go their own way. The main reason is that some credit work cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of credit cooperation as one of the methods of transforming the small-peasant economy, thus relaxing leadership. This is detrimental to our work. (Liu Qun)

    黑龙江农村信贷工作近年来大有发展
    黑龙江省农村信用合作工作近年来有了很大的发展。目前，全省共有六百六十二个信贷部，十四个信用合作社。这些信贷组织散布在农村各地，全省约有三十万农民和信贷部、信用合作社发生了信贷联系。
    农村信用合作事业开展以后，大大显示出社会主义性质集体经济组织的优越性，它对扶助生产，活跃农村经济，扶助贫困农民，打击高利贷剥削，促进互助合作运动起了重大作用。全省在去年第三季末统计：通过信贷合作组织，存款、贷款总额共三百五十五亿五千五百万元。扶助贫困农民增添了大批生产资料。仅耕畜一项就有二千八百五十二头。此外，还贷给农民一千五百余件农具，八百三十七万斤种籽和吃粮。还有马草、马料、肥料等物资，帮助农民克服了生产和生活上许多困难。
    得到信贷合作好处的村庄很多。如景星县聚宝盆村，全村农户去年没有畜力的有七十七户，畜力不足的有十七户。现在，由于贷款的扶助，这七十七户人家中，有二十八户买了牛，二十一户买了马，三户买了驴，有九户卖驴买进了牛，有七户卖牛买了马，有一户卖驴买了马。讷河县忠义村受了灾害，信贷部马上贷款二千八百八十万，扶助受灾农民生产自救。农民用贷款购买了耕牛、大车、打鱼用具，渡过了难关。
    在信贷组织发展的地区，高利贷剥削基本被消灭了。安达县永安村在未成立信用合作社以前，全村一百五十五户人家，有二十余户放高利贷，全年要放出十八万斤粮食。全村有八十余农民要向高利贷者借粮食。利息最高的是二倍，最低的是半倍。农民王庆祥借了高利贷者不多点粮食，很快就滚到了一百二十余石（每石四百五十斤）。王庆祥曾被债主逼得上过吊。一九五二年信用合作社成立以后，农民谁也不再向高利贷者借粮款了。永安、永利等七个村八百二十五户农民和信用合作社发生了信贷关系，存放款达五亿五千万元，消灭了高利贷的剥削。去年农民仅节省的利息就有二亿零一百一十八万元（按高利贷一般六分利息计算）。村里农民都乐着说：“这回高利贷算垮台了！”过去受高利贷盘剥的农民王永发说：“过去，一年忙到头也不够还高利贷的，从这以后，再不受这份剥削了。”
    信用合作这种社会主义性质的集体经济组织，它给农民带来了很大的好处，已在群众中树立起威信。许多农民积极将自己的余粮余款存放在信用合作社和信贷部里去。去年全省六百余信贷部和信用合作社，平均每个存款只有一千六百万元，现在已增加到三千万元了。许多农民存款到期还要求再转存。在嫩江县，九个信贷部在去年十月份转存款数就有三千六百万元。
    中共黑龙江省委在领导信用合作工作中，也获得了不少经验：一、切实贯彻自愿互利政策，是搞好信用合作工作的关键。必须作到按期收回借款，按期偿还存款，遵守信用。只有这样才能开展业务，实现扶助发展生产的任务。凡是自愿互利政策贯彻不好的地方，群众就怀疑党的信贷政策，思想混乱，怕“不能按期偿还”，信用业务就开展不起来，就达不到扶助发展生产，促进互助合作的要求。二、切实宣传信贷政策，讲清信贷政策，讲清信贷部是劳动人民自己的经济组织，存借方便，利息合适，有借有还，决不瞎账；强调说明存款到期，保证本利齐还；信用合作就是新道路——互助互济发展生产。三、不断提高信用合作干部水平，也是搞好信用合作工作的重要关键。全省去年有三十一个县从七月以后，进行四十天的干部训练。受训干部共有五百五十一名。通过学习，进一步贯彻了党在农村全面的信贷政策，树立以国家银行为领导，积极稳步地发展信用合作，提倡正当的私人合理借贷，以发展农业生产，促进合作互助运动的政策思想。并使受训干部明确认识了放款必须以扶助劳动农民，支持发展农业生产为主，凡当地劳动人民需要贷款者均应贷给；并优先扶助参加互助合作在生产中急需借款的贫困农民；在同样的条件下，社员有优先权等原则。四、积极开展存、放款业务，全力支持生产发展，扶助生产是信用合作工作的根本任务之一。开展存款的经验：首先是扩大存款来源，主要是依靠广大农民的余资，和独身军人代耕粮，村政府经费，妇女小份钱，和孤寡的积累等。其次是适应群众要求，办理存现取现、存实折现，根据条件还可办理定期存款，活期存款，大额存款，小额存款，以及零存整取，整存零取等。为此必须遵守信用，按期还款，以树立威信，扩大存款。并动员有余资的干部、党、团员积极分子等带头先存，以带动群众。作好放款的经验：首先是以大力支持贫困农民生产，防止贷款零散、平均分配的毛病，并要教育农民克服单纯依赖思想。贷款期限必须适应生产周转和季节需要。五、信贷合作工作必须在党委、政府和国家金融机关领导下，才能得到发展和提高。事实证明：信贷合作发展，离开党委、政府和国家银行的支持和扶助是不可能办好的。今后必须加强党、政领导，要紧紧依靠国家银行，作好农村信贷工作。六、正确地领导小农经济走向信贷合作的道路，就必须坚持积极领导，稳步前进的方针。过去，在有些县曾发生强迫命令的错误。批判以后又发生信贷工作无人负责放任自流的偏向。主要原因是有些信贷工作干部对信贷合作工作是改造小农经济的方法之一认识不足，因而放松了领导。这是对我们的工作不利的。（刘群）
