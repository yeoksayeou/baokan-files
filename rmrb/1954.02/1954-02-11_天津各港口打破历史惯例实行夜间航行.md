Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th—Tianjin's ports have broken with historical convention and are now implementing night navigation. From October to the end of December last year, there were seventy-one successful night voyages without any accidents. Now, ten-thousand-ton freighters can enter Tanggu New Port at night riding the tide. Between Dagu and Tianjin, three-thousand-ton ships can also navigate at night.

    After implementing night navigation, ships no longer have to wait for high tide during the day to enter and exit the port, which greatly shortens docking time. If the berthing time is reduced by twelve hours, a ten-thousand-ton ship can save 30 million yuan, and a three-thousand-ton ship can save 10 million yuan. From October to December of last year, it is estimated that more than 2 billion yuan was saved from shortening the docking time alone. At the same time, after night navigation, large quantities of materials can enter and exit the port in a timely manner, thus facilitating the exchange of materials.

    Tianjin Port is a tidal port, with high tide occurring twice a day, day and night. Before liberation, Tianjin Port was controlled by imperialists, and most of the pilots were foreigners. At that time, they believed that the Tianjin Port channel was winding and narrow, and that night navigation was impossible. Ships could only enter and exit the port during high tide in the daytime. After liberation, all the pilots were replaced by Chinese. As the political awareness of the pilots improved and their skills advanced, some began to attempt night navigation. Since the night of October 4 last year, when Shi Xueliang, a pilot and labor model, successfully guided the "Peace No. 14" ship from Dagu into Tanggu Port, all the pilots have actively participated in night navigation between Dagu and Tianjin. On the night of November 6, pilot Wang Hongyuan guided a ten-thousand-ton ship into the New Port dock. Zhang Molin, an old pilot aged sixty-seven, also created a new record by leading a ship more than 390 feet long through the lock at night.

### 天津各港口打破历史惯例实行夜间航行

    天津各港口打破历史惯例实行夜间航行
    【新华社天津十日电】天津各港口已打破历史上的惯例，实行夜间航行。从去年十月份到十二月底，已顺利地航行七十一次，没有发生任何事故。现在，万吨巨轮能在夜间乘潮进入塘沽新港。从大沽口到天津间，三千吨轮船也能在夜间航行了。
    实行夜间航行后，船只不必等待白天涨潮时进出港口，这样停船时间就可以大为缩短。如果少停十二小时，万吨轮船可以节省费用三千万元，三千吨轮船可以节省费用一千万元。从去年十月到十二月，据估计仅缩短停船时间一项费用，就可以节省二十多亿元。同时，夜间航行后，大量物资能及时进出港口，因而物资交流也更加便利。
    天津港是潮水港，每天昼夜各涨潮一次。解放前，天津港被帝国主义操纵，引水员多由外国人担任。那时，他们认为天津港航道弯曲、狭窄，根本不可能实行夜航，只能乘白天涨潮时进出港口。解放后，引水员都换了中国人。由于引水员的政治觉悟提高，技术进步，一部分人便开始了夜航的尝试。自去年十月四日夜间，引水员、劳动模范施学良把“和平十四号”轮船由大沽口引进塘沽港成功后，全体引水员都积极参加大沽通往天津间的夜航。十一月六日深夜，引水员王鸿源又把一艘万吨轮船引进新港码头。六十七岁的老引水员张墨林，也创造了一个新纪录，他在夜间引领一只长三百九十多呎的轮船开过船闸。
