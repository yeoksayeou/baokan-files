With the joint efforts of the PLA Railway Corps and workers, the pile driving project for Piers No. 5 and No. 6 of the Hanshui Railway Bridge was successfully completed.
    The pile driving projects for Piers No. 5 and No. 6 of the Hanshui Railway Bridge were successfully completed on February 14th and 18th respectively, thanks to the active efforts of all employees and the comrades of the 854th Detachment of the PLA Railway Corps.
    The pile driving project for Pier No. 6 began on February 1st, and the task was undertaken by the soldiers of the 854th Detachment of the PLA Railway Corps. At the beginning of the project, the pile driving efficiency was very low because the soldiers were not familiar with this type of pile driving work, and the planning and organization work was not done well enough. In order to quickly become familiar with the work, the Party Branch Committee held an enlarged meeting to specifically study the pile driving situation and identify the key problems. Then, each platoon and each Party and Youth League group also held timely group meetings and proposed guarantees for improving the work. The next day, the pile driving work of the first platoon immediately underwent a great change. Everyone paid attention to the operating procedures and eliminated accidents. At the same time, while driving piles, everyone also did preparatory work—tying pile ropes and digging square timbers for the foundation. In this way, one pile followed another, and the pile driving speed increased to 56 meters, and then to 63 meters on the third day.
    The new record created by the soldiers of the first platoon greatly encouraged the soldiers of the fourth platoon. The soldiers of the fourth platoon soon also created a record of 86.5 meters in eight hours. Through the hard work of the soldiers, many difficulties were overcome. Some time ago, there was heavy rain and snow, and many people fell into the mud or water, but they got up and continued to work immediately. When the work was tense, some soldiers even forgot to eat.
    The underwater pile driving work of Pier No. 5 was also completed on the morning of the 14th of this month, with a crane ship that had to lift and drive piles at the same time. Currently, Pier No. 5 is undergoing pile supplementation and impact testing, and wooden caisson work is being actively prepared; Pier No. 6 has also begun static load testing. All the soldiers who participated in the pile driving work of Pier No. 6 are actively preparing to welcome the upcoming pile driving task of Pier No. 7.

    在解放军铁道部队和工人共同努力下
    汉水铁桥五号六号桥墩打桩工程胜利完成
    汉水铁桥五号和六号桥墩打桩工程在全体职工和中国人民解放军铁道部队八五四一支队全体同志的积极努力下，先后于二月十四、十八日胜利完成。
    六号桥墩的打桩工程是在二月一日开始的，担负这个任务的是中国人民解放军铁道部队八五四一支队的战士。工程开始时，由于战士们对这样的打桩工作不熟悉，加上计划、组织工作做得不够，因此打桩效率很低。为了迅速熟悉业务，党支委扩大会议具体研究打桩情况，找出了关键问题。接着各个排和各个党、团小组也及时召开了小组会，并且提出改进工作的保证。第二天一排的打桩工作立刻就有很大的转变，每个人都注意了操作规程，消灭了事故。同时大家一面打桩，一面做准备工作——捆桩绳和挖地基的方木，这样一根接着一根，打桩的速度就提高到五十六公尺，第三天又提高到六十三公尺。
    一排战士创造的新纪录，大大地鼓舞了四排战士。四排战士不久也创造了八小时打八十六点五公尺的最高纪录。在战士们的艰苦奋斗之下，许多困难都被克服了。前些时大雨大雪，许多人摔倒在泥里，或掉到水里，但他们爬起来立刻又继续工作。在工作紧张的时候，有的战士连饭都忘了吃。
    五号桥墩水下打桩的工作，也在一只吊船既要吊桩又要打桩的情况下，于本月十四日上午完成打桩任务。现在，五号桥墩正在进行补桩和作冲击试验，木沉井工作正在积极准备；六号桥墩亦开始作静载试验。参加六号桥墩打桩工作的全体战士，正在积极准备迎接即将到来的七号桥墩的打桩任务。
