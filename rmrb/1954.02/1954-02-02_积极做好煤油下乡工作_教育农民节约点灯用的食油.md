    Editor's Note: Reader Liu Zhongwen's suggestion is correct. Doing a good job of promoting kerosene use in rural areas will not only save some edible vegetable oil but also help agricultural and sideline production. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of all parties, the work of promoting kerosene use in rural areas has made considerable progress. Especially since the fourth quarter of last year, various regions have adopted methods such as assigning specific personnel to specific areas for distribution, organizing the supply of lamps, and providing short-term credit sales to cooperatives with financial difficulties, so that the supply plan for 1953 was overfulfilled. In order to better meet the needs of the people, the China Petroleum Corporation has determined to adopt the business policy of "cooperating with the purchase of agricultural products, appropriately regulating edible vegetable oil, actively organizing supply, meeting the needs of the people, and strengthening sales work in blank areas in a planned and step-by-step manner" this year.

    However, at present, the kerosene supply plans of some grassroots department stores and cooperatives are divorced from reality, resulting in frequent stockouts. Individual cooperatives still have a fear of trouble in kerosene supply work. In many places, not enough has been done to organize urban and rural private merchants and peddlers to expand the supply of kerosene. These should be actively improved in the future.

    Liu Zhongwen from the Jiujiang Special District Trading Company of Jiangxi Province wrote: In order to solve the current imbalance between the production and sales of edible oil, the State Council of the Central People's Government recently issued the "Directive on Increasing the Production of Oil Crops." I think that mobilizing the broad masses of farmers to use kerosene instead of edible oil for lamps to save edible oil is also a work worth promoting. At present, the phenomenon of using edible oils such as rapeseed oil, raw oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, and soybean oil for lamps is still very common in rural areas (especially in rural areas south of the Yangtze River). Even if we calculate that there are 100 million farmers in the country using edible oil for lamps, and each household and each person uses an average of one jin of oil per year, then the edible oil consumed in a year is 100 million jin. If this edible oil is used to supply people for consumption, it will help to solve the problem of edible oil falling short of demand.

    In recent years, with the development of the petroleum industry, the production of kerosene has been greatly increased, and the price of kerosene has also been reduced a lot. Taking Jiujiang City, Jiangxi as an example, rapeseed oil on the market is 5,000 yuan per jin, while kerosene is only 4,200 yuan per jin; even in the most remote areas, kerosene will not be more expensive than edible oil. Moreover, using kerosene for lamps is economical, bright, and convenient. Therefore, I suggest that the people's governments in areas where farmers are accustomed to using edible oil for lamps actively publicize the benefits of using kerosene for lamps to farmers, and at the same time organize state-owned commercial institutions and cooperatives to do a good job of promoting kerosene use in rural areas.

### 积极做好煤油下乡工作  教育农民节约点灯用的食油

    积极做好煤油下乡工作  教育农民节约点灯用的食油
    编者按：读者刘中文的建议是正确的。做好煤油下乡的工作，不但能够节约部分食用植物油，而且有助于农业和副业的生产。几年来，由于各方面的努力，煤油下乡的工作已经取得了不少成绩。特别从去年第四季度以来，各地更采取了专人专地分片包销、组织灯具供应、给资金困难的合作社以短期赊销的便利等办法，使一九五三年的供应计划得以超额完成。为了更好地满足人民需要，中国石油公司已确定以“配合收购农产品，适当调节食用植物油，积极组织供应，满足人民需要，有计划有步骤地加强空白区推销工作”为今年的经营方针。
    但是，目前还有部分基层百货商店和合作社的煤油供应计划脱离实际，以致常常发生脱销现象；个别合作社对煤油供应工作还存在怕麻烦思想。不少地方在组织城乡私商小贩以扩大煤油供应面的工作还做得不够。这些，在今后都应该积极改进。
    江西省九江专区贸易公司刘中文来信：为了解决目前食油产销之间的不平衡现象，中央人民政府政务院最近发布了“关于增产油料作物的指示”。我觉得，动员广大农民用煤油代替食油点灯，以节约食油，也是一个值得提倡的工作。目前农村里（特别是江南的农村）用菜油、生油、棉油、麻油、豆油等食油点灯的现象还是很普遍的。即使以全国有一亿农民用食油点灯、每户每人每年平均点一斤油计算，那末一年耗费的食油就是一亿斤。如果把这项食油用来供应人民食用，对解决食油供不应求的问题是会有一些帮助的。
    几年来，随着石油工业的发展，煤油生产量已有很大提高，煤油价格也降低了很多。以江西九江市来说，市场上菜油五千元一斤，煤油只四千二百元一斤；即使在最边远的地区，煤油也不会比食油贵。而且，拿煤油点灯又节省、又光亮、又方便。因此，我建议在农民习惯用食油点灯地区的人民政府积极向农民宣传用煤油点灯的好处，同时组织国营商业机构和合作社做好煤油下乡工作。
