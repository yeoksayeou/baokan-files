    Northeast China Coal Mines' Five Newly Built Vertical Shafts to be Completed This Year
    Will Produce a Large Amount of High-Quality Coking Coal to Meet the Needs of the Steel Industry
      [Our Newspaper] The five large-scale, newly equipped vertical shafts in the Northeast region, which began construction in 1950 and 1952 respectively—the Xi'an Central Vertical Shaft, the Benxi Caitun Vertical Shaft, the Hegang Dongshan Vertical Shaft, the Shuangyashan West Vertical Shaft, and the Jixi Xiaohengshan Vertical Shaft—can all be completed around October this year and put into production one after another. At present, the main and auxiliary shafts of these five pairs of vertical shafts have been completed, and the installation of mechanical equipment inside the shafts and on the ground, as well as the layout of tunnels and mining areas, are proceeding intensely. Most of these vertical shafts produce high-quality coking coal, and their completion and production will prepare sufficient fuel for the development of the steelmaking and ironmaking industries.
    The construction projects of these vertical shafts are very large. If their underground tunnels were connected, they would be more than seventy kilometers long; the amount of waste rock excavated totals 560,000 cubic meters; the combined length of the five pairs of main and auxiliary shafts can reach more than 3,400 meters underground, with the largest shaft reaching a depth of 520 meters. From this shaft, five tons of coal can be lifted every minute in the future. Taking the Xi'an Central Vertical Shaft as an example: in the underground 500 meters deep, there are various mechanized tunnels, crisscrossing for ten li. The tunnels are paved with concrete, neat and smooth. In the future, you can take a Donbass-style tram here to reach every tunnel and mining area. Underground, in addition to these "streets," there are also offices, traffic control rooms, warehouses, and various automated mechanical control rooms. These five pairs of vertical shafts will all be equipped with highly mechanized equipment. From mining to transportation, all heavy physical labor will be replaced by machinery. In order to protect the health of the workers, all vertical shafts will also build very perfect safety and hygiene equipment and labor protection equipment. Each underground has a spray network, waterproof doors, fire doors, safety ladders, underground canteens, and clinics.
    The construction of vertical shafts is a very arduous and complex task. According to the technical standards of general capitalist countries, it takes at least eight to ten years to build a vertical shaft with an annual output of 900,000 tons of coal. However, with the help and guidance of advanced Soviet technology, these five pairs of vertical shaft projects are proceeding at an unprecedented speed. A certain vertical shaft project with a designed annual coal output of 900,000 tons started construction in September and October of 1950 and can be completed around October of this year, totaling just four years. The Benxi Caitun Vertical Shaft was also built during the puppet Manchurian period. Japanese plunderers used Germany's so-called "latest technology" to build it. From 1938 to 1945, it took seven years to build a main shaft. However, in more than three years, we have built an auxiliary shaft that is larger than the main shaft and other projects.
    These projects have all received assistance from advanced Soviet technology. The Xi'an Central Vertical Shaft and the Hegang Dongshan Vertical Shaft are projects belonging to the 141 key projects that the Soviet Union is helping our country to build or rebuild. The other three pairs of vertical shafts are also being built under the guidance of advanced Soviet technology. Soviet experts personally went to the site to provide guidance, which played a significant role in accelerating the progress of the project and ensuring the quality of the project. At the beginning of the construction of the Xi'an Vertical Shaft, the single-line operation method was adopted, and the rock drilling and wall masonry were carried out in two separate processes. The average daily progress was only 0.413 meters. Later, under the guidance of Soviet expert Shi Mankuo, the parallel operation method was adopted, and the construction schedule instruction chart and day and night cycle instruction chart were promoted, and the comprehensive daily progress was increased to 1.598 meters. The main and auxiliary shaft projects, which originally would have taken at least four years to complete, were completed in one year and ten months.
    In the process of shaft construction, while the workers conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, they actively overcame difficulties and gave play to their creativity. Initially, the progress of the Xiaohengshan Vertical Shaft project was not fast. Since the workers created the "spiral upward wall masonry method," the wall masonry efficiency increased from 4 meters per day to 11.68 meters. In terms of rock drilling, they created the "grouping and circling relay drilling method," which increased efficiency several times and greatly accelerated the progress of the project. In the construction of the Dongshan Vertical Shaft, workers created the "model hook method," which increased efficiency four times.
    Now, the Northeast Coal Mine Administration is actively carrying out various preparations from top to bottom to ensure that these five pairs of vertical shafts are completed on schedule and ahead of schedule to participate in production.

### 东北煤矿新建五对竖井年内竣工  将大量出产优质炼焦煤供应钢铁工业需要

    东北煤矿新建五对竖井年内竣工
    将大量出产优质炼焦煤供应钢铁工业需要
      【本报讯】东北区在一九五零年、一九五二年先后开始兴建的五对规模宏大、新式装备的竖井——西安中央竖井、本溪彩屯竖井、鹤岗东山竖井、双鸭岭西竖井和鸡西小恒山竖井，今年十月前后可以全部竣工，陆续投入生产。现在，这五对竖井的主、副井筒都已全部完成，正在紧张进行井内、地面的机械设备安装工程，以及坑道和采煤区的布置工作。这些竖井大部分是生产优质炼焦煤的，它们竣工生产后，将为炼钢、炼铁工业的发展准备好充足的燃料。
    这些竖井的建设工程非常浩大。如果把它们的地下巷道连接起来有七十多公里长；开凿的矸石量共达五十六万立方公尺；五对正、副井筒的长度加在一起可深入地下三千四百多公尺，其中最大的一个井筒深达五百二十公尺，从这个井筒里，将来每分钟就可提升出五吨煤来。举西安中央竖井为例：在五百公尺深的地下，安装着各种机械化装置的巷道，纵横交错足足有十里长，巷道用混凝土铺砌得齐整光滑，将来在这里坐着顿巴斯式的电车可以通往每个坑道和采煤区。井下，除了这些“大街”外，还有办公室、行车指挥室、仓库和各种自动化机械操纵室。这五对竖井，都将用高度机械化的设备装备起来。从开采到运输，一切笨重的体力劳动将为机械所代替。为保障工人们的身体健康，所有的竖井还要建设非常完美的安全卫生设备和劳动保护设备，每个井下都有喷水网、防水门、防火门、安全梯、井下食堂和诊疗所。
    建设竖井是一项十分艰巨、复杂的工作。按一般资本主义国家的技术标准，建设一个年产九十万吨煤的竖井，至少需要八年到十年。然而，在苏联先进技术的帮助和指导下，这五对竖井工程却以空前的速度在进行。设计年产煤量达九十万吨的某竖井工程，从一九五零年九、十月间动工，到今年十月左右就可竣工，前后总计不过四年。本溪彩屯竖井在伪满时也曾兴建，日本掠夺者采用德国的所谓
  “最新技术”来建设，从一九三八年到一九四五年，七年才建成一个主井井筒，而我们在三年多的时间内，就建成了比主井井筒更大的副井井筒和其他各项工程。
    这些工程都得到了苏联先进技术的帮助。西安中央竖井和鹤岗东山竖井是属于苏联帮助我国兴建或改建的一百四十一项重点工程中的项目，另外三对竖井也是在苏联先进技术指导下建设的。苏联专家亲入现场指导，对加速工程进度、保证工程质量起了重大作用。西安竖井建井之初，采用的是单行作业施工法，凿岩和砌壁分两道工序进行，平均综合日进度只达零点四一三公尺；后经苏联专家石曼阔的指导，采用了平行作业法，并推行施工日程指示图表和昼夜循环指示图表，综合日进度提高到一点五九八公尺。原来至少需要四年才能完成的主、副井筒工程，在一年零十个月内就完成了。
    在建井过程中，职工们一方面认真执行苏联专家的建议，一方面积极克服困难，发挥自己的创造性。起初，小恒山竖井工程进展不快，自从工人们创造了“螺旋式向上砌井壁法”，砌壁效率由日进四公尺提高到十一点六八公尺；在凿岩方面，创造了“分组分圈接替打眼法”，提高效率数倍，大大加速了工程进度。在东山竖井建设中，工人创造了
  “模型弯钩法”，提高效率四倍。
    现在，东北煤矿管理局正自上而下地积极进行各项准备工作，保证这五对竖井按期和提前竣工参加生产。
