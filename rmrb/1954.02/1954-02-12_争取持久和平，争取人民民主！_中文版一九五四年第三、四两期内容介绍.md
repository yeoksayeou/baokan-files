    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
    Introduction to the Contents of the Chinese Edition, Issues 3 and 4, 1954
    The Chinese edition of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" issues 3 and 4, 1954, have been published.
    The central theme of these two issues is the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Lenin's death. The third issue, in its editorial entitled "Raise the Level of Ideological Work of Communist and Workers' Parties," points out that the progressive people of the world deeply mourn the great Lenin. Lenin's name has become the banner of the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, democracy, and socialism. Lenin taught Communist and Workers' Parties that they must attach great importance to ideological work and the study of revolutionary theory. A high level of ideological work in the Party indicates that the Party is mature, strong, and has an unbreakable connection with the masses. Communist and Workers' Parties in People's Democratic countries are making full use of the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, victoriously leading their people along the road of building socialism. Their task is to further raise the level of ideological work and improve the theoretical cultivation of Party cadres and all Party members. Communist and Workers' Parties in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries are also carrying out large-scale work to publicize revolutionary theory and educate Party members in Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Resolutely opposing decadent bourgeois ideology and relentlessly exposing the "theories" and "viewpoints" of the bourgeoisie and social democracy is an important responsibility of Communist and Workers' Parties.
    The fourth issue, in its editorial entitled "The Great Power of Leninist Thought!" points out that Lenin's name and the entire history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the establishment of the first state of working people—the Soviet Union—and the development of the world communist movement are inextricably linked. Leninism lives forever and is invincible! Its influence is constantly expanding in various countries. The invincible banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, uniting millions of people, flies high all over the world.
    The third issue contains important articles such as "Leninist Thought Illuminates the Path to Improving People's Welfare" by Ioan Chișinevschi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, and "Marxism-Leninism is the Ideological Foundation of the German Socialist Unity Party" by F. Oelssner, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party.
    The fourth issue contains the full text of the report by Pospelov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, at the Moscow memorial meeting commemorating the 30th anniversary of Lenin's death, and also includes the following important articles: "Leninism—the Invincible Banner of the Cause of Liberation of the Working People" by Dong Biwu, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Leninism and the French Workers' Movement" by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, and "The Victory of Lenin's Thought" by Ernő Gerő, Member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party.

专栏：

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五四年第三、四两期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第三、第四两期已先后出版。
    这两期的中心内容是纪念列宁逝世三十周年。第三期在题为“提高共产党和工人党的思想工作水平”的社论中指出：全世界的进步人类都深深悼念伟大的列宁。列宁的名字已经成为各国人民争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争的旗帜。列宁教导共产党和工人党必须极其重视思想工作，重视对革命理论的钻研。党的思想工作水平高，就表示这个党是成熟的，是强大的，是和群众有牢不可破的联系的。人民民主国家的共产党和工人党尽量利用苏联共产党的经验，胜利地领导着本国人民沿着建设社会主义的大道前进。它们的任务是进一步提高思想工作的水平和提高党的干部及全体党员的理论修养。资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国共产党和工人党也在进行大规模的工作，来宣传革命理论，并向党员进行马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义教育。坚决反对腐朽的资产阶级思想，无情地揭露资产阶级和社会民主主义的“理论”和“观点”，这是共产党和工人党的重要职责。
    第四期在题为“列宁主义思想的伟大力量！”的社论中指出：列宁的名字和苏联共产党的全部历史，和第一个劳动人民的国家——苏联——的建立，和世界共产主义运动的发展都是不可分地联系着的。列宁主义永远活着，并无往而不胜！它的影响正在各国不断扩大。团结着千百万人民的马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的战无不胜的旗帜，高高地在世界各地飘扬。
    第三期刊载的重要文章有罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记约·基辛涅夫斯基的“列宁主义思想照耀着增进人民福利的道路”，德国统一社会党中央委员会政治局委员弗·厄斯纳的“马克思列宁主义是德国统一社会党的思想基础”等。
    第四期刊载了苏联共产党中央委员会书记波斯伯洛夫在莫斯科列宁逝世三十周年纪念会上的报告全文，还刊载了下列重要文章：中国共产党中央政治局委员董必武的“列宁主义——劳动人民解放事业的战无不胜的旗帜”，法国共产党书记雅·杜克洛的“列宁主义和法国工人运动”，匈牙利劳动人民党政治局委员埃·格罗的“列宁思想的胜利”。
