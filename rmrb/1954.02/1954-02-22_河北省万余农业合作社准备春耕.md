Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 21st—The newly organized 7,600-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives and the original 3,600-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hebei Province are actively preparing for spring plowing. In Anci County, the 28 newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives have rolled 80% of the wheat fields. Since winter, 300 new and old agricultural producers' cooperatives in Daming County have been hauling soil and accumulating manure, driving a fertilizer accumulation campaign in more than 300 villages. In the Cang County area, where flooding occurred last year, more than 600 agricultural producers' cooperatives, after developing various sideline occupations such as saltpeter boiling and weaving, have driven more than 800,000 farmers in the area to engage in diverse sideline production, increasing the funds for this year's agricultural production. Among the 100 newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives in Xingtang County, 70 have already formulated their annual production plans before the Spring Festival. Because these agricultural producers' cooperatives engage in collective labor and collective management, overcoming the contradictions and difficulties that could not be overcome in the past by mutual aid teams and individual households, this year's production increase plans are higher than those of mutual aid teams and individual households. The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Wugong Village, Raoyang County, plans to increase the unit area yield of the cooperative's more than 4,000 mu of cultivated land from 318 jin of grain per mu last year to 500 jin this year, which will increase the national production of commodity grain by 500,000 jin and a considerable amount of industrial raw materials.

The ability of more than 10,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hebei Province to quickly enter production is mainly due to the fact that the Communist Party committees at all levels in Hebei Province have earnestly implemented the policy of combining cooperative establishment with production. All localities started with leading production when establishing cooperatives and included the formulation of production plans as part of the work of establishing cooperatives. Whether new or old cooperative members, in the process of developing or rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives, not only further understood the policy of mutual aid and cooperation, but also received a relatively profound patriotic production increase education, so that production activities immediately unfolded once many agricultural producers' cooperatives were established.

    河北省万余农业合作社准备春耕
    【新华社保定二十一日电】河北省新组织的七千六百多个农业生产合作社和原有的三千六百多个农业生产合作社，正积极准备春耕。安次县新建的二十八个农业生产合作社已将麦田轧过十分之八。大名县三百个新旧农业生产合作社入冬后便拉土积肥，带动三百多个村庄开展起积肥运动。沧县专区去年受涝地区六百多个农业生产合作社开展起熬硝、纺织等各种副业后，带动全区八十多万农民开展起多种多样的副业生产，增加了今年的农业生产资金。行唐县新建的一百个农业生产合作社，有七十个社已在春节前订出全年的生产计划。因为这些农业生产合作社集体劳动集体经营，克服了过去在互助组和单干户时克服不了的矛盾和困难，所以今年的增产计划都高于互助组和单干户。饶阳县五公村耿长锁农业生产合作社计划今年把全社四千多亩耕地的单位面积产量由去年每亩折谷三百十八斤增加到五百斤，总计可为国家增产五十万斤商品粮食和不少工业原料。
    河北省一万多个农业生产合作社能够迅速投入生产，主要是河北省各级中共党委切实执行了建社和生产相结合的方针。各地在建社时都是从领导生产着手，并把制订生产计划列为建社的工作内容。无论新老社员，在发展或整顿农业生产合作社的过程中，不仅进一步懂得了互助合作的政策，并受到一次比较深刻的爱国增产教育，所以很多农业生产合作社一经建成，生产活动立即展开。
