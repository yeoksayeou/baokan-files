    Encouraging Mountain People to Take the Socialist Road
    Conducting specific propaganda and education "tailored to local conditions" and "tailored to the individual" for different targets and situations is an effective method for newspapers to promote the general line in depth. The Hubei Daily published several reports in mid-to-late January about the transition to socialism in mountainous areas. These reports, based on the characteristics of mountainous areas and combined with the practical experience of the masses, carried out specific socialist prospect education for mountain farmers.
    Enshi and Yichang prefectures in Hubei Province are both mountainous areas. Many local farmers have a vague understanding and lack confidence in whether mountainous areas can achieve socialism. For example, some people believe that they are planting on hillside fields, and no matter how busy they are throughout the year, the grain they harvest is not enough to eat, so they are not at ease with agricultural production; some people believe that there is very little flat land even three acres in size in mountainous areas, so how can they use tractors in the future? According to the ideological situation of the mountain people, Hubei Daily published on January 12 and 14 a series of reports on the party members, Youth League members, village cadres and activists of Zhaojiayan Township in Changyang County and Gaoqiao Township in Enshi County who, through study and discussion, improved their understanding of the socialist realization of mountainous areas, in order to enlighten mountain farmers to recognize their bright future. For example, the former report pointed out the benefits of taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation with the personal experience of Zhou Qiben, the deputy head of Zhaojiayan Township. Zhou Qiben organized mutual aid groups from 1952, vigorously changed sloping fields into terraced fields, and carried out land processing, transforming fourth-class fields into first-class fields, greatly increasing the harvest; and several households in his mutual aid group changed from "worrying about the next meal after eating this meal" before liberation to "not only having enough to eat and wear, but also having surplus grain." Facts have proved that as long as the mountain people organize production, they can achieve common prosperity. The report also used the corn threshing machine and other machines seen by the mountain farmers as examples, pointing out that with the development of the national industry, various suitable machines can also be obtained in the mountains in the future. Through the personal experiences of Huang Wenyou, the militia captain of the township, and He Yundian, the report also criticized the erroneous ideas that farming in the mountains is not as good as doing business outside, and the lack of confidence in the construction of the mountains, and the plan to move to other places to live. Just as He Yundian said after improving his understanding: "Realizing socialism is a national matter, and our mountainous areas will never be an exception."
    The newspaper’s "The Glory of the General Line Shines in the Deep Mountains," published on January 29, further encouraged mountain farmers to work hard to realize the general line with the actual example of Zhaojiayan Township farmers actively carrying out winter production and participating in mutual aid and cooperation. The report vividly described the enthusiasm of the township farmers for building socialism and the huge power generated by it. Inspired by the general line, in order to "sell more grain to the state" and "to transition to socialism as soon as possible," the township farmers, regardless of the severe cold in the deep mountains in winter, overcame various difficulties and worked nervously to build embankments and level the land, transforming steep mountain slopes into flat terraced fields. Through winter production, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has also greatly developed. Of the 200 middle and poor peasant households in the township, 183 have organized 28 mutual aid groups. This points out the specific road to transition to socialism for the mountain people.
    Although Hubei Daily's propaganda of the general line to the mountain people still needs to be deepened, the newspaper pays attention to educating the masses to recognize the bright future of socialism and actively organize to develop production by adopting the method of mass self-education according to the characteristics of different regions and in light of the specific ideological conditions of the masses. This effort is worthy of attention. (Wang Huaming)

### 鼓舞山区群众走社会主义的路

    鼓舞山区群众走社会主义的路
    针对不同对象的不同情况，“因地制宜”、“因人制宜”地进行具体的宣传教育，是报纸深入总路线宣传的一种有效方法。湖北日报一月中旬和下旬发表的关于山区也能过渡到社会主义的几篇报道，就根据山区的特点，结合群众的实际经验，向山区农民进行了具体的社会主义前途教育。
    湖北省恩施、宜昌两专区均为山区。当地不少农民对山区能否实现社会主义认识模糊，信心不足。如有人认为种的是望山坡田，一年忙到头，收的粮食不够吃，因而不安心于农业生产；有人认为山区连三亩大的平地也很少，将来怎能用得上拖拉机呢？湖北日报根据山区群众的思想情况，在一月十二日、十四日连续发表了长阳县赵家堰乡和恩施县高桥乡党、团员、乡村干部和积极分子经过学习、讨论，提高了对山区实现社会主义的认识的报道，用以启发山区农民认识自己的光明前途。例如前一篇报道就以赵家堰乡副乡长周启本的亲身体会，指明了走互助合作道路的好处。周启本从一九五二年起组织了互助组，大力改坡地为梯田，进行土地加工，把四等田改良为一等田，大大提高了收获量；而他的互助组的几户也由解放前的“吃上餐愁下餐”，变为“不仅有吃有穿还有余粮”。事实证明，山区群众只要组织起来生产，一样可以达到共同富裕。报道中还以山区农民亲眼看到的扭苞谷的机器等为例，指出随着国家工业的发展，将来山区也可以得到各种合用的机器。又通过该乡民兵中队长黄文友和何运典的现身说法，批判了认为在山区种田不如出去做生意，以及对山区建设缺乏信心，打算搬到外地去住等错误想法。正如何运典在提高了认识之后所说的：“实现社会主义是全国的事，我们山区绝不会例外。”
    报纸在一月二十九日发表的“总路线的光辉照耀在深山里”，更以赵家堰乡农民积极开展冬季生产和参加互助合作的实际榜样，鼓舞山区农民为实现总路线而努力。报道中生动地描写了该乡农民建设社会主义的热情以及由此产生的巨大力量。该乡农民在总路线的鼓舞下，为了“把更多的粮食卖给国家”，“为了早日过渡到社会主义”，不顾冬日深山的严寒，克服着种种困难，紧张地打壋整地，要将陡峻的山坡改造成一块块平展的梯田。通过冬季生产，互助合作运动也有了很大的发展。全乡中贫农二百户，已有一百八十三户组织起二十八个互助组。这就为山区群众指明了过渡到社会主义的具体道路。
    湖北日报对山区群众宣传总路线虽然还有待继续深入，但该报注意根据不同地区的特点，针对群众的具体思想情况，采用群众自我教育的方式，来教育群众认识社会主义的光明前途，积极地组织起来发展生产，这种努力是值得重视的。　（汪华明）
