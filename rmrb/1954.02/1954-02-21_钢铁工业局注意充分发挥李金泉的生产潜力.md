    Steel Industry Bureau Pays Attention to Fully Utilizing Li Jinquan's Production Potential
    Letter from the Steel Industry Bureau of the Central People's Government Ministry of Heavy Industry: On November 10th of last year, the People's Daily published Comrade Li Jinquan's letter from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant regarding "Why Won't They Let Us Produce Welding Rods in Large Quantities?". After reviewing this, we have the following:
    Starting in 1950, Comrade Li Jinquan, through painstaking research, successively trial-produced five types of welding rods. Although the leadership of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant provided some assistance to him, they one-sidedly believed that welding rods were not a major product of the steel plant, only considering the plant's own needs for welding rods, and failed to recognize the needs for welding rods in modern industry, national defense industry, and basic construction projects. Therefore, they did not give sufficient importance and support to Comrade Li Jinquan's research and production of welding rods. In 1951, the plant assigned an engineer to assist Comrade Li Jinquan, but later stopped helping him because the General Mechanical Office lacked technical cadres. Therefore, Comrade Li Jinquan basically relied on his own painstaking research in the process of trial-producing welding rods. Up to now, the manufacturing principles of the various welding rods trial-produced by Comrade Li Jinquan have not been theoretically summarized and affirmed, apart from the results of the appraisal. In addition, there are some objective difficulties, such as the difficulty in buying raw materials for stainless steel welding rods on the market, which also directly affect the production of welding rods.
    The Steel Industry Administration Bureau should also bear some responsibility for not actively helping to solve the difficulties encountered by Comrade Li Jinquan in the process of manufacturing welding rods. Recently, the General Office of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry examined this issue. In order to better utilize Comrade Li Jinquan's role, we have decided to transfer him to work at the Beiman Steel Plant of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, which is under the administration's control. Since the Beiman Steel Plant is under construction and has a large number of metal structure projects, transferring Comrade Li Jinquan to the plant to organize and train welding technicians can fully utilize his potential.

### 钢铁工业局注意充分发挥李金泉的生产潜力

    钢铁工业局注意充分发挥李金泉的生产潜力
    中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局来信：去年十一月十日人民日报发表了石景山钢铁厂李金泉同志关于“为什么不让我们大量生产电焊条”的来信。对此，我们检查如下：
    李金泉同志从一九五○年开始，经过苦心钻研，陆续试制了五种电焊条。石景山钢铁厂领导方面虽然也对他进行了一些帮助，但是，由于他们片面地认为电焊条不是钢铁厂的主要产品，只考虑本厂对于电焊条的需要，而没有认识到电焊条在现代化的工业、国防工业和基本建设工程上的需要情况，因而对李金泉同志研究和生产焊条工作，没有给以充分的重视和支持。一九五一年该厂曾配备了一位工程师协助李金泉同志，后来因为总机械室缺乏技术干部就停止了对他的帮助。因此，李金泉同志在试制电焊条的过程中，基本上靠自己苦心钻研。迄今为止，李金泉同志试制的各种电焊条，除了鉴定的结果外，还没有从理论上加以总结，肯定其制造原理。此外，还有一些客观上的困难，如不锈钢焊条所需原料市场上不易买到等，也直接影响到电焊条的生产。
    对于李金泉同志制造电焊条过程中所遇到的困难，钢铁工业管理局没有主动加以帮助解决，也应负一定责任。最近，中央重工业部办公厅检查了这个问题。为了更好地发挥李金泉同志的作用，我们决定将他调局重新分配到本溪钢铁公司北满钢厂工作。因北满钢厂正在建厂，有大量金属结构工程，调李金泉同志去该厂组织和训练焊接技工，可以充分发挥他的潜力。
