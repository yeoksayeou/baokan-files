The Minsheng Shipping Company, a public-private joint venture, uses steam-powered ships with water-tube boilers for its Yangtze River routes. The Sichuan River is narrow with many shoals and rapid currents, requiring ships with high horsepower. However, due to space limitations on board, the boilers lack comprehensive water treatment equipment. River water is simply filtered and then injected into the boilers to create steam, making the boilers prone to scale buildup, especially within the water tubes. These water tubes number from over a thousand for smaller boilers to over three thousand for larger ones, and most are curved, making scale removal very difficult. Before the public-private joint venture, scale removal was done manually with scrapers during ship repairs. This not only consumed a large amount of labor and extended repair time, but also, because the scale was hard, it could not be scraped clean. Therefore, despite annual scraping and regular boiler cleaning, the scale thickness continued to increase, sometimes even exceeding the thickness of the water tubes. This resulted in extremely high fuel consumption, estimated at 17,000 tons of coal wasted annually, worth approximately 5 billion yuan. Other losses, such as the waste of seamless steel pipes due to scale buildup that was too thick to remove, increased repair costs, and prolonged repair times rendering ships inoperable, were even more staggering.

Last year, the Minsheng Shipping Company headquarters learned that a power plant in Wuhan had successfully used hydrochloric acid for boiler cleaning after learning from advanced Soviet experiences. They organized specialists to study the method and formed a working team. Hydrochloric acid boiler cleaning was subsequently tested on the "Minzheng," "Minwu," and "Meishan" vessels. The results not only completely removed the scale that had accumulated in the water tubes for years but also shortened repair time and saved labor. In the past, using the old method, it took six people forty to fifty days to clean a boiler; now, it only takes two people five to six days. After the ships were repaired, coal consumption also decreased significantly, with an average saving of 8% to 12%. At the same time, the boiler's heat transfer efficiency increased, reducing the physical labor of the crew. After summarizing the experiences of the hydrochloric acid boiler cleaning trials, Minsheng Shipping Company decided to promote it comprehensively this year and organize specialized groups to study simpler and more effective Soviet methods to prevent scale buildup.

    公私合营民生轮船公司试用盐酸洗炉成功
    民生轮船公司航行长江的轮船中，有很多艘是装置水管式锅炉，用蒸汽作动力。川江河道狭窄，滩多水急，轮船的马力大，而锅炉用水因受船上地位限制，没有装置较完善的炉水处理设备，江水经过简单过滤后就注入锅炉中化汽，因此锅炉内部易结水垢，水管中尤为严重。锅炉中水管，小的有一千多根，大的有三千根左右，管子多是弯的，清除水管中水垢十分困难。该公司公私合营以前，清除水垢是在修船时用人力来绞刮，不但耗费大量劳动力，延长了停修的时间，而且因为水垢质硬，不能绞刮干净，所以，尽管年年绞刮，定期洗炉，水垢厚度仍与日俱增，有时，水垢厚度甚至超过水管的厚度。因此，燃料的耗费极其巨大，估计每年要浪费煤炭一万七千吨，约值五十亿元；其他如因水垢过厚无法清除，每年浪费大量无缝钢管、增加修船费用与长期修理不能行驶等损失数字更为惊人。
    去年，民生轮船公司总公司听说武汉某电力厂学习苏联先进经验，用盐酸洗炉成功，即组织专人学习，成立工作队，先后在民政、民武、眉山各轮试用盐酸洗炉，结果不但使多年积存在水管中的水垢彻底清除，而且还缩短了修理时间，节省了劳动力。过去用旧法洗炉，六个人要花四、五十天，现在只要两个人花上五、六天就行了。船修好后，煤炭消耗量也显著减少，平均节省耗量百分之八至百分之十二；同时，锅炉传热效率增加，减轻了船员的体力劳动。民生轮船公司总结了试行盐酸洗炉的经验后，决定今年全面推广。并组织专门小组学习苏联更简捷有效的办法，防止结垢。
