Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 31st: Pyongyang newspapers prominently published on January 31st the full texts of statements by Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Nam Il and People's Republic of China Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the U.S. side's forcible detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The newspapers also published editorials unanimously endorsing these two statements.

    "Labor News" stated in an editorial titled "Resolutely Condemn the U.S. Side's Heinous Provocative Act": The U.S. side has once again seized our captured personnel, depriving our captured personnel of the freedom and right to return home and live peaceful lives. This is a crime against international trust and trampling on human morality that U.S. warmongers can never wash away. We, the Korean people, firmly support the statements of Foreign Minister Nam Il and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and together with all kind people in the world, denounce the United States for creating new obstacles on the road to a peaceful resolution of the Korean problem, and denounce the United States for continuing to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and maintaining the tense situation in the Far East and Asia. The Korean people firmly maintain that the U.S. side has the responsibility at all times to track down and return all Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have been forcibly detained, and to provide an explanation to the Korean and Chinese sides. This issue must also be submitted to the Korean political conference and other relevant international conferences for discussion. We will pursue this crime of the U.S. side to the end. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from its heinous provocative act.
    The editorial emphasized: The Korean people demand the prompt convening of a political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean problem, and demand the unconditional and rapid resumption of bilateral talks. At the same time, we demand that the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly reconvene as soon as possible to discuss the serious situation in Korea with the participation of representatives of the Korean and Chinese governments.
    "Democratic Korea" stated in an editorial titled "The U.S. Side's Crimes Must Be Severely Condemned": The U.S. warmongers are still attempting to delay and obstruct the convening of the political conference in order to avoid discussion of the prisoner-of-war issue and continue to maintain the tense situation in Korea, the Far East, and Asia. Therefore, the Korean people firmly demand that the United Nations General Assembly reconvene as soon as possible to discuss the current serious situation in Korea with the participation of representatives from Korea and China. The Korean people also fully support the proposal put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Berlin Conference regarding "measures to ease international tensions and convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China." At the same time, the Korean people call on the people of the world to solemnly condemn and resolutely stop the U.S. side's criminal policy of forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”和“民主朝鲜报”发表社论
    严厉斥责美方劫夺朝中战俘的挑衅行为
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】平壤各报在一月三十一日都以首要地位刊载朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日和中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来分别就美方强迫扣留朝中战俘发表的声明全文。各报并发表社论，一致拥护这两个声明。
      “劳动新闻”在题为“坚决斥责美方罪恶的挑衅行为”的社论中指出：美方再次劫夺了我方被俘人员，剥夺了我方被俘人员回家过和平生活的自由和权利。这是美国好战分子永远洗刷不掉的违背国际信义、蹂躏人类道德的罪行。我们朝鲜人民坚决支持南日外务相和周恩来外交部长的声明，和全世界所有善良的人们一道，痛斥美国在和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上制造新障碍，痛斥美国继续保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态、保持远东和亚洲的紧张局势的行动。朝鲜人民坚决主张：美方对于被强迫扣留的朝中被俘人员在任何时候都负有把他们全部追回、并向朝中方面提出交代的责任。这个问题并且必须提交朝鲜政治会议和其他有关国际会议讨论。我们对于美方的这一罪行定将追究到底。美方对于由它的这个罪恶的挑衅行为而引起的一切后果必须负完全责任。
    社论强调说：朝鲜人民要求迅速召开和平解决朝鲜问题的政治会议，要求无条件地迅速恢复双方会谈。同时，我们要求第八届联合国大会从速复会，在朝中两国政府代表的参加下，讨论朝鲜的严重局势。
    “民主朝鲜报”在题为“美方的罪行必须受到严厉斥责”的社论中指出：美国的好战分子仍在企图拖延和阻挠政治会议的召开，以躲避关于战俘问题的讨论，并继续保持朝鲜、远东和亚洲的紧张局势。因此，朝鲜人民坚决要求联合国大会迅速复会，在朝中两国代表参加下，讨论朝鲜当前的严重局势。朝鲜人民并完全支持苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫在柏林会议上提出的“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”的建议。同时，朝鲜人民吁请全世界人民严正谴责和坚决制止美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的罪恶政策。
