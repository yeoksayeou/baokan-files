Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, February 10th: According to TASS, newspapers report that Danish Minister of Commerce Lis Groes, speaking at a meeting of the Supply Committee of the Lower House on February 4th, confirmed that the Danish government is preparing to expand trade with the Soviet Union; several private enterprises will also negotiate with a delegation from the German Democratic Republic that has arrived in Denmark on the issue of increasing trade between the two countries.

Lis Groes said that the economic recession in the United States will have an impact on Europe, which will make competition among countries more intense, create more difficulties for export trade, and thus increase industrial difficulties. "National Daily" and "Land and People's Newspaper" both emphasized in their commentaries on this speech that the government is very worried that the US economic recession may seriously affect the Danish economy.

The Danish public attaches great importance to expanding trade with the Soviet Union. "News" reported that the British merchants' visit to Moscow has had a huge impact in Denmark. The question of Denmark sending a similar delegation to Moscow is under discussion. Hans Rasmussen, chairman of the Danish Forgemen's Union, published an article in the latest issue of "Metalworker" magazine discussing the recent trade agreements concluded by the Soviet Union with Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and other countries. He demanded that the government more actively expand trade with the Soviet Union and also send a delegation to Moscow.

    丹麦政府准备扩大与苏联的贸易关系
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根讯：报纸报道，丹麦商务大臣利斯·格罗斯于二月四日在下院供应委员会的会议上发言时证实，丹麦政府正准备扩大与苏联的贸易；若干私人企业也将与已到达丹麦的德意志民主共和国的一个代表团洽商增加两国间贸易的问题。
    利斯·格罗斯说，美国的经济衰退将对欧洲发生影响，这会使得各国间的竞争更加激烈，给出口贸易造成更多的困难，从而使工业困难日益增长。“国民日报”及“国土与人民报”在评论这一发言时都强调指出：政府很担心美国的经济衰退可能严重地影响到丹麦的经济。
    丹麦的公众非常重视扩大与苏联的贸易。“新闻报”报道说，英国商人访问莫斯科已经在丹麦造成了巨大的影响。丹麦派一个同样的代表团去莫斯科的问题正在讨论中。丹麦锻工工人工会主席汉斯·拉斯穆森在最近一期“五金工人”杂志上发表文章谈到苏联最近与比利时、瑞典、英国及其他国家缔结的贸易协定，他要求政府更积极地扩大与苏联的贸易，并且也派一个代表团到莫斯科去。
