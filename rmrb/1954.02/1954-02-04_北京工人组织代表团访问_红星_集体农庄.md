    Beijing Workers' Delegation Visits "Red Star" Collective Farm
   [Xinhua News Agency News] A Beijing workers' delegation organized by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions visited the "Red Star" Collective Farm in the Nanyuan District on January 31. The delegation consisted of over a hundred people, including national, North China, and Beijing industrial labor models and advanced producers. There were also doctors, teachers, and the Beijing Workers' Amateur Song and Dance Troupe and a film projection team. They were warmly welcomed by the farm members.
    On the same day, the delegation also visited the Yin Weichen Vegetable Production Cooperative in Huangtugang Township in the capital's suburbs and held a get-together with the cooperative members.
   At the reception held at the "Red Star" Collective Farm, the farm members repeatedly thanked the workers for their assistance, and the workers also thanked the farmers for their support of industry.
    During the visit, the workers' delegation presented the farm with a silk banner, which read: "Consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and strive to build our country into a great socialist state!" The delegation also presented the farm with a rocker-arm reaper. The farmers also presented the delegation with their own products - chicken eggs, chives, radishes, and a large pumpkin weighing thirty-eight pounds. During the visit, the film team screened newsreels such as "Spark Collective Farm" and "Chinese Peasants' Visit to the Soviet Union" for the farm members, and the song and dance troupe performed wonderful programs such as "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance."
     The "Red Star" Collective Farm was established in August 1952 and was the first collective farm in the suburbs of the capital. The farm's cultivated land was originally a low-lying alkaline land. Because the farm signed a contract with a nearby tractor station, eighty percent of the land was cultivated by machine, and with the use of electric pumping for irrigation, not only was the difficulty of growing grain on alkaline land overcome, but also a higher yield was obtained than that of ordinary farmers. The unit area yield of cotton on the farm was 35.5 percent higher than that of individual farmers in the vicinity, and the yield of corn was 47 percent higher.
    With the development of production, the income of the farm members has continuously increased. In 1953, the average income of a full labor force was 4.76 million yuan. The income of 31 of the 63 households in the entire farm more than doubled or tripled compared to the previous year. The increase in income has changed the economic lives of the farm members. Thirty-four farmers owed a total of 26 million yuan in debt before joining the farm. After the autumn harvest distribution, 24 households had repaid a total of 20 million yuan. Now 26 farm members' homes have electric lights installed, and almost every family has made new clothes and quilts. In the past, Gao Fenglan, a female farm member, had three people sharing one quilt. Last year, she and her husband worked 500 workdays, earning nearly 8 million yuan, and made four new quilts at once. Li Yuchuan's family also bought a new radio. The farmers, thinking of the source of their happiness, are grateful to Chairman Mao for pointing out the correct socialist path for them, and also thank the worker brothers for giving them strong support. This year, the "Red Star" Collective Farm has absorbed more than 460 households from the Qi Donghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yilezhuang Township, the Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yinghaizhuang, and some mutual aid teams. Now the farm has more than 530 households. The farm members described the development prospects of the farm to the visiting workers. They pointed out that in the future, the farm will gradually be changed into a farm that manages vegetables, fruits, and meat. In a few years, there will be a large vineyard, thousands of acres of vegetable gardens, and herds of poultry and livestock.

    北京工人组织代表团访问“红星”集体农庄
   【新华社讯】北京市总工会组织的北京市工人访问农村代表团，在一月三十一日到南苑区访问“红星”集体农庄。代表团共有百余人，其中有全国和华北区、北京市的工业劳动模范和先进生产者。还有医生、教师以及北京市工人业余歌舞团和电影放映队。他们受到庄员们的热烈欢迎。
    同日，这个代表团还访问了首都郊区黄土岗乡殷维臣蔬菜生产合作社，并和社员们进行联欢。
   在“红星”集体农庄举行的招待会上，庄员们一再感谢工人对他们的援助，工人也感谢农民对工业的支援。
    工人代表团在访问期间赠给农庄一面锦旗，旗上写着：“巩固工农联盟，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争！”代表团还送给农庄一台摇臂式收割机。农民们也把自己生产的产品——鸡子、韭菜、萝卜和三十八斤重的一个大南瓜，送给了代表团。在访问中，电影队为农庄庄员放映了“星火集体农庄”、“中国农民访苏经过”等新闻记录影片，歌舞团表演了“采茶扑蝶舞”等精彩节目。
     “红星”集体农庄是在一九五二年八月成立的首都郊区第一个集体农庄。农庄的耕地原是一片低洼的碱地。由于农庄和附近的拖拉机站订了合同，百分之八十的土地采用机器耕作，加上使用了电力抽水灌溉，不仅克服碱地谷物生长的困难，而且获得比一般农户更高的产量。农庄棉花的单位面积产量比附近单干农民产量高出百分之三十五点五，玉米高出百分之四十七。
    生产发展了，庄员的收入就不断提高。一九五三年一个整劳动力平均收入四百七十六万元。全农庄六十三户中有三十一户的收入超过前年的一倍至三倍以上。收入的增加改变了庄员们经济生活的面貌。有三十四户农民在入庄前共借债二千六百万元，在秋收分配后，已有二十四户共还清了二千万元。现在已有二十六户庄员的家里安装了电灯，几乎每家都做了新衣新被。女庄员高凤兰家里，往年三个人一条被子，去年她夫妇做了五百个劳动日，收入近八百万元，一次就制了四床新被。李玉川家还新买了一架收音机。农民们饮水思源，都感激毛主席给他们指引了社会主义的正确道路，也感谢工人兄弟给了他们有力的支援。“红星”集体农庄今年已吸收了怡乐庄乡的齐东海农业生产合作社、瀛海庄的农业生产合作社和有些互助组等四百六十多户加入了农庄。现在农庄共有五百三十多户。庄员们对访问的工人描绘了这个农庄的发展远景。他们指出，今后农庄要逐步改变为经营蔬菜、水果和肉类的农庄，几年以后，这里将出现一大片葡萄园，上千亩的蔬菜园地，成群的家禽和家畜。
