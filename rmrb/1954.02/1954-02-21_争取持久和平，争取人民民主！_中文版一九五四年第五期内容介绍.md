The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, 1954, Issue 5, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "People's Democratic Countries Vigorously Strengthen the Worker-Peasant Alliance." The editorial points out that the worker-peasant alliance is an indispensable condition and guarantee for the victorious advance of people's democratic countries. The worker-peasant alliance, led by the working class, is the indestructible foundation of the people's democratic system. The Communist and Workers' Parties of these countries extensively utilize the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and their own experience to tirelessly strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. In their struggle to implement planned economy and lay the foundation for a socialist economy, the role and significance of the worker-peasant alliance is becoming increasingly clear; the assistance of the city to the countryside has increased, and the city's role in guiding the countryside towards socialist development has grown. On the one hand, the Party vigorously supports agricultural producers' cooperatives, using various methods to strengthen and develop them, and at the same time is taking important measures to encourage individual peasants, encouraging poor and middle peasants to increase production. In order to further develop agriculture, people's democratic countries are constantly supplying the countryside with tractors and other agricultural machinery. The editorial concludes by saying that the achievements of the people's democratic countries in laying the foundation for socialism vividly prove that the Marxist-Leninist argument that industrial workers and working peasants have common interests in all major issues is completely correct.

This issue publishes the full text of Molotov's speech at the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Conference on January 25, and an article by S. Indrihovsky, a member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, entitled "People's Democratic Countries' Concern for the Welfare of Working People."

Indrihovsky's article points out that in recent years, the national economies of the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe have been developing at an accelerated pace, especially in heavy industry. In the process of implementing socialist industrialization plans, these countries have also consolidated their national defense forces and improved the people's welfare and cultural standards. However, in these countries, there has also been an imbalance in the development speed of industry and agriculture. Therefore, the task of ensuring a rapid improvement in the living standards of urban and rural working people has become the foundation of the economic policies of the Communist and Workers' Parties and governments of various people's democratic countries. And increasing agricultural production is the main link in achieving this task. In the various people's democratic countries, the state has given greater assistance to working peasants by increasing the supply of agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, building materials, and farm implements. They have decided to greatly increase agricultural output in the next few years, develop all sectors of agricultural production, and are formulating specific measures according to this goal. In addition to striving to increase agricultural production, people's democratic countries are also working to increase the output of daily necessities, build more houses, and develop urban transportation and social and cultural construction undertakings. These plans to rapidly improve the welfare of working people and raise their cultural standards once again prove the superiority of socialism over capitalism.

This issue also contains an article entitled "The Djilas 'Incident' and the Current Situation in Yugoslavia." The article analyzes how the recent articles published by Djilas, the secretary of the Central Committee of the so-called "League of Communists of Yugoslavia," the speaker of the National Assembly, and the vice president of Yugoslavia, revealed the reactionary aims of the Tito fascist clique in Yugoslavia. The article exposes the truth that the Yugoslav rulers decided to exclude Djilas from the Central Committee and deprive him of all his positions in the "League of Communists." The article emphasizes that the Djilas "incident" first proves that the Yugoslav ruling group has encountered a serious internal crisis. This crisis is inseparable from the disintegration process of Tito's "League of Communists." And the whole process is a direct result of the widespread dissatisfaction of the broad masses of people with the Yugoslav rulers' traitorous policies. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第五期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五四年第五期已经出版。
    本期以“人民民主国家大力加强工农联盟”为题发表社论。社论指出：工农联盟是人民民主国家胜利前进的不可缺少的条件和保证。以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟是人民民主制度的不可摧毁的基础。这些国家的共产党和工人党广泛地利用苏联共产党的经验和自己的经验，不懈地加强工农联盟。在它们执行计划经济和奠定社会主义经济基础的斗争过程中，工农联盟的作用和意义是越来越明显了；城市给农村的帮助增加了，城市引导农村向社会主义发展的作用增长了。党一方面大力支持农业生产合作社，用各种办法加强和发展农业生产合作社，同时正在采取重要的措施来鼓励个体农民，鼓励贫农和中农增加生产。为了进一步发展农业，人民民主国家不断地以拖拉机和其他农业机器供给农村。社论最后说：人民民主国家在奠定社会主义基础方面的成就生动地证明：产业工人和劳动农民在一切重大问题上有着共同的利害关系这一马克思列宁主义论点是完全正确的。
    本期刊载了莫洛托夫一月二十五日在柏林四国外长会议上的发言全文，和波兰统一工人党中央委员斯·英德里霍夫斯基的题为“人民民主国家对劳动人民福利的关怀”的文章。
    英德里霍夫斯基的文章指出：近几年来，东欧人民民主国家的国民经济在加速度地发展，特别是在重工业方面。这些国家在实现社会主义工业化计划的过程中，也巩固了国防力量，提高了人民的福利和文化水平。但是，在这些国家里，同时也出现了工业发展和农业发展速度不平衡的现象。因此，保证迅速提高城乡劳动人民的生活水平这一任务，就成为各人民民主国家的共产党、工人党和政府的经济政策的基础。而提高农业生产则是实现这一任务的主要环节。在各人民民主国家中，国家用增加供应农业机器、化学肥料、建筑材料和农具的办法给了劳动农民更大的帮助。它们已经决定在今后短短几年中大大增加农业产量，发展农业生产的各个部门，而且都在按照这一目标制订具体的措施。人民民主国家除了努力提高农业生产之外，还在努力提高日用品的产量，兴建更多的房屋，发展城市交通和社会文化建设事业。这些迅速增进劳动人民的福利和提高他们的文化水平的计划，又一次证明社会主义比资本主义优越。
    本期还刊载了一篇题为“德热拉斯‘事件’和南斯拉夫的现状”的文章。文章分析了所谓“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟”中央委员会书记、国民议会议长、南斯拉夫副总统德热拉斯最近发表的文章泄露南斯拉夫铁托法西斯集团的反动目的的情况。文章揭露了南斯拉夫统治者决定把德热拉斯从中央委员会排除出去，并剥夺他在“共产主义者联盟”中的一切职位的真象。文章着重说：德热拉斯“事件”首先证明了：南斯拉夫统治集团遇到了严重的内部危机。这种危机是和铁托的“共产主义者联盟”的瓦解过程分不开的。而整个过程则是广大人民群众对于南斯拉夫统治者的卖国政策日益不满的直接结果。（新华社）
