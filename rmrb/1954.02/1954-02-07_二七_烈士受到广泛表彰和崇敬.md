Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th: The martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the "February 7th" Great Strike have been commended and revered by the People's Government and the broad masses of the people. The lives of the martyrs' families have been well taken care of, and some old workers who actively participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike in those years have also been respected by the people.

Every year around the "February 7th" anniversary or Qingming Festival, many people go to the tombs of the "February 7th" martyrs to pay their respects. Since liberation, at the tomb of Lin Xiangqian in Zhenfeng Mountain, Minhou County, Fujian Province, and the tomb of Shi Yang in Hongshan, Wuchang, local Party and government leading organs and representatives of people from all walks of life have specially held grand memorial ceremonies. In order to commend the martyr Lin Xiangqian, the People's Government of Minhou County, the martyr Lin Xiangqian's hometown, presented the martyr Lin Xiangqian's family with a large horizontal plaque with the four characters "Revolutionary Martyr" on the "February 7th" anniversary in 1952. This plaque hangs in the main hall of the martyr's former residence in Shanggan Town, Minhou County. In Zhengzhou, the source of the "February 7th" Great Strike, the Municipal People's Government, in order to commemorate the two martyrs Wang Shengyou (President of the Zhengzhou Branch of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Trade Union) and Si Wende (General Representative of Workers of the Zhengzhou Works Department of the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways), leaders of the Zhengzhou railway workers during the "February 7th" era, has transformed the Changchun Bridge area in Zhengzhou, where the two martyrs were killed, into "February 7th" Square. The center of the square is planted with evergreen shrubs and various flowers, and the original Changchun Road has been renamed "February 7th" Road. At the same time, the Zhengzhou Railway Administration and the Zhengzhou District Committee of the China Railway Trade Union have erected monuments at the tomb of martyr Wang Shengyou in Chaoxian County, Anhui Province, and the tomb of martyr Si Wende in Tangyin County, Henan Province, respectively, in order to commend the two martyrs Wang Shengyou and Si Wende.

The people's governments and the administrative and trade union departments of the railway system at all levels have given great concern to the lives of the family members of the "February 7th" martyrs. Those family members of the martyrs who have the ability to work have been introduced to various jobs. Some family members of martyrs who have lost their ability to work due to old age and have no one to take care of them have been provided with living expenses by the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union since December 1951. These family members of martyrs include Shi Yang's mother, Lin Xiangqian's wife, and Zeng Yuliang's wife (deputy head of the Jiang'an Workers' Picket during the "February 7th" strike), among others, totaling nine people.

The old workers who actively fought against the imperialist lackeys and feudal warlords in the "February 7th" era have been respected and loved by the broad masses of the people since liberation. Many of them are often invited by the young workers or the Communist Youth League organizations in the factories to give reports. In recent years, many old workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike have been sent to scenic spots such as West Lake for recuperation or treatment. Some old workers who have persisted in revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party for a long time after the "February 7th" strike have been even more loved by the broad masses of the people and valued by the Communist Party. For example, Liang Yongfu, the current Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, Li Zhengang, Director of the Supervision Office of the Beijing Railway Administration, and Lin Maoxiang, Minister of the Living Quarters and Labor Insurance Department of the Zhengzhou District Committee of the China Railway Trade Union, are all veterans of the "February 7th" Great Strike worker movement.

    “二七”烈士受到广泛表彰和崇敬
    【新华社郑州五日电】在“二七”大罢工中英勇牺牲的烈士们受到了人民政府和广大群众的表彰和崇敬。烈士家属的生活已得到妥善的照顾，有些在当年积极参加“二七”大罢工的老工人也受到人民群众的敬重。
    每年“二七”纪念日或清明节前后，都有许多人前往“二七”烈士们的墓地祭奠凭吊。解放以后，在福建省闽侯县枕峰山麓的林祥谦烈士墓和武昌洪山的施洋烈士墓地，当地党政领导机关和各界人民代表都曾专门举行过隆重的祭礼。林祥谦烈士故乡闽侯县人民政府为了表彰林祥谦烈士，在一九五二年“二七”纪念日，曾送给林祥谦烈士家中一个写着“革命先烈”四字的大横匾。这个匾挂在闽侯县尚干镇烈士故居的正厅。在“二七”大罢工策源地的郑州，市人民政府为了纪念“二七”时代的郑州铁路工人领袖汪胜友（京汉铁路总工会郑州分会会长）、司文德（京汉陇海两路郑州工务处工人总代表）二烈士，已把二烈士遇难的郑州长春桥地方辟建为“二七”广场，广场中心遍植常青灌木和各种鲜花，原来的长春路已改名为“二七”路。同时，郑州铁路管理局和中国铁路工会郑州区委员会为了表彰汪胜友、司文德二烈士，已分别在安徽省巢县的汪胜友烈士墓地和河南省汤阴县的司文德烈士墓地树立了纪念碑。
    各地人民政府和铁路系统行政、工会部门对于“二七”烈士遗属的生活都给予极大的关怀。烈士家属中凡是有工作能力的人，都已分别介绍参加各种工作。有些因年老失去工作能力又无人照养的烈士家属，则已从一九五一年十二月开始全部由中国铁路工会全国委员会负责供给他们生活费用。这些烈士家属中有施洋烈士的母亲、林祥谦烈士的妻子、曾玉良烈士（“二七”罢工时的江岸工人纠察团副团长）的妻子等九人。
    在“二七”时代积极与帝国主义走狗封建军阀作斗争的老工人，在解放后受到广大人民群众的尊敬和爱护。他们之中有许多人常常被工厂里的青年工人或青年团的组织邀请去作报告。几年来，有不少参加“二七”罢工的老工人被送到西湖等名胜地方去休养或疗养。有些在“二七”罢工后长期在共产党领导下坚持革命斗争的老工人，更受到广大群众的爱戴和共产党的器重，例如现任中国铁路工会全国委员会副主席梁永福、北京铁路管理局监察室主任李震刚、中国铁路工会郑州区委员会生活住宅及劳动保险部部长林茂湘等人，都是参加“二七”大罢工的工人运动的老前辈。
