People in Cities Like Xi'an, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou
Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Economic Construction Bonds

    People from all walks of life in Xi'an, Chongqing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou are enthusiastically subscribing to national economic construction bonds. Among them, Xi'an and Chongqing have exceeded their expected subscription targets.
    Xi'an started subscriptions on January 14th. By the 28th, the city's total bond subscriptions reached 58.001 billion yuan, exceeding the original planned sales target by 83%. Among these, workers and shop employees' subscriptions exceeded the original planned target by 105.2%; subscriptions from government cadres exceeded the original planned sales target by over 283%; suburban farmers' subscriptions exceeded the original planned sales target by over 101%; subscriptions from private industrialists and merchants also exceeded the original planned sales target by over 25%; city residents' subscriptions were also very enthusiastic. According to incomplete statistics, over 1 billion yuan has already been paid. Chongqing basically concluded its national economic construction bond subscription work by January 30th. The city's total subscriptions exceeded the original plan by 49%. In Wuhan, many factory and enterprise employees are enthusiastically subscribing to national economic construction bonds. According to incomplete statistics, units such as the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau, the Hankou Railway Transportation Branch Bureau, the Wuchang Ferry Section, and the Wuhan Power Machinery Factory have already proposed their bond subscription amounts. The work of subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds is being widely carried out in Guangzhou. Cadres of the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government Finance Bureau launched a surge in bond subscriptions on January 29th, exceeding the original target by 2.59 times within two hours.
    In the bond subscription process, the people of all regions demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and enthusiastically subscribed. He Fugen, a worker from the Second Winter Training Brigade of the Northwest Construction Engineering Company in Xi'an, subscribed to 2.5 million yuan on his own. He said, "My family used to live a very hard life. After liberation, all five members of my family have jobs, and our lives are very good. To live an even better life, I want to buy bonds to support national construction." Hong Yingxu, an employee of the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau, used the 1.2 million yuan he had saved to buy an accordion to buy bonds. Gong Wenxiu, a model worker at the Wuhan Fuxin Flour Mill, discussed with his wife and formulated a family savings plan, subscribing to 2 million yuan in bonds. Suburban farmers in various regions also showed great enthusiasm for subscribing to bonds. After visiting various factories and enterprises and receiving education on the worker-peasant alliance, many farmers realized the benefits of industrialization for the country and for themselves, and they competed to subscribe, with general subscription figures exceeding the expected figures.
    In regions where the subscription work has basically ended, the work of organizing and mobilizing payments is now underway; in regions where the subscription work has not yet ended, subscriptions are still being enthusiastically made.

    西安、重庆、武汉和广州等市人民
    热烈认购国家经济建设公债
    西安、重庆、武汉和广州等城市各界人民踊跃认购国家经济建设公债。其中西安、重庆两市已超额完成预计认购数字。
    西安市从一月十四日开始认购，到二十八日止，全市认购公债数字已达五百八十亿零一千多万元，超过原计划推销数字的百分之八十三。其中工人店员认购数字超过原计划数字的百分之一百零五点二；机关干部认购数字超过原计划推销数字的百分之二百八十三以上；郊区农民认购数字超过原计划推销数字的百分之一百零一以上；私营工商业者认购的数字也超过原计划推销数字的百分之二十五以上；市内居民认购也很踊跃，据不完全统计，已缴的公债款，有十亿多元。重庆市截至一月三十日止已基本结束认购国家经济建设公债工作，全市认购数字超过原计划百分之四十九。武汉市许多工厂企业职工踊跃地认购国家经济建设公债，据不完全统计，目前已有武汉冶电业局、汉口铁路运输分局机关、武昌轮渡段、武汉动力机厂等单位提出了认购公债的数字。广州市认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债工作正广泛展开。广州市人民政府财政局干部在一月二十九日展开了认购公债的热潮，两小时内超额完成原预定数字二点五九倍。
    在认购公债中，各地人民发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，踊跃认购。西安市西北建筑工程公司第二冬训大队工人何富根，一个人就认购了二百五十万元。他说：“过去我家里生活很苦，解放后，我家五口人都有了工作，生活过得很好，为了过更美好的生活，我要买公债，支援国家建设。”武汉电信局职工洪瀛绪把积存买手风琴的一百二十万元买了公债。武汉市福新面粉厂劳动模范龚文秀和爱人商量后，订出了家庭节约计划，认购了两百万元公债。各地郊区农民认购公债的热情也很高。许多农民在参观了各工厂企业受到工农联盟教育后，认识到了工业化对国家以及对农民自己的好处，都争相认购，一般认购数字都超过了预计数字。
    在认购工作基本结束的地区，现正组织动员缴款工作；尚未结束认购工作的地区，仍在热烈认购中。
