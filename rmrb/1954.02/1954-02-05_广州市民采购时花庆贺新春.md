    广州市民采购时花庆贺新春
    据新华社讯：春节期间的广州市正临着草木葱茏、百花齐放的季节。成千上万的市民们正川流不息地到花市去采购时花庆贺新春。春节赶花市是广州市人民所习惯的由来已久的风俗。今年摆设花市的地点也和历年那样：一个是在西开浆栏路、长乐路、杨巷路、抗日东路、十三行等道路交叉地带，另一个是在永汉北路。这一带在今年春节中要停止车辆通行两天，各条道路上都安装了扩音器，由专人播音介绍各种花卉陈列的地点，指导游人参观。花市里，应时的花卉排成锦绣的行列。那里最多的是桃花、梅花和吊钟花，有三四尺高的，也有一两丈高的。还有菊花、芍药、鸡冠花、剑兰花等，这些花枝中有供插瓶用的，也有盆栽的。从福建运来栽培的水仙花，和只有一两尺高却结满累累果实的金橘、桔、柑等盆栽，是专门为了春节而上市的。此外，牡丹、玫瑰、桂花、茶花等艳丽而幽香的盆栽，也在花市出现。
