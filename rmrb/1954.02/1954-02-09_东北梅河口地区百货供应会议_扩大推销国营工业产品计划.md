    Northeast Meihekou Area Department Store Supply Conference
    Plan to Expand Sales of State-Owned Industrial Products
    The Meihekou Area Department Store Wholesale Station of the China National General Merchandise Company, Liaodong Province, convened a first-quarter department store supply conference in January. Participants included the heads of department stores and shops in the thirteen cities and counties within the supply area. The success of this conference not only solved the problem of the source of goods for state-owned commerce in various cities and counties within the supply area for the first quarter, but also solved the problem of expanding sales of some new state-owned industrial products.
    At the meeting, some people pointed out the changes in the market for Northeast state-owned industrial products in their speeches: some products, due to the continuous improvement of quality, have been selling well in the vast rural and urban areas. For example, Qinghua gabardine, various colored fine cloth, and fancy serge printed and dyed by the Xiong Yue Printing and Dyeing Factory, as well as "New China," "New Youth," and "Flying Sky" brand soaps, various towels, socks, and sneakers produced by state-owned factories have established a reputation among consumers. These new circumstances broke the mindset of some requisitioning units that they were unwilling to promote state-owned industrial products and only wanted "name-brand goods," and gave the attendees a new understanding of the significance of actively promoting state-owned industrial products. In addition to actively replenishing order plans for various state-owned industrial products at the meeting, many suggestions were also made on the quality, specifications, and styles of certain products from the production departments. For example, everyone reflected that the 2.4-foot popular printed pillowcases were too large and should be smaller; processed leather shoes should be boxed to avoid deformation, etc. These opinions are of great significance for improving production and meeting consumer needs. A total of 1,124 kinds of commodities were traded at the meeting, and 60 supply contracts were signed, an increase of 57% compared with the same period last year.
    In order to effectively meet the needs of various cities and counties, the Meihekou Area Department Store Wholesale Station has already started to add to its purchase plan after this meeting, and is preparing to send people to various places to actively organize sources of goods; for seasonal materials originally ordered from the factories, it has been decided to take measures to purchase goods in advance according to the needs of various cities and counties to ensure timely supply.

    东北梅河口地区百货供应会议
    扩大推销国营工业产品计划
    中国百货公司辽东省梅河口地区百货批发站，一月份召开了第一季度百货供应会议，参加会议的有供应区内十三个市县百货公司、商店的负责人。这次会议的成效，不仅解决了供应区内各市县国营商业第一季度的货源问题，也解决了一些国营工业新产品的扩大推销问题。
    会上，有些人在发言中指出了东北国营工业产品在市场上的变化情况：某些产品由于质量的不断提高，已畅销于广大农村和城市。如熊岳印染厂印染的青华达呢、各种色细布、花哔叽和国营工厂生产的“新中国”“新青年”“飞天”等牌香皂以及各种毛巾、袜子、球鞋等，都已在消费者中树立了信誉。这些新情况，打破了各要货单位那种不愿推销国营工业产品只愿要“名牌货”的思想，使得到会人员对积极推销国营工业产品的意义也有了新的认识。在会议上大家除了积极补订各种国营工业产品的要货计划以外，对生产部门的某些产品的质量、规格、式样也提出很多改进的意见。如大家反映：二尺四寸的大众印花枕套太大，应该再小一点；加工的皮鞋应用匣装，免得走样等。这些意见对改进生产与满足消费者需要，都有很大的作用。会上成交商品达一千一百二十四种，共签订供应合同六十份，较去年同时期提高百分之五十七。
    为了切实满足各市县的需要，梅河口地区百货批发站在这次会议以后，就已着手追加进货计划，并准备派人分赴各地积极组织货源；对原与厂方订购的季节物资，决定根据各市县的需要采取提前进货办法，以保证及时供应。
