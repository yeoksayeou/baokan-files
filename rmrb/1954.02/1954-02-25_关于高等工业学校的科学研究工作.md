On Scientific Research Work in Higher Industrial Schools
Qian Weichang, Dean of Studies, Tsinghua University

Scientific research work in higher industrial schools has a dual significance: on the one hand, we can use it to conduct the most rigorous self-transformation, enrich scientific and technological knowledge, thereby enriching teaching materials and improving teaching quality; on the other hand, we can also help the country's production and construction departments solve scientific and technological problems and continuously improve productivity. Although scientific research work in our country's higher industrial schools is still in its infancy, if we give it appropriate attention, it will gradually develop and play a huge role in the country's socialist industrialization and in the transformation and improvement of higher industrial education.

Today, when the motherland is implementing socialist industrialization, scientific research work in higher industrial schools has extremely rich topics. Workers are constantly providing valuable experience from production practice, and those of us engaged in scientific and technological work have many opportunities to combine scientific work with production practice, to investigate and study this practical process, to understand it, to summarize it, to promote it, and to enrich scientific theory. For example, Ye Kaiyuan, a graduate student of the Mechanics Teaching and Research Group of Tsinghua University, conducted research on Zheng Xikun's "Off-Axis, 500-Kilometer Operation Method" in 1952 (the paper was published in "Science Bulletin" Vol. 3, No. 10), which is a good example. Another example is Chen Zhida, a graduate student of the Mechanics Teaching and Research Group of Tsinghua University. After an internship at the rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in 1951, he put forward specific suggestions for anti-circumferential discs and carried out appropriate theoretical analysis (the paper was published in "Science of China" in 1952). His suggestions and Zhang Mingshan's later creation of anti-circumferential discs were the same in principle. For example, Gu Qiulin, a graduate student of the Mechanics Teaching and Research Group of Tsinghua University, creatively solved the theoretical calculation problem of screw-joined replicated beams in answering the design problem of installing the bottom plate beam of heavy-duty trucks for a car repair factory in Nanjing, which improved the theory of replicated beams.

In the first Five-Year Plan, the 141 large-scale projects that the Soviet Union helped us build and renovate contain a large number of scientific and technological problems, inspiring us to carry out scientific research work. At present, there are still many problems in how to apply Soviet advanced technology to China's specific conditions, which also requires us to work hard to study. For example, Associate Professor Zhang Changling and others from the Engineering Technology Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Architecture of Tsinghua University studied the problem of "how to apply Soviet architectural technology to Chinese national-style buildings" last year. Their technical research on Soviet herringbone roof trusses and the motherland's national-style roofs will play a significant role in further research on Chinese architecture.

Scientific research work combined with production practice can best enrich scientific theory, because any valuable scientific theory is a summary of social practice. Some people believe that only by participating in actual work in factories or workshops can we achieve the combination of theory and practice. Given that our scientific research work used to have a serious tendency to deviate from reality, emphasizing contact with the front line is completely necessary, and we must also work hard in this area; however, we should also note that simply going to work in factories or workshops does not necessarily achieve the effect of combining theory and practice. Only by scientifically studying and summarizing practice, analyzing all aspects of the objective practical process, raising it to the level of scientific theory, deepening the known theory, and further proposing new theories and pointing out the direction of new practice, can we truly eliminate the danger of theory being divorced from reality.

There is no doubt that scientific research work mainly absorbs topics from production practice. However, if we stay at summarizing individual production practice problems, then our scientific theory will be a large pile of unrelated or disorganized things. Therefore, those of us engaged in scientific research work have a responsibility to study the internal connections of these individual theories, clarify their system, and gradually unify these theories, gradually raising scientific theory to a higher level. It is of great significance for teachers in higher industrial schools to engage in such scientific research work. Because the development level of each science directly affects the quality of teaching of that science. Therefore, the main means to improve teaching quality is to fully develop science and fully develop scientific research work. For example, Professor Zhao Fangxiong, director of the Mathematics Teaching and Research Group of Tsinghua University, conducted research on the "Slope Method for Solving Simultaneous Algebraic Equations" (paper published in "Acta Mathematica Sinica" in 1953), which will have a significant impact on the quality of teaching of a science such as structural mechanics, because structural mechanics requires solving a large number of simultaneous equations everywhere, and the numerical solutions we used to use were often very complicated, while the slope method has significant advantages in this regard.

Teachers engaging in such scientific research work requires a large amount of scientific and technological literature and data. This literature and data is generally the scientific works of previous scientific workers, as well as scientific journals from our country, the Soviet Union, and countries around the world. From these works and journals, we can select literature and data related to our field of science and absorb the experience, creations, and theoretical analysis of predecessors and contemporary scientists on a certain issue. Therefore, it is very important to collect a large amount of scientific and technological literature and data (mainly scientific and technological journals) in the libraries of higher industrial schools for teachers' reference and application. However, at present, the collection, organization, and management of scientific and technological journals and related literature and data in higher industrial schools are far behind the needs.

Teachers can supplement new teaching materials, or even compile new textbooks for specialized courses, through these scientific research work. Such research work will obviously have direct benefits for teaching. However, through these research work, teachers can not only supplement new teaching materials, but also have a clearer understanding of the development of their field of science, as if they themselves had participated in the creation and development of this science; in this way, teachers can more deeply master and expand the knowledge of their major, gain experience in scientific work, become familiar with the techniques for analyzing many problems in their major, and apply them to their own research work.

At present, there are still many professional course textbooks that are completely unavailable in higher industrial schools, and even if they are available, some of them are still just piles of data. For example, general machine manufacturing majors have such a situation. If we want to improve the teaching quality of these courses, we still need to carry out a lot of scientific research work in this area.

The fundamental difference between teaching in higher education institutions and teaching in secondary schools is that in higher education institutions, we must not only impart knowledge of specialized sciences, but more importantly, cultivate students' ability to independently solve professional scientific problems. Because higher education institutions want to train students to become various experts and engineers who can independently handle production problems that arise in various unique production environments. But if teachers themselves have no experience in independently solving scientific problems, how can they successfully complete the task of cultivating students' independent working ability? Therefore, scientific research work has become an indispensable labor for teachers in higher education institutions.

Since scientific research work is so important in higher industrial schools, why has it not been carried out for a long time? There are many reasons. First of all, in the old China's engineering colleges, the semi-colonial nature of industrial production under the reactionary rule did not require any scientific research, and since liberation, schools have been busy with teaching reforms and have not paid much attention to promoting it. Secondly, due to our lack of experience in scientific research work, there are various misunderstandings about scientific research work. Some people see that the few people engaged in scientific research work before liberation could only do scientific research in mathematics because there was no possibility of connecting with production at that time, and there were no working conditions such as laboratories. So, they mistakenly believe that engaging in scientific research work must have a high level of mathematical foundation. If their mathematical foundation is poor, they hesitate to engage in scientific research work. In fact, mathematics is only one of the tools for scientific research work; in addition to mathematics, there are many other tools that can be used for scientific research work. Some people also regard teaching and research work as opposites, "Teach the book well first, and then talk about scientific research." In fact, teaching and research work are mutually causal. Of course, there is a basic condition here, that is, teachers must have a preliminary understanding of the teaching materials, or even have taught them once; but in any case, to further improve teaching quality, simply studying the teaching materials to death is not enough, and only through scientific research work can we gradually achieve the goal. Especially in some professional teaching and research groups, some professional courses do not have any written teaching materials, and even the Soviet Union does not have them now; therefore, we must read scientific literature and data, analyze and research, and compile teaching materials. This is the beginning of scientific research work. But some people feel that the current teaching tasks are very heavy and there is no time. Therefore, they feel that unless the teaching work is reduced, it is impossible to carry out any research work. This idea is also incorrect. Teaching tasks are the main task of teachers, and the purpose of engaging in scientific research for teachers in higher industrial schools is to improve teaching quality. Therefore, we should not abandon the root and pursue the tip, reducing teaching tasks in order to carry out scientific research work. But we cannot refuse to engage in scientific research work because of the lack of time. We can only say that if there is very little time, we do not have to propose large and heavy research tasks; or, under the heavy teaching tasks, we should still carry out scientific research work, but we can set the topic smaller and the time limit longer. Some people also believe that since the primary task of teachers in schools is teaching, they should devote all their time to students. In fact, this is not entirely correct. Of course, we are against the kind of teaching attitude that is indifferent to students, but our teaching work is based on scientific research work. Therefore, it is also wrong for teachers to be indifferent to improving their scientific level; because this is bound to affect the improvement of teaching quality and cannot meet the ever-increasing learning requirements of students.

Marx wrote in the preface and postscript to the French translation of "Das Kapital": "There is no smooth road in science, only those who are not afraid of hard work in climbing the rugged path have the hope of reaching the brilliant peak." Therefore, we must point out that emphasizing difficulties and emphasizing conditions are both contrary to the fundamental principles of scientific work. Scientific research work itself requires creating conditions and overcoming difficulties in order to continuously develop.

Of course, we do not deny that at present, the teaching tasks of teachers in higher industrial schools are still quite heavy (such as some courses that they are not yet able to offer, and course design and graduation thesis design are generally not grasped due to lack of experience, etc.), but if we recognize that scientific research work is helpful for courses that cannot be offered and designs that cannot be made; if we regard collecting data, systematizing it, and compiling it into teaching materials as a part of scientific research work, then, except for teachers whose teaching tasks are indeed too heavy, and young teachers who still need to make up for basic knowledge through further study, other teachers generally have the conditions to carry out scientific research work. Especially in the current teaching situation, we have a not very small number of teachers who have largely mastered the teaching materials and have certain teaching experience. It is entirely possible for them to carry out scientific research work with different requirements to varying degrees. Of course, it must still be pointed out that no matter what the conditions, our attitude towards scientific research work must be realistic and do what we can.

Therefore, although scientific research work in higher industrial schools is still in its infancy, it will inevitably gradually develop under the encouragement and support from top to bottom. For the industrial construction of the motherland, for the higher industrial education of the motherland, and also for the scientific cause of the motherland, the vast majority of our teachers will inevitably work hard to engage in research work. But we also know that this is a very arduous task, and only by moving forward steadily and not being afraid of difficulties can we achieve the due effect.

Finally, we must point out that Marxism-Leninism is the only correct scientific foundation and ideological weapon. Only by continuously improving teachers' theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism and continuously learning the Marxist method of studying problems can we gradually improve the level of scientific research work; otherwise, we cannot confidently draw correct conclusions in scientific research work, and of course, our scientific work level cannot be improved. But this does not mean that we must first learn Marxism-Leninism well before we can carry out scientific research work. This view of separating theoretical study and scientific research work, or mechanically dividing them into before and after, is also incorrect. We should understand the spirit of Marxism-Leninism through specific scientific research work, and at the same time, constantly use Marxism-Leninism to measure and criticize our scientific work. Only in this way can we improve and deepen our understanding of Marxism-Leninism.

    关于高等工业学校的科学研究工作
    清华大学教务长　钱伟长
    高等工业学校的科学研究工作，有着双重的意义：一方面，我们可以借此进行最严格的自我改造，丰富科学技术知识，从而丰富教材，提高教学质量；另一方面，也可以帮助国家的生产建设部门解决科学技术方面的问题，不断地提高生产力。虽然，在目前我国高等工业学校的科学研究工作还处在萌芽时期，但假如我们给它以适当的注意，那它便将逐渐发展，在国家社会主义工业化的事业中，在高等工业教育的改造和提高过程中，发生巨大的作用。
    在祖国正实行社会主义工业化的今日，高等工业学校的科学研究工作有着极其丰富的题材。工人不断地从生产实践中提供着宝贵的经验，我们从事科学技术工作的人，就有不少的机会把科学工作和生产实践结合起来，考察和研究这种实践过程，理解它，总结它，推动它；并使科学理论更加丰富起来。如一九五二年清华大学力学教研组研究生叶开沅对于郑锡坤“超轴、五百公里作业法”的研究
  （论文载“科学通报”第三卷第十期），就是一个很好的例子。又如一九五一年清华大学力学教研组研究生陈志达，在鞍山钢铁公司轧钢厂实习后，曾提出了反围盘的具体建议，并进行了适当的理论分析（论文载一九五二年“中国科学”），他的建议和后来张明山的反围盘的创造在原则上是相同的。又如，清华大学力学教研组研究生顾璆琳在解答南京某汽车修配厂关于装制载重汽车底板的大梁设计问题中，创造地解决了螺钉结合复制梁的理论计算问题，这就把复制梁的理论提高了一步。
    在第一个五年计划内，苏联帮助我们新建和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程中，有着大量的科学技术问题，启示着我们来进行科学研究工作。目前，怎样把苏联的先进技术运用到我国的具体条件下，还存在着很多问题，这也需要我们去努力研究。例如，清华大学建筑系工程技术教研组张昌龄副教授等，曾在去年研究了“怎样把苏联的建筑技术运用到我国民族型式的建筑上来”的问题，他们关于苏联人字屋架和祖国民族型式的屋顶的技术研究，对于进一步研究中国建筑将发生很大的作用。
    结合生产实践的科学研究工作，最能使科学理论丰富起来，因为任何一种有价值的科学理论都是社会实践的总结。有些人认为，只有到工厂或工场中去参加实际工作，才能做到理论和实际的结合。鉴于我们的科学研究工作，曾有着严重的脱离实际的偏向，强调和现场的联系是完全应该的，我们也必须在这方面努力；但是我们也应该注意到，单纯地到工厂或工场中去工作，并不一定能达到理论和实际结合的效果。只有科学地研究和总结实践，分析客观实践过程的各个方面，把它提高到科学理论的水平，使已知的理论更加深化，并进一步提出新的理论，指示出新的实践的方向，才能真正消除理论脱离实际的危险。
    科学研究工作主要是从生产实践里吸收题材，这是没有疑问的。但假如停留在总结个别的生产实践问题上，那么，我们的科学理论便将是一大堆各不相关或杂乱无章的东西。所以，我们从事科学研究工作的人，都有责任研究这些个别理论的内在联系，阐明其系统，并把这些理论逐步地统一起来，将科学理论逐步地提到更高的水平。高等工业学校的教师从事这样的科学研究工作有着巨大的意义。因为每门科学的发展水平，都直接影响着这门科学的讲授质量。所以，提高教学质量的主要手段是全力发展科学，全力发展科学研究工作。例如清华大学数学教研组主任赵访熊教授关于“斜度法解联立代数方程”（论文载一九五三年“数学学报”）的研究，对于像结构力学这样一门科学的讲授质量，就会有不小的影响，因为结构力学中处处要求解数量众多的联立方程，以前我们所习用的数字解法常常是非常繁复的，而斜度法在这方面则有显著的优点。
    教师们从事这样的科学研究工作，就需要大量的科学技术文献和资料。这些文献和资料，一般就是以前科学工作者的科学著作，以及我国、苏联和全世界各国的科学杂志。从这些著作和杂志里我们可以选择和本门科学有关的文献和资料，从研究这些文献和资料里来吸取前辈科学家和同时代科学家对于某一问题的经验、创造和理论分析。因此，在高等工业学校的图书馆里收藏大量的科学技术文献和资料（主要是科学技术的杂志期刊），以备教师的参考应用，是十分重要的。但在目前高等工业学校里，科学技术期刊以及有关文献和资料的收藏、整理、保管还远远落后于需要。
    教师们在这些科学研究工作当中，就能够补充新的教材，甚至于编著新的专门化课程的教材，这样的研究工作，对于教学，很明显地会有直接的利益。但教师通过这些研究工作，还不仅在于补充了新的教材，而同时，也能够使教师对于本门科学的发展有更清楚的认识，犹如本身就曾参加了这门科学的创造发展；如此，教师就有可能更深入地掌握和扩充自己所授专业的知识，获得科学工作的经验，熟习分析本专业中许多问题的技术，并应用到自己的研究工作中去。
    在目前的高等工业学校里，还有不少专业课的教材，是根本没有的，就是有了，一部分也还是资料的堆积。例如一般机器制造各专业的教材，就有这样的情况。如要提高这些课程的教学质量，还需在这一方面进行大量的科学研究工作。
    高等学校的教学和中等学校教学的根本差别是：在高等学校里，不仅要传授专门科学的知识，而更重要的，是要培养同学独立地解决专业的科学问题的能力。因为高等学校要培养同学成为各种专家，各种工程师，他们要独立地处理在各种独特的生产环境下所产生的生产问题。但假如教师本身在独立地解决科学问题上毫无经验，那么他如何能够很好地完成培养同学独立工作能力的任务呢。因此，科学研究工作就成为高等学校中教师不可缺少的劳动了。
    科学研究工作在高等工业学校里既然这样重要，那么，为什么又迟迟没有开展起来呢？原因是多方面的。首先，在旧中国的工学院里，由于反动统治下半殖民地性质的工业生产并不需要什么科学研究，而解放以来，学校忙于教学改革，也就没有大力予以注意提倡。其次，由于我们对于科学研究工作缺乏经验，对科学研究工作有着各种各样的误解。有人看到在解放前少数从事科学研究工作的人，因为在那时没有联系生产的可能，也没有实验室这样的工作条件，只能做些数学方面的科学研究工作，于是就误以为从事科学研究工作必须具有高深的数学基础。自己的数学基础较差，就对科学研究工作踌躇不前。其实，数学只不过是科学研究工作的工具之一；除数学而外，还有许多种工具可以用来进行科学研究工作。也有人把教学和研究工作对立起来看待，“先把书教好，然后再谈科学研究”。其实，教学和研究工作是互为因果的。当然，这里也有一个起码的条件，就是教师必须对教材有个初步的了解，甚或已经教过一遍；但无论如何，要进一步提高教学质量，单纯地死啃教材是不行的，只有通过科学研究工作才能逐步地达到目的。特别是在一些专业教研组里，有些专业课并没有什么写就的教材，就是在苏联现在也还没有；所以，我们必须通过阅读科学文献资料，分析研究，编著教材。这就是科学研究工作的开端。但也有人觉得目前教学任务很重，没有时间，因此就觉得，除非减少教学工作，否则就不可能进行什么研究工作。这种想法也是不正确的。教学任务是教师的主要任务，从事科学研究的目的，对高等工业学校的教师来讲，也就是为了提高教学质量。因此就不应该舍本逐末，为了进行科学研究工作，便减少教学任务。但也不能因为时间少，就拒绝从事科学研究工作。只能这样讲，如果时间很少，可以不必提出庞大繁重的研究任务；或者说，在教学任务繁重的情况下，我们还是应该进行科学研究工作，只是我们可以把题目定得小一些，把期限定得长一些。也有人认为，在学校里，教师的首要任务既是教学，就应该把全部时间投向同学。其实，这也不完全正确。当然，我们是反对那种对同学漠不关心的教学态度的，但我们的教学工作，是建立在科学研究工作的基础上的，所以，教师如果对于自己的科学水平的提高工作抱着漠不关心的态度，那也是错误的；因为这势必要影响到教学质量的提高，不能满足同学们日益增长的学习要求。
    马克思在“资本论”的法文译本之序与跋里曾经这样写着：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”因此，我们必须指出，强调困难，强调条件，都是违反科学工作的根本原则的。科学研究工作本身就需要创造条件，克服困难，才能不断发展。
    当然，我们不否认在目前高等工业学校里，教师们的教学任务还相当繁重（如有些课程还没有能力开出来，课程设计、毕业论文设计由于没有经验，一般还没有把握等等），但是，假如我们认识到科学研究工作对于开不出的课和做不出的设计都有一定的帮助；假如我们把收集资料、加以系统化编成教材也看做是科学研究工作的一种内容，那么，除了教学任务确已过重，和青年教师尚需通过进修，补足基础知识而外，其他教师一般还是有条件进行科学研究工作的。特别是在目前的教学情况下，我们有不很小的一部分教师，他们已经大体掌握了教材，也有了一定的教学经验，他们在不同程度上来进行不同要求的科学研究工作，是完全可能的。自然，仍必须指出，无论在什么条件下，我们对科学研究工作所抱的态度，都必须是实事求是的，量力而行的。
    因此，高等工业学校的科学研究工作，虽然还在萌芽时期，但在自上而下的鼓励和支持下，必然会逐步地发展起来的。为了祖国的工业建设，为了祖国的高等工业教育，同时也为了祖国的科学事业，我们极大多数教师们必然会努力从事研究工作。但我们也知道，这是一件十分艰巨的工作，只有稳步前进，不畏艰难，才能收到应有的效果。
    最后，我们必须指出马克思列宁主义是唯一正确的科学基础和思想武器，只有不断地提高教师的马克思列宁主义理论水平，不断地学习马克思主义研究问题的方法，我们才有可能逐步提高科学研究工作的水平；否则，我们在科学研究工作中就不能很有把握地得出正确的结论，当然，我们的科学工作水平也无法提高。但这并不是说，一定要先学好了马克思列宁主义，才能进行科学研究工作，这种把理论学习和科学研究工作分离开来，或机械地分成先后的看法，也是不对的。我们应该通过具体的科学研究工作来体会马克思列宁主义的精神，同时不断地用马克思列宁主义来衡量、批判我们的科学工作，只有这样，我们才能提高和深化我们对马克思列宁主义的认识。
