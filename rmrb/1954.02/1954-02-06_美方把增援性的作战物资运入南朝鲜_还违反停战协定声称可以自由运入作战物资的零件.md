Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 5th: The U.S. side's conspiracy to transport reinforcement combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition into South Korea under the guise of parts or disassembled components has been further confirmed.

    Rear Admiral R.T. Cowdrey, the U.S. Senior Member of the Military Armistice Commission, wrote to General Li Sang Cho, the Korean-Chinese Senior Member, on February 2nd, unreasonably claiming that combat materiel disassembled into parts could be freely transported into Korea without being bound by the Armistice Agreement. He also refused to continue discussions on the definition of "parts," unilaterally declaring: "The U.S. side hereby withdraws its previous proposals and considers this matter closed." In the four months since October 1953, six meetings of staff officers from both sides had been held regarding the parts issue. However, because the U.S. side has consistently insisted that combat materiel disassembled into parts or components does not belong to the combat equipment that should be subject to surveillance, the meetings have yielded no results to date.

    It is remembered that in October 1953, just as the U.S. side was insisting at the staff officers' meetings of the Military Armistice Commission that combat materiel could be freely transported into Korea if disassembled into parts, without being bound by the Armistice Agreement, the U.S. side on October 12th, in complete self-contradiction, falsely accused the Korean-Chinese side to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission of violating the Armistice Agreement by disassembling aircraft into parts, packing them in boxes, and transporting them into Korea, and requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to send mobile teams to Uiju for observation and inspection. After the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission accepted the U.S. request and dispatched mobile teams for observation and inspection, they unanimously affirmed that the U.S. accusation was groundless. Comparing the U.S.'s behavior with its claims regarding the parts issue, it is clear that they believe the Armistice Agreement is only binding on the Korean-Chinese side, while the U.S. can act according to its own convenience. What kind of attitude toward international obligations is this?

    In fact, the U.S. side has long secretly transported combat materiel into South Korea after disassembling it. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's comments on the summary report submitted to both sides regarding the movement of military personnel and combat materiel from both sides since the armistice until the end of September had already exposed the U.S.'s violation of the Armistice Agreement. The Czechoslovakian and Polish members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also pointed out that the U.S. side transported 106 4.2-inch mortars, disassembled and packed into 318 boxes, into South Korea from the port of Pusan on August 4th, violating the provisions of Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement.

    Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates: "Cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition"; during the armistice period, combat materiel damaged or consumed can only be "replaced on a one-for-one basis with items of the same performance and the same type," and the replacement must be carried out under the supervision and inspection of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The U.S. side's absurd claim that parts or disassembled components of combat materiel can be freely transported into Korea is clearly an attempt to evade these provisions of the Armistice Agreement, to openly transport combat materiel into South Korea after disassembling it into parts or as disassembled components, and then assemble them into complete combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition, in order to realize its sinister conspiracy to strengthen the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

### 美方把增援性的作战物资运入南朝鲜  还违反停战协定声称可以自由运入作战物资的零件

    美方把增援性的作战物资运入南朝鲜
    还违反停战协定声称可以自由运入作战物资的零件
      【新华社开城五日电】美方企图借零件或拆散件为名把增援性的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药运入南朝鲜的阴谋已获得进一步证实。
    军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西在二月二日写信给朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将，横蛮无理地主张作战物资拆散成为零件后，就可以不受停战协定的约束自由地运入朝鲜，并且拒绝就零件的定义问题继续进行讨论，片面地声称：美方现撤回其
  “以前的各次提案并且认为此问题已告结束”。自一九五三年十月份以来的四个月中间，关于零件问题的双方参谋人员会议曾举行了六次。但是，由于美方一直坚持其拆散成零件或拆散件的作战物资不属于应受监察的作战装备的主张，会议至今毫无结果。
    人们记得，一九五三年十月，正当美方在军事停战委员会双方参谋人员会议上，坚持把作战物资拆成零件，就可以不受停战协定的约束，自由地运入朝鲜的时候，美方曾在十月十二日向中立国监察委员会完全自相矛盾地诬控朝中方面违反停战协定，将飞机拆成零件，装箱运入朝鲜，并要求中立国监察委员会派遣机动小组去义州进行观察和视查。中立国监察委员会接受美方要求，派遣机动小组去观察与视查之后，一致肯定美方的诬控毫无根据。拿美方的这种行为和他们关于零件问题的主张对照来看，显然他们认为停战协定只是对朝中方面有约束力，而美方则可以对之便宜行事。这究竟是一种什么对待国际义务的态度呢？
    事实上，美方早已把作战物资拆散后秘密地运入南朝鲜。中立国监察委员会向双方提出的关于自停战后到九月底双方军事人员及作战物资移动情况简要报告的评论早就揭露了美方的这种违反停战协定行为。中立国监察委员会的捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员还指出：美方在八月四日从釜山口岸把一百零六门四点二英吋的迫击炮，拆散后分装三百一十八箱运入南朝鲜，违反了停战协定第十三款卯项的规定。
    停战协定第十三款卯项明白规定：“停止自朝鲜境外进入增援的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药”；在停战期间毁坏耗损的作战物资只能“在同样性能同样类型的一件换一件的基础上进行替换”，而且替换必须在中立国监察委员会的监督与视察下进行。美方坚持其作战物资的零件或拆散件可以自由运入朝鲜的荒谬主张，显然是企图躲过停战协定的这些规定，把作战物资拆成零件或作为拆散件，公开地运入南朝鲜，然后再装配成为完整的作战飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药，以实现其加强李承晚伪军的罪恶阴谋。
