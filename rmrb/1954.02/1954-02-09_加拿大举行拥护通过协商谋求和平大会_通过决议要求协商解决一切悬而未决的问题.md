Xinhua News Agency, Toronto Dispatch: The Canadian National Conference Advocating Peace Through Negotiation was held in Toronto from January 30th to 31st. The conference was attended by 1,500 representatives from public organizations, trade unions, educational institutions, and various local organizations across the country. In addition, more than 1,000 people who were unable to attend the conference donated money and wrote letters requesting to be listed as conference representatives.

    Representatives from nearly all Canadian provinces participated. Many businessmen and pastors also attended the conference. There was also a large contingent of trade union workers who, disregarding the intentions of reactionary trade union leaders, represented the masses of union members in attending the conference.

    At the opening ceremony of the conference, Dr. James Endicott delivered a speech entitled "Negotiation Must Lead to Agreement." He cited convincing facts to illustrate the growing strength of the worldwide movement for peace. He said that this fact has already caused a surprising change in public opinion in Canada. More than 500,000 trade union workers in the trade union movement now formally express their support for great power negotiations to seek peace.

    Endicott reported on the results of the Canadian referendum initiated by the Canadian Peace Congress. He said, "This referendum is the most extensive and thorough survey of public opinion ever conducted. More than 80 percent of the Canadian people have expressed their reasonable opinion, advocating that a great power conference be held now to resolve world problems through negotiation."

    Endicott cited a series of irrefutable facts to support the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence between two systems.

    Following Endicott's speech, Mrs. Libby Park, Secretary of the Toronto Peace Council, and Jean-Jules Richard, a well-known Canadian writer, delivered speeches at the meeting, discussing the issue of expanding cultural relations between all countries. Afterwards, the participants were divided into five groups to study the peaceful resolution of the German problem, trade issues, and the issue of consultation among the five major powers.

    The conference continued its discussions on the second day. People of different professions, political views, nationalities, and ages spoke about the growing desire of the Canadian people for peace.

    Dyson Carter, President of the Canada-Soviet Friendship Association, gave a speech about the peaceful construction work of the Soviet people and their sincere desire to strengthen peace, which repeatedly won cheers from the audience.

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution supporting the declaration of the World Peace Council. This declaration calls for the convening of international conferences, the expansion of cultural relations between countries, and the resolution of all outstanding issues through negotiation. The conference also passed an appeal to the Canadian Parliament and government, urging the Parliament and government to pass a solemn resolution declaring that Canada will never be the first to use atomic weapons and indicating that Canada is prepared to participate in statements of the above nature issued by all countries, to achieve the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction and the reduction of armaments.

    加拿大举行拥护通过协商谋求和平大会
    通过决议要求协商解决一切悬而未决的问题
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社多伦多消息：加拿大全国拥护通过协商谋求和平大会于一月三十日到三十一日在多伦多举行。参加大会的有来自全国各公共团体、工会、教育机构和各种地方组织的代表一千五百人。此外，尚有一千多不能出席大会的人，纷纷捐款和来信要求列名为大会代表。
    差不多所有加拿大的省份都有代表参加。许多商人和牧师也出席了大会。还有很大一部分工会工作者，他们不顾反动工会领袖的意旨，代表工会会员群众来参加大会。
    在大会的开幕式上，文幼章博士以“协商必定达到一致”为题，发表了演说。他引用令人信服的事实，说明世界规模的争取和平运动的日益壮大的力量。他说：这一事实，在加拿大已经使舆论产生了惊人的改变。在工会运动中有五十万以上工会工作者现在正式表示主张大国协商谋取和平。
    文幼章报告了由加拿大和平大会发起的加拿大公民投票的结果。他说：“这次公民投票是从来没有举行过的一次最广泛最彻底的舆论调查。百分之八十以上的加拿大人民已经表示了他们的合乎情理的意见，主张现在召开大国会议用协商的办法来解决世界问题。”
    文幼章举出一系列无可争辩的事实来支持两个制度的和平共处的可能性和必要性。
    继文幼章发表演说之后，多伦多和平理事会书记利比·帕克夫人，著名的加拿大作家让·儒勒·理夏等在会上发表演说，讨论扩大一切国家间的文化关系问题。之后，与会者分成五个小组，研究和平解决德国问题、贸易问题和五大国协商问题。
    大会在第二天继续进行讨论。不同职业、政治见解、国籍和年龄的人在发言中都谈到加拿大人民日益增长的争取和平的愿望。
    加苏友好协会主席戴森·卡特谈到苏联人民的和平建设劳动和他们衷心愿望加强和平的演说，一再博得听众的欢呼。
    大会一致通过一项支持世界和平理事会宣言的决议。这个宣言要求召开国际会议、扩大国与国间的文化关系，经过协商解决一切悬而未决的问题。大会同时通过一项送致加拿大议会和政府的呼吁书，敦促议会和政府通过庄严的决议，宣布加拿大决不第一个使用原子武器并表明加拿大准备参加一切国家所发表的上述性质的声明，达成禁用一切大规模毁灭性武器和缩减军备。
