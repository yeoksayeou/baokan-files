The newly built modern Bayi Flour Mill in Xinjiang Province officially started production on February 9th. That afternoon, the factory held a ceremony to celebrate the commencement of operations. Saifudin, Fourth Secretary of the Xinjiang Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Bao Erhan, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, extended their congratulations to the workers who participated in the construction of the factory and encouraged all the factory's staff to achieve new accomplishments in future production.

This flour mill is currently the largest in Northwest China. Its main building (the flour mill building) is a five-story building, 28 meters high, with an area of approximately 2,450 square meters. After the flour mill commences production, its daily output will be approximately three times that of the current Urumqi People's Flour Mill. The flour produced will not only meet the needs of the people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi but also supply the people of the counties near Urumqi.

The construction project of this factory was undertaken by a construction unit of the Engineering Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The soldiers demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm in building the frontier of the motherland during the construction of the factory. Whether it was in the severe cold of snowy days or in the scorching heat of the summer, the project never stopped. The soldiers actively studied technology, overcame difficulties in the project, and continuously improved the progress and quality of the project. Soldiers Liu Zhihua, Xue Cai, Yang Yongcang, He Fukuan, and others jointly researched and manufactured wire shears, steel bar bending wheels, and other steel bar bending tools, which increased the efficiency from one person being able to tie only 600 kilograms of steel bars a day to 1,800 kilograms. At the beginning, it took 18 days to install the concrete beam shell panels on the second floor. Later, the soldiers exchanged and summarized experiences and improved the work method. When installing the concrete beam shell panels on the third and fourth floors, it only took three days to complete. The soldiers not only tried every means to improve the progress of the project, but also paid attention to saving. When building the outer wall of the flour mill building, the soldiers created a method of using wooden boards to build the building, saving 1,500 man-days and a considerable amount of wood.

In the process of installing the machines, the factory's newly trained trainees and the workers who came from Shanghai to support the factory also worked actively with a sense of ownership. When the installation of the machines began, it was during a heavy snowstorm with wind and snow. Moreover, the factory did not have lifting equipment. However, the workers found ways to use the power of chain hoists to lift hundreds of tons of machines to each floor. When installing the heating equipment, Zhou Weijie and others researched and designed a method that saved 40 percent of the radiators compared to the original plan. This item alone saved more than 200 million yuan in basic construction costs. The workers not only installed various machines conscientiously and responsibly but also brought collective wisdom into play to improve the original equipment. The original equipment lacked a mixer, so the workers manufactured two themselves. Previously, the dust extraction machine did not have a fire protection device, so the workers installed a self-created automatic fire extinguishing water dispenser on it. The original flour discharge method was not the "front-end flour discharge method," so the workers changed it to the front-end flour discharge method based on the experience of flour mills in Guannei (areas within the passes). All of these improvements have greatly strengthened the safety of production and increased the production volume of the original equipment.

### 新疆省新建的八一面粉厂正式开工生产

    新疆省新建的八一面粉厂正式开工生产
    新疆省新建近代化的八一面粉厂，已在二月九日正式开工生产。这一天下午，这个厂举行了庆祝开工的典礼。中共中央新疆分局第四书记赛福鼎、新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉，向参加建厂的职工们表示祝贺，并勉励全厂职工在今后生产中获得新的成就。
    这个面粉厂是目前全西北最大的一个面粉厂。它的主要厂房（粉楼）为二十八公尺高的五层大楼，面积约两千四百五十多平方公尺。这座面粉厂开工后，它的日产量约等于现在乌鲁木齐市人民面粉厂的三倍。生产出的面粉，除满足乌鲁木齐市各族人民的需要外，还可以供应乌鲁木齐市附近各县人民。
    这个厂的建设工程是由中国人民解放军新疆军区工程处某建筑部队担任的。战士们在建厂工作中表现了高度的建设祖国边疆的劳动热情。不论是在严寒的大雪天，或者是在红日当头的暑天里，工程从来没有间断过。战士们积极钻研技术，克服工程中的困难，不断地提高工程进度和工程质量。战士刘志华、薛财、杨永仓、何福宽等，共同研究制造了铁丝剪刀、扎钢筋轮等弯钢筋工具，使开始一天一个人只能扎六百公斤钢筋的效率，提高到一千八百公斤。在开始装二层楼的混凝土梁壳子板时，用了十八天的时间，后来战士们互相交流、总结经验，改进了工作法，在装三楼和四楼的混凝土梁壳子板时，只三天就完成了。战士们不仅想尽一切办法来提高工程进度，而且，他们注意节约。在砌粉楼外墙时，战士们创造了按楼搭木板的方法，节省了一千五百个人工和不少的木料。
    在安装机器过程中，该厂新训练的学员和由上海来支援该厂的工人们，也都以主人翁的态度积极工作。在开始安装机器的时候，正赶上是风雪交加的大雪天，工厂又没有起重设备，可是，工人们想办法，利用倒链的力量，把几百吨重的机器，吊到各层楼上去。在安装暖气设备时，经过周维介等的研究、设计，比原来计划节省了百分之四十的散热片，只这一项就节约了基本建设费用两亿多元。工人们不只是认真负责地安装了各种机器，而且发挥了集体智慧，改善了原来的设备。原来的设备缺少搅拌机，工人们自己制造了两个。以前吸灰机上没有防火装置，工人们给它装上了自己创造的自动灭火放水器；原来的出粉法不是“前路出粉法”，工人们根据关内面粉厂的经验，把它改成了前路出粉。所有这一切改进，都大大地加强了生产的安全，并提高了原有设备的生产量。
