    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The documentary film "Resist America, Aid Korea" Part Two, produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, has been shown in major cities and vast rural areas across the country during the Spring Festival. This film, starting from the time when the US invading army in Korea was commanded by Ridgway in 1951, until the official signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, and the start of peaceful construction by the Korean people, records the shameful failures of US imperialism at the negotiation table and on the battlefield over the past three years, as well as the glorious victories achieved by the people of China and Korea.
    The China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea has specifically notified the general sub-committees and sub-committees of major administrative regions to assist the local branches of film distribution companies in publicizing this film and organizing audiences, so as to further deepen the publicity of Resist America and Aid Korea in conjunction with the reports delivered by the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea across the country.

    全国各地在春节期间
    放映“抗美援朝”影片第二部
   【新华社三日讯】中央新闻记录电影制片厂摄制的文献记录影片“抗美援朝”第二部，已于春节期间在全国各大城市及广大农村放映。这部影片从一九五一年美国侵朝军统帅李奇微上台开始，到一九五三年七月二十七日朝鲜停战协定正式签字、朝鲜人民开始和平建设为止，记录了三年来美帝国主义在谈判会议桌上和在战场上遭到的可耻失败，以及朝中两国人民所取得的辉煌胜利。
    中国人民抗美援朝总会为这部影片的扩大放映，特通知各大行政区总分会、分会，要他们协助当地电影发行公司的分支机构进行这部影片的宣传与组织观众等工作，以结合当前中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团在全国各地的传达报告，进一步深入抗美援朝的宣传。
