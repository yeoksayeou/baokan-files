The Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine will continue large-scale basic construction this year. This year, the state's investment in the basic construction of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine has increased by 40.6% compared to last year, accounting for 66.1% of the total investment of the Fuxin Mining Bureau. The basic construction project of the Haizhou Open-Pit Mine in 1954 is the most important year for the mine's construction. If this year's basic construction can be completed according to plan, the production of this open-pit mine can reach the designed output in 1955. At that time, the coal produced by this open-pit mine each year will be equivalent to the harvest produced by 240,000 farmers in one year. If this coal is used to generate electricity, it can supply the electricity needed to smelt 36.75 million tons of steel. If this electricity is supplied to textile factories, the cloth woven can provide each person in the country with an average of 60 feet.

The open-pit mine's basic construction project this year is very large and complex, with as many as 96 construction items. These include permanent railways, wiring, and partially automated communication signal equipment; three-dimensional intersection overpasses and large-scale culverts; four large-scale repair workshop buildings and the installation of all their automated equipment; coal mining stations and the latest type of coal unloading stations; and technically complex traction substations. In addition, there are many precision mechanical installations and civil construction projects. These projects require very strict standards and will be constructed using the latest Soviet technical standards.

In order to complete such a huge task, the Fuxin Mining Bureau began preparations a quarter ahead of schedule last year. In November last year, more than 100 engineering and technical personnel were transferred to form a design committee, which determined this year's engineering tasks and made appropriate arrangements for design, equipment, materials, and manpower. In order to ensure the completion of the task, the basic construction organization was strengthened, and a Haizhou Open-Pit Mine Basic Construction Engineering Team was specially established. Based on last year's experience, strict acceptance and inspection systems were formulated, and various advanced experiences from last year were summarized in preparation for vigorous promotion this year.

    阜新海州露天煤矿继续进行各项基本建设
    阜新海州露天煤矿今年继续进行大规模的基本建设。今年国家给海州露天矿基本建设的投资比去年增加了百分之四十点六，占阜新矿务局总投资的百分之六十六点一。海州露天矿一九五四年的基本建设工程是该矿进行建设的最重要的一年，今年的基本建设能按照计划完成，一九五五年这个露天矿的生产就能达到设计产量，那时这个露天矿每年所生产的煤，其价值相等于二十四万农民一年生产的收获量，若用这些煤发电，可供冶炼三千六百七十五万吨钢所需的电力，这些电供给纺织厂，织成的布全国人民平均每人可以得到六十尺。
    露天矿今年的基本建设工程非常庞大复杂，仅建设的项目即达九十六项。其中有永久性的铁路、架线及部分自动化的通讯信号设备、有立体交叉高架桥和工程浩大的涵洞、有四座大型修配厂房及其全部自动化设备的安装，还有采煤站及最新式的卸煤站和技术复杂的牵引变电所，此外还有很多精密的机械安装和土木建筑工程。这些工程要求非常严格，都将采用苏联最新式的技术标准进行施工。
    阜新矿务局为了完成这样巨大的任务，在去年便提前一个季度开始做准备工作，去年十一月份抽调了一百多名工程技术人员成立了设计委员会，确定了今年的工程任务，对设计、设备、材料及人力等，都作了适当的安排。为了保证任务的完成，还加强了基本建设机构，专门成立了海州露天矿基本建设工程队。并接受去年的经验，制订了严格的验收制度和检查制度，同时又总结了去年各种先进经验，准备在今年大力推广。
