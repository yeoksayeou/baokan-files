Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th Dispatch: According to TASS, the All-Russian Agricultural Advanced Workers Conference convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (the largest republic in the Soviet Union), opened in the Kremlin on the 11th to discuss some of the most important issues in the further development of agriculture in the Russian Federation. Participating in the conference were 2,317 people, including advanced agricultural workers and livestock experts from various states of the Russian Federation, as well as representatives from other Soviet republics.

At 10 a.m., Soviet Party and government leaders Malenkov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Saburov, Pervukhin, Shvernik, Suslov, Pospelov, Shatalin, and government leaders of the Russian Federation attended the conference. They were warmly welcomed by all attendees as they took their seats on the rostrum.

The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation and Minister of Agriculture, P. Lobanov, delivered a report on increasing the unit area yield of crops and the productivity of livestock. He said that the Russian Federation occupies an important position in the realization of the great plan for the further development of Soviet agriculture. Its collective farms account for more than half of the total number in the Soviet Union, and its machine tractor stations account for 62 percent. This year's appropriation for the further development of agriculture is 25.5 billion rubles, one and a half times that of 1953. Since the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, 65,000 agronomists and livestock specialists have been working full-time in collective farms, and 15,000 engineers and technicians have been working in machine tractor stations. With experienced cadres, powerful machines, and the use of scientific achievements and advanced experience, we are fully capable of greatly improving the republic's agriculture. Lobanov then spoke about the tasks of collective farmers in increasing the production of grain, meat, milk and other agricultural products, as well as increasing the production of raw materials for light industry. He said that this year's grain output should be increased by one and a half times that of last year, potato output should be increased by nearly two times, vegetable output should be increased by two and a half times, and milk output should be increased by 80 percent. Finally, Lobanov analyzed in detail the shortcomings of individual food sectors and pointed out specific ways to improve the work of these sectors.

After Lobanov's report, the conference began to discuss the report.

The meeting is continuing.

    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和俄罗斯联邦共和国（苏联最大的加盟共和国）部长会议所召开的全俄罗斯农业先进工作者会议，十一日在克里姆林宫开幕，讨论在进一步发展俄罗斯联邦农业中的一些最重要的问题。参加会议的有俄罗斯联邦各州的农业先进工作者和饲畜能手，以及苏联其他加盟共和国的代表共两千三百一十七人。
    上午十时，苏联共产党和政府的领袖马林科夫、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、萨布罗夫、别尔乌辛、什维尔尼克、苏斯洛夫、波斯伯洛夫、夏塔林以及俄罗斯联邦共和国的政府领袖们参加了会议。他们在主席台就座时受到全体到会者的热烈欢迎。
    俄罗斯联邦部长会议第一副主席、农业部部长帕·洛巴诺夫在会上做了关于提高农作物单位面积产量和牲畜产品生产率的报告。他说，在实现进一步发展苏联农业的伟大计划中，俄罗斯联邦占着重要的地位。它的集体农庄的数目占全苏联的一半以上，机器拖拉机站占百分之六十二。今年用来进一步发展农业的拨款达二百五十五亿卢布，为一九五三年的一倍半。自从苏共中央一九五三年九月全体会议以后，在集体农庄中固定工作的有六万五千名农艺师和饲畜师，在机器拖拉机站中有一万五千名工程师和技术人员。由于有了有经验的干部和效力强大的机器，由于利用科学成就和先进经验，我们完全有可能大力提高共和国的农业。洛巴诺夫接着谈到了集体农民在提高谷物、肉类、牛奶和其他农产品的生产以及提高轻工业原料的生产方面的任务。他说，今年谷物产量要增加为去年的一倍半，马铃薯产量要将近增加为两倍，蔬菜要增加为两倍半，牛奶要增加百分之八十。洛巴诺夫最后详细分析了个别食业部门的缺点，并指出了改进这些部门的工作的具体办法。
    洛巴诺夫报告后，会议就对这个报告进行讨论。
    会议在继续进行中。
