Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on February 18th, the Vietnamese People's Army once again repulsed enemy troops attacking from the besieged and isolated stronghold of Dien Bien Phu.

    On February 15th, an enemy European-African battalion from Dien Bien Phu, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched an attack on Hill 674 northeast of Dien Bien Phu, which was defended by a small unit of the Vietnamese People's Army. The battle lasted from 7:00 AM to 10:30 AM, during which the enemy battalion attacked a total of five times. However, each time they were repulsed by the Vietnamese People's Army. The Vietnamese People's Army killed or wounded more than 50 enemy soldiers.

    Prior to this, an enemy company from Dien Bien Phu, supported by tanks, advanced north of Dien Bien Phu on February 5th, and was intercepted by a reconnaissance team of five soldiers from the People's Army. The fierce battle lasted from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The enemy company failed to advance and had to retreat to their lair after suffering a loss of 20 killed.

    These five People's Army soldiers have been awarded medals of merit by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The Vietnamese People's Army is attacking French army transport lines everywhere, causing heavy losses to the French army.

    According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, a unit of the Vietnamese People's Army intercepted a convoy of enemy transport ships consisting of 20 ships, including gunboats and motorboats, en route from Nam Dinh to Hanoi on the Red River on the 14th. The People's Army sank three enemy motorboats, burned two gunboats, and damaged several gunboats and motorboats, annihilating a multi-battalion of European-African troops. The enemy was forced to retreat to Hung Yen city.

    Prior to this, local troops of the Vietnamese People's Army attacked an enemy train on January 31st in Kim Thanh, 12 kilometers southeast of the capital of Hai Duong province, destroying 12 carriages, killing 600 enemy soldiers, and wounding more than 300 enemy soldiers, most of whom were European-African troops, including a major and three captains. On the same day, local troops of the People's Army in Quang Yen province intercepted an enemy transport convoy on Highway 18, killing 14 enemy soldiers and capturing 85 enemy soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, February 19th: The French invading forces besieged by the Vietnamese People's Army in Dien Bien Phu have recently received a large amount of U.S. weapons support and have repeatedly attempted to expand their positions outward, but each time they have been fiercely attacked by the Vietnamese People's Army and retreated in disarray.

    An article from Saigon published in "U.S. News & World Report" on February 12th stated, "Wherever you go in Indochina, you will see vivid signs that the United States is undertaking an increasing mission in this war." Dien Bien Phu is a typical example: "Nearly 100 American DC-3 cargo planes land every day at that precarious airport within range of the Communist mortars. These planes bring 200 to 300 tons of supplies. In addition, 30 huge, slow-flying C-119 transport planes hover over Dien Bien Phu every morning, dropping another 100 to 150 tons of cargo by parachute. All these transport planes are donated by the United States. When you walk around Dien Bien Phu, you will see dozens of American mortars, with boxes of American shells piled next to them. All the artillery – 105mm and 155mm caliber – is American. And all the ammunition air-shipped for these guns comes from the United States. There are even some American tanks there, which are air-shipped in parts and then reassembled within the isolated Dien Bien Phu defense perimeter."

    However, the military and weapons aid boasted by the United States cannot improve the fate of the French invading forces. According to a report from Hanoi by United Press quoting French military headquarters, a large number of French troops advanced northeast from Dien Bien Phu airport on the 15th. The Vietnamese People's Army "first let the attacking troops climb the thickly forested hills, and when they were almost at the top... they swept them with machine guns and released heavy mortar fire and grenades." The advancing French troops, under the counterattack of this "terrible firepower" of the Vietnamese People's Army, "suffered heavy casualties and retreated." Subsequently, the French army risked launching a second attack, "but found that the Communist positions were still very solid." After several hours of fighting, "they were beaten back." United Press said that the French forces trapped in Dien Bien Phu "also engaged in four battles in this direction (northeast direction) last week, all of which were similarly defeated."

    越南人民军击退从奠边府出犯的敌军
      【新华社十九日讯】据越南通讯社十八日讯：越南人民军再度击退从被围困的孤立据点奠边府出犯的敌军。
    二月十五日，奠边府的敌军一个欧非营在飞机和大炮的掩护下向奠边府东北的由越南人民军少数部队据守的六七四高地发动攻击。战斗从上午七时继续到十时半，这营敌军一共进攻了五次，然而每一次都被越南人民军击退了。越南人民军共毙、伤敌军五十多名。
    在这以前，奠边府的一连敌军曾于二月五日在坦克的配合下，向奠边府以北进犯，遭到由人民军五个战士组成的一个侦察小组的截击，激烈的战斗从上午九时一直持续到下午五时，这连敌军未能前进一步，只得在遭受被击毙二十名的损失后，退回老巢。
    这五个人民军战士已荣获越南人民军总司令部授给的军功章。
    【新华社十九日讯】越南人民军到处袭击法军的运输线，使法军遭到重大损失。
    据越南通讯社报道，越南人民军一部于十四日在红河上截击由南定开往河内的由炮艇和汽艇共二十艘组成的一队敌军运输船队。人民军击沉敌军汽艇三艘，焚毁炮艇两艘，并击伤炮艇和汽艇若干艘，歼灭了一个多欧非营。敌军被迫退到兴安城。
    在这以前，越南人民军地方部队在一月三十一日在海阳省省会东南十二公里金城攻击敌军火车一列，击毁车厢十二节，击毙敌军六百名，并击伤敌军三百多名，其中绝大部分是欧非军，包括一个少校和三个上尉。同一天，广安省的人民军地方部队在第十八号公路上截击一支敌军运输车队，毙敌十四名，俘敌八十五名。
    【新华社十九日讯】被越南人民军围困在奠边府的法国侵略军，最近得到大量美国武器支援，曾多次企图向外扩大阵地，但每次都遭到越南人民军的痛击，狼狈龟缩回去。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”二月十二日刊载的一篇西贡通讯写道，“在印度支那境内，不管你到那里，你都会看到生动的迹象，显示美国在这一战争中正在承担着不断增多的任务。”奠边府就是一个典型的例子：“每天都有将近一百架的美国DC三型运货机降落在那个位于共方迫击炮射程以内的、岌岌可危的飞机场上。这些飞机带去二百吨到三百吨的供应品。此外，还有三十架巨大的、飞起来慢吞吞的C一一九型运输机每天早晨在奠边府上空低掠下来，用降落伞投下另外一百吨到一百五十吨的货物。所有这些运输机都是美国赠送的。当你走到奠边府的周围时，你就会看到数十门美国迫击炮，在炮的旁边还堆积着成箱的美国炮弹。所有的大炮——一百零五公厘及一百五十五公厘口径——都是美国的。并且，所有那些空运来的、供这些大炮使用的弹药，也都是从美国来的。甚至在那里还有一些美国的坦克，这些坦克是拆成零件后空运来的，然后在这与外界隔离开的奠边府防御圈内重新装配起来。”
    但是，美国所夸耀的这些军火和武器援助，并不能改善法国侵略军的命运。据合众社河内电引法军司令部消息透露，大批法军在十五日从奠边府机场向东北出犯。越南人民军“先让进攻的部队爬上密林丛丛的山坡，等到几乎抵达山顶……后，即用机枪扫射，并放出重迫击炮火和手榴弹”。出犯的法军在越南人民军这种“可怕的火力”的迎击下，在“遭到大量伤亡后就撤退下来”，接着，法军又冒险发动第二次攻击，“但发现共军阵地仍很坚固”，战斗数小时后，“即被打回”。合众社说，困守奠边府的法军，“上周在这个方向（东北方向）也进行了四次战斗，都同样遭到挫败。”
