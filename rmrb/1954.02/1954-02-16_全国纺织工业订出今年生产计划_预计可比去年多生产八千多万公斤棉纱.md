Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: In 1954, China's textile industry will see further growth. According to preliminary calculations of the 1954 production plan, the total output value of the national state-owned and central state-private joint textile industries will increase by about 12 percent compared to 1953; public and private textile enterprises nationwide (excluding handicrafts) will produce 83.5 million kilograms more cotton yarn than last year. This increased amount of cotton yarn can be woven into over 600 million meters of fabric. If these fabrics were laid along the railway from Manzhouli in the Northeast to Guangzhou, they could be laid in about 128 layers. Calculated at one set of clothing per person, it could supply 120 million people. The total of other wool, hemp, silk, and satin fabrics will generally increase by 15 to 20 percent compared to 1953.

The 1954 textile industry production plan is formulated according to the state's policy of concentrating major efforts on developing heavy industry and correspondingly developing light industry, as well as actual needs and possibilities. Since the liberation of the country, the amount of cloth supplied to the people by China's textile industry has increased by about one and a half times. Calculated on a per capita basis, in the peak pre-war year of 1936, the average person received 13 *shi chi* of machine-woven cloth; in 1953, the average per person had increased to 23.3 *shi chi*. This year, the state anticipates that the people's purchasing power will further increase, so it requires the textile industry's production to also grow appropriately. This year, the national textile mills plan to produce cotton cloth averaging 26.3 *shi chi* per person; if we add the cloth produced by handicraft cloth factories, the number will be even higher.

The characteristic of this year's textile industry production is that it must both supply the needs of the people and be based on the possibilities of financial resources, materials, and raw material supply. Their task is to actively overcome difficulties under the existing conditions, strive to increase production, improve quality, and increase variety. This year, the textile industry will ensure the completion of tasks from the following aspects: First, strengthen planning management in enterprises, focusing on the implementation of work plans; strengthen technical measures, implement the production responsibility system, to further improve the production management of existing enterprises; continue to leverage the potential capabilities of enterprises. State-owned and central state-private joint textile enterprises will use methods of increasing equipment utilization rates and unit output to increase production of 3.7 million kilograms of 20-count yarn; the utilization rates of spindles in local state-owned, state-private joint, and private textile enterprises are also required to be improved. Second, newly built textile mills are required to strive to put them into production as early as possible. The four state-owned cotton textile mills built last year and some expanded spindles will gradually start production in the second and third quarters of this year. By the end of this year, the number of spindles in operation nationwide will increase by 8 percent compared to the end of last year. If all the newly added spindles are put into production one month earlier on average, approximately 3.1 million kilograms more cotton yarn can be produced. Third, in order to appropriately meet the needs of the people of the country, firstly from the supply quantity of fabrics, this year it is required to try using high-quality cotton to weave coarse-count single-yarn khaki, gabardine, and other high-grade new products to replace high-grade thread-woven fabrics, and appropriately increase the production of sturdy and durable coarse cloth of 14 pounds and 16 pounds needed in the vast rural areas. Last year, fine-count yarns of 32 counts or higher, such as thread serge and thread khaki, accounted for about 15 to 20 percent of the total cotton yarn production nationwide. If this can be reduced by 10 percent this year and changed to spinning 20-count yarn, 20 million kilograms of cotton yarn can be increased, which can also increase ordinary market cloth by more than 145 million meters. Fourth, in order to compensate for the reduction in high-grade thread-woven fabrics, this year silk fabrics, tussah silk fabrics, and woolen fabrics will be required to appropriately increase production according to the possibility of raw material supply, and each factory will be required to actively improve technology, improve quality, and create new, inexpensive, and high-quality fabrics that are loved by the masses.

### 全国纺织工业订出今年生产计划  预计可比去年多生产八千多万公斤棉纱

    全国纺织工业订出今年生产计划
    预计可比去年多生产八千多万公斤棉纱
    【新华社十二日讯】一九五四年我国纺织工业又将进一步获得增长。根据对一九五四年生产计划的初步计算，今年全国国营和中央公私合营纺织工业的生产总值将比一九五三年提高百分之十二左右；全国公、私营纺织企业（不包括手工业）将比去年多生产八千三百五十万公斤的棉纱，这部分增加的棉纱可以织成六亿多公尺的布，如果把这些布从东北的满洲里沿铁路铺到广州，大约可以铺一百二十八层，如果以一人一套衣服计算，可以供应一亿二千万人。其他毛、麻、丝、绢等织品的总和，大致比一九五三年提高百分之十五到二十。
    一九五四年纺织工业的生产计划，是根据国家集中主要力量发展重工业相应发展轻工业的方针以及实际的需要和可能来制订的。从全国解放以来，我国纺织工业供应给人民的布匹，已增加了一倍半左右，如按全国人口平均计算，抗战前的最高年份一九三六年，平均每人分到机织布十三市尺，一九五三年平均每人分得的机织布已增加到二十三点三市尺。今年国家预计到人民购买力将进一步提高，因此要求纺织工业的生产也要适当的增长，今年全国纺织厂计划生产的棉布，平均每人可以得到二十六点三市尺，如果加上手工业布厂生产的布，数字还要高出不少。
    今年纺织工业生产的特点是：既要供应人民需要，又要根据财力、物力和原料供应的可能。他们的任务就是要在现有的条件下积极克服困难，努力增加生产，提高质量，增加品种。今年纺织工业将从这样几方面来保证任务的完成：首先，在企业中加强计划管理，以推行作业计划为中心；加强技术措施，贯彻生产责任制，来进一步改善现有企业的生产管理；继续发挥企业的潜在能力。国营和中央公私合营纺织企业将用提高设备利用率和单位产量的办法，增产二十支纱三百七十万公斤；地方国营、公私合营和私营纺织企业的纱锭利用率也要求提高。其次，要求新建的纺织厂争取提早投入生产。去年兴建的四个国营棉纺织厂和一部分扩建纱锭，都将在今年第二、三季度陆续开工生产，到今年年底，全国开动的纱锭将比去年年底增加百分之八，如果全部新增纱锭平均提前一个月投入生产，大约可以增产三百十万多公斤的棉纱。第三，为了首先从布匹的供应数量上适当满足全国人民的需要，今年要求试用优等棉花纺织粗支纱的单纱卡叽、华达呢等高级新产品来代替高级线织品，并适当增产广大农村需用的十四磅和十六磅的坚厚耐牢的粗布。去年全国织线哔叽、线卡叽等高级布的三十二支以上的细支纱，约占棉纱总产量百分之十五到二十，今年假如能够减少百分之十，而改纺二十支纱，就可以增加棉纱二千万公斤，也就可以增加普通市布一亿四千五百万公尺以上。第四，为抵补高级线织布的减少，今年将要求蚕丝织品、柞蚕丝织品和毛织品根据原料供应的可能适当增加产量，并要求各厂积极地改进技术，提高质量，创制出为大众所喜爱的价廉物美的新织品。
