In 1953, agricultural technology extension stations in the Northeast region increased from 85 in 1952 to 903, with over 5,800 extension station cadres. Last year, these extension stations played a significant role in promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience, improving agricultural technology, and facilitating the mutual aid and cooperation movement. To further improve the work of the extension stations, provinces have adopted different methods to run training courses since last December. This past winter and spring, over 80% of the technology extension station cadres in the entire region have received systematic theoretical and professional training.

After studying the general line, the participating cadres generally recognized the future of agricultural development, clarified the important role of extension station work in transforming the small-peasant economy, criticized certain capitalist ideological tendencies, and strengthened their confidence in running the extension stations well. The agricultural technology, mechanical technology operation, and theoretical abilities of the vast majority of cadres have also been greatly improved through this study. Some first-time participants in intensive training, who were previously "four ignorant" (ignorant of the name, effectiveness, operation, and adjustment) of new agricultural tools, are now "four knowledgeable"; those who had shorter study periods in the past have further mastered the technology and enriched their agricultural knowledge through this study; and cadres with a relatively strong foundation in agricultural technology have also made progress.

At the training courses, cadres from various extension stations also further reviewed their work from last year and formulated technical extension plans for this year. For example, the Jin County Extension Station cadre training course in Lüda City strictly reviewed the technical extension work in 1953, affirmed the achievements, criticized the mistakes, and proposed ways to improve the work in the future. In particular, the training courses in various regions conducted serious reviews and criticisms of the subjective, dogmatic, and unrealistic work styles in last year's technical extension work, such as mechanically applying, simply calling for dense planting, and mechanically promoting equidistant thinning. After the study, it was generally reflected that: "This time, our minds are clear, and we will no longer be clueless when we return to the stations to do technical extension work."

Currently, the extension station cadres of Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces have completed their studies and returned to the countryside, and are actively preparing to carry out this year's agricultural technology extension work.

    东北各省普遍训练农业技术推广站的干部
    一九五三年东北地区的农业技术推广站由一九五二年的八十五个发展到九百零三个，推广站干部有五千八百多人。这些推广站去年在推广肇源丰产经验，改进农业技术，促进互助合作运动方面，起了很大作用。为了把推广站的工作再提高一步，自去年十二月以来，各省就采取了不同的方式开办了训练班。全区去冬今春有百分之八十以上的技术推广站的干部都受到了一次系统的理论和业务训练。
    参加学习的干部在学习了总路线以后，普遍认识到农业的发展前途，明确了推广站工作在改造小农经济中的重要作用，批判了某些资本主义思想倾向，坚定了办好推广站的信心。绝大多数干部的农业技术、机械技术的操作和理论能力经过这次学习，也有很大的提高。部分首次参加集训的，原来对新式农具“四不知”（不知名称、效能、操作、调整）现在是四懂；过去学习时间较短的，经过这次学习进一步掌握了技术，丰富了农业知识；对农业技术较有根底的干部也提高了一步。
    各地推广站干部在训练班上还进一步地检查了去年的工作，制订了今年的技术推广计划。如旅大市金县推广站干部训练班，严格检查了一九五三年的技术推广工作，肯定了成绩，批判了错误，提出了今后提高工作的办法。特别是各地训练班对去年技术推广工作中的生搬硬套，单纯号召密植，机械推行等距、间苗等主观主义、教条主义的脱离实际的工作作风，都做了认真的检查和批判，学习之后，普遍反映：“这回心可亮堂了，回到站上做技术推广工作就再不会蒙头了。”
    现在黑龙江、松江两省的推广站干部已结束学习回到农村，正积极进行开展今年农业技术推广的准备工作。
