    Hunan Province's Newly Built Xiangtan Cotton Textile Factory Fully Commences Production
    The newly built local state-owned Xiangtan Cotton Textile Factory in Hunan Province fully commenced production in early February. Based on the excellent operation of the machinery, the factory plans to produce 36,000 bales of cotton yarn and 670,000 bolts of cotton cloth this year. The profits remitted to the state in the first year will equal one-sixth of the total factory construction investment.
    The Xiangtan Cotton Textile Factory is one of the six large-scale state-owned and locally state-owned textile factories in China that began construction in 1952. It has 50,200 spindles and 1,050 automatic looms. All the machinery was manufactured and assembled by textile machinery factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, and was completed by the end of December last year. After more than two months of trial operation and partial production, it has been proven that the performance of this domestically produced machinery is excellent. Although more than 95% of the operators are newly recruited and unskilled apprentices, the improvement in labor productivity is still very rapid. By the beginning of February, the average output per spindle per 20 hours had reached 0.92 pounds, exceeding the original plan by 5%. The quality of the yarn, except for a slight difference in evenness, met the standards of grade A yarn in terms of twist, color, and strength. The output per loom per 20 hours has also increased from more than ten yards at the beginning of operation to more than seventy yards, with the highest reaching ninety-six yards.

    湖南省新建湘潭棉纺织厂全面开工生产
    湖南省新建的地方国营湘潭棉纺织厂，已在二月初全面开工生产。根据机器运转良好的情况，该厂计划在今年年内生产三万六千件棉纱和六十七万匹棉布；在头一年内上缴给国家的利润，就将等于建厂投资总额的六分之一。
    湘潭棉纺织厂是我国一九五二年动工新建的六个大型的国营和地方国营纺织厂之一，拥有五万零二百个纱锭，一千零五十台自动布机。全部机器是由上海、天津、青岛等地纺织机械厂分工制造和装配起来的，在去年十二月底安装完毕。经过两个多月的试运转和局部生产，证明这种国产机器的性能非常优良。虽然操作工人中百分之九十五以上是新招收来的技术不熟练的学徒，但劳动生产率的提高仍很迅速。到二月初时，平均每个纱锭二十小时的产量已达到零点九二磅，超过原订计划百分之五；纱的质量除匀度稍差外，捻度、格林、强力等全部符合甲级纱的标准。每台布机二十小时的产量，也已从开始运转时的十多码提高到七十多码，最高的已达到九十六码。　（新华社）
