Shanghai Workers Visit Farmers in Suburban Areas and Baoshan, etc.

    On the morning of February 4th, the Shanghai Workers' Delegation visited farmers in Shanghai's suburbs and Baoshan, Qingpu, Jiaxing, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. As the cars carrying the workers' delegation passed through the green wheat fields of early spring and approached Baoshan County, farmer teams who had been waiting in the streets, cheered "Worker Elder Brothers" and came to greet them with gongs and drums. The worker representatives also shouted: "Salute to the farmer brothers." Before the workers could get out of the cars, the farmers rushed up to shake hands and exchange greetings with the workers.

    At the symposium, the two brothers started talking without introduction. They recalled that they had both suffered equally before liberation, both had turned over after liberation, and now both have gained happiness equally. Like long-lost relatives, everyone wanted to share their feelings of mutual support and mutual help in this meeting. A young farmer, Huang Laiquan, wearing a brand-new set of cotton clothes, said: "Take our cotton planting as an example. Before liberation, a mu of land yielded at most 50 to 60 jin. After liberation, in 1951, each mu yielded 100 jin, and in 1952, each mu yielded 120 jin. In 1953, not long after the cotton grew, it encountered insect pests, and red spiders were everywhere. Seeing that the cotton seedlings were about to be ruined by the insects, the sprayers and insecticides manufactured by the worker elder brothers came. The capacity of one sprayer is equivalent to dozens of our farmers. The insecticide killed pests quickly and thoroughly, resulting in our cotton yielding more than 180 jin per mu. Jiang Lao San's family, the county's model of high yield, even harvested 306 jin per mu." While recounting the process of the cotton harvest, he said gratefully: "Without the help of the worker elder brothers, it would be simply impossible." He promised to organize the cooperatives better, produce more cotton, and send it to the factories, so that the country can achieve industrialization at an early date. Zhao Ruiying, a female worker from the Shanghai No. 8 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory, said: "In 1950, there was a shortage of cotton throughout the country, and the factory was shut down for more than a month. At that time, we each looked after only four machines, but now one person can look after more than 20 machines, and we still can't use up all the cotton. Without the support of the farmer brothers, our production would not be good." Some workers said that the grain and vegetables we eat are all grown by farmers. Some farmers said: "Cloth is woven by workers, trains and cannons are made by workers, and even the pot for cooking rice is made by the working class." Everyone talked and thanked each other for their mutual support and mutual help.

    A get-together was held that afternoon. The workers presented the farmers with ten sprayers they had brought and performed wonderful programs to comfort the farmer brothers. The farmers presented their own hand-picked flowers as thank-you gifts. Finally, the farmer representatives proposed that they must produce more grain, cotton, and vegetables to support industrial construction, and the worker representatives promised to increase production even higher, make products even better, and lower costs even more, to help agricultural production and further improve the lives of farmers.

    上海工人访问郊区和宝山等地农民
    上海市工人代表团，于二月四日早晨，分别到上海郊区及宝山、青浦、嘉兴、扬州、杭州等地访问农民。当载着工人代表团的汽车，通过初春绿色的麦田，驶近宝山县城的时候，早在街头等候着的农民队伍，欢呼着“工人老大哥”敲锣打鼓地前来迎接。工人代表也高呼：“向农民弟兄致敬”。工人们还没来得及下车，农民们已经抢上来与工人握手，问好。
    在座谈会上，两兄弟见面，没经介绍就谈开了。他们回想起，解放前都同样受过痛苦，解放后都同样翻了身，现在都又同样得到了幸福。像久别重逢的亲人一样，大家都想在这次见面中，吐一吐平时互相支持，互相帮助的心情。一位穿着全套新棉衣的青年农民黄来泉说：“拿我们种棉花的情形来说，解放前，一亩田至多收五十斤到六十斤，解放后，一九五一年每亩收到一百斤，一九五二年每亩收到一百二十斤，一九五三年棉花生长出来不久，就遇到虫灾，遍地生了红蜘蛛，眼看棉苗就要给虫糟害了，这时候，工人老大哥制造的喷雾器和杀虫药来了，一部喷雾器的能力抵上我们农民几十个。杀虫又快又彻底，结果使我们的棉花每亩收到一百八十多斤，全县丰产模范蒋老三家每亩田竟收到三百零六斤。”他一面讲述着棉花丰收的经过，一面感激地说：“没有工人老大哥的帮助，简直是不可能。”他保证一定把合作社组织得更好，生产更多的棉花，送到工厂，使国家早日达到工业化。国营上海第八棉纺织厂的女工赵瑞英说：“一九五○年全国棉花不足，工厂停工一个多月，那时我们一个人只看四台机，现在一个人可以看二十多台机，棉花还用不了，不是农民兄弟的支援，我们的生产，也搞不好。”有的工人就说，我们吃的粮食和菜全是农民种出来的。有的农民就说：布是工人织的，火车、大炮是工人制造的，就连煮饭的锅子也是工人阶级制造的。大家一面谈，一面互相感激着相互间的支持，相互间的帮助。
    当天下午举行了联欢大会，工人们把带去的十部喷雾器赠送给农民，并演出精彩节目慰问农民弟兄，农民们以自己手栽的鲜花作了谢礼。最后，农民代表提出一定生产更多的粮食、棉花、蔬菜支援工业建设，工人代表保证把产量提得更高，产品做到更好，成本降的更低，帮助农业生产，进一步改善农民生活。　（吴玉水）
