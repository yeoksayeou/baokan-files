    The "National People's Delegation to慰问 the People's Liberation Army," composed of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Resistance Against America and Aid Korea General Association according to the joint enlarged meeting on February 5th, along with its various sub-delegations, set off from the capital and various regions around the Lantern Festival to慰问 the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who are diligently and heroically defending the national defense and national construction of the motherland.
    For more than twenty years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has walked together with the people of the whole country through an extremely arduous and glorious road of struggle. We salute the invincible, heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army! The Chinese people, relying on this heroic army, relying on these most outstanding sons and daughters, won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and in the War of Liberation, completely defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fully supported by American imperialism, annihilated more than eight million Kuomintang bandit troops, liberated the mainland of the country, and founded the People's Republic of China. Only by the armed revolutionary forces defeating the armed counter-revolutionary forces could the Chinese people seize political power and control their own destiny. In those arduous years, for the victory of the people, the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army endured hardships that people could hardly imagine, and many sacrificed their blood and lives. Today, the blood they shed has blossomed and borne fruit on the land of the motherland. Our great motherland has begun to implement the Five-Year Plan and has entered a period of large-scale peaceful construction. The people of the whole country, when drinking water, remember the source; how can they not sincerely thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army and remember their earth-shattering great spirit of self-sacrifice and immortal revolutionary feats!
    The Chinese people have always pursued a policy of peace, but they are by no means afraid of imperialist aggression. Just as the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea are guarding the peace in the Far East with a hundredfold vigilance, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is guarding our great motherland with a hundredfold vigilance. We salute the Army, Air Force, Navy, Special Forces, and Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who are defending the national defense and protecting economic construction! On the long sea, land, and air defense lines of the motherland, in important factories, mines, transportation lines, and large forests and grasslands, the People's Liberation Army braves wind and rain, treads on ice and snow, and diligently performs guard duties day and night, preparing to strike at any time against the harassment and sabotage activities of American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang. Any enemy who dares to invade our country will be dealt a fatal blow. In July 1953, the Chinese People's Liberation Army annihilated the Chiang bandit troops who窜犯 Dongshan Island in Fujian Province, causing the conspiracy that American imperialism had painstakingly planned for more than four months to end in a shameful failure. In order to consolidate the revolutionary social order and protect the safety of the lives and property of the people in urban and rural areas, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the enthusiastic assistance of local troops, militia, and the people, has continued to fight heroically in the past few years,剿灭 more than two million remnant Chiang bandit troops and bandits. On the invisible front of sharp struggle with the enemy, the public security forces of the People's Liberation Army have established special merits, arresting many hidden special agents and counter-revolutionaries. Now, the high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has turned into an infinitely powerful national defense force, overcoming all kinds of difficulties and building national defense into an impregnable wall. The fact that our country's economic construction has been able to develop so smoothly in the past few years and that the people have been able to enjoy a life of peace and happiness is not only inseparable from the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers, but also inseparable from the diligent vigilance of the People's Liberation Army.
    Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a fighting force, but also a working force. They not only use their blood and sweat to defend the construction of the motherland, but also do everything possible to directly participate in the construction of the motherland. We salute the fighting troops, railway troops, construction engineering troops, and reclamation troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who assist local areas in carrying out various tasks and actively participate in economic construction! Using the rest time from combat to assist local work is a glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the few years since the liberation of the whole country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made significant contributions in this regard. They spared no effort to participate in rent reduction and anti-hegemony, participated in land reform, and together with the peasants overthrew the rule of the landlord class in the countryside, helped the peasants recover their land, and established a revolutionary democratic government. They have labored selflessly in water conservancy projects such as the治淮 and Jingjiang flood diversion, in railway projects such as the Chengyu, Tianlan, Baocheng, and Lanxin, and in arduous construction projects such as the construction of the Kangzang Highway, determined to build their motherland into a civilized and advanced country. Many commanders and fighters have made new contributions to the people in these construction projects and have won the glorious title of hero and model. Many units of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the border defense have achieved significant achievements in production. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang Province has cultivated nearly 1.7 million mu of land in more than three years. In 1952, the rice yield planted by the Zhu Chuanwen Battalion of the Xinjiang Military Region exceeded the highest national record in 1951. In the minority areas, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has exemplaryly implemented the party and state's ethnic policies. They love the people of all ethnic groups, patiently publicize various policies, laws, and achievements of national construction to the people of all ethnic groups, and promote the great future of socialism. They respect local ethnic customs and beliefs, help local people overcome difficulties in production and life, resolve disputes, promote unity, and help train many minority cadres. On the road of progress of all ethnic groups, the new achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are engraved everywhere.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and is the people's own army. We salute the sons and daughters of the people—the Chinese People's Liberation Army! The Chinese People's Liberation Army comes from the people, has a flesh-and-blood connection with the people, and shares the same fate with the people. They regard the suffering of the people as their own suffering and place the interests of the people above their own interests. In July 1952, large hailstones suddenly fell in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province. In order to protect the lives and property of the people, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed there mobilized all its personnel to rescue the masses and livestock working in the fields. The Air Force also helped the people extinguish locusts and rescue floods, the Navy protected coastal fishermen from going to sea to fish and helped people in disaster areas transport grain, and the Public Security Forces helped the people rescue fires and floods. The vast number of commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, in performing these glorious tasks of loving and helping the people, were as fearless of any hardship as they were in fighting the enemy, and even did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. Such touching deeds of selflessly saving the people appeared in many troops. Helping the people fight drought, prevent floods, eliminate insects, cultivate land, harvest crops, and carry out other labor, and even saving food and clothing to help the surrounding disaster-stricken people, are regarded by the People's Liberation Army as normal and regular activities. Therefore, the people regard them as their own children, brothers, and relatives, and care for their health and life with the same love and enthusiasm, and care for the completion of the various sacred tasks they undertake. It is precisely this family-like unity and friendship that gives the Chinese People's Liberation Army the infinite power to defeat strong enemies and overcome various difficulties.
    The people's army is always moving forward. We salute the increasingly modernized Chinese People's Liberation Army in its efforts to learn! The Chinese People's Liberation Army is as heroic in learning as it is in battle. After the cultural level of the entire army has been greatly improved, in order to adapt to modern construction, it is now implementing unified command, unified training, unified system, unified organization, and unified discipline. The construction of a strong, modernized, revolutionary national defense force will provide a more reliable guarantee for the security of the motherland and the cause of economic construction.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a fighting force with a high degree of political consciousness under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. After the entire army recently studied the general line of the state, its socialist consciousness has been further improved, it has more actively completed various tasks, enthusiastically participated in universal suffrage and purchased public bonds, and is carrying out regular production and conservation movements. Many soldiers wrote letters home, mobilizing family members to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and sell surplus grain to the state to support the country's large-scale economic construction. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is doing its utmost to fight for the realization of socialism in our country.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army completed the historical task of liberating the mainland of the country, and for four years has persistently joined the Chinese People's Volunteers in defending the security of the motherland. The people of the whole country thank the great and immortal feats of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and care about the life and health of all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Army, Air Force, Navy, Special Forces, Public Security Forces, Railway Forces, Construction Engineering Forces, Reclamation Forces, and the wounded and sick soldiers in convalescence and the honorary soldiers studying in schools, and decided to send their own delegations to慰问 them; the Chinese People's Volunteers also sent delegations from afar to慰问 their close comrades-in-arms. The delegation will convey the Central Committee of the Party, the Central People's Government, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the concern of the people of the whole country to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, convey the situation of the flourishing socialist construction, and also convey the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. At present, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the people of the whole country are mobilizing all forces to build our country into a great socialist country. However, our country is still under the encirclement of capitalism, the threat of American imperialism attempting to provoke a new war of aggression has not been eliminated, and the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandits in Taiwan may also harass the coast. Therefore, the people of the whole country hope that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will be more vigilant, step up training, and continuously improve its military, political, and cultural level, skillfully master modern military science and technology, and continue to carry forward the fine traditions of hard struggle, heroic sacrifice, close unity, discipline, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance in the three domestic wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan, as well as the Chinese People's Volunteers in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and strive to build a fully modernized and powerful revolutionary army to ensure the security of the motherland, ensure the smooth progress of our country's socialist construction, and ensure peace in the Far East and the world.
    Now, the delegation is about to begin the慰问 work in various places. Around the Spring Festival, the people in various places carried out large-scale army-people celebrations and various activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of soldiers. While the delegation is carrying out the慰问 work, the people in various places should cooperate with the activities of the delegation and慰问 the People's Liberation Army stationed in the local area to fully express their love and respect for the People's Liberation Army. After the慰问, the people in various places should continue to assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out national defense construction, crack down on open and hidden enemies, care about their daily lives, help their families solve various difficulties in production or life, and help honorary soldiers and demobilized soldiers participate in production or work. With the unremitting support of the people of the whole country, we are fully confident that the Chinese People's Liberation Army will surely rapidly grow into an incomparably strong armed force, protecting the country's victorious transition to a socialist society.

    向中国人民解放军致敬
    根据中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会和中国人民抗美援朝总会常务委员会二月五日联席扩大会议的决定所组成的“全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团”总团及各总分团，于旧历元宵节前后由首都及各地分别出发，慰问辛勤地英勇地保卫着祖国国防和国家建设的中国人民解放军。
    二十多年来，中国人民解放军在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，和全国人民一起走过了极其艰苦、极其光辉的斗争道路。我们向战无不胜的英雄的中国人民解放军致敬！中国人民依靠这支英雄的军队，依靠这些最优秀的子弟，取得了抗日战争的胜利，并在解放战争中彻底打败了美帝国主义所全力支持的蒋介石匪帮，消灭了八百多万国民党匪军，解放了全国大陆，创立了中华人民共和国。武装的革命力量战胜了武装的反革命力量，中国人民才取得了政权，把命运掌握在自己手里。在过去那些艰苦的年月里，为了人民的胜利，中国人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员们忍受了人们难以想像的苦难，许多人并献出了自己的鲜血和生命。今天，他们所付出的鲜血已经在祖国的大地上开花结果，我们伟大的祖国已经开始实行五年计划，进入了大规模和平建设的时期，全国人民饮水思源，怎能不衷心感谢中国人民解放军，感念他们惊天动地的伟大自我牺牲精神和不朽的革命功勋！
    中国人民一贯奉行和平政策，但也绝不害怕帝国主义的侵略。如同中国人民志愿军在朝鲜百倍警惕地保卫着远东和平一样，中国人民解放军正在百倍警惕地保卫着我们伟大的祖国。我们向守卫祖国国防和保卫经济建设的中国人民解放军的陆军、空军、海军、特种部队和公安部队致敬！在祖国漫长的海防、陆防和空防线上，在重要的工厂、矿山、交通线和大森林、大草原上，人民解放军冒着风雨，踏着冰雪，日夜辛勤地执行警卫任务，准备随时打击美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪帮的侵扰和破坏活动。任何敢于进犯我国的敌人，都会受到致命的痛击。一九五三年七月，中国人民解放军歼灭了窜犯福建省东山岛的蒋匪军，使美帝国主义苦心筹划了四个多月的阴谋归于可耻的失败。为巩固革命的社会秩序，保护城乡人民生命财产的安全，几年来，中国人民解放军在地方部队、民兵以及人民群众的热情援助之下，继续英勇奋战，剿灭了残余的蒋匪军和土匪达二百多万名。在与敌人进行尖锐斗争的无形的战线上，人民解放军的公安部队建立了特殊的功迹，逮捕了许多潜藏的特务分子和反革命分子。现在，中国人民解放军的高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义精神，已经变成无限强大的国防力量，战胜了种种困难，把国防建设成铜墙铁壁。几年来我们国家的经济建设能够如此顺利地发展，人民能够享受和平安乐的生活，不只是和中国人民志愿军的英勇奋战分不开，也是和人民解放军的辛勤警卫分不开的。
    毛泽东同志指示说：中国人民解放军是一个战斗队，同时也是一个工作队。他们不只是用自己的血汗来保卫祖国的建设，而且也尽一切可能来直接参加祖国的建设。我们向协助地方开展各种工作和积极参加经济建设的中国人民解放军的战斗部队、铁道部队、建设工程部队和屯垦部队致敬！利用战斗余暇协助地方工作，是中国人民解放军的光荣传统。全国解放几年来，中国人民解放军在这方面作了显著的贡献。他们不辞辛劳地参加减租反霸、参加土地改革，和农民一起推翻了地主阶级在农村的统治，帮助农民收回了自己的土地，并建立起革命的民主政权。他们在治淮和荆江分洪等水利工程中，在成渝、天兰、宝成、兰新等铁路工程中，在修建康藏公路等艰巨的建设工程中，奋不顾身地劳动，决心要把自己的祖国建设成文明先进的国家。许多指挥员和战斗员都在这些建设工程中为人民立下了新的功劳，获得英雄模范的光荣称号。驻在边防的人民解放军，有许多单位都在生产上获得重大的成就。驻新疆省的人民解放军，三年多来共垦殖土地近一百七十万亩。一九五二年，新疆军区竺传文营所种植的水稻产量，超过了一九五一年全国最高纪录。在少数民族地区，中国人民解放军模范地贯彻执行了党和国家的民族政策。他们热爱各族人民，向各族人民耐心地宣传各种政策法令和国家建设的成就，宣传社会主义的远大前途。他们尊重当地民族的风俗习惯和信仰，帮助当地人民解除生产和生活上的困难，排解纠纷，促进团结，并帮助培养了许多少数民族干部。在各族人民前进的道路上，到处刻下了中国人民解放军的新的功绩。
    中国人民解放军是全心全意为人民服务的军队，是人民自己的军队。我们向人民的子弟兵——中国人民解放军致敬！中国人民解放军来自人民，与人民有着血肉的联系，与人民相依为命。他们把人民的苦难当成自己的苦难，把人民的利益放在自己的利益之上。一九五二年七月，河北省石家庄一带骤降大冰雹，驻地人民解放军某部为了保护人民的生命财产，全体出动抢救在田野中活动的群众和牲畜。空军还帮助人民扑灭蝗虫和抢救水灾，海军保护沿海渔民出海捕鱼和帮助灾区人民运送粮食，公安部队帮助人民抢救火灾水灾。广大的解放军指挥员和战斗员们在执行这些爱护人民和帮助人民的光荣任务中，也如同与敌人作战一样不畏任何艰苦，甚至不惜牺牲自己的生命。这种可歌可泣的舍身救民的事迹，出现在许多部队中。帮助人民抗旱、防洪、除虫、耕耘、收割和进行其他劳作，以至节衣缩食救济周围受灾的人民，是人民解放军视为当然的经常活动。人民因此把他们当作自己的孩子、兄弟和亲人，用同样的爱和热情关怀他们的健康和生活，关怀他们所担负的各种神圣任务的完成。正是这种亲如家人的团结和友爱，中国人民解放军才获得战胜强大敌人和克服各种困难的无穷力量。
    人民的军队永远不停地前进。我们向在努力学习中日益现代化的中国人民解放军致敬！中国人民解放军在学习中和在战斗中一样英勇。全军在文化水平大大提高之后，为适应现代化的建设，现在正实行统一的指挥，统一的训练，统一的制度，统一的编制和统一的纪律。一支强大的现代化的革命的国防军的建成，将使祖国的安全和经济建设事业获得更加可靠的保障。
    中国人民解放军是中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的具有高度政治觉悟的战斗部队。全军在最近学习国家总路线之后，社会主义觉悟进一步提高，更加积极地完成各项任务，踊跃地参加普选和认购公债，进行着经常性的生产节约运动。许多战士写信回家，动员家庭成员参加互助合作组织，把余粮卖给国家，以支援国家大规模的经济建设。中国人民解放军正竭尽全力为社会主义在我国的实现而奋斗。
    中国人民解放军完成了解放全国大陆的历史任务，四年来又坚持不懈地和中国人民志愿军共同保卫了祖国的安全。全国人民感谢中国人民解放军的伟大不朽的功绩，关怀中国人民解放军陆军、空军、海军、特种部队、公安部队、铁道部队、建设工程部队、屯垦部队，和在休养中的伤病员与在学校中学习的荣誉军人全体同志的生活和健康，决定派遣自己的代表团前往慰问他们；中国人民志愿军也派遣了代表团远道赶来慰问自己亲密的战友。代表团将传达党中央、中央人民政府、毛泽东同志和全国人民对中国人民解放军的关切的心意，传达正在蓬勃开展着的社会主义建设的情况，也将传达全国人民对于中国人民解放军的殷切期望。目前，全国人民正在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导之下，动员一切力量，为把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。但我国还处在资本主义的包围之下，美帝国主义企图挑动新的侵略战争的威胁仍未消除，台湾蒋介石残匪也有袭扰沿海的可能。因此，全国人民希望中国人民解放军更加警惕，加紧训练，不断地提高军事、政治和文化水平，熟练地掌握现代化军事科学和技术，并继续发扬在三次国内战争和抗日战争中以及中国人民志愿军在抗美援朝斗争中艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、亲密团结、遵守纪律、克服困难、坚忍不拔的优良传统，为建设成为完全现代化的强大的革命军队而努力，以保障祖国的安全，保障我国社会主义建设的顺利进行和保障远东与世界和平。
    现在，代表团即将在各地开始慰问工作。各地人民群众在春节前后曾进行了大规模的军民联欢和各种拥军优属活动。在代表团进行慰问工作同时，各地人民应该配合代表团的活动，向驻地人民解放军进行慰问，以充分表达对于人民解放军的热爱与尊敬。慰问之后，各地人民群众应该继续协助人民解放军进行国防建设，打击公开的和暗藏的敌人，关怀他们平日的生活，帮助他们的家属解决生产上或生活上的各种困难，帮助荣誉军人和转业军人参加生产或工作。在全国人民这种不遗余力的支援之下，我们完全相信，中国人民解放军必将迅速成长为一支无比坚强的武装力量，保卫着国家胜利地过渡到社会主义社会。
