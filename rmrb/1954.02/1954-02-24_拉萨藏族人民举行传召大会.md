The Great Prayer Festival, held annually by the Tibetan people of Lhasa in the first month of the Tibetan calendar, began on February 6th. This is the largest religious gathering in Lhasa of the year. February 17th also marked the Dalai Lama's ceremony for receiving the vows of a Bhikshu, so this year's Great Prayer Festival was particularly lively. Every day at dawn, the sound of Buddhist drums and horns echoed within the Jokhang Temple, and the lamas began various religious activities. Before dusk, monks, nuns, and laypeople circled the "Linkor" road and Barkhor Street, chanting scriptures and praying. Around the 15th day of the Tibetan New Year, farmers and herdsmen from all directions performed various dances under the Princess Willow tree in front of the Jokhang Temple and held horse racing and archery competitions behind the Potala Palace.

During the Great Prayer Festival each year, the population of Lhasa increases significantly. This year, the Lhasa Municipal People's Hospital has specially prepared a large quantity of medical equipment and expanded its outpatient services to serve the Tibetan monks, nuns, and laypeople participating in the Great Prayer Festival. In order to maintain environmental sanitation in the city during the Great Prayer Festival, the Lhasa Municipal Sanitation Committee sends cleaning teams out daily to patrol and remove garbage from the urban area. The Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region distributed tens of thousands of Tibetan-language propaganda materials during the Great Prayer Festival, publicizing Chairman Mao's policies of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief, which were warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people.

    拉萨藏族人民举行传召大会
    藏族人民每年藏历正月在拉萨举行的传召大会，已于二月六日开始举行，这是拉萨一年内最大的一次宗教集会，二月十七日又值达赖喇嘛受比丘戒典礼，故今年传召的景象特别热闹。每天黎明，大昭寺内便响起了佛鼓佛号的声音，喇嘛们开始进行各种宗教活动。黄昏前，僧俗男女围绕着“林廓”大道和八角街念经祈祷。藏历正月十五日前后，从四方赶来的农、牧民们在大昭寺前的公主柳下表演各种舞蹈，在布达拉宫后面举行赛马射箭。
    拉萨市每年在传召期间，人口便要增加很多，今年拉萨市人民医院特地准备了大批医药器材，扩大了门诊业务，替参加传召的藏族僧俗人民服务。为了保持市区在传召时期的环境卫生，拉萨市清洁卫生委员会每天派出清洁队巡回清除市区垃圾。中国人民解放军西藏军区政治部在传召大会期间散发了数万份藏文宣传品，宣传毛主席民族平等和宗教信仰自由的政策，受到藏族人民的热烈欢迎。
