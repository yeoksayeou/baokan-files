    Fully Exploit the Potential of Highway Transportation and Strive to Complete Transportation Tasks
    Zhu Shuntian, Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau of the Central Ministry of Transportation

    Highway transportation is a highly mobile transportation force. In China's current situation, in addition to independently undertaking trunk and branch line transportation tasks in areas where trunk line transportation tools are lacking (such as in Xinjiang, Guizhou, and other provinces), highway transportation is closely linked with trunk line transportation in four forms: (1) as a branch or capillary of trunk line transportation, such as the highway routes from Jinhua, Zhejiang to Lishui, Shangrao, Jiangxi to Nanping, Fujian, Handan, Hebei to Changzhi, Shanxi, Hankou, Hubei to Mengjialou (border of Henan and Hubei), Zhangjiakou, Hebei to Beizi Temple, Inner Mongolia, Panshi, Jilin to Huadian, and Baoji, Shaanxi to Hanzhong, connecting fertile agricultural areas, industrial and mining areas, and minority areas with transportation trunk lines, railways, or the Yangtze River; (2) as an extension or relay line of trunk line transportation, such as the highway routes from Guangzhou to the Leizhou Peninsula, Jinchengjiang, Guangxi to Guiyang, and Lanzhou westward to Xinjiang, directly linked to railways for relay transportation; (3) as a short-distance parallel line to trunk line transportation, such as the highway route from Beijing to Tianjin, with some areas stipulating that transportation within 30 or 50 kilometers along the railway line is to be undertaken by highway transportation, these highway routes undertake short-distance transportation unsuitable for trunk line transportation; (4) as a connecting line for various trunk line transportation tools, such as the highway from Yantai, Shandong to Weifang, connecting the seaport with the railway, and short-distance connecting transportation from the station to the sea and river docks is even more common. Thus, it can be seen that highway transportation is a powerful assistant to trunk line transportation tools, a mobile force on the transportation front, a vanguard in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and an indispensable department in the national economy. If highway transportation cannot keep up with the increasing development of industrial and agricultural production and cannot meet the growing needs of all aspects, it will not only increase the burden on railway trunk line transportation tools, but also affect the expansion of material exchange between urban and rural areas, affect the increase in industrial production and the expansion of sales tasks, and affect the completion of basic construction tasks. Therefore, striving to complete highway transportation tasks is of extremely great significance for ensuring the completion of production and basic construction of other enterprises.

    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party committees and governments at all levels, all employees of the highway transportation departments have made many achievements. Especially in 1953 – the first year of the country's planned economic construction – due to the development of the "safety, four quotas (implementing quotas for fuel consumption, tire consumption, repair mileage, repair labor and materials, etc.), two thousand ton-kilometers (2,000 kilometers transported per ton of transport capacity per month)" campaign and the increase production and practice economy campaign, according to incomplete statistics, national state-owned and local state-owned automobiles completed 116% of the annual freight turnover plan and 112% of the passenger turnover plan; in terms of vehicle ton-year output, freight transport increased by 57% compared to 1952, and passenger transport increased by 46%. However, because many highway transportation enterprises cannot clearly grasp the source of goods, cannot plan and dispatch and use public and private vehicles to maximize the effectiveness of various tools, and cannot gradually reduce the imbalance between vehicles and goods between seasons and regions; many major scientific management systems have not yet been established in enterprise management; and the socialist transformation of private automobiles and the vast number of private horse carts has not yet been carried out in a planned manner. Therefore, there is still a contradictory phenomenon in highway transportation nationwide: on the one hand, transportation capacity is insufficient, and the growth of transportation capacity cannot keep up with the growth rate of transportation volume, and there are frequent cases of material backlog; on the other hand, a large potential transportation capacity has not been fully utilized, and the phenomenon of vehicles being repaired beyond the plan and running empty or idle is still serious in many highway transportation enterprises. For example, based on the calculation of state-owned and local state-owned freight vehicles, the average vehicle repair rate in 1953 was as high as 33%, the empty running rate was 25%, and the idle rate was 15%. Traffic accidents also occur frequently, and transportation costs are still high. The transportation capacity of many private automobiles and horse carts is even less utilized.

    In order for highway transportation to better serve socialist construction, meet the needs of the national economy, and smoothly complete transportation tasks, it is necessary to strive to overcome this contradictory phenomenon and fully exploit the potential of highway transportation. To this end, it is necessary to gradually ascertain the situation of passenger and freight sources and their circulation patterns, plan and dispatch and fully use public and private transportation forces, gradually implement planned transportation, thereby improving the level of operation and management; and gradually reduce freight rates on the basis of reducing costs, and carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign in a thorough and regular manner. Although the level of development of highway transportation work varies from place to place, the following main tasks should generally be done well in 1954:

    First, establish and improve the consignment planning system and conduct line economic investigation work. Highway transportation departments at all levels should proactively report the transportation work situation and existing problems to the local Party committees and government financial and economic committees in detail, and under their leadership and assistance, strive for the cooperation and coordination of cargo owners and other transportation departments. First of all, cargo owners are required to compile consignment plans accurately and on time, and to strengthen loading and unloading work and transportation preparation work. During the off-season for freight transportation, various transportation departments should encourage cargo owners to deliver goods in advance; during the peak season for freight transportation, goods should be ranked according to urgency and importance, and duplicate transportation should be avoided; for routes with transportation imbalances, cargo owners should be encouraged to provide return goods as much as possible. In short, all measures should be taken to gradually eliminate unreasonable phenomena such as vehicle idling and empty running and duplicate transportation. In addition, highway transportation departments at all levels should conduct economic investigations of major routes in a planned and step-by-step manner, clarify the types, quantities, and flows of goods, the proportion of public and private transportation, etc., and proactively assist major cargo owners in compiling consignment plans, and correct the passive thinking of some highway transportation departments who sit and wait for consignment plans or blame cargo owners without examining themselves. The national economy is an indivisible whole, and no department can carry out activities in isolation. It must not only proactively assist and cooperate with others, but also obtain assistance and cooperation from all other aspects. Because highway transportation has the characteristics of connecting transportation, highway transportation departments should firmly establish this idea of collaboration and cooperation.

    Second, continue to improve all aspects of the enterprise with planned management as the center. Because highway transportation has the characteristics of mobility and dispersion, without a unified plan to unify the work of vehicles, station services, repairs, and supply, it is easy to cause transportation inefficiencies and waste of transportation capacity. Although various highway transportation enterprises have established certain planned management systems in 1953, they are generally not very thorough or comprehensive. Therefore, highway transportation departments in various places should still improve all aspects of the enterprise with planned management as the center. When implementing planned management, it is necessary to mobilize all employees to seriously discuss and revise various planned indicators. Each motor vehicle team should start by correctly arranging maintenance and repair cycles, and minimizing the distance between the planned transportation capacity and the consignment plan; repair and maintenance yards should start by minimizing the distance between the repair capacity and the vehicle team's repair plan, and formulate specific plans and guarantee measures for each vehicle, vehicle team, and repair and maintenance group; the dispatching organization must be strengthened in each transportation company and repair and maintenance plant, and a dispatching responsibility system must be established to minimize vehicle idling and downtime, complete repair plans, prevent transportation and repair interruptions, and conscientiously promote the circulation vehicle dispatching method and passenger bus schedule charts that have been effectively implemented in some provinces and cities in transportation; it is necessary to insist on establishing a technical responsibility system in companies, vehicle teams, and repair and maintenance plants, as well as process inspection in repair and maintenance, and conscientiously promote key advanced experiences such as driving, repairing, improving, and creating machines and using restored old and waste parts, so that they become regular work, to ensure driving and production safety, extend vehicle life, ensure repair quality, and shorten repair time; it is necessary to continue to implement various technical and economic quotas, especially management personnel quotas and deferred quotas (such as tire mileage, repair mileage, etc.), to ensure the completion of the cost plan; it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological work in enterprises, improve the political and ideological level of employees, and educate all employees to establish the concept of "providing the country with large, high-quality, low-cost, fast, and safe transportation capacity," overcome bourgeois ideology and the idea of not paying attention to economic accounting.

    Third, highway transportation enterprises must, under the guidance of the spirit of the country's general line and general task during the transition period, and under the leadership of the local Party committee and the financial and economic committee, carry out socialist transformation of private automobile transportation and professional horse-drawn carriage transportation in a planned, step-by-step, and differentiated manner. It is necessary to summarize the existing experience in implementing public-private joint ventures in the capitalist automobile and horse-drawn carriage transportation industry, and summarize the experience in implementing mutual assistance and cooperation in the individual automobile and horse-drawn carriage transportation industry, and actively create different transformation methods and experiences for capitalist economic components and individual economic components using pilot methods. It is necessary to constantly and continuously conduct education on the country's general line and general task during the transition period for them, strengthen leadership over them, correctly exert their transportation effectiveness, gradually incorporate their transportation forces into the national plan, prevent blind competition, and restrict the capitalist automobile and horse-drawn carriage transporters' behaviors that are profit-oriented and opportunistic and are not conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and overcome the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of individual automobile and horse-drawn carriage transporters. In addition, attention should be paid to the mutual division of labor and combination of horse-drawn carriages and other folk transportation tools with automobiles, and under the principle of planning and mutual benefit, various backward transportation tools should be organized to concentrate freight from both sides of the road for automobiles.

    The transportation task facing the highway transportation department this year will be more arduous than in 1953. For example, the phenomenon of material backlogs in many places is continuing to develop, and the situation of "the off-season is not light, and the peak season is even busier" is becoming more obvious. Although there are still temporary vehicle idle phenomena in some places, with the development of economic construction, this year's transportation task will also greatly increase compared with last year. Therefore, highway transportation departments in various places must continue to improve their work on the basis of their work achievements in 1953, fully exploit transportation potential, and strive to successfully complete this year's transportation tasks.

    充分发挥公路运输的潜在力量，努力完成运输任务
    中央交通部运输局副局长　朱顺田
    公路运输是一种机动性很大的运输力量。就我国现有情况来说，公路运输除了在干线运输工具缺乏的地区（如在新疆、贵州等省），独立担负着干线和支线运输任务外，它和干线运输在四种形式下密切联系着：（一）作为干线运输的支线或微血管，如浙江金华到丽水，江西上饶到福建南平，河北邯郸到山西长治，湖北汉口到孟家楼（河南，湖北交界），河北张家口到内蒙贝子庙，吉林磐石到桦甸，陕西宝鸡到汉中等公路路线，把丰沃的农产区，工矿区及少数民族区与交通干线铁路或长江联接起来；（二）作为干线运输的延伸线或接力线，如广州到雷州半岛，广西金城江到贵阳，兰州以西到新疆等公路线直接与铁路挂勾，进行接力运输；（三）作为干线运输的短途平行线，如北京到天津的公路线，有些地方还规定铁路沿线三十公里或五十公里以内的运输由公路运输担负，这些公路线担负着不适于干线运输的短途运输；（四）作为各种干线运输工具的联接线，如山东烟台到潍坊，联接着海港与铁路，至于从车站到海河码头之间的短距离联接运输更为普遍。由此可见，公路运输是干线运输工具的有力助手，是运输战线上的一支机动部队，是城乡物资交流中的尖兵，是国民经济中一个不可缺少的部门。在工农业生产日益发展的时候，公路运输如果跟不上去，不能适应各方面日益增长的需要，那末，不但会增加铁路干线运输工具的负担，而且会影响到扩大城乡物资交流，影响到工业增产及扩大销售任务，会影响到基本建设任务的完成。因此，努力完成公路运输任务，对保证其他企业部门的生产和基本建设的完成，就有极其重大的意义。
    几年来，公路运输部门的全体职工，在各级党委与政府的领导下，已经做出了不少成绩。特别在一九五三年——国家进入有计划的经济建设的第一年，由于“安全、四定（贯彻燃料消耗、轮胎消耗，修理里程，修理工料等四个定额）、两千吨公里
  （每一吨运输力量每月运输两千公里）”运动与增产节约运动的开展，据不完全统计，全国国营及地方国营汽车完成全年货运周转量计划的百分之一百一十六，完成客运周转量计划的百分之一百一十二；就车吨年产量计，货运比一九五二年增加百分之五十七，客运增加百分之四十六。但是，由于许多公路运输企业还不能清醒地掌握货源，不能有计划地调度与使用公、私车辆，以发挥各种工具的效能，不能逐步缩小季节间以及地区间的车货不平衡现象；在企业经营管理上许多主要的科学管理制度还没有建立起来；对私营汽车及广大私营马车的社会主义改造工作还没有有计划的开展。因此，目前全国公路运输仍然存在着一种矛盾现象：一方面是运输力量不足，运输力量的增长赶不上运输量的增长速度，时常发生物资积压现象；另一方面很大的运输潜在力量，未能充分发挥，许多公路运输企业车辆超计划修理及空驶、停歇现象仍然严重，如以国营及地方国营货运汽车计算一九五三年平均车辆修理率高达百分之三十三，空驶率达百分之二十五，停歇率达百分之十五。行车事故也经常不断发生，运输成本还很高。许多私营汽车及马车的运输力量发挥得更不够。
    为使公路运输更好地为社会主义建设服务，满足国民经济的需要，顺利完成运输任务，就必须努力克服这一矛盾现象，充分发挥公路运输的潜在力量。为此，必须逐步摸清客货源情况及其流转规律，有计划地调度与充分使用公、私运输力量，逐步实行计划运输，从而提高经营管理的水平；并在降低成本的基础上逐步降低运价，把增产节约运动深入地经常地开展下去。各地公路运输工作的发展水平虽不平衡，但在一九五四年一般都应做好以下几个主要工作：
    第一，建立与健全托运计划制度并进行线路经济调查工作。各级公路运输部门都应当主动地把运输工作情况和存在的问题，向当地党委及政府的财政经济委员会详细汇报，并在他们的领导与协助下，争取货主和其他运输部门的协作配合。首先要求货主按时而正确地编制托运计划，加强装卸工作与运输准备工作。各运输部门在货运淡季应提倡与鼓励货主提前运送货物；在货运旺季应根据缓急轻重实行货物排队，并避免重复运输；在运输不平衡的路线应提倡与鼓励货主尽量提供回程货物。总之，要采取一切措施以逐步消灭车辆停歇与空驶和重复运输等不合理现象。此外，各级公路运输部门还应该有计划有步骤地进行主要线路的经济调查工作，将货物品种、数量、流向，公私比例等情况弄清，并主动协助主要货主编制托运计划，纠正有些公路运输部门坐等托运计划或不检讨自己只埋怨货主的消极思想。国民经济是一个不可分割的整体，任何部门绝不能孤立地进行活动，它既要主动协助与配合别人，又要取得其他各方面的协助与配合。由于公路运输具有联接运输的特点，公路运输部门更应该坚定地树立这一协作配合的思想。
    第二，继续以计划管理为中心，改进企业各个方面的工作。由于公路运输具有机动性与分散性的特点，如果没有一个统一的计划把车辆、站务、修理、供应各个环节的工作统一起来，就很容易造成运输不灵与运力浪费的现象。一九五三年各公路运输企业虽已建立了某些计划管理制度，但一般还十分不深入，不全面，因此，各地公路运输部门仍应以计划管理为中心，改进企业各方面的工作。在贯彻计划管理时，必须发动全体职工认真讨论与修正各项计划指标，各汽车队应从正确安排保养与修理周期，尽量缩小运输能力计划与托运计划的距离着手；修理保养场则应从缩小修理能力与车队送修计划的距离着手，订出各车上、车队和修理保养小组的具体计划和保证措施；必须在各运输公司及修理保养厂中加强调度机构，建立调度责任制，以尽量减少车辆空驶与停歇，完成修理计划，防止运输与修理中断，并在运输中认真推行某些省、市已经行之有效的循环调车方法及客运班车运行图表；必须坚持在公司、车队，及修理保养厂中认真建立技术责任制，以及修理保养中的过程检验，认真推广驾驶、修理、改进与创造机具及利用修复旧废配件等关键性的先进经验，使之成为经常工作，以保证行车及生产安全，延长车辆寿命，保证修车质量，缩短修车时间；必须继续贯彻各种技术经济定额，特别是管理人员定额及递延性定额（如轮胎里程，修理里程等），保证成本计划的完成；必须在企业中加强政治思想工作，提高职工的政治思想水平，教育全体职工树立“为国家提供量大、质好、价廉、迅速、安全的运输力”的观念，克服资产阶级思想和不注意经济核算的思想。
    第三，公路运输企业必须根据国家过渡时期总路线与总任务的精神，在当地党委及财政经济委员会的领导下，对私营汽车运输业和专业马车运输业，有计划、有步骤、有区别地实行社会主义改造。必须总结已有的对资本主义汽车、马车运输业实行公私合营的经验，及总结个体汽车、马车运输业实行互助合作的经验，并用试点办法积极创造对资本主义经济成分及个体经济成分的不同改造方法与经验。必须经常不断地对它们进行国家过渡时期总路线与总任务的教育，加强对它们的领导，正确地发挥它们的运输效能，把它们的运输力量逐步纳入国家计划的轨道，防止盲目竞争，对资本主义汽车、马车运输业者的唯利是图、投机取巧等不利于国计民生的行为必须加以限制，克服个体汽车、马车运输业者的自发的资本主义倾向。此外，并须注意马车及其他各种民间运输工具与汽车的相互分工与结合，在有计划与两利的原则下，组织各种落后运输工具从公路两旁为汽车集中货源。
    摆在公路运输部门面前的运输任务，今年将比一九五三年更加紧张。比如现在许多地方的物资积压现象正在继续发展，“淡季不淡，旺季更忙”的形势更加明显，有些地方虽然目前还暂时存在着车辆空闲现象，但随着经济建设的发展，今年的运输任务也将比去年大大增加。因此，各地公路运输部门必须在一九五三年工作成绩的基础上继续把工作提高一步，充分发挥运输潜力，争取胜利完成今年的运输任务。
