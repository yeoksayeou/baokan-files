Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The movement against the U.S.-orchestrated U.S.-Pakistan military treaty has been widely launched in Asian countries in recent months.

The United States' conspiracy to harness Pakistan to its war chariot has been strongly opposed by the Pakistani people. Mansur, acting general secretary of the Communist Party of Pakistan, pointed out in a statement issued in December last year that the United States is attempting to turn Pakistan into a war base through the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty and use Pakistani soldiers as cannon fodder to realize its policy of "using Asians to fight Asians." The statement called on all political parties, all patriotic groups, and freedom-loving people in Pakistan to form a united front against the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty.

The protest movement against the United States dragging Pakistan into aggressive wars is rising among the people of all strata in Pakistan. The Jinnah People's Muslim League, the Free Pakistan Party, the Sindh Provincial Trade Union Committee, the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, the Sindh Provincial Farmers' Committee, and the Pakistan Bank Employees' Union issued a joint statement in December last year opposing the acceptance of U.S. military "aid." National organizations of students, youth, women, and progressive writers in Pakistan have also issued statements separately, calling on the Pakistani people to unite to defend the country's freedom and independence. Under the call of the East Pakistan Peace Committee, East Pakistan held a "Day for Defending Peace and Independence" on New Year's Day this year. Mass rallies were held in many cities and villages, strongly protesting the proposed U.S.-Pakistan military treaty. In West Pakistan, the Sindh People's Front passed a resolution condemning the U.S. aggressive conspiracy, and political workers in the Northwest Frontier Province also launched a signature campaign against the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty.

In India, which borders Pakistan, people from all walks of life across the country have responded enthusiastically to the call of the All-India Peace Council and held a "Day Against the U.S.-Pakistan Military Treaty" on February 14. This is a new upsurge in the Indian movement against the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty. The All-India Peace Council pointed out that the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty is part of the "U.S. government's plan to seize world hegemony," and the United States "intends to use this treaty to worsen the tense situation between India and Pakistan, thereby gaining control over the two countries." A statement by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Ghosh, expressing full support for the "Day Against the U.S.-Pakistan Military Treaty," pointed out: "U.S. imperialism, regardless of the opposition of many governments in Asia and the opposition of Pakistan's democratic public opinion, insists on implementing its plan… This increasingly requires further strengthening and expanding the movement against this U.S. action, striving for the participation of people from all walks of life, and strengthening friendship and unity with the people of Pakistan." The 59th annual meeting of the Indian National Congress also expressed serious concern about the U.S. military "aid" to Pakistan. Indian Prime Minister Nehru pointed out that the U.S. military "aid" to Pakistan is a serious threat to India. Ten thousand representatives of various sects of Hinduism held a conference on the banks of the Ganges River near Allahabad, vowing to fight for the unity of the Indian people facing the threat of the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty. Muslims in Madras also held a conference and called on the Pakistani people not to allow others to turn them into "U.S. cannon fodder." Young people and students across India widely responded to the call of the All-India Students' Federation and held a "Day of Protest Against the U.S.-Pakistan Military Treaty" on January 22. In an open letter to Pakistani women, the All-India Women's Liaison Committee guaranteed that Indian women would support Pakistani women in their struggle against U.S. aggression. The open letter said: Indian women hate war, and they very much hope to live and raise their children in a peaceful environment. Throughout India, from Calcutta in the east to Mumbai in the west, from Madras Province in the south to East Punjab in the north, demonstrations and mass rallies were held against the United States establishing war hotbeds on both sides of India. In Ludhiana, East Punjab alone, more than 10,000 people participated in a demonstration held on January 8 in the rain.

In Nepal, leaders of parties such as the National Congress Party, the National Democratic Party, and the People's Congress have expressed deep concern about the planned U.S.-Pakistan military treaty. Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala also believes that the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty will complicate the situation in Asia and lead to unfortunate consequences.

The U.S. conspiracy to plan the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty has also aroused strong protests in Southeast Asian countries such as Ceylon, Burma, and Indonesia. Newspapers in Ceylon continue to expose the U.S. conspiracy. The "Ceylon Observer" believes that the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty is "the most disturbing news at present." The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace also denounced the U.S. aggressive scheme to plan military bases in Pakistan. The "Rangoon Burmese Newspaper" published an editorial saying: "The rumored U.S.-Pakistan military alliance cannot but make Burma feel uneasy." Indonesian public opinion widely condemned the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty. "Independent Newspaper" wrote: "Indonesia believes that U.S. military assistance (to Pakistan) is a threat to the security of Asian countries along the Pacific coast—including Indonesia."

Because the U.S.-planned U.S.-Pakistan military treaty is also part of its plan to piece together a Middle East aggressive bloc, it has also been strongly opposed by public opinion in the Near and Middle East countries and by some government leaders. Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan pointed out at the end of last year that, in his view, U.S. military "aid" to Pakistan is a serious threat to peace and the security of Afghanistan. The Afghan "Friendship Newspaper" pointed out that "every step the United States and Pakistan take towards concluding a military treaty will arouse protests from the people of Asian countries." Egyptian President Naguib believes that the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty is a hostile act against Arab countries. While criticizing the U.S. plan to piece together a Middle East aggressive bloc, Iraqi National Democratic Party leader Chadhaji pointed out that the United States is trying to rely on Pakistan and Turkey to force Arab countries to accept that plan. The Arab people will continue to strongly oppose this imperialist conspiracy.

Since the U.S.-planned U.S.-Pakistan military treaty has posed a new threat to Asian peace, the people of China and the Soviet Union have expressed due concern about the U.S.-Pakistan military negotiations; at the same time, peace-loving people all over the world are giving strong support to the rising struggle movement of Asian countries against the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty.

The U.S. government's conspiracy to plan the U.S.-Pakistan military treaty has aroused unprecedentedly widespread and strong opposition in Asian countries, which shows that the U.S. ruling clique, which adheres to an aggressive policy, is becoming increasingly isolated in Asia.

    亚洲人民一致反对美巴军事条约
    美国统治集团坚持侵略政策在亚洲日趋孤立
       【新华社十九日讯】反对美国策划美巴军事条约的运动，这几个月来已在亚洲各国广泛展开。
    美国要把巴基斯坦套在美国战车上的阴谋，首先受到巴基斯坦人民的强烈反对。巴基斯坦共产党代理总书记曼苏尔在去年十二月间发表的声明中指出：美国企图通过美巴军事条约来把巴基斯坦变为战争基地，并把巴基斯坦士兵当作炮灰，以实现它的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策。声明号召巴基斯坦一切政党、一切爱国团体和爱好自由的人士，组成一个统一阵线，反对美巴军事条约。
    反对美国把巴基斯坦拖入侵略战争的抗议运动，正在巴基斯坦各阶层民众中日益高涨起来。真纳人民回教联盟、自由巴基斯坦党、信德省工会委员会、全巴基斯坦和平委员会、信德省农民委员会和巴基斯坦银行职员联合会在去年十二月发表了反对接受美国军事“援助”的联合声明。巴基斯坦的学生、青年、妇女和进步作家的全国性组织，也都分别发表了声明，号召巴基斯坦人民团结起来保卫国家的自由和独立。在东巴基斯坦和平委员会的号召下，东巴基斯坦在今年元旦举行了“保卫和平与独立日”。许多城市和乡村，都举行了群众集会，强烈抗议拟议中的美巴军事条约。在西巴基斯坦，信德省人民阵线通过了谴责美国侵略阴谋的决议，西北省政治工作者也发起了反对美巴军事条约的签名运动。
    在与巴基斯坦毗邻的印度，全国各地各阶层都风起云涌地响应全印和平理事会的号召，在二月十四日举行了“反对美巴军事条约日”。这是印度反对美巴军事条约运动的新的高涨。全印和平理事会指出：美巴军事条约是“美国政府夺取世界霸权计划”的一部分，美国“存心要利用这个条约来使印巴之间的紧张局势恶化，从而取得对这两个国家的支配权。”印度共产党总书记高士在表示完全支持
  “反对美巴军事条约日”的声明中指出：“美帝国主义不顾亚洲许多政府的反对，也不顾巴基斯坦的民主公众舆论的反对，坚持执行它的计划……这就日益需要进一步加强并扩大反对美国这种行动的运动，争取各阶层人士参加，同时，并加强与巴基斯坦人民的友谊团结。”印度国大党第五十九届年会对美国给予巴基斯坦军事“援助”也表示严重关切。印度总理尼赫鲁指出：美国给予巴基斯坦的军事“援助”是对印度的严重的威胁。印度教各派别的代表一万人曾在阿拉哈巴德城附近的恒河岸边举行大会，宣誓要为面临美巴军事条约威胁的印度人民的团结而斗争。马德拉斯城的回教徒也举行了大会，并呼吁巴基斯坦人民不要容许别人把他们变成“美国的炮灰”。印度全国青年和学生广泛响应全印学生联合会的号召，在一月二十二日举行了“反对美巴军事条约抗议日”。印度全国妇女联络委员会在致巴基斯坦妇女的公开信中，保证印度妇女将支持巴基斯坦妇女为反对美国侵略而进行的斗争。公开信说：印度妇女憎恨战争，她们非常希望在和平的环境中生活和抚养她们的子女。印度全国各地，从东部的加尔各答到西部的孟买，从南部的马德拉斯省到北部的东旁遮普省都举行了反对美国在印度的两侧建立战争温床的示威游行和群众大会。单是东旁遮普省卢德希那，一月八日举行的示威游行就有一万多人冒雨参加。
    在尼泊尔，民族国大党、国家民主党和人民会等党派的领袖，都对策划中的美巴军事条约深表忧虑。尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊也认为美巴军事条约会使亚洲的局势复杂起来，并将导致不幸的后果。
    美国策划美巴军事条约的阴谋同样在锡兰、缅甸、印度尼西亚等东南亚国家引起了强烈的抗议。锡兰的报纸不断揭露美国的阴谋。“锡兰观察家报”认为美巴军事条约是“目前最令人不安的消息”。缅甸保卫世界和平委员会也指斥了美国在巴基斯坦策划军事基地的侵略勾当。“仰光缅甸人报”发表社论说：“传说中的美巴军事同盟不能不使缅甸感到不安。”印度尼西亚的舆论广泛斥责美巴军事条约。“独立报”写道：“印尼认为，美国（对巴基斯坦）的军事援助对太平洋沿岸的亚洲国家——包括印尼在内——的安全是一种威胁。”
    由于美国策划的美巴军事条约也是它拼凑中东侵略集团的计划的一部分，因此，它也受到近中东各国的公众舆论和若干政府领袖的强烈反对。阿富汗首相穆罕默德·达乌德汗在去年年底指出：照他看来，美国对巴基斯坦的军事“援助”是对和平与阿富汗的安全的严重威胁。阿富汗“友谊报”指出：美国和巴基斯坦“每向缔结军事条约走一步，都要引起亚洲各国人民的抗议”。埃及总统纳吉布认为美巴军事条约是对阿拉伯国家的一种敌对行为。伊拉克国家民主党领袖查大基在抨击美国拼凑中东侵略集团的计划时指出：美国企图依靠巴基斯坦和土耳其来强迫阿拉伯国家接受那个计划。阿拉伯人民将继续强烈反对这种帝国主义的阴谋。
    由于美国策划的美巴军事条约已对亚洲和平造成新的威胁，中国和苏联的人民，已对美巴军事谈判表示了应有的关切；同时，全世界爱好和平的人民，也正在给予高涨中的亚洲各国反对美巴军事条约的斗争运动以有力的支持。
    美国政府策划美巴军事条约的阴谋，在亚洲各国引起了规模空前广泛的强烈反对，这说明了坚持侵略政策的美国统治集团正在亚洲日趋孤立。
