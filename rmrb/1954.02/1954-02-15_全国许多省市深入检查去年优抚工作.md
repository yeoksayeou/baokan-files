    Many Provinces and Cities Across the Country Conduct In-depth Inspections of Last Year's Preferential Treatment Work
    According to the notice from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, many provinces and cities across the country have begun inspecting the preferential treatment work of 1953 around the Spring Festival.

    Some regions have conducted inspections of the preferential treatment work by holding various meetings. Not long ago, twenty-one counties and cities in Anhui Province, at meetings conveying the general line to representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, etc., combined this with inspections of the preferential treatment work over the past year. This inspection is currently being, or will soon be, conducted in depth at forums of representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and mass representatives held at the township level in each county. Five districts in Shanghai, including Jiangning, have successively invited representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and demobilized and transferred soldiers to hold forums, soliciting their opinions or suggestions on the preferential treatment work. In addition, three districts, including Hongkou, have inspected the preferential treatment work at meetings of the district preferential treatment work committees. Before the Spring Festival, all cities and villages in Xikang Province also held forums of representatives of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents, based on police station jurisdictions or townships, to discuss issues of improving preferential treatment work.

    Dispatching cadres to form inspection teams to conduct in-depth investigations in cities and villages is also an important method for various regions to inspect preferential treatment work. In early January, the Northeast Administrative Committee dispatched cadres to form four inspection teams to inspect the resettlement of demobilized and transferred soldiers in provinces and cities such as Songjiang, Liaodong, Shenyang, and Fushun. Henan Province dispatched more than 200 cadres to 30 counties and cities in nine special districts within the province to conduct inspections of the preferential treatment work in conjunction with consolation activities. In early January, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government dispatched two groups to Shantou, Chaozhou, Jiangmen, Foshan, Shiqi, and other cities and towns to inspect the organization of production and job placement for revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents. The inspection has now been completed. Recently, five more groups have been organized to inspect the work of land cultivation on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents in rural areas in the five administrative regions of eastern Guangdong, western Guangdong, central Guangdong, northern Guangdong, and Hainan. Fuzhou City organized forty-four visiting teams to conduct in-depth investigations and inspections of the production and living conditions of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents in various streets before the Spring Festival. The people's governments of each district will formulate a preferential treatment work plan for 1954 based on the results of this inspection. Xi'an City also dispatched inspection teams to the suburbs to inspect the land cultivation work on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents in four townships, and at the same time inspected the district people's government's implementation of preferential treatment policies.

    During the inspection of preferential treatment work, some regions have paid attention to promptly resolving certain issues of helping revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents with production and improving their lives. Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces, while conducting inspections, are also combining this with typical pilot projects for rectifying land cultivation organizations. Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, decided to help revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents with winter production work such as topdressing wheat fields through inspection. After inspection, the preferential treatment work in some regions has been initially improved. The Sixth District of Xi'an City, where Hui people live in concentrated communities, held nine forums of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents before the Spring Festival. At the meetings, revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents raised more than 100 suggestions for improving preferential treatment work, and the problems discovered through inspection were promptly handled. Four revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents who requested employment have been introduced to apply for the state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory, and seven revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents with temporary difficulties have received subsidies. After inspecting the preferential treatment work in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, the county people's government distributed 50 million yuan in construction subsidies, and the local people voluntarily contributed labor and materials to help demobilized and transferred soldiers build 147 houses. After inspection, the West District of Guangzhou City is now starting to help revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents establish a handicraft cooperative to solve their living difficulties.

    全国许多省市深入检查去年优抚工作
    按照中央人民政府内务部的通知，全国已有许多省、市在春节前后开始检查了一九五三年的优抚工作。
    有些地区通过召开各种会议来对优抚工作进行检查。安徽省不久前已有二十一个县、市在向烈属、军属等代表传达总路线的会议上，结合检查了一年来的优抚工作。这种检查目前还正在或即将在各县以乡为单位召开的烈属、军属、复员转业军人代表和群众代表座谈会上来深入进行。上海市江宁等五个区已先后邀请烈属、军属和复员转业军人代表举行了座谈会，征求他们对优抚工作的意见或建议，另外有虹口等三个区已在区的优抚工作委员会会议上，检查了优抚工作。西康省各城市和乡村也都在春节前一周内以派出所辖区或乡为单位召开了烈属、军属代表座谈会，讨论改进优抚工作问题。
    抽调干部组成检查组重点深入城市和乡村，也是各地检查优抚工作的一项重要方法。东北行政委员会在一月上旬抽调干部组成四个检查组分赴松江、辽东、沈阳、抚顺等省、市检查对复员转业军人的安置情况。河南省抽调了二百多名干部分赴省内九个专区的三十个县、市结合慰问进行对优抚工作的检查。广东省人民政府在一月初就派出两个组到汕头、潮州、江门、佛山、石岐等市、镇检查组织烈属、军属生产和介绍就业的情况，现已检查完毕；最近又组织了五个组分别到粤东、粤西、粤中、粤北和海南五个行政区检查农村的代耕工作。福州市组织了四十四个访问队，在春节前分别深入各街道重点了解和检查烈属、军属的生产、生活情况，各区人民政府将根据这次检查的结果订出一九五四年优抚工作计划。西安市也派出检查组到郊区检查了四个乡的代耕工作，同时检查了区人民政府执行优抚政策的情况。
    在检查优抚工作中，有些地区已注意到及时解决帮助烈属、军属生产和改善他们生活的若干问题。辽东、辽西两省在检查的同时，都要结合进行整顿代耕组织的典型试办工作。江苏省射阳县决定通过检查帮助烈属、军属做好麦田追肥等冬季生产工作。经过检查，有些地区的优抚工作已有了初步改进。西安市回民聚居的第六区，在春节前召开了九次烈属、军属座谈会，烈属、军属们在会上提了一百多件改进优抚工作的建议，经过检查发现的问题都及时作了处理。要求就业的四个烈属、军属已被介绍去投考国营西北第三棉纺织厂，七户有临时困难的烈属、军属已得到补助。安徽省寿县在检查优抚工作后，县人民政府发放了五千万元修建补助费，当地群众并自动献工献料，帮助复员转业军人修建了一百四十七间房屋。广州市西区在检查后，现已着手由政府帮助烈属、军属成立一个手工业合作社，解决他们的生活困难问题。　（新华社）
