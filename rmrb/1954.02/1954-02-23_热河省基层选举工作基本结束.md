    Basic Completion of Grassroots Election Work in Rehe Province

    The grassroots election work in Rehe Province has basically concluded. Since the province's 4,090 villages and towns began their general election work in mid-July of last year, more than 99 percent of the villages and towns have now completed the general election. According to incomplete statistics, approximately 60,000 village and town people's representatives have been elected throughout the province. They are all outstanding figures among the masses. Many of the original village cadres have been re-elected due to the trust of the masses.

    While completing the election work, Rehe Province also successfully completed the population census. The results of the investigation and registration showed that among the province's twenty-one counties, banners, and cities, twenty units saw an increase in population compared to 1952, except for some counties where the population decreased slightly due to the transfer of some villages to other provinces. The province's population increased by 4.3 percent compared to the statistics of 1952. The increase is partly due to the fact that previously omitted reports were now accurately reported, and the main reason is that social stability and improved living standards in the years since liberation have led to an increase in the natural population growth rate.

    After the basic completion of grassroots elections in Rehe Province, the newly elected people's representatives and village cadres are actively motivating the masses to carry out spring plowing preparations with high working enthusiasm. Many villages have convened people's representative conferences to discuss and promote spring plowing preparations. Dadi Village in Qinglong County held a village people's representative conference before the Spring Festival to discuss mobilizing all villagers to prepare for spring plowing and made specific plans. After the meeting, all the people's representatives and cadres immediately took the lead in delivering manure and collecting firewood, and at the same time, they went to the farmers' households to mobilize them, so that the farmers quickly took action. Before the Spring Festival, 80 percent of the manure in the village had been delivered to the fields. Guo Jinshu, the village head of Qiuwo Village in the suburbs of Chengde City, used the examples of two agricultural production cooperatives and nine mutual aid teams in the village overcoming disasters and achieving bumper harvests over the years to educate farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation at a mass meeting held before the Spring Festival. Through the promotion of cadres and people's representatives, ten single-household farmers in the village have now joined the mutual aid team, and some farmers are preparing to join the agricultural production cooperative. In areas where Mongolians and Han people live together, ethnic unity has been further strengthened after the general election. In many villages in the Fourth District of Ongniud Banner, under the education and promotion of the people's representatives of the two ethnic groups, Han farmers took the initiative to send the selected good vegetable seeds to Mongolian herders and guaranteed to teach Mongolian herders how to grow vegetables.

### 热河省基层选举工作基本结束

    热河省基层选举工作基本结束
    热河省基层选举工作已基本结束。全省四千零九十个村、镇从去年七月中旬展开普选工作以来，到目前已有百分之九十九以上的村、镇全部结束了普选工作。据不完全统计，全省选出的村、镇人民代表共有六万名左右。他们都是群众中的优秀人物。很多原来的村干部，由于得到群众的信任而连选连任。
    热河省在完成选举工作的同时，也胜利完成了人口调查工作。调查登记的结果，全省二十一个县、旗、市单位中，除有的县因一部分村庄划给外省因而人口略见减少以外，有二十个单位的人口都比一九五二年增加。全省人口比一九五二年统计的数字增加了百分之四点三。增加的原因，一部分是因为过去遗漏未报这次报实了，主要的原因是解放以后几年来社会安定，人民生活改善，因而人口的自然增加率也随之提高。
    热河省基层选举基本完成以后，新当选的人民代表和村干部正以高度的工作热情积极带动群众进行春耕准备工作。许多村庄都召开了人民代表大会，讨论和推动春耕准备工作。青龙县大地村在春节以前召开了村人民代表大会，讨论了发动全村农民准备春耕的问题，并做出了具体计划。会后全体人民代表和干部立即动手带头送粪、打柴，同时又分头深入农户进行动员，使农民很快地行动起来。春节以前，全村百分之八十的粪肥已送到地里。承德市郊鹙窝村村长郭进书在春节前召开的全村群众大会上，以本村两个农业生产合作社和九个互助组历年战胜灾害获得丰收的事例，教育农民走互助合作道路。经过干部和人民代表的推动，现在该村已有十户单干农民参加了互助组，还有部分农户正酝酿准备加入农业生产合作社。在蒙族、汉族杂居的地方，普选以后，民族团结也进一步加强了。翁牛特旗第四区许多村在两族人民代表的教育推动下，汉族农民主动把挑选出的良好菜籽送给蒙族牧民，并保证教给蒙族牧民种菜的方法。
