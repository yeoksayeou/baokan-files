    With the enthusiastic help of worker brothers
    Many farmers at the Foziling Reservoir construction site have learned technology.
    At the Foziling Reservoir construction site of the Huai River Project, many farmers have learned technology with the help of their worker brothers. In order to help the farmers learn technology, the Reservoir Headquarters has successively transferred over a thousand young farmers from the civilian labor teams, shock brigades, and transportation teams to engineering units such as the grouting team, pumping team, and cement team for study over the past three years. These young farmers were warmly welcomed and enthusiastically helped by the worker comrades upon their arrival at each team. Many units established teaching and research groups to provide farmers with cultural and technical lessons, and formulated "guaranteed teaching and learning" plans. Some veteran workers, in order to accommodate the farmers' difficulties in understanding technical lessons due to their limited education, took them to the machines and explained the names and performance of the parts. Some workers even disassembled the machines and explained them to the farmers again and again until they fully understood them. Under the enthusiastic guidance of the workers, these farmers studied very diligently. For example, farmer He Renyi encountered many difficulties in her studies because she was illiterate, but she was determined to study culture intensively. When the lights went out in the dormitory at night, she would go to the street lights to read. With the workers' patient help, she is now a skilled drilling worker.
    Most of these farmers who participated in technical training have now reached the technical level of second- or third-grade technicians and are playing a huge role in their work. For example, farmer Wang Yunfu, who studied in the grouting team, has continuously created advanced working methods such as the "inclined treatment method," "separate rock pipe installation method," and "simple pipe extraction method," which greatly improved work efficiency.

    在工人兄弟的热情帮助下
    佛子岭水库工地很多农民学会了技术
    治淮工程中的佛子岭水库工地上，很多农民在工人兄弟帮助下学会了技术。水库指挥部为了帮助农民学会技术，三年来曾先后从民工队、突击队、运输队抽调千余青年农民，到灌浆队、抽水队、水泥队等工程单位学习。这些青年农民到达各队后，都受到工人同志的热烈欢迎和热情帮助。很多单位成立了教学研究小组，给农民上文化课和技术课，并订出“包教保学”的计划，有些老工人为了照顾农民文化程度浅，听不懂技术课的困难，就把他们带到机器旁边，告诉他们机件的名称和性能，有的工人还把机器拆开，一次又一次地讲给他们听，直到他们完全弄懂了为止。这些农民在工人的热情教导下，学习都非常用功，如农民何仁仪，因为不识字，学习中曾遇到许多困难，但她下定决心突击学习文化，晚上宿舍里灯熄了，她就到路灯下念书，加上工人们平时的耐心帮助，她现在已是一个熟练的钻探工人了。
    这批参加学习技术的农民，现在大部分都达到了二、三级技工的技术水平，并在工作中发挥了巨大的作用，如在灌浆队学习的农民王云富，连续创造了“倾斜处理法”、“分岩装管法”、“简便拔管法”等先进工作方法，大大地提高了工作效率。
