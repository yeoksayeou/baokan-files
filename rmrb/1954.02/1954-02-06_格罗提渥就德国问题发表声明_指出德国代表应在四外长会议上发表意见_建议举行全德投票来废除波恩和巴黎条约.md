Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 5th: The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting in Berlin yesterday. Premier Otto Grotewohl delivered a statement at the meeting on some issues concerning the German question discussed at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference by the government of the German Democratic Republic.

In his statement, Grotewohl emphasized that some issues concerning the safeguarding of international security discussed at the Berlin conference, especially Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov’s proposal to convene a world conference on universal disarmament and the Soviet delegation’s proposal to hold a five-power conference with the participation of the People’s Republic of China, are of vital importance to the German people as well as the people of other countries, and therefore are closely related to the German question. Grotewohl continued, if these international issues are most closely related to Germany, then the German question is also most closely related to these international issues... The international significance of the German question lies here. Grotewohl quoted Molotov's words at the Berlin Conference on February 1, that the Soviet government opposes any attempt to revive German militarism. He said that German representatives should also express their views on this issue at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. As for discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, Grotewohl said that in the eyes of the Germans, this means an issue related to the future of the German people; in the eyes of the people of other countries, it is an issue related to their security and their future peaceful life. Therefore, we have every right to expect clear guarantees for our national security. German representatives can only make a contribution to the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference under such circumstances, that is, they must discuss the security issues of our neighboring countries as opponents of German militarism. Grotewohl pointed out that the purpose of Adenauer and the Bonn government in not attaching importance to sending representatives to participate in the conference is very clear, because they can only propose the revival of German militarism and the creation of new possibilities for aggression to Germany's neighboring countries.

Grotewohl said that Western countries, with the active help of Bonn's revanchists and militarists, are forcing the German people to accept the Bonn military treaty and the Paris military treaty. He then emphasized that the Bonn government's signing of these treaties is an act of betraying the nation. Grotewohl pointed out that the Bonn and Paris military treaties sell out the national rights that are of vital importance to the German people to Western countries, and bet the national survival of the German people as a stake. Therefore, the most important task at present to restore the unity of the country on a democratic basis is to oppose re-militarization and to oppose the Bonn and Paris enslavement treaties. Thus, the Bonn and Paris treaties, which contribute to the revival of aggressive German militarism, are the main obstacle to free elections in Germany.

Grotewohl exposed the plan for Germany's "reunification" proposed by British Foreign Secretary Eden at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which is harmful to the German people. He emphasized that elections are not the business of the occupying countries, but the business of the German people themselves, and the appropriate institution for preparing and holding elections is an all-German provisional government. Grotewohl said that the national interests of the German people require that Hitler-style elections cannot be repeated in Germany, and the German people do not want to implement the election systems of the United States, Britain or France. Grotewohl pointed out that the German people oppose the so-called free elections prepared and held by the Western occupying countries in collusion with the Adenauer regime, because the purpose of such elections is to restore the rule of militarists in Germany. He also believes that all-German free elections can only be held if the occupation statutes and the Bonn and Paris treaties are abolished.

Grotewohl emphasized that the proposals on the German question put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference are in all respects in line with the true vital interests of the German people and are in line with the proposals in the memorandum of the German Democratic Republic. But unfortunately, nothing constructive has been heard from the Western three foreign ministers to this day.

Grotewohl said in his statement that if the four foreign ministers cannot reach an agreement on the abolition of the Bonn and Paris military treaties at the Berlin Conference, then we propose to hand this issue over to those who are to be governed by these treaties, that is, the German people, to resolve. Therefore, we propose to immediately hold an all-German democratic people's vote under conditions of complete equality and freedom in both parts of Germany. Grotewohl finally called on the residents of West Germany to resolutely fight for peace, for unity, and against the Bonn and Paris military treaties.

    格罗提渥就德国问题发表声明
    指出德国代表应在四外长会议上发表意见
    建议举行全德投票来废除波恩和巴黎条约
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林四日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院昨日在柏林举行会议，总理奥托·格罗提渥在会上就德意志民主共和国政府关于柏林四外长会议所讨论的关系德国问题的一些问题发表声明。
    格罗提渥在声明中着重指出，柏林会议上所讨论的保障国际安全的一些问题，首先是苏联外长莫洛托夫的召开世界普遍裁减军备会议的建议以及苏联代表团提出的关于举行有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议，无论是对德国人民还是对其他各国人民都有切身利害的重大关系，所以也就与德国问题有密切的关系。格罗提渥接着说道，如果说这些国际问题与德国有最密切的关系，那末德国问题与这些国际问题也同样有最密切的关系……德国问题的国际意义就在这里。格罗提渥引述莫洛托夫在二月一日柏林会议上所说的话，即苏联政府反对任何复活德国军国主义的企图，他说，德国代表也应就这一问题在柏林四外长会议上发表意见。至于讨论对德和约问题，格罗提渥说，在德国人看来，这意味着关系德国人民前途的问题；在其他各国人民看来，是关系他们的安全和他们将来的安居乐业的问题。因此，我们有充分的权利期望我们的国家安全获得明确的保障。德国代表只有在这种情况下才能在四外长会议上有所贡献，即他们要作为德国军国主义的反对者来讨论关于我们邻国的安全问题。格罗提渥指出阿登纳和波恩政府不重视派代表参加会议的目的是很明显的，因为他们除了向德国的邻国提出复活德国军国主义和造成新的侵略的可能性外，不可能提出任何其他的东西。
    格罗提渥说，西方国家在波恩复仇主义分子和军国主义分子积极帮助下，强使德国人民接受波恩军事条约和巴黎军事条约。他接着强调说，波恩政府在这些条约上签字，就是出卖民族的行为。格罗提渥指出，波恩与巴黎军事条约是把与德国人民有切身利害关系的民族权利出卖给西方国家，把德国人民的民族生存作为赌注。因而，目前在民主基础上恢复国家的统一的最重要的任务就是反对重新军国主义化和反对波恩与巴黎奴役性条约。因而，有助于复活侵略性的德国军国主义的波恩与巴黎条约就是德国自由选举的主要的障碍。
    格罗提渥在声明中揭露了对德国人民有害的、英国外交大臣艾登在柏林四外长会议上所提出的使德国“恢复统一”的计划。他着重指出，选举不是占领国家的事，而是德国人民自己的事，而筹备和举行选举的适当的机构是全德临时政府。格罗提渥说，德国人民的民族利益要求不能在德国重复希特勒式的选举，德国人民也不希望实行美国、英国或是法国的选举制度。格罗提渥指出，德国人民反对由西方占领国勾结阿登纳政权准备和举行所谓自由选举，因为这种选举的目的是要使军国主义分子的统治在德国复辟。他并认为全德的自由选举只有在取消了占领法规和波恩与巴黎条约的情况下才能举行。
    格罗提渥着重指出，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在四外长会议上就德国问题提出的建议在各方面都符合德国人民的真正的切身利益，并与德意志民主共和国备忘录中的建议相吻合。但遗憾的是，直到今天还没有听说西方三国外长提出什么建设性的建议。
    格罗提渥在声明中说，如果四外长在柏林会议上不能就废除波恩与巴黎军事条约达成协议，那末我们提议把这一问题交给要受这些条约支配而生活的那些人，即德国人民来解决。因此我们建议在德国两部分完全平等和自由的条件下立即举行全德民主的人民投票。格罗提渥最后号召西德居民坚决为和平，为统一，为反对波恩与巴黎军事条约而斗争。
