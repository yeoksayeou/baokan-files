    [This newspaper dispatch] (This is inferred from the content of the article) Taiyuan: Sixteen key factories and mines in Taiyuan City, including Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, have decided to launch a red banner rotating competition for increased production and thrift between factories. The competition will focus on improving technology and enterprise management, and aim towards mechanization and automation to ensure the comprehensive, balanced, and safe overfulfillment of national production plans and increased production and thrift tasks. The participants in the competition include: State-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, No. 2 Power Plant, No. 4 Power Plant, Taiyuan Paper Mill, Railway Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, Taiyuan Railway Bureau, Taiyuan Cement Plant, Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, and locally-owned state enterprises such as Shanxi Machinery Plant, Jinsheng Textile Mill, Shanxi Chemical Plant, Taiyuan Flour Mill, Taiyuan Tobacco Factory, Dongshan Coal Mine, Xishan Coal Mine, and Ximing Coking Plant. The competition period is temporarily set at one quarter. The top three will be awarded the winning red banner and bonuses by the Municipal People's Government. The conditions for evaluating and winning the red banner competition are as follows: 1. Comprehensively overfulfill seven indicators including product, output value, quality, cost, profit delivered to the state, capital turnover, and labor productivity. 2. Calculate the balance rate on a monthly basis, requiring factories and mines with complex production processes and diverse varieties to achieve a balance rate of over 70%; factories and mines with simple production processes and single varieties to achieve a balance rate of over 90%. 3. Conscientiously implement the policy of safe production, with no deaths related to production, technology, or responsibility systems, as well as production equipment accidents throughout the quarter; the losses caused by accidents throughout the quarter should not exceed 0.05% of the total output value of the entire quarter. 4. Comprehensively complete the quarterly safety and hygiene equipment, employee welfare programs, or the provisions of the collective contract. 5. The overall attendance rate of the factory exceeds the national stipulated target.
    Currently, all factories, in conjunction with the propaganda and education of the General Line, have made a series of preparations, overcome the idea of "easing up," and are now entering this glorious competition with a fighting attitude.
