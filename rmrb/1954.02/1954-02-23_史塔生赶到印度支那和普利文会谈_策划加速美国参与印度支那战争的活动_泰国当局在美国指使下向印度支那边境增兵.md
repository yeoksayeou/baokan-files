Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd:  U.S. Foreign Operations Administration Director Harold Stassen's recent activities in Indochina show that, despite the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference having recommended the convening of a Geneva conference to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the United States is still colluding with France to intensify the Indochina war.

Stassen arrived in Indochina from Taiwan on the 19th and engaged in three days of intense activity. On the 21st, Stassen met with French Defense Minister Pleven and French military and political leaders in Indochina in Bao Dai's residence in Da Lat, "to study the situation in Indochina and accelerate the methods of American aid to the French-Vietnamese forces" (Associated Press). British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia, MacDonald, also participated in the talks. According to United Press, the main issues discussed in the Da Lat talks included: the prospects for the Geneva conference to end the wars in Korea and Indochina, "policies to be coordinated in the event of the breakdown of ceasefire negotiations and the resumption of fierce warfare," the "Navarre Plan," and the issue of the United States sending a "military delegation" to train Indochinese puppet troops. United Press quoted "well-informed sources" as saying that Pleven "requested Stassen for more assistance for the Indochina war if the Geneva conference fails to prevent the war from being fought to the end."

In order to spur France, which has repeatedly failed militarily, to intensify the war, Stassen boasted at a press conference in Saigon on the 20th about the "role" of US "aid," saying that "from a military point of view, current US aid to Indochina is sufficient to enable Navarre to realize his plan to win victory." However, Navarre, the commander-in-chief of the French invasion forces in Indochina who has suffered heavy blows from the Indochinese People's Armed Forces—the drafter and executor of the "Navarre Plan"—has expressed frustration with the "victory" of his "plan." On the same day Stassen arrived in Indochina, Navarre publicly stated that he "did not expect to inflict a decisive defeat on the enemy next year." Citing the recent defeats suffered by the French forces in Indochina as an example, Navarre said that the Vietnamese People's Army's "offensive has achieved considerable success, forcing us to withdraw from Kontum and certain strongholds." Navarre had to say discouragedly: "We cannot hold all the places."

Xinhua News Agency, February 20th:  The Thai Phibunsongkhram regime is increasing troops on the Indochinese border.

According to a Agence France-Presse report from Bangkok on the 16th:  Thai army authorities have ordered the Thai 7th Infantry Division stationed in Lampang, northern Thailand, to move to the Indochinese border. The headquarters of the 7th Division will be located in Pong Sam, Chiang Rai Province, northeastern Thailand, near the Lao border. Another Agence France-Presse report from Bangkok on the 15th stated: Thai army authorities dispatched four battalions, including armored forces and paratrooper forces, to Aranyaprathet, southeastern Thailand, near the Cambodian border, on the 15th.

The news indicates that the Thai authorities' troop increase on the Lao border is related to the activities of the US Ambassador to Thailand, Donovan. According to Reuters, Donovan flew to northeastern Thailand on the morning of the 9th for an "unusual" inspection trip at a time when the war in Laos was tense. After Donovan's "inspection," Phibunsongkhram took measures to increase troops on the Indochinese border.

    泰国当局在美国指使下向印度支那边境增兵
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生最近在印度支那的活动表明：尽管柏林四国外长会议已经建议召开日内瓦会议来讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题，美国仍在与法国密谋加紧进行印度支那战争。
    史塔生是在十九日从台湾到达印度支那的，他进行了三天紧张的活动。二十一日，史塔生曾在保大的驻在地大叻和法国国防部长普利文以及法国在印度支那的军政首脑会谈，“研究印度支那的局势和加速美国援助法越军的方法”（美联社）。参加会谈的还有英国驻东南亚最高专员麦克唐纳。据合众社透露，大叻会谈中所讨论的主要问题包括：日内瓦会议结束朝鲜及印度支那的战争的前景，“关于一旦停战谈判破裂而激烈战争再起时所要配合采取的政策”，“纳瓦尔计划”，美国派遣“军事代表团”训练印度支那伪军问题。合众社引“消息灵通人士”的谈话说，普利文在会上“已要求史塔生给印度支那战争以更多的帮助，如果日内瓦会议不能阻止战争打到底的话”。 
    为了鞭策在军事上一再失败的法国加强进行战争，史塔生二十日在西贡记者招待会上大肆吹嘘美国“援助”的“作用”说，“从军事观点看来，目前美国对印度支那的援助足可以使纳瓦尔实现其赢得胜利的计划”。但是，遭到印度支那人民武装沉重打击的印度支那法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔——“纳瓦尔计划”的起草人和执行人，已对自己“计划”的“胜利”表示沮丧。纳瓦尔在史塔生到达印度支那的当天就公开说，他“并不指望在明年能使敌军遭到决定性的失败”。纳瓦尔以法军最近在中越遭到的失败为例说，越南人民军的“这次攻势已取得了相当大的成就，它已迫使我们撤出昆嵩，并撤出某些据点”。纳瓦尔不得不泄气地说：“我们不能守住一切地方。”
    【新华社二十日讯】泰国銮披汶政权正向印度支那边境增兵。
    据法新社曼谷十六日消息：泰国陆军当局已命令驻在泰国北部喃邦的泰军第七步兵师开往印度支那边境。第七师总部将设在泰国东北靠近寮国边境的昌莱省的蓬三。法新社在十五日从曼谷发出的另一消息说：泰国陆军当局于十五日派遣了包括装甲部队和伞兵部队的四个营前往泰国东南靠近高棉边境的亚兰。
    消息显示，泰国当局增兵寮国边境的行动，和美国驻泰国大使杜诺万的活动有关。据路透社消息，杜诺万在寮国战事紧张之际，曾于九日晨飞往泰国东北部作了一次“不平常”的视察旅行。杜诺万“视察”以后，銮披汶就采取了增兵印度支那边境的措施。
