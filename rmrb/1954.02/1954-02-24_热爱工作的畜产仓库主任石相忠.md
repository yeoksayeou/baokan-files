    Stone Xiangzhong, a livestock store first warehouse director of the China National Native Produce Company in Changchun City, used to be a pig-collecting technician and was elected as a model and advanced worker eighteen times in a row. After Stone Xiangzhong was promoted to warehouse director in April 1952, he was responsible for leading the feeding of live pigs. In the past, the mortality rate of pigs was too high, resulting in financial losses. In order to change this situation, Stone Xiangzhong tried his best to improve the methods of raising pigs. Newly arrived pigs are generally prone to internal heat after transportation, so he would first feed them thin gruel, with a little salt added. After a few days, after the internal heat of the new pigs subsided, they were gradually placed into the old pens. He also insisted on seasonal pig feeding and the selection of sick pigs. Last summer, when it was hot and there were many pigs (2,000), Stone Xiangzhong thought how difficult it was for farmers to raise such fat pigs, and that the army, workers, and citizens of the city all needed to eat fresh pork. Because of the heat, pigs could not be allowed to die of heatstroke. He took the lead in mobilizing everyone to carry cool water to pour on the pigs, and in this way, the pigs' heat gradually subsided.

    Throughout the year, regardless of wind, rain, night, or day, he led the masses to work diligently. He always got up to check once or twice at night, and persisted in working even when he was sick. Thanks to his efforts, the pigs he raised in the second and third quarters of last year increased in weight by more than 43,000 catties. At an average price of 3,400 yuan per catty, this increased the state's income by more than 140 million yuan.

    In the fourth quarter of last year, the company launched a production increase and economy campaign, and the pig and cattle warehouses were to be merged, making his tasks even heavier. When he first arrived at the East Station warehouse, he saw that large and small cattle were fed together, the grass at the bottom of the troughs was half a foot thick, and some cattle had even bitten through their reins. So, he studied the reasons with the cattle feeders, and that night he convened a meeting to listen to the opinions of the masses. He found that there was a shortage of manpower, so he tried to increase the number of workers. When the comrades' enthusiasm was not high, he educated them. He asked the comrades to feed the cattle on time every day to ensure that the fodder was not lost. At the same time, based on his experience in feeding pigs, he separated the newly arrived cattle from the original cattle, and the large cattle from the small cattle, to avoid the new cattle and the original cattle bumping into each other, and to ensure that the large and small cattle could not eat grass well together. Due to the improved feeding methods, the live cattle in the fourth quarter increased in weight by more than 59,300 catties, increasing the state's income by more than 132 million yuan.

    Stone Xiangzhong is welcomed by the masses wherever he goes. Outsiders cannot recognize him as the warehouse director. He inspects pigs and feeds cattle with the workers every day. In May and June of last year, there was no bookkeeper, so he took care of both bookkeeping and storage himself. In order to ensure the supply of meat for the Dragon Boat Festival, he sent pigs to the slaughterhouse by truck. At that time, it was raining heavily. He said: "We must not let the rain affect the people of the city from eating pork." He led the comrades to load the trucks in the heavy rain. He said: "It is a small matter for us to be tired, but it is a big matter to meet the supply."

    Stone Xiangzhong, who works hard for the Party and the people, was awarded the title of first-class labor model in the state-owned commercial system at the end of 1953 due to his conscientious and selfless work. He also attended the Sixth Changchun City Labor Model Congress. When studying the Party's general line for the transition period, he said: "I came from a manual labor background. Under the cultivation of the Party, I have learned many things. But the work I have done is still too little. I want to further improve feeding methods, increase production, reduce loss rates, accumulate more wealth for the country, and supply the people with fresh meat under the light of the general line."

    热爱工作的畜产仓库主任石相忠
    冯潜
    中国土产公司长春市公司畜产商店第一仓库主任石相忠，以前是收猪技术员，曾连续十八次当选为模范和先进工作者。一九五二年四月石相忠被提拔为仓库主任后，他负责领导活猪的饲养工作。过去，猪的死亡率太高，使得经营上发生赔钱现象。石相忠为了转变这种情况，便尽力想法改进猪的饲养方法。新来的猪经过运输，一般都火大，他就先喂稀食，稍加些食盐，经过几天工夫，新猪消火后，再陆续放到旧圈里，并且坚持了季节喂猪法、病猪挑选法。去年夏季天热猪多（有二千头），石相忠想农民喂养成这样的大肥猪多么不容易，全市驻军、工人、市民都要吃到新鲜猪肉，天热，可不能叫猪热死。他就以身作则，发动大家挑凉水浇猪，这样猪热就渐渐的退了。
    一年来，他不管风里、雨里、黑夜、白天，领导群众兢兢业业地工作着。夜间总要起来检查一、两次，有病也坚持工作。由于他的努力，去年二、三季度他经养的猪增加重量四万三千多斤，平均每斤按三千四百元计算，可给国家增加收入一亿四千多万元。
    去年第四季度公司开展增产节约竞赛，猪、牛仓库要合并，他的任务更重了。当他第一次走到东站仓库的时候，看见大、小牛混在一起喂，槽底下的草有半尺厚，有的牛把缰绳也咬断了。于是，他就和喂牛工友研究原因，当晚他就召开会议，听取群众意见，发现人力不足，他就设法增加工人，同志们情绪不高，他就进行教育。要同志们每天按时喂牛，保证草料不受损失。同时，根据喂猪的经验，把新来的牛和原有的牛，大牛和小牛分别喂养，避免新来的和原有的牛乱顶乱碰，大小牛在一起不能很好吃草。由于改进了饲养方法，第四季度的活牛就增加重量五万九千三百多斤，给国家增加收入一亿三千二百多万元。
    石相忠到那里都受到群众的欢迎，外来人都认不出他是仓库主任，他每天和工人在一起验猪喂牛，去年五、六月间没有记账员，他自己连记账带保管。为了做好五月节的肉食供应，用汽车往屠宰场送猪，当时天下大雨。他说：“决不能让雨天影响全市人民吃猪肉。”他冒着大雨带领同志们装车。他说：“我们累点事小，满足供应事大。”
    为党为人民努力工作的石相忠，由于他兢兢业业地忘我的工作，一九五三年底又被评为国营商业系统一等劳动模范，并出席长春市六届劳动模范大会。在学习党在过渡时期总路线时，他说：“我是杠力工人出身，在党的培养下我学会了很多东西。可是我作的工作还太少。我要在总路线的灯塔照耀下，进一步改进饲养方法，增加产量，减少损数率，为国家积累更多的财富，供应人民新鲜肉食。”
