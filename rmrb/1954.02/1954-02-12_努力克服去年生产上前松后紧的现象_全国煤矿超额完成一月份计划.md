Strive to Overcome the Phenomenon of Slackness at the Beginning and Tightness at the End of Production Last Year
National Coal Mines Overfulfilled January Plan

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: National coal mines overfulfilled the January production plan by 6% above the state plan. All thirty units across the country exceeded their January planned targets. Calculated by major regions, the Southwest Region achieved the highest overfulfillment, reaching 122.9% of the plan, followed by the Northwest Region and the East China Region. The North China Region, with the smallest overfulfillment percentage, still produced approximately 50,000 tons more than the state plan. Some regions even saw production increase by several thousand tons compared to December of last year.

To ensure the needs of coking coal and other industrial coal, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Coal Mine Administration Bureau repeatedly instructed various mines in January to establish the perspective of serving the steel industry and industry first and foremost. They made many necessary arrangements and emergency measures for the normal loading of coking coal before and after the Spring Festival. For example, when the supply of coking coal from a certain mine in Beipiao was at risk of being insufficient, the Coal Mine Administration Bureau immediately instructed that coal from the Taiji Mine be substituted, and coal from the Jingxing Mining Bureau be supplied to the units originally supplied by the Taiji Mine. To prevent the possibility of loading work not maintaining normalcy before and after the Spring Festival, some mines transported extra amounts in advance. Fushun Longfeng Mine, for example, supplied over 8,000 tons of extra coking coal to Anshan Iron and Steel in January.

All mines across the country, having learned the lesson of the serious passive situation caused by the slackness at the beginning and tightness at the end of production last year, realized that to ensure the completion of this year's production tasks, it is necessary to first ensure the smooth completion of the first quarter and January's production tasks. Therefore, various mines paid special attention to ensuring normal attendance before and after the Spring Festival in January. All mines launched attendance competitions in January. The Hegang Mining Bureau combined mobilizing workers to ensure attendance with implementing regulations and systems, with technical cadres organizing inspection teams to go deep into the mines for inspection. In addition, various mines also made many preparations for future production. Some units carried out work related to safe production, while others utilized the Spring Festival holiday or the time after completing the monthly plan to carry out roadway repairs and electromechanical repairs.

[Our Newspaper] The Huadong Coal Mine Administration Bureau and its six subordinate units, including Huainan and Zibo, all overfulfilled their January production plans. The region as a whole completed 109% of the state plan for raw coal production and 110.16% of the tunneling plan. In terms of safety, no fatalities occurred in the entire region for the entire month.

In order to raise the level of production a step further based on last year's increased production and conservation movement, the bureau made specific arrangements targeting key issues in production. For tunneling work, it established tunneling zones, implemented strict acceptance systems to ensure the quality of roadway projects, and regularly balanced the three links of geology, tunneling, and coal mining, preventing the phenomenon of relaxing tunneling and geological work due to increased production. Regarding safety work, it held three meetings in January and organized safety inspections in certain units, or designated a certain time as a safety activity day. Emergency measures were also taken to resolve temporary problems. For example, on the evening of January 17, the water inflow at the Nanbazao production face of the Huainan Datong Mine suddenly increased. Two water pumps were immediately transferred from the Jiulonggang Mine to rescue the situation, and production was restored the next day.

In order to ensure that the first quarter's production is no lower than the fourth quarter's production level last year, the bureau recently issued an urgent directive to its subordinate units, clearly stipulating the specific production tasks of each bureau and mine, and emphasizing: In order to earnestly and practically guarantee the completion of the first quarter's production tasks, first, the leadership must fully recognize and estimate the favorable conditions for completing the production plan and actively overcome various negative factors; second, in terms of tunneling, the general requirement for the first quarter is to achieve a coal gain of six months, and strive to achieve a coal gain of seven months. Improve coal mining methods, promote advanced experience in mining and tunneling, and gradually achieve normal cyclic operation; third, convene production balance meetings to ensure the supply of materials and safe transportation in the first quarter.

    努力克服去年生产上前松后紧的现象
    全国煤矿超额完成一月份计划
      【新华社十一日讯】全国煤矿一月份超过国家计划百分之六完成了产量计划。全国三十个单位，都超额完成了一月份的计划任务。以大区为单位计算，超额最多的是西南区，达到计划的百分之一二二·九，其次是西北区和华东区，超额百分数最少的华北区也比国家计划多约五万吨，有的大区产量比去年十二月份产量还多几千吨。
    为了保证炼焦煤和其他工业用煤的需要，中央燃料工业部和煤矿管理总局在一月份曾一再指示各矿，必须树立首先为钢铁服务、为工业服务的观点。他们对于炼焦煤在春节前后的正常装车问题，做了很多必要的布置和紧急措施。如北票某矿炼焦煤曾一度可能供应不上，煤矿管理总局随即指示以台吉矿的煤代替，另以井陉矿务局的煤供给台吉矿原供应的单位。有的矿为防止春节前后万一装车工作不能保持正常，就提前多运出一部分，抚顺龙凤矿就在一月份多供应鞍钢炼焦煤八千多吨。
    全国各矿由于接受了去年生产上前松后紧造成严重被动局面的教训，认识到要保证今年生产任务的完成，必须首先保证第一季和一月份生产任务的顺利完成，所以各矿在一月份特别注意了保证春节前后的正常出勤。各矿都在一月份发动了出勤竞赛。鹤岗矿务局并把动员工人保证出勤和贯彻规程制度结合起来，由技术干部组织检查小组深入矿井进行检查。另外，各矿还为今后生产做了很多准备工作。有些单位进行了有关安全生产的工作，有些单位利用春节假期或提前完成月计划后的时间进行了巷道检修和机电检修。
    【本报讯】华东煤矿管理局所属淮南、淄博等六个单位全部超额完成一月份生产计划。以全区计，原煤产量完成国家计划百分之一零九；掘进计划完成百分之一一零点一六，在安全方面，全区全月未发生死亡事故。
    为了在去年增产节约运动的基础上把生产水平提高一步，该局针对生产上的关键问题，作了具体部署。对掘进工作，建立了掘进区，严格验收制度，确保巷道工程质量，并经常进行地质、掘进、采煤三个环节的平衡，防止了因产量增加而放松掘进与地质工作的现象发生。对于安全工作，一月内曾开了三次会议，并在某些单位组织了安全大检查，或以一定时间作为安全活动日。对于临时发生的问题，也采取了紧急措施加以解决。如淮南大通矿南八槽在一月十七日晚上，生产工作面涌水量突然增高，随即由九龙岗矿调去两台水泵抢救，第二天即恢复了生产。
    为了使第一季度生产不低于去年第四季度生产的水平，该局最近又对所属各单位发出紧急指示，对各局矿的具体生产任务作了明确规定，并着重指出：为了认真地、切实地保证第一季度生产任务的完成，首先，领导上必须充分认识与估计到完成生产计划的有利条件，积极克服各种消极因素；其次，在掘进方面，要求第一季度一般地要达到六个月的获得煤量，争取达到七个月的获得煤量。改进采煤方法，推广采掘方面的先进经验，逐步地做到正常循环作业；第三，召开生产平衡会议，以保证第一季度的材料供应与安全运输。
