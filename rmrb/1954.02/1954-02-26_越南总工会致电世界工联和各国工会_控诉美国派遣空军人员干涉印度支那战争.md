(Xinhua News Agency, February 25th) Vietnam News Agency, February 24th: The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor cabled the World Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions of all countries, expressing the Vietnamese people's indignation at the recent dispatch of air force personnel by the American interventionists to Indochina. The cable reads as follows:

The U.S. government recently announced the dispatch of 400 air force "technicians" to aid the French aggressors in Indochina. More than 200 of them have already arrived in Hanoi and Haiphong. These so-called "technicians" are in reality U.S. Air Force officers and men. As the U.S. government has clearly announced, their mission is to direct U.S. aircraft in combat to massacre the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

The above facts prove that the U.S. government, which in the past has given increasing military aid to the French aggressors in Indochina, is now further directly involved in the war of aggression in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The purpose of this shameless intervention by the U.S. government is to intensify the Indochina war and aggravate tensions in Asia and the world.

While the U.S. government talks about "peace," it is actually deliberately delaying and expanding the war in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, becoming the main obstacle to a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue. The U.S. imperialists are directly infringing upon the national sovereignty of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, seriously threatening the freedom and security of the people of Southeast Asian countries, and threatening world peace.

The workers and people of Vietnam are extremely indignant at the American intervention, and they are determined to fight under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh until complete victory is achieved, in order to restore their national independence and safeguard peace in Southeast Asia. We firmly believe that the powerful movement of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the working people of France and the United States, can restrain the warmongers, just as the strong solidarity of the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos will cause the French and American imperialists to suffer a crushing defeat.

    越南总工会致电世界工联和各国工会
    控诉美国派遣空军人员干涉印度支那战争
    【新华社二十五日讯】越南通讯社二十四日讯：越南总工会致电世界工会联合会和各国工会，表示越南人民对于最近美国干涉者派遣空军人员到印度支那一事的愤慨情绪。电文如下：
    美国政府最近宣布派遣四百名空军“技术人员”来援助印度支那的法国侵略军。其中二百多名已经到达河内和海防。所谓“技术人员”，实际上就是美国空军军官和兵员。如美国政府所清楚宣布的，他们的任务是，指挥助战的美国飞机去屠杀越南、高棉和寮国的人民。
    上述事实证明，在过去给予印度支那法国侵略军越来越多的军事援助的美国政府，现在已更进一步地直接参与了在越南、高棉和寮国的侵略战争。美国政府进行这种无耻干涉的目的是要加紧进行印度支那战争和加剧亚洲和世界的紧张局势。
    美国政府嘴里谈着“和平”，实际上却在故意拖延和扩大在越南、高棉和寮国的战争，成了和平解决越南问题的主要障碍。美帝国主义者在直接侵犯越南、高棉和寮国的国家主权，严重地威胁着东南亚各国人民的自由与安全，并威胁着世界和平。
    越南工人和人民对美国的干涉感到非常愤慨，他们决心在胡志明主席领导下进行斗争，直到取得完全的胜利，以恢复他们的民族独立，并保障东南亚的和平。我们坚信，全世界爱好和平的人民，尤其是法国和美国劳动人民的强大的运动可以遏止战争贩子，就像越南、高棉和寮国三国人民的坚强团结会使法、美帝国主义者遭到惨败一样。
