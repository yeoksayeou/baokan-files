    The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies held an "Academic Discussion Meeting of Various Agricultural Science Societies" in Beijing from the 16th to the 20th. The discussion meeting was led by the presidium and executive committee organized by the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the heads of various societies, and was supported by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The purpose of this discussion meeting was mainly to discuss how agricultural science workers can integrate with the actual situation of agricultural production in China, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and clarify how agricultural science work can serve to improve agricultural production.
    During the discussion meeting, Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, attended the meeting and made an important report. In his report, he introduced the situation of the National Agricultural Conference, pointing out that only by gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture in accordance with the requirements of the general line for the transition period, promoting agricultural cooperativization, and improving technology can the problem of increasing agricultural production be fundamentally solved. He also analyzed some specific issues in agricultural science and technology work, explaining that the task of agricultural science workers is to serve the promotion of agricultural cooperativization and the improvement of agricultural production, so as to ensure the development of national industrialization. Therefore, comprehensive research should be conducted on the key issues urgently to be solved in agricultural production in various regions. In the research, we should also focus on long-term agricultural construction and conduct planned investigations and research on various aspects such as soil, climate, crops, and pests in various regions. The improvement of agricultural technology should be adapted to the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the promotion of new-style agricultural tools. The learning of advanced Soviet agricultural science and technology must be combined with the actual situation of Chinese agriculture and the production experience of the broad masses of farmers. Because agricultural production in our country has great regional characteristics, we should take measures suitable to local conditions, prescribe the right medicine, combine scientific theory with the summary of mass production experience, and use local materials to promote them locally. The experience of other places and new scientific achievements should be gradually promoted only after local farm trials have proven effective. Agricultural science should, according to conditions, move from single technical measures to comprehensive research. Various aspects such as agricultural administration, education, scientific research, technology promotion, and state-owned agricultural enterprises should closely coordinate to promote the development of agricultural science.
    The meeting heard a report by Chen Fengtong, Director of the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, on the institute's rural work in 1953. This report illustrated the necessity of agricultural scientific research work facing the countryside and going deep into the countryside to conduct investigations and research.
    Soviet soil science expert Niganov was invited to the meeting to make a report. He analyzed the history of the development of soil and its fertility from the perspective of dialectical materialism, and described the struggle between the two lines in soil science. His report was very enlightening for Chinese soil science workers in their future research on soil work.
    The discussion meeting was divided into eight groups: agronomy, soil, fruit trees, vegetables, plant pathology, entomology, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine, and respectively discussed grain and cotton yield increase technology and seed selection, improved seed breeding, saline-alkali soil improvement, vegetable supply in urban and industrial mining areas, prevention and quarantine of crop diseases and insect pests, development of mountain fruit trees, improvement of livestock reproductive capacity and increased feed production, cattle plague, swine fever, equine glanders, and other important issues in current agricultural production. Through discussion, the main links for solving these problems were further clarified.
    Yang Xiandong, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, summarized the gains of the discussion meeting on behalf of the presidium. He pointed out that the main characteristic of this discussion meeting was that under the guidance of the general line of the state in the transition period and the guidance of Michurin's theory, the main technical problems existing in agricultural production in our country were discussed, so that everyone realized the importance of their work in the country's economic construction, and learned that scientific workers must strengthen unity in order to better complete the arduous and glorious tasks in the future. He hoped that the spirit of this meeting would be implemented throughout the country.
    The closing speech of the discussion meeting was delivered by Zhang Jiafu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He pointed out that in agricultural scientific research work, it is necessary to grasp the three main links of learning from the Soviet Union, investigation and research, and summarizing mass experience. He called on scientific workers to unite, actively give play to collective wisdom, give play to the spirit of patriotism, and strive for the realization of the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会
    举行农业科学各专门学会学术讨论会
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会十六日到二十日在北京举行“农业科学各专门学会学术讨论会”。讨论会由中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会及各学会负责人组织的主席团和干事会领导，并得到中央人民政府农业部和中国科学院的支持。这次讨论会的目的主要是讨论农业科学工作者如何结合中国农业生产实际，学习苏联先进经验，并明确农业科学工作如何为提高农业生产服务等问题。
    讨论会进行过程中，中央人民政府农业部副部长刘瑞龙到会作了重要报告。他在报告中介绍了全国农业会议的情况，指出只有按照国家过渡时期总路线的要求逐步实现农业的社会主义改造，促进农业合作化和改进技术，才能从根本上解决农业增产的问题。他并对农业科学技术工作中若干具体问题作了分析，说明农业科学工作者的任务就是为促进农业合作化和提高农业生产服务，以保证国家工业化的发展，因此应综合研究各地农业生产上急待解决的关键性问题。在研究中并要从长期农业建设着眼，对各地土壤、气候、作物、病虫害等各方面进行有计划的调查研究。农业技术的改进要与互助合作运动的发展和新式农具的推广相适应。对苏联先进农业科学技术的学习，必须和中国农业的实际情况相结合，和广大农民的生产经验相结合。由于我国农业生产有着很大的地域性，因此应该因地制宜，对症下药，结合科学理论总结群众生产经验，就地取材，就地推广。外地的经验和新的科学成就，都应该经过当地农场试验有效后才可逐步推广。农业科学应该根据条件，由单一的技术措施进到综合研究。农业行政、教育、科学研究、技术推广及国营农业企业等各个方面，应密切协同，以促进农业科学事业的发展。
    会议听取了华北农业科学研究所所长陈凤桐关于该所一九五三年农村工作的报告，这个报告说明了农业科学研究工作面向农村，深入农村进行调查研究的必要性。
    苏联土壤学专家涅加诺夫应邀到会作了报告。他用辩证唯物主义的观点分析了土壤及其肥沃性的发展史，叙述了土壤学中两条路线的斗争。他的报告对于中国土壤学工作者今后研究土壤工作有很大启发。
    讨论会分为农学、土壤、果树、蔬菜、植物病理、昆虫、畜牧、兽医等八个组进行，分别讨论了粮棉的增产技术及选种、良种繁育问题，盐碱土改良，城市及工矿区蔬菜供应，农作物病虫害的预防和检疫，发展山区果树，提高农畜繁殖力及增产饲料、牛瘟、猪瘟、马鼻疽等当前农业生产上的重要问题。经过讨论，进一步明确了解决这些问题的主要环节。
    中央人民政府农业部副部长杨显东代表主席团总结了讨论会的收获。他指出这次讨论会的主要特点是在国家过渡时期总路线照耀下，在米丘林学说思想指导下讨论了我国农业生产中存在的主要技术问题，使大家认识到自己的工作在国家经济建设中的重要性，了解到科学工作者必须加强团结才能更好地完成今后艰巨而光荣的任务。他希望把这次会议的精神贯彻到全国各地去。
    讨论会由中国科学院副院长张稼夫致闭幕词。他指出在农业科学研究工作中要很好地抓住学习苏联、调查研究、总结群众经验三个主要环节。他号召科学工作者团结起来积极发挥集体智慧，发挥爱国主义的精神，为国家的社会主义工业化及农业社会主义改造的实现而奋斗。　（新华社）
