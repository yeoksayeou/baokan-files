    The First Beijing-Moscow Direct Passenger Train Arrives in Beijing
   [Xinhua News Agency, February 9th] The first Beijing-Moscow direct passenger train arriving from Moscow reached Beijing Station punctually at 8:09 PM today.
    The train entered the station amidst military music and applause. As soon as the train stopped, Young Pioneers from the Railway Children's Primary School ran up to present flowers to the Soviet staff. The Soviet train captain, Mikunichi, was the first to step off the train and report the work situation to Zhu Yunsheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Railway Administration of China.
    Those who came to welcome the train at the station included Mi Yong, Director of the International Joint Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government; Mao Yixin, Deputy Director of the Vehicle Bureau; Zhu Yunsheng, Deputy Director of the Beijing Railway Administration; Zhang Yun, Director of the Beijing Transportation Branch; representatives of the Beijing Municipal People's Government; and more than 300 railway workers.
    This train departed from Moscow at 5:55 PM (Moscow time) on January 31st. The entire journey covered more than 9,000 kilometers, and the trip was very smooth, arriving at each station on time. The Soviet Ministry of Railways also specially sent vehicle expert Duroyetsky to inspect the operation.
    There were 140 passengers on this train from the Soviet Union to China, including Soviet experts helping with China's construction, Romanian technicians coming to work in China, and Chinese students studying abroad. There were also more than 50 Korean students studying in the Soviet Union who were passing through China. Although they had experienced a long journey of nearly nine days and nights, the passengers were in good spirits upon arrival in Beijing, thanks to the comfortable train facilities, smooth journey, and the meticulous care provided by the Chinese and Soviet crew members.
    After the train entered Chinese territory, it received a warm welcome from railway workers along the route.

    第一列北京—莫斯科直达旅客列车到京
   【新华社九日讯】从莫斯科开来我国的第一列北京—莫斯科直达旅客列车已经在今天下午八点零九分正点到达北京车站。
    列车在军乐和掌声中开进车站。列车刚刚停下，铁路子弟小学的少年先锋队员就跑上去向苏联工作人员献花。首先走下列车的苏联列车长米库尼奇向我国北京铁路管理局副局长朱云生报告工作情况。
    到车站欢迎的有中央人民政府铁道部国际联运局局长糜镛、车辆局副局长茅以新，北京铁路管理局副局长朱云生、北京运输分局局长张云、北京市人民政府代表和三百多名铁路职工。
    这趟列车是在一月三十一日下午五点五十五分（莫斯科时间）从莫斯科开出的。全程一共行走了九千多公里，沿途非常顺利，正点到达各车站。苏联交通部还特派车辆专家杜洛耶茨基随车检查运行情况。
    乘这趟列车从苏联到我国的旅客有一百四十人，其中有帮助我国建设的苏联专家、来我国工作的罗马尼亚技术人员和我国的留学生，还有路过我国的五十多位在苏联留学的朝鲜留学生。虽然经过将近九昼夜的长途旅行，但是由于列车的设备舒适、行驶顺利和车上中苏两国乘务员的周密照顾，旅客们到达北京后精神都很愉快。
    这趟列车进入中国境内以后，受到沿途铁路职工的热烈欢迎。
