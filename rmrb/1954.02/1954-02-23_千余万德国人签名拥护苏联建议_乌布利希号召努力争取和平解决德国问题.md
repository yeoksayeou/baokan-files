Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 22nd: The democratic newspapers of Berlin continue to publish news of the unanimous support of the working people of the German Democratic Republic for the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

The "Neues Deutschland" reported that as of February 20, 11,736,896 Germans had signed petitions demanding the democratic reunification of Germany, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of a provisional all-German government, and the holding of truly free and democratic elections. The newspaper said that since February 3, the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany had received 4,690 telegrams and 22,699 letters. In these telegrams and letters, workers from factories and institutions, as well as various groups and citizens of the German Democratic Republic, requested that the German question be resolved in accordance with the proposals put forward by Molotov at the Berlin Conference. “Neue Zeit” published a commentary by Otto Nuschke on the results of the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference. He said that the positive result of the meeting was that negotiations would continue. Nuschke said that at Molotov's insistence, another meeting with the participation of the People's Republic of China would be held in Geneva in April to discuss the Far East issue. Nuschke fiercely attacked Eden's plan for the German question and supported Molotov's constructive proposal for a truly democratic solution to the German question.

Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: According to TASS, Berlin, February 21st: Walter Ulbricht, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, addressed the opening ceremony of the Congress of Labor Youth of the German Democratic Republic in Leipzig on February 20. He reviewed the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference and spoke about the tasks of the labor youth.

Ulbricht pointed out that the fact that the Four Foreign Ministers finally held a meeting to discuss issues related to easing international tension marked progress in international relations. The meeting showed that there are forces in the world that try their best to increase profits, and are interested in concluding arms contracts and engaging in arms races, and therefore use all means to continue the policy of establishing military bases and concluding military treaties.

He said that during the Foreign Ministers Conference, three points became clear: The main obstacle to the reunification of Germany is the "European Defense Community" which aims to revive German militarism. The reunification of Germany must first and foremost be a matter for the German people themselves. That is why the occupying forces must be withdrawn and the Bonn and Paris treaties abolished, so that the German people can freely decide on the reunification of Germany and decide on their internal democratic system. Peaceful cooperation between European countries must be based on an all-European treaty guaranteeing collective security in Europe, in which Germany is a member with equal status with other countries. The Berlin Conference made it clear to the German people that the work of restoring Germany's unity by following a democratic and peaceful policy depends on their own efforts. A peaceful solution to the German question depends primarily on the efforts of the people of the German Democratic Republic and on the struggle of the people of West Germany against militarism and for democratic rights.

Ulbricht emphasized that the government of the German Democratic Republic had put forward a request to allow representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the discussion of the German question at the Berlin Conference. This request was supported by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, but was opposed by the Foreign Ministers of the three Western countries. The German people and German youth were extremely indignant at this attitude of the Foreign Ministers of the three Western countries.

Ulbricht said that all peace-loving Germans warmly welcomed Molotov's proposals to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, withdraw the occupying forces, and reduce Germany's financial and economic burden as a result of the war. However, the representatives of Western countries, because they were trying their best to militarize West Germany and drag it into an aggressive bloc, repeatedly rejected these proposals. This shows that the Western countries are unwilling to ease international tension, nor are they willing to peacefully resolve the German question according to the wishes of the German people and the need to ensure the safety of the people of all European countries.

Referring to the so-called "free elections" widely promoted by Western countries and the Bonn government, Ulbricht said that under the occupation regime, with militarist and fascist organizations all over West Germany, and the policy of the Bonn and Paris war treaties being implemented, there is no question of truly free and democratic all-German elections. Free and democratic elections can only be held when the peace-loving German people themselves have created democratic conditions. This requires the establishment of a provisional all-German government.

Ulbricht severely condemned the policy pursued by Bonn Chancellor Adenauer, pointing out that what Adenauer is striving for is not to unify Germany, but to deepen the division of Germany; not to peacefully resolve the German question, but to incorporate West Germany into a military bloc and prepare for war. The situation at the Berlin Foreign Ministers Conference shows that the government of the German Democratic Republic is the true representative of the national interests of the German people. The Bonn government is gradually losing the support of the people of West Germany and the trust of the European people, and is increasingly relying on foreign occupying forces.

Ulbricht called on German youth to step up their struggle to achieve a peaceful solution to the German question, to maintain peace, to oppose the re-militarization of West Germany, and to complete their work in an exemplary manner in the German Democratic Republic, so that West German youth can be inspired by the German Democratic Republic to fight against poverty and improve their lives. Ulbricht concluded by saying that we support West German youth in their struggle for freedom and against the enslaving Bonn and Paris treaties, for the withdrawal of occupying forces and the abolition of foreign military bases, thereby liberating the German people in West Germany, for the German people's right to demand the conclusion of a just peace treaty, for an agreement between representatives from East and West Germany, and for the establishment of a provisional all-German government to prepare for all-German democratic elections.

    千余万德国人签名拥护苏联建议
    乌布利希号召努力争取和平解决德国问题
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社柏林二十二日讯：柏林各民主报纸继续登载德意志民主共和国各地劳动人民一致拥护苏联在四外长会议上提出来的建议的消息。
    “新德意志报”报道，到二月二十日为止，已有一千一百七十三万六千八百九十六个德国人在请愿书上签名，要求民主地重新统一德国、缔结对德和约、成立临时的全德政府并举行真正自由的民主选举。该报说，自从二月三日以来，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会已接到了四千六百九十封电报和二万二千六百九十九封来信。在这些电报和来信中，德意志民主共和国的工厂和机关的工作人员以及各团体和公民都要求根据莫洛托夫在柏林会议上提出的建议解决德国问题。“新时报”登载了奥托·努舍克的一篇评论柏林外长会议的结果的文章。他说：会议的积极的成果是谈判将继续下去。努舍克说，在莫洛托夫的坚持下，四月间，将在日内瓦召开另一个有中华人民共和国参加的会议，来讨论远东问题。努舍克激烈地抨击了艾登的关于德国问题的计划，并拥护莫洛托夫的真正民主地解决德国问题的建设性建议。
      【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：德意志民主共和国副总理、德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希二月二十日向在来比锡开幕的德意志民主共和国劳动青年代表大会致词，他回顾了柏林外长会议，并谈到劳动青年的任务。
      乌布利希指出：四国外长终于举行会议，来讨论有关缓和国际紧张局势的问题，这一事实标志着国际关系有了进展。会议说明，世界上有这么一种力量，它们尽量想增加利润，它们对于订立军火合同、进行军备竞赛感到兴趣，因此使用一切办法来继续建立军事基地与缔结军事条约的政策。
    他说：在外长会议过程中弄清楚了三点，就是：德国恢复统一的主要障碍是以复活德国军国主义为目的的“欧洲防务集团”。恢复德国的统一首先必须是德国人民自己的事情。就是因为这样，所以必须撤退占领军、废除波恩与巴黎条约，这样德国人民才能自由地决定德国的重新统一，才能决定他们内部的民主制度。欧洲国家的和平合作必须建立在保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的基础上，在这个条约中，德国是与其他国家居于平等地位的一个成员。柏林会议向德国人民说明，遵循民主与和平方针恢复德国统一的工作要靠他们自己的努力。德国问题的和平解决主要决定于德意志民主共和国人民的努力，决定于西德人民反对军国主义、争取民主权利的斗争。
    乌布利希着重指出，德意志民主共和国政府曾提出让德意志民主共和国与西德代表参加柏林会议关于德国问题的讨论的要求，这项要求得到苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫的支持，而遭到西方三国外长的反对，德国人民与德国青年对西方三国外长这种态度都极为愤慨。
    乌布利希说：所有爱好和平的德国人民都热烈欢迎莫洛托夫提出的缔结对德和约、撤退占领军队、减轻德国因战争后果而承担的财政与经济负担等建议，而西方国家的代表，由于尽量想使西德军国主义化，并把它拉进侵略集团，却接连地拒绝了这些建议。这就说明，西方国家不愿意缓和国际紧张局势，也不愿意按照德国人民自己的愿望，以及保障欧洲各国人民安全的需要，来和平解决德国问题。
    谈到西方国家和波恩政府广泛鼓吹的所谓“自由选举”时，乌布利希说，在占领政权下，在军国主义和法西斯组织遍布西德，波恩和巴黎战争条约的政策正在执行的情况下，根本谈不到真正自由的、民主的全德选举。自由、民主的选举只有在爱好和平的德国人民自己创造了民主条件的时候才有可能举行。这就需要成立一个临时的全德政府。
    乌布利希严厉斥责了波恩总理阿登纳所奉行的政策，指出，阿登纳所努力争取的并不是统一德国，而是要加深德国的分裂；并不是和平解决德国问题，而是要把西德并入军事集团，是准备战争。柏林外长会议的情况说明，德意志民主共和国政府才是德国人的民族利益的真正代表者。波恩政府逐渐失去西德人民的支持和欧洲人民的信任，正在越来越依靠外国占领势力。
    乌布利希号召德国青年加紧进行斗争，争取和平解决德国问题，维护和平，反对西德重新军国主义化，在德意志民主共和国模范地完成工作，以使西德青年可以从德意志民主共和国得到鼓舞，去进行反对贫困、争取改善生活的斗争。乌布利希最后说，我们支持西德青年为争取自由和反对奴役性的波恩和巴黎条约而斗争，为争取撤退占领军和取消外国军事基地从而解放西德的德国人民而斗争，为争取德国人民要求缔结一个公正的和约的权利、为争取东西德代表之间的协议、为成立一个临时的全德政府以准备全德民主选举而斗争。
