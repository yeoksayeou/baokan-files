    Xinhua News Agency report:
    The North China People's Drama Troupe in Rural Areas
    The North China People's Drama Troupe, from December 10th of last year to January 14th of this year, for more than thirty days, toured seven districts and sixteen townships in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, and four districts and six townships in Yutian County, performing twenty-four short and concise artistic programs, and showed movies and slides many times, with a total audience of more than 420,000 people.
    This tour of the drama troupe fully utilized artistic forms that farmers loved to see and hear, such as small song and dance performances, Ping Opera, Qinshu storytelling, Shandong Kuaishu rhyming stories, and clapper talks, making the propaganda of the general line easy to understand. Wherever the troupe went, farmers from villages within ten to twenty li around came to watch by cart and on livestock. The troupe used typical local events to sing about real people and real things, which played a great educational role for the farmers. In Laozhuangzi, District 3, Fengrun County, the troupe discovered Li Junying, a model grain seller, and immediately composed a song about his exemplary deeds. After watching the performance, Li Junying went home and carefully calculated and sold more than one stone of wheat, and also motivated many people to sell surplus grain.
    The drama troupe's theatrical workers demonstrated great enthusiasm in their propaganda activities in the countryside. Regardless of the cold winter, they often performed until late at night in open-air plazas, and some people persisted in working even with frozen hands and feet. Wu Fengyuan, an eighteen-year-old actress and member of the Communist Youth League, played five roles in one performance, dancing and then performing clapper talk. Although the actors were all stage actors, they knew that the local farmers liked Ping Opera the most, so four actors actively learned to perform Ping Opera. Zhang Zhen of the creative team created a new Ping Opera "A Right Path" overnight in order to supply performance materials in a timely manner. In more than thirty days, the drama troupe compiled more than forty songs, Shandong Kuaishu, small song and dance programs, etc., based on many real people and real events, which timely solved the problem of the lack of singing materials.
     “Now we can see socialism!”
    The film education work team of Heze Prefecture, Shandong Province, has rented films such as "The Visit of Chinese Farmers' Representatives to the Soviet Union," "Soviet Agriculture," "Government Member," and related grain issues: "Defending Tsaritsyn," and "Unforgettable 1919" from the Shandong Provincial Office of the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation, and screened them in the Heze area. The above five films were shown thirty-nine times, with an audience of 32,750 people. The screening of these films has powerfully cooperated with the study of the general line. For example, when "Soviet Agriculture" was shown in the Fifth District of Heze, the masses in various villages were studying and discussing the general line. The discussion among the masses in Lizhuang, Guanmiao, was not enthusiastic enough. After watching the film, the discussion became more enthusiastic; the farmers said: "Seeing the good times of the Soviet farmers, and then looking at the times we are living in, we should quickly organize and catch up with the Soviet elder brother!" After "The Visit of Chinese Farmers' Representatives to the Soviet Union" was released, the audience said: "Now we can see socialism!" After "Soviet Agriculture" and "Government Member" were shown to more than 300 representatives of the mutual aid and cooperation representative training class in the entire prefecture, the representatives said: "After watching 'Soviet Agriculture,' we felt that socialist agriculture is very good; after watching 'Government Member,' we felt that the collective movement in the Soviet Union was also difficult, with special agents sabotaging and also lazy people and hooligans. To live a socialist rural life, we must be vigilant against bad elements causing trouble, and at the same time, we must educate those with backward ideas." Some people also said: "These two films solve more problems than giving several oral lectures." (Li Feng)
    Trying out new songs
    The Southwest Musicians Association and the Sichuan Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau organized music workers in Chengdu in early December of last year to create songs to publicize the general line. By late December, more than forty musical works had been completed. On December 26th of last year and January 16th of this year, two creative trial singing sessions were held. The works tried out included: "Motherland Construction March," "Rowing a Wooden Boat to Sell Grain," "We Want to Sell Our Grain to the State," "Qiaomen Tree," "In the Newly Built City," "Song of Labor," "Tractor," "Searching for Treasures in the Motherland's Underground," and other songs, as well as two piano pieces such as "Happy Times."
    In the twenty days after the first creative trial singing session, the music workers' creative team continued to produce a total of forty-three works; there were great improvements in the methods of discussion and organization, which encouraged creative enthusiasm. (Xiao Qianlin)
    More than 4.4 million New Year pictures
    The Central South People's Literature and Art Publishing House published more than 4.4 million New Year pictures for 1954, which have been distributed by the Central South Xinhua Bookstore. There are twenty kinds of these New Year pictures, including door gods and stove gods. Since September of last year, the branches and mobile service teams of the Xinhua Bookstore in various parts of Central South, as well as the supply and marketing cooperatives in various places, have been selling them to the vast number of farmers batch by batch. As a result of planned distribution, many paintings were quickly purchased by people as soon as they arrived at the bookstore. The stove god painting "Auspicious New Year Picture," which farmers love most, has been published in more than 1.7 million copies. A considerable number of New Year pictures have also been distributed to various parts of the country. "Thank you, dear Volunteer Army uncles!" A painting sold more than 13,000 copies in the Southwest.
    The art workers who painted these New Year pictures all participated in real life in depth before creating, repeatedly listened to the opinions of the masses, and then carefully engaged in creation. Each painting has rich political and educational significance. These New Year pictures have very exquisite pictures and are printed in five colors, making each one very beautiful and generous. Among them, paintings such as "Harvesting Wheat and Resting" and "District Committee Secretary and Farmers" have been posted in cultural centers in many places to cooperate with the propaganda of the general line.

    Residents' Entertainment Groups
    More than 1,000 members of more than 50 residents' mass entertainment groups in Nanjing City, with the help of cultural centers in various districts, after studying the general line, collected or wrote materials to publicize the general line, and conducted propaganda to the masses during the Spring Festival entertainment activities. Nearly 100 members of the residents' entertainment group in the Third District rehearsed more than 20 programs and prepared to perform 15 shows. They used forms such as crosstalk, clapper talk, songs and dances, etc. The six residents' entertainment groups in the Second District are rehearsing short plays and songs and dances such as "On the Way to Sell Grain." The residents' entertainment group in the Sixth District rehearsed local operas such as "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Watching Lanterns" to promote the worker-peasant alliance, and performed for farmers in the suburbs during the Spring Festival.

    组织文化艺术工作者广泛宣传总路线
    华北人民话剧团在农村
    华北人民话剧团从去年十二月十日到今年一月十四日的三十多天中，在河北省丰润县的七个区十六个乡镇和玉田县的四个区六个乡镇，巡回演出短小精悍的文艺节目二十四场，并放映了电影、幻灯多次，观众共有四十二万多人。
    话剧团这次巡回演出，充分运用了农民喜闻乐见的小歌舞、评剧、琴书、山东快书、快板等文艺形式，使总路线的宣传做到通俗易懂。剧团每到一处，周围一二十里村庄的农民都坐大车、骑牲口赶来观看。剧团运用各地的典型事迹，演唱真人真事，对农民起了很大的教育作用。剧团在丰润县三区老庄子发现卖粮模范李俊英，立即以他的模范事迹编成歌曲演唱。李俊英看了演出后，回家又精打细算，多卖了一石多麦子，还带动许多人出卖余粮。
    话剧团的戏剧工作者们在下乡进行宣传活动中，都发挥了极大的工作热情。不论在寒冷的冬天里，在露天大广场上，他们都经常演出到深夜，有的人冻了手脚也坚持工作不肯休息。十八岁的女演员、青年团员吴凤媛在一场演出中，身兼五个角色，跳完表演舞，又说快板。演员们虽然都是演话剧的，可是知道当地农民最喜欢评剧，有四个演员就积极学习演评剧。创作组的张桢为了及时供应演出材料，连夜创作成新评剧“一条正路”。在三十多天中，话剧团依据许多真人真事编出四十多个歌曲，山东快书、小歌舞等节目，及时解决了演唱材料缺乏的问题。（据新华社讯）
     “这可看到社会主义啦！”
    山东省菏泽专区的电影教育工作队，自开始大张旗鼓地宣传总路线以来，先后自中国影片经理公司山东省办事处租了“中国农民代表访苏经过”、“苏联农业”、“政府委员”及有关粮食问题的：“保卫察里津”、“难忘的一九一九年”等影片，在菏泽地区放映。以上五部影片共放映三十九次，观众三万二千七百五十人。这些影片的放映，有力地配合了关于总路线的学习。如在菏泽五区放出“苏联农业”时，各村正在学习讨论总路线，关庙李庄群众讨论不够热烈，看了电影，讨论就热烈起来了；农民说：“看苏联农民老大哥过的好时光，再看咱过的时光，就该很快地组织起来，赶上苏联老大哥！”“中国农民代表访苏经过”放出后，观众们都说：“这可看到社会主义啦！”当“苏联农业”和“政府委员”给全专区互助合作代表训练班三百多名代表放映后，代表们说：“先看‘苏联农业’感到社会主义的农业很好；又看到‘政府委员’感到苏联搞集体运动时也很艰难，有特务分子破坏，也有懒汉二流子，要想过社会主义的农村生活，必须警惕坏分子捣乱，同时要教育那些有落后思想的人。”也有人说：“这两部影片比口头讲几遍都解决问题。”（李峰）
    试唱新的歌曲
    西南音乐工作者协会和四川省人民政府文化事业管理局在去年十二月初，组织成都市的音乐工作者创作宣传总路线的歌曲，到十二月下旬，已完成音乐创作四十多件。去年十二月二十六日和今年一月十六日，举行了两次创作试唱会。试唱的作品包括：“祖国建设进行曲”、“驾着木船去卖粮”、“我们的粮食要卖给国家”、“窍门树”、“在新建设的城市里”、“劳动之歌”、“拖拉机”、“向祖国地下找宝藏”等歌曲及“快乐的时光”等两首钢琴曲。
    在第一次创作试唱会后，仅仅二十天当中，音乐工作者创作小组继续产生了作品共四十三件；在讨论和组织的方法上有了很大的改进，从而鼓舞了创作热情。（萧前林）
      四百多万张新年画
    中南人民文学艺术出版社出版的一九五四年年画四百四十万多张，已由中南新华书店发行完毕。这些年画共有二十种，其中还有门画和灶画多种，从去年九月开始由中南各地的新华书店的分店和流动服务队，以及各地供销合作社一批批地推销到了广大农民手中。由于计划发行的结果，许多画一到书店，很快就被人们购买了去。农民们最喜爱的那幅灶画“新年吉庆图”已经出版了一百七十万多张。还有为数不少的年画，发行到全国各地去。“感谢您，亲爱的志愿军叔叔！”一幅画在西南就销售了一万三千多张。
    绘制这些年画的美术工作者在创作以前都深入地参加了实际生活，反复地听取群众意见，然后精心从事创作的。每张画都有丰厚的政治教育意义。这些年画画面十分精致，加上五色彩印，张张都很美观大方。其中“收麦和休息的时候”和“区委书记与农民”等画，被很多地方的文化馆张贴起来，用以配合总路线的宣传。（新华社）
    居民文娱组
    南京市五十多个居民群众文娱组的组员一千多人，在各区文化馆的帮助下，经过总路线的学习，搜集或自己编写了以宣传总路线为内容的材料，在春节文娱活动中向群众进行宣传。三区居民文娱组组员近一百人分头排练了二十几个节目，准备演出十五场。他们运用的形式有相声、快板、歌舞等。二区的六个居民文娱组正在排“卖粮路上”等短剧和歌舞。六区居民文娱组排演“姑嫂看灯”等宣传工农联盟的地方戏，在春节期间向郊区农民演出。（据新华社讯）
