    The Current Situation and the Press
    (Summary of Comrade Molotov's Report at the All-Union Editorial Conference on September 22, 1928)
      I. The Press and Party Slogans
    Comrades! This conference, the conference of newspaper editors, has been brewing for a long time. The press, especially all our newspapers, occupies a most important position in the entire work of the Party and socialist construction. Compared to the last editorial conference in 1925, we have made great achievements in this regard.
    Since the 14th Party Congress, the slogan of national industrialization has become our central slogan. It goes without saying how great a role the press has played in explaining this basic slogan of the Party. The 15th Party Congress put the slogan of collectivization on the agenda of mass work. The role of the press in popularizing this slogan among the broad masses of poor and middle peasants in rural areas, not to mention among the workers, has also been enormous. The significance of the press, especially the significance of newspapers, is now particularly significant because the Party has put forward slogans such as cultural revolution and self-criticism. If it is easy to understand that the press should occupy a particularly prominent position in the work of realizing the slogan of cultural revolution, then the press has also occupied a primary position in realizing the slogan of self-criticism.
    Of course, self-criticism should not only be a characteristic of the press. At present, the slogan of self-criticism should be implemented in the work of every Communist Party member and every conscious proletarian, no matter what organization he works in; because in the institutions of our practical work, Party institutions are no exception, there are many bureaucratic phenomena and many so-called "bureaucratic disguises," and the slogan of self-criticism can mobilize the working masses to fight against these phenomena. However, at the newspaper editorial conference, it should be sincerely admitted that this slogan is equally realistic for the work of the press itself today. In order to ensure that this conference guarantees our true and comprehensive understanding of the basic task of realizing the slogan of self-criticism, all participants should seriously ask themselves this question: How should this slogan be applied to the work of the press itself, especially to the work of newspapers.
    The Party's policy has won the unanimous support of the broad working class, and similarly in the countryside, it has not only won the support of the broad poor and farmhand strata, but also the unanimous support of the middle peasants. This is one of the basic prerequisites for carrying out the slogan of self-criticism widely and practically. However, with the deep trust and mass support of the workers and advanced peasant strata for our policies, the Party still has to constantly check the correctness of the work of its institutions, check the correctness of the plans implemented by these institutions, and also propose new tasks in order to adapt to new situations. …

    V. The Slogan of Self-Criticism and the Press
    …The main significance of the slogan of self-criticism lies in guiding the masses to fight against the shortcomings in our institutions and doing everything possible to launch a struggle from the bottom up. In this case, fearing to carry out self-criticism from the bottom up, fearing that ordinary workers or poor peasants in rural areas will "criticize" too fiercely or too rudely, is the worst kind of disguised bureaucratic attitude towards the masses. We should carry out a series of merciless struggles against this bureaucratic fear in our institutions. Hasn't the bureaucratic attack of certain of our institutions affected the worker-peasant correspondent movement? Attention to this matter has obviously been relaxed recently. It should be hoped that the worker-peasant correspondent congress convened by "Pravda" will focus on this issue.
    The significance of carrying out self-criticism lies not only in attracting the masses to the work of all proletarian organizations, but also in re-educating the masses on the basis of their participation in socialist construction. The task of socialism is not only to transform small commodity economy, but also to re-educate the working masses themselves, first of all to carry out socialist education for the vanguard of the laborers - the working class. From this, it is clear how profound the political significance of the slogan of self-criticism is.
    Among the comrades present at this meeting, there must be many people who, when talking about self-criticism, often think of many difficulties, the difficulties encountered in actually carrying out this slogan. There is no doubt that there are many difficulties. On this issue, sometimes even the Party organization lacks the necessary support for the newspaper, and has not carried out enough struggle to overcome the attitude of bureaucratically treating self-criticism. Newspaper workers, especially the editors-in-chief of local newspapers, should know more than one such fact. Therefore, our press, and especially those of our newspapers that are the best run, are truly standing at the forefront of self-criticism, and this is not in vain. Newspapers that are truly connected with the workers and peasant masses are now receiving a large amount of material from the broad workers and peasants criticizing the shortcomings of the Soviets, cooperatives, trade unions, economic institutions, and Party organizations themselves. Our newspapers are receiving more and more of this kind of material. Without widely using this material in the newspapers, it is actually impossible to carry out self-criticism. The best newspaper workers who are now at the forefront of self-criticism should continue to stand firmly, consistently, in a revolutionary and communist spirit in this position in the future. It is necessary to eliminate the fact that the "Worker-Peasant Inspection Bureau Column" in the newspaper seems to have become a part that is completely unrelated to the entire newspaper. Under the leadership of the Party, the newspaper must more resolutely eliminate shortcomings and more accurately hit the boils of bureaucracy. When it is particularly necessary in this regard, the higher-level Party organs should provide assistance to the local newspapers. But the leaders of the newspapers must always remember that what they have accomplished is only a part of the work that the Party organization and the Party have led and realized.
    As everyone knows, the circulation of our newspapers has doubled in the last four years. However, our newspapers still cannot reach the tens of millions of workers. Not only in remote rural areas, but also in cities, the culturally backward working class does not yet have newspapers. Therefore, we cannot but admit that the time is ripe to establish newspapers that are as popular as possible, such as "The Worker's Kopek." At the same time, it is necessary to run the "Peasant Newspaper" in a very popular way, so that it is easier for the most culturally backward strata in rural areas to accept. The newspaper should take appropriate measures to make its work more closely integrated with the task of realizing the slogan of cultural revolution.
    Everyone is familiar with the particularly great role of the press in economic construction. Until recently, we were not doing enough to serve the needs of agriculture. Therefore, the Central Committee called on us to start a large new agricultural newspaper. Staff members of the central, especially local, agricultural organs, as well as staff members of various cooperatives related to rural areas, should actively participate in the work of this newspaper.
    I would also like to talk about the issue of self-criticism in the press itself. I don't know why we don't hear about the central leading newspapers criticizing other central newspapers, and there is almost a lack of criticism of local newspapers. In fact, under the monopoly of the Communist Party's press, this situation is extremely harmful. Not only at the central level, but also in all regions, we should move forward by leaps and bounds according to this policy.
    Finally, I should talk about the issue of our news reporting. For this reason, mainly because I want to talk about the issue of reporting on the international situation, I will talk about the beloved organ of TASS (a voice from the seat said: "Go ahead!"). The time is ripe to carry out the necessary major improvements in this regard. Sometimes we have the most "interesting" detailed reports on foreign news... Reported a lot of small things, reported the life events of a certain General Zhang in China. Also paid too much attention to the empty talk of such vile social democrats as Paul Boncour in the League of Nations. The reporting on this aspect should be greatly shortened. We should pay attention to every change and new event, no matter how significant, in the bourgeois camp, especially among social democrats and imperialist groups. At the same time, too little attention is paid to the basic issues in the economic and social development of foreign countries, and completely insufficient attention is paid to the real situation of the working masses in bourgeois countries, and this is the main thing! I will give an example in this regard. "Industry and Commerce News" (Issue 211) recently published a very important report on the report of the World Economic Group of the Soviet State Planning Commission, which cited the development of the world economy and the economy of individual countries... Unfortunately, after these materials were published, other newspapers did not publish any reports. This is not entirely because they have already published these materials. It must be reminded that we often lack good reports with Marxist insights and Bolshevik sensitivity to the masses. But this is a very, very important matter. …

    目前形势和报刊
    （莫洛托夫同志在一九二八年九月二十二日全苏编辑会议上报告的摘要）
      一、报刊和党的口号
    同志们！这次会议，报纸编辑的会议，早就酝酿成熟了。报刊，首先是我们的一切报纸，在整个党的工作和社会主义建设中，居于最重要的地位。较之一九二五年上次编辑会议的时候，我们在这方面有了巨大的成就。
    自第十四次党代表大会以来，国家工业化的口号成了我们的中心口号，报刊在解释党的这个基本口号上起着何等巨大作用，用不着再说了。第十五次党代表大会把集体化的口号提到群众工作的议事日程上来，这一口号在广大农村的贫农和中农群众中、更不用说在工人中间普及开来，报刊的作用也是巨大的。报刊的意义，首先是报纸的意义，现在由于党提出了如文化革命和自我批评这些口号而特别重大了。如果报刊在实现文化革命口号的工作中应该占有特别显要地位这件事是容易理解的话，那么报刊在实现自我批评的口号中也已居于首要的地位了。
    当然，自我批评不应该只是报刊的特点。在目前，自我批评的口号应该贯彻在每一个共产党员，每一个自觉的无产者的工作中，无论他是在什么组织中工作都是一样；因为在我们的实际工作的机构中，党的机构也不例外，存在着很多的官僚主义和很多的所谓“官僚主义的变相”，自我批评的口号就能动员工人群众，和这些现象进行斗争。可是在报纸编辑会议上应该真诚地承认，这个口号对于报刊本身今天同样有着极其现实的意义。要使这次会议保证我们对于实现自我批评口号的基本任务有真正的全面的理解，参加会议的人都应该认真地向自己提出这样的问题：这个口号应该如何运用到报刊自己这方面的工作中去，特别是运用到报纸的工作中去。
    党的政策获得了广大工人阶级的一致拥护，同样在农村中也不仅获得了广大贫雇农阶层的拥护，而且也获得了中农群众的一致拥护。这是广泛地实际地开展自我批评口号的基本前提之一。然而，有了工人和先进农民阶层对于我们政策的深厚的信任和群众性的拥护，党还是要时常去检查自己机关中工作的正确性，检查这些机构所执行的方案的正确性，而且为了适应新的情况，党还要提出新的任务。……
    五、自我批评口号和报刊
    ……自我批评口号的主要意义，在于引导群众和我们机关里的缺点进行斗争，尽一切力量来发动自下而上的斗争。在这种情况下，害怕开展自下而上的自我批评，害怕普通的工人或农村中的贫农“批评”得太激烈或太粗鲁，是一种最坏的变相的对群众的官僚主义态度。我们应该和我们机关中的这种官僚主义的恐惧，进行一系列的无情的斗争。难道我们某些机关官僚主义的攻击对工农通讯员运动没有影响吗？最近对这件事情的注意显然是放松了。应该希望“真理报”召开的工农通讯员代表大会，会着重地提出这个问题。
    开展自我批评的意义，不仅在于把群众吸引到一切无产阶级组织的工作中来，而且在于在他们参加社会主义建设的基础上来重新教育群众。社会主义的任务，不仅是改造小商品经济，而且要重新教育劳动群众本身，首先是对劳动者的先锋队——工人阶级进行社会主义教育。由此可见，自我批评的口号具有何等深刻的政治意义，是很明白的。
    在这儿出席会议的同志们中间，一定有不少这样的人，他们在讲到关于自我批评的时候，经常想起许多的困难，在实际开展这个口号时所遇到的困难。困难无疑是很多的，在这个问题上，有时候甚至党组织对机关报也缺乏必要的支持，对于克服官僚主义地对待自我批评的态度这方面，也未能进行足够的斗争。报刊工作者，首先是地方报纸的总编辑，应该知道的这类事实不只一个。所以，我们的报刊，而首先是我们报纸中那些办得最好的，真正站在自我批评的前哨，并不是徒劳无益的。真正和工人与农民群众有联系的报纸，现在从广大工人和农民那儿收到了大量的批评苏维埃、合作社、职工会、经济机关和党组织本身的缺点的材料。我们的报纸所收到的这种材料正愈来愈多。不在报纸上广泛运用这种材料，实际上就不可能使自我批评开展起来。现在走在自我批评前列的最好的报纸工作者，今后也应该坚定地、始终不渝地以革命的精神和共产主义精神站在这个岗位上。必须消除这样的事实，这就是报纸上的“工农检查局专栏”似乎变成和整个报纸毫不相干的一部分。必须使报纸在党的领导之下，更坚决地消除缺点，更准确地击中官僚主义的脓疮。在这方面特别必要时，上级的党机关要对地方报纸加以帮助。但报纸的领导人员必须永远记住，他们所完成的只是党组织和党所领导实现的那个工作的一部分。
    众所周知，最近四年来我们报纸的发行份数提高了一倍。然而我们的报纸还是达不到千千万万的劳动者那儿去。不仅在偏僻的乡村地区，就是在城市里面，文化落后的劳动阶层也还没有报纸。所以我们不能不承认，建立如像“工人的戈比”那样的尽可能通俗的报纸的时机已完全成熟了。同时必须把“农民报”办得非常通俗，使农村中的文化最落后的阶层更易于接受。报纸方面要用适当的措施，使自己的工作更能结合实现文化革命口号的任务。
    报刊在经济建设事业中特别巨大的作用，大家是很熟悉的。直到最近我们对服务于农业的需要这方面来说，是不够的。因此，中央委员会号召我们必须创办一个大的新农业报纸。中央的特别是地方的农业机关的工作人员以及和农村有关的各种合作社的工作人员，应该积极参加这个报纸的工作。
    还要谈一谈关于报刊本身的自我批评问题。不知为什么我们听不到中央的领导的机关报批评别的中央机关报这样的事情，而且对地方机关报的批评几乎也是缺乏的。其实，在共产党报刊的专营的情况下，这种情形是极其有害的。不仅是中央方面，而且在各个地区都应该按照这个方针大踏步地前进。
    最后，应该谈到关于我们的新闻报道的问题。由于这个缘故，主要的由于要谈关于国际情况的报道问题，我就要讲到塔斯社这个敬爱的机关（从席位上发出呼声：“请吧！”）。在这方面进行必要的重大的改善的时机已经成熟了。我们在国外新闻方面有时候有着最“有趣的”详尽的报道……报道了很多的小事情，报道了中国的某一个张将军的生活事件。还过多地注意了如普恩凯尔那种卑劣的社会党人在国际联盟中的空谈。关于这方面的报道应该大大地缩短。我们应该注意到资产阶级阵营中，特别是社会党人和帝国主义集团中每一个无论多么重大的变动和新的事件。同时，对于国外的经济和社会发展中的基本问题注意得太不够了，对于资产阶级国家中劳动群众真实的情况是完全不够注意的，而这是主要的事情！我举一个这方面的例子。“工商业报”（第二百十一期）不久前发表了一个十分重要的关于苏联国家计划委员会世界经济组的报告的报道，报道中引举了关于世界经济和个别国家经济的发展状况……可惜在这些材料公布之后，其他的报纸，却没有发表任何的报道。这完全不是因为它们已刊载过这些材料的缘故。必须提醒大家，具有马克思主义的见解和对群众有布尔什维克的敏感的好的报道，我们还常常是缺乏的。但这是非常、非常重要的事情。……
