During the Spring Festival, workers and peasants of all ethnic groups in Ningxia Province extensively carried out worker-peasant get-together activities, further strengthening the unity between workers and peasants. Before the Spring Festival, the Ningxia Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated a plan to conduct education on the worker-peasant alliance among factory and mine workers and the masses of peasants in conjunction with the general line. Workers and peasants of all ethnic groups throughout the province learned about the principles of mutual support between workers and peasants, agriculture and industry, and urban and rural areas through writing letters, holding discussion forums, and visiting each other, strengthening the ties between workers and peasants.

Last year, 697 mu of wheat in the Fourth Township of the First District of Lingwu County were affected by wheat midges. The government promptly supplied more than 3,000 jin of "666" insecticide powder and 40 sprayers, which eliminated the pests, resulting in an average yield of 342 jin of wheat per mu. After education on the general line and the worker-peasant alliance, the Hui and Han farmers in the township wrote to the workers, saying: "This is all thanks to the benefits you, our worker elder brothers, have brought to us farmers." The employees of the Ningxia Provincial Enterprise Company Flour Mill continuously set ten new production records in the past year, with an average wheat flour extraction rate reaching 90 percent, setting the highest record in the Northwest region. The employees said in their letters to the farmers: "The reason why we can win battles on the production front is because you have increased grain production. Without the support of farmers of all ethnic groups, we workers would not be able to successfully complete our production increase tasks."

On the second day of the Spring Festival, the Ningxia Provincial Federation of Trade Unions organized two "Worker Rural慰問团" (Worker Rural慰問团) to visit and express appreciation to the farmers and agricultural workers of the state-owned Lingwu and Qianjin Farms in counties such as Pingluo, Ningshuo, and Lingwu. When the farmers of Pingluo County learned that the慰問团 (consolation group) would be arriving on February 4th, more than 1,200 people, including the heads of agricultural production mutual aid teams, members of agricultural production cooperatives, farmer representatives, and propagandists from the entire county, rushed to the agricultural production cooperative led by Mo Ruxin, a provincial special-class labor model, to wait for them at the crack of dawn. After the arrival of the 慰問团 (consolation group), the Yangko team organized by the farmers themselves came out of the village to greet them from afar. The worker representatives of the two 慰問团 (consolation group) held discussion forums with the farmers and visited dozens of farmers individually. In order to congratulate the farmers on the Spring Festival, the 慰問团 (consolation group) also presented some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams with new-style walking plows, banners, portraits of Chairman Mao, candies, red flowers and other gifts. The farmers of the Third District of Ningshuo took the steamed buns they made themselves and invited the workers to eat them. Many workers said with emotion: It feels even warmer than returning to my own home. During the get-together and visits, the farmers held on to the workers for a long time. After listening to the reports from the farmers, the workers said: "The hard work of our peasant brothers, every grain and every drop of sweat, supports us. In the future, we must find better ways and tap our potential in production in order to supply the farmers with more products." Luo Zhankui, the Hui director of the Luo Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Yinchuan City, said: "When we first established the cooperative in 1952, we didn't even have half a bowl of extra seeds. Now every family is prosperous, and last year we sold more than 23,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. This is all thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the support of our worker elder brothers. We must encourage more farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, produce more grain, and support industrial construction." Around the Spring Festival, farmers from Helan, Yongning, Yinchuan and other places also organized delegations to visit the Ningxia Provincial Enterprise Company Flour Mill, Rice Processing Plant, Yinchuan Power Plant, and Wool Textile Factory, and held discussion forums and get-togethers, which were warmly received by the workers.

    宁夏省春节期间广泛开展工农联欢
    春节期间，宁夏省各族工人和农民广泛开展工农联欢活动，进一步增强工人和农民之间的团结。春节前，中共宁夏省委即拟定了结合总路线的宣传在厂矿职工和农民群众中进行关于工农联盟教育的计划，全省各族工人和农民通过写信、座谈、互相参观等方式，了解了工人和农民、农业和工业、城市和乡村互相支援的道理，加强了工人和农民之间的联系。
    灵武县一区四乡去年有六百九十七亩小麦发生了吸浆虫，政府及时供应了三千多斤“六六六”药粉，四十架喷雾器，消灭了虫害，使每亩小麦平均产三百四十二斤。全乡回汉农民经过总路线和工农联盟宣传教育后，给工人们写信说：“这都是你们工人老大哥给我们农民的好处。”宁夏省企业公司面粉厂职工在去年一年内，生产上连续创造了十次新纪录，小麦出粉率平均达到百分之九十，创造了西北区的最高纪录。职工们给农民的信上说：“我们能在生产战线上打胜仗，就是因为你们增产了粮食，没有各族农民的支援，我们工人就不能很好地完成增产任务。”
    春节第二天，宁夏省工会联合会组织了两个“工人农村慰问团”，分赴平罗、宁朔、灵武等县，慰问农民和国营灵武、前进两农场的农业工人。平罗农民知道慰问团在二月四日要来的消息后，全县的农业生产互助组组长、农业生产合作社的社员、农民代表、宣传员等一千二百多人，天一明就赶到省特等劳动模范莫如信领导的农业生产合作社去等候。慰问团到达以后，农民自己组织的秧歌队就远远出村迎接，两个慰问团的工人代表们和农民举行座谈会外，还分别访问了数十户农民，为了给农民祝贺春节，慰问团还给一些农业生产合作社和互助组赠送了新式步犁、锦旗、毛主席像、糖果、红花等礼物。宁朔三区农民拿着自己亲手做的馍馍请工人们吃，许多工人感动地说：比回到自己家里还亲切。在举行联欢和访问时，农民们抱住工人好久不放。工人们听了农民的报告以后说：“农民兄弟一颗粮一滴汗的辛勤劳动支援我们，今后我们在生产上更要好好的找窍门、挖潜力，以更多的产品供给农民。”银川市郊区罗家庄农业生产合作社社长回民罗占魁说：“我们一九五二年刚成立合作社时，连多余的半碗籽种都没有，现在家家富裕，去年还卖给国家二万三千多斤余粮，这都是共产党的领导和工人老大哥的支援。我们一定要带动更多的农民走互助合作的道路，多打粮食，支援工业建设。”春节前后，贺兰、永宁、银川等地的农民，也先后组织代表团，参观了宁夏省企业公司面粉厂、大米加工厂、银川电厂、毛纺织厂，举行了座谈、联欢，受到了工人们的热情招待。（曹炎　白槐）
