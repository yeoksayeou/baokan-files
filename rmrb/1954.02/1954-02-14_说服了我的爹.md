When Dad came, we were listening to a report on the national grain policy, and we were very engrossed, so we didn't have time to receive him. We only saw him wearing a brand-new cotton-padded coat, with a scarf around his neck, and a red face, being led to the barracks by the duty platoon leader.

After class, I went to see Dad. During the conversation, I learned that the family had already joined a mutual aid team, and Dad had also become a county-level model worker. The county had also taken them to visit a state-owned farm. That new scarf of his was a reward from the county. These past few years, the family's life had been getting better day by day. In the spring, they built three new houses, and Mom's asthma had been cured by the county hospital.

At this point, I asked him: How much grain will you sell to the state after the autumn harvest? Dad hesitated and said, "Sold it." I asked him again how much he sold, and he said 400 jin. I thought, didn't Dad just say that he harvested more than 5,000 jin of grain this year, and there was still grain left over from last year, how could he only sell 400 jin! I explained to him many reasons why he should sell the surplus grain to the state. But he just kept saying I was right, and then making excuses that he didn't have any grain. I thought to myself, how backward, and he's supposed to be a model worker? However, I remembered what the instructor said in class: We must patiently persuade and educate the peasants. So I calmed myself down.

I calculated the detailed account with him, and Dad had no way out, so he said: "Isn't there still a few hundred jin of grain left? What if something happens and we need grain? Don't you know about 'storing grain to guard against famine'?" As soon as I heard this, I realized that was the problem. So I asked him: "Dad! Don't you remember what happened in 1942? Why didn't you 'store grain to guard against famine' then?" That year, as soon as the harvest was in, the landlord forced him to pay debts, so Dad sold the newly harvested grain. At that time, the landlord and the unscrupulous merchants desperately drove down the price, and the grain obtained from a year of hard work was sold off as cheaply as dirt. The family had food for one meal but not the next, and grain was as expensive as gold. My little brother cried all day long from hunger, truly crying to heaven with no way out, begging for help with no door to knock on. In desperation, we had to sell our little sister to get three dou and five sheng of grain. Even now, my sister is still missing, and Mom cries whenever this matter is mentioned; her illness came from that. When I got to this point, Dad also shed tears. I said, think about where today's good life came from, how can you want to hoard grain as soon as you've turned over, making things difficult for the country, and letting brothers who lack grain go hungry? Dad didn't say a word.

After a while, I asked him again: "Dad, haven't you visited the state-owned farm? You saw how they use tractors to cultivate the land..." As soon as I said this, Dad said: "No need to say anymore, I understand. Only by working together to build the country well can we have an even better life." Then we calculated the account in detail, and Dad said that he could sell another 800 jin of grain to the state. The next day, the comrades all came to ask me about it, and the instructor praised me during roll call. What could I say! I could only say: "I am also doing my bit for socialism."

### 说服了我的爹

    说服了我的爹
    人民解放军某部战士　郭献忠
    爹来的时候，我们正在听关于国家粮食政策的报告，听得很起劲，也没功夫接待他，只看见他穿着崭新的棉袄，脖子上围着一条围巾，脸上红喷喷的，被值星排长领到营房里去了。
    下课以后，我就去看爹。谈话中，知道家里已经参加了互助组，爹也当了县的劳动模范，县里还领他们到国营农场去参观，他那条新围巾，就是县里奖给他的。这几年家里的日子一天比一天好起来，春上盖了三间房，娘的气喘病，也让县里的医院给治好了。
    这时我就问他：秋后卖给国家多少粮食？爹吞吞吐吐地说“卖啦”。我又问他卖了多少，他说四百斤，我想爹方才不是说，今年打了五千多斤粮食，去年的粮食还有剩余，怎么才卖四百斤呢！我就给他讲了许多要把余粮卖给国家的道理。那知他光说对，就是推说没粮食。我心想，这样落后，还是劳动模范呢？但是，我又想起教导员上课讲的：对农民必须耐心说服教育。我才把心耐下来。
    我跟他算了细账，爹没法了，才说：“可不是还剩几百斤粮食，要是都卖了，再有个事用粮食怎办呢？你不知道‘积谷防饥’吗？”我一听，原来问题在这儿，我就问他：“爹！你不记得民国三十一年的事了？那时你怎不‘积谷防饥’呢？”，那一年刚收下粮，地主就逼着要账，爹就把新收的粮食往外卖，那时，地主和奸商就拚命压价，辛苦一年得到的粮食，就这样像泥土一样贱卖出去，弄的一家人吃上顿，没下顿，粮食贵的像金子一样，小弟弟饿得整天哭叫，真是哭天无路，求地无门。没办法，只好把小妹妹卖了，换了三斗五升谷子，直到现在，妹妹还找不到影，娘一提这事就哭，他的病就是从这儿来的。讲到这，爹也流泪了，我就说，你想想，今天的好日子是从那来的，怎么你刚翻身就想把粮食囤起来，让国家为难，让缺粮兄弟打饥荒呢？爹一句话也不说了。
    停了一会，我又问他：“爹，你不是参观过国营农场吗？你看用拖拉机种地……”刚说到这，爹说：“不用说啦，我想通了，只有大伙出力把国家建设好，才能有咱们更好的日子。”接着我们细算了一下账，爹说可以再卖给国家八百斤粮食。第二天，同志们都来问我，指导员在点名时还表扬我，这叫我怎么说呢！我只能说：“我也是为社会主义，尽了一点点力量。”
