Xinhua News Agency, February 7th:

    In order to adapt to the requirements of the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, and to strengthen the propaganda work related to Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held its first National Propaganda Work Conference in Beijing in late January.

    The conference affirmed the achievements made in propaganda work since the Third National Work Conference of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held in April 1953, and discussed in detail the future direction and tasks of propaganda work. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the propaganda work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association must, in accordance with the Party's general line and general task during the transition period and the nature of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, further carry out internationalist education with the basic content of publicizing Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union. The conference pointed out that the organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at all levels must, under the direct leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels, closely cooperate with various people's organizations and relevant parties, and carry out propaganda on Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union in light of the central work of the state in each period and the central work of the local area, focusing on the production needs and ideological conditions of the masses. The conference emphasized that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should launch propaganda work to the broad masses of the people across the country, but should first focus on workers and peasants, and focus on the two main links of the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture to carry out propaganda. At the same time, it is necessary not only to publicize the advanced construction experience and advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, but also to publicize the significant role of combining this advanced experience and advanced technology with China's actual conditions. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously recognized that in the new period of large-scale national construction, the task of publicizing Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union is more arduous. Therefore, the staff of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at all levels must deeply study the Party's general line during the transition period, study Marxist-Leninist theory and knowledge about the Soviet Union, become excellent propaganda workers, and strive to carry out the propaganda of Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union in a deep and extensive manner.

    Representatives of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations from various regions exchanged experiences in propaganda work at the meeting.

    This conference received the care and attention of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Denisov, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, sent a telegram to congratulate the conference. Academician Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China, and Sokolov, the representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, hosted a banquet for the representatives attending the conference during the conference. At the closing of the conference, all the representatives unanimously adopted a reply telegram to Denisov, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.

    中苏友协举行全国宣传工作会议
    决定深入开展中苏友好和学习苏联的宣传
    【新华社七日讯】为了适应国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的要求，加强有关中苏友好和学习苏联的宣传工作，中苏友好协会总会一月下旬在北京举行第一次全国宣传工作会议。
    会议肯定了在一九五三年四月举行的中苏友好协会第三次全国工作会议后宣传工作所获得的成绩，并详尽地讨论了今后宣传工作的方针和任务。到会代表一致认为：中苏友好协会的宣传工作，必须根据党在过渡时期的总路线总任务，根据中苏友好协会的性质，进一步开展以宣传中苏友好、学习苏联为基本内容的国际主义教育。会议指出：中苏友好协会的各级组织必须在各级中共党委的直接领导下，与各人民团体和有关方面密切联系合作，根据国家每一时期的中心工作和当地的中心工作，针对群众的生产需要和思想情况来进行中苏友好和学习苏联的宣传。会议强调指出：中苏友好协会应向全国广大人民展开宣传工作，但首先应以工人、农民为主要对象，抓住国家的社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造这两个主要环节来展开宣传。同时，不仅要宣传苏联的先进建设经验，先进科学技术，并且要宣传这种先进经验和先进技术与中国实际相结合的显著作用。到会代表一致认识到：在国家大规模建设的新时期中，宣传中苏友好和学习苏联的任务更繁重了，因此各级中苏友好协会的工作人员必须深入学习国家在过渡时期的总路线，学习马克思列宁主义的理论和有关苏联的各种问题的知识，成为一个优秀的宣传工作者，为深入、广泛地开展中苏友好和学习苏联的宣传工作而努力。
    各地中苏友好协会的代表在会上交流了宣传工作的经验。
    这次会议受到苏联对外文化协会的关怀和重视。苏联对外文化协会理事会主席杰尼索夫曾来电祝贺。苏联驻我国大使尤金院士和苏联对外文化协会代表索柯洛夫曾在会议期间设宴招待参加这次会议的代表。会议闭幕时，全体代表一致通过了致苏联对外文化协会理事会主席杰尼索夫的复电。
