    The Han cadres and staff members of various organs of the Tibet Military Region stationed in the Lhasa area of the Chinese People's Liberation Army universally studied Tibetan language and script in January this year. At the mobilization meeting on January 14th, Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government, called on all cadres and staff members of the organs of the Tibet Military Region stationed in Lhasa to complete the study of Tibetan language and script as an important political task. He pointed out that mastering Tibetan language and script is the main tool for further strengthening the relationship between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and better helping the Tibetan people in construction. At present, various organs in the Lhasa area have already organized classes and established a learning system. Since entering Tibet, the Han cadres and staff members of various organs have attached great importance to learning Tibetan language and script. Some personnel have received specialized training in the language class of the military region's cadre school, and the general personnel have also persisted in learning Tibetan language and script while engaging in production, construction, and business work. Those who have achieved better results in their studies can already use fluent Tibetan to publicize ethnic policies and write short Tibetan letters. Most personnel can also use Tibetan to directly conduct short conversations with Tibetan people. In addition, Han cadres working in areas such as Xigaze, Bomi, and the Thirty-nine Tribes have also persisted in learning Tibetan language and script and have achieved remarkable results.

    西藏军区驻拉萨地区机关干部学习藏族语文
    中国人民解放军西藏军区驻拉萨地区各机关的汉族干部和工作人员，在今年一月间普遍学习藏文藏语。中央人民政府代表张经武将军在一月十四日的学习动员大会上，号召西藏军区驻拉萨机关的全体干部和工作人员，将学习藏文藏语当作重要的政治任务来完成。他指出：学好藏文藏语，是进一步密切藏汉民族关系和更好地帮助西藏人民建设的主要工具。目前，拉萨地区各机关已经编班上课，并建立了学习制度。各机关的汉族干部和工作人员自入藏之日起，对学习藏文藏语就很重视，有些人员曾在军区干部学校语文班进行专门学习，一般人员在生产、修建及进行业务工作的同时，也坚持了藏文藏语的学习。学习成绩较好的人员已能用流利的藏语宣传民族政策，并能写简短的藏文信件，大部分人员也都能用藏语直接和藏民进行简短的交谈。此外，日喀则、波密、三十九族等地区工作的汉族干部，也都坚持了藏文藏语的学习，并取得了显著成绩。
