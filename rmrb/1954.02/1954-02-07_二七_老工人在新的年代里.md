Today, in various units of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, there are still many old workers who actively participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike thirty-one years ago. In those days, they fought bravely against imperialism and feudal warlords for national independence and democratic freedom. Today, in the new historical era when the country is gradually transitioning to socialism, although most of these old workers are already white-haired, most of them still stick to their production posts, dedicating all their energy in their later years to the country and the people.

In the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot factory, one can see an old worker wearing reading glasses operating the largest machine tool in the entire depot—a large gantry planer that can plane workpieces more than ten feet long. This person is Wang Rongcai, a member of the dare-to-die team during the "February 7th" strike. He is seventy years old this year. A long time ago, his colleagues urged him to retire and enjoy his old age according to the labor insurance regulations, but he always refused, saying, "Don't look at my old age, my spirit is not old, and my skills are still there. As long as I live, I will contribute to the construction of the new society and not lag behind the young people." Indeed, Wang Rongcai's work is excellent. In the past four years, he has not had a single rework job in the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot. On the contrary, the working hours required for him to do many jobs are shortened year by year. For example, the working hours he now uses to plane the guide plates, an important part of the locomotive, are almost two-thirds shorter than in 1949. The work of other "February 7th" old workers has also achieved significant results like Wang Rongcai's. Liu Tong, the deputy director of general affairs of the Zhengzhou Railway Trade Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway during the "February 7th" Great Strike, is now in charge of repairing screws in the fitter team of the Zhengzhou Rolling Stock Depot. And he does a very good job. Chu Bochao, the leader of the fitter team of the Zhengzhou Rolling Stock Depot, said, "In the few years since liberation, the Zhengzhou Rolling Stock Depot has never had a situation where the train departure was affected because Liu Tong could not repair the screws." Liu Tong's work is quite difficult. Because the Zhengzhou Rolling Stock Depot's screw tapping machines are still not sufficient, Liu Tong works manually. He stands by the workbench every day, turning the screwdriver frame with both hands. Sometimes his body is very tired, but he has never slackened. Liu Tong said, "Is work tiring? It's really tiring. But building socialism is like climbing a high mountain. If you are afraid of being tired, you can't climb the mountain."

The great goal of building a socialist society inspires all "February 7th" old workers. No matter what work they do, they deeply realize the significance of their work. Li Lunqian, an old "February 7th" worker, used to be a boiler stoker on a shunting locomotive at Zhengzhou Station. Once, he broke his leg while repairing the locomotive and could no longer climb up and down the locomotive. At the beginning of last year, the leadership transferred him to the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot factory to boil water. Li Lunqian boils water and supplies boiling water to hundreds of employees in the entire factory alone. He does this work as conscientiously and responsibly as he did when he was a locomotive stoker in the past. The rules of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot factory stipulate that employees start work at eight o'clock every morning. Li Lunqian comes to the factory at five o'clock every morning to start the fire. In the evening, Li Lunqian leaves later than all the employees. He often says, "Only let the water wait for people, not let people wait for the water." Sometimes he personally delivers water to the workshop or office to avoid employees running back and forth to fetch water and delaying production. When people praise Li Lunqian's work spirit, he always humbly says that he has not done well enough.

The "February 7th" old workers not only do their own work well, but also care very much about the work of other employees. Because they know that building a socialist society depends on everyone's efforts. In this regard, the workers on the locomotive A-inspection platform of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot are very grateful for the help of Zheng Guojun, an old "February 7th" worker. Zheng Guojun was originally a fitter in the braking group and did not work directly on the A-inspection platform, but he often paid attention to the work of the A-inspection platform near his workplace. Once, Zheng Guojun saw the A-inspection platform raising a locomotive. Three of the four lead screws on the A-inspection platform were rising, but one lead screw malfunctioned in the middle and stopped turning. If this situation had been discovered a little later, the locomotive above would have overturned, not only damaging the locomotive but also injuring the workers. Because Zheng Guojun discovered it in time and immediately reminded the workers on the A-inspection platform to pay attention, this major accident was avoided.

The "February 7th" old workers also help young new workers learn technology. Like Wang Rongcai, the seventy-year-old planing machine master mentioned earlier, he has taught several apprentices to learn planing machine operation in a very short period of time. Liu Jiazhen, a young planing worker personally trained by Wang Rongcai, has now participated in the construction of a heavy industrial factory in Northeast China. Liu Zhiqing, an old craftsman in the boiler squad of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot and an old "February 7th" worker, has trained five apprentices to become third- or fourth-grade craftsmen in the years since liberation. Deng Kanggui, Liu Zhiqing's eldest apprentice and an excellent riveting craftsman, has participated in the construction project of the Xiangjiang Bridge and is now building the Hanshui Bridge. The other four apprentices of Liu Zhiqing have either been transferred to other factories in the railway system to work, or have gone abroad to help the Korean people's economic recovery work.

Cherishing national property and actively implementing economic accounting are also characteristics of the "February 7th" old workers. For example, Liu Zhiqing, as long as he has a little free time at work every day, he will search around the workshop and the yard to see if there is any waste. When he saw mechanical equipment placed in the yard, fearing that it would rust, he asked someone to carry it to the warehouse. When he saw that some workers did not cherish materials very much in their work, he made strict criticisms. In order to oppose waste, sometimes, when the person in charge of the factory did not accept his reasonable opinions in time, Liu Zhiqing would write letters to the chairman and ministers of the Zhengzhou District Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union. Liu Zhiqing often said to people, "If you spoil a little material in the factory, it hurts me even more than spoiling something in my own home." Liu Zhiqing's high quality of cherishing national materials has great educational significance for all workers.

    “二七”老工人在新的年代里
    新华社记者　袁蓬
    今天在郑州铁路管理局各单位里，还有许多在三十一年前积极参加“二七”大罢工的老工人。他们当年为了争取民族独立和民主自由，同帝国主义和封建军阀作过英勇斗争。今天，在国家逐步过渡到社会主义的新的历史年代里，虽然这些老工人大部分已经须发苍白了，可是他们大部分仍然坚守在生产岗位上，把晚年的全部精力贡献给国家和人民。
    在郑州机务段工厂，人们可以看到一个戴着老花眼镜的老工人，他开着全段最大的一部机床——能刨刮一丈多长工作物的大龙门刨。这个人就是“二七”罢工时的工人敢死队员王荣才。他今年已经七十岁了。很早以前，和他一起工作的同志们，就劝他按照劳动保险条例退休养老，可是他总是拒绝，他说：“你们别看我年纪老了，我的精神不老，技术也还在，只要我活一天，就要为新社会的建设出一把力，不能落在青年人的后边。”的确，王荣才的工作干得不错。四年多来，他在郑州机务段没有出过一件返工活。相反地，他做许多活所需要的工时是一年年地缩短了。比如他现在刨刮机车上重要部件导板所用的工时，就比一九四九年差不多缩短了三分之二。其他“二七”老工人的工作，也都像王荣才那样获得显著成绩。“二七”大罢工时的京汉铁路郑州工会庶务副主任刘桐，现在郑州车辆段钳工班负责检修螺丝的工作。而且工作做得很好。郑州车辆段钳工班班长楚伯超说：“解放几年来，郑州车辆段从来没有因为刘桐的螺丝修不出来影响过出车。”刘桐的工作是相当艰难的。因为郑州车辆段的套螺丝机床现在还不够用，刘桐干活是用手工，他每天站立在工作台旁，用双手扳动着螺丝刀架子，有时身体累得很疲乏，可是他始终没有懈怠过。刘桐说：“工作累不累呢？真累。可是要建设社会主义好比上高山，要怕累，山就上不去。”
    建设社会主义社会的伟大目标，鼓舞着所有“二七”老工人，他们不管干什么工作，都深刻认识到自己工作的意义。“二七”老工人李伦谦，原来在郑州车站的调车机车上烧锅炉，有一次因为修理机车碰坏了腿，不能再在机车上爬上爬下地干活了，上级就在去年年初调他到郑州机务段工厂烧茶炉。李伦谦烧茶炉，一个人要供给全厂几百个职工开水。他干这个工作，也像过去当机车司炉时候一样认真负责。郑州机务段工厂的制度规定，职工们是在每天上午八点钟开始上班，李伦谦在每天早晨五点钟就来到厂里生火了；晚上，李伦谦又比所有的职工走的都晚。他常说：“只能叫水等人，不能叫人等水。”有时候他还亲自把水送到车间或办公室，免得职工们来回跑着取水，耽误生产。当人们称赞李伦谦工作精神时，他总是谦虚地说，做得还不够好。
      “二七”老工人们不仅把本身负责的工作做好，而且都非常关心别的职工的工作。因为他们知道建设社会主义社会是要靠大家的力量。在这方面，郑州机务段机车甲检台上的工人，非常感激
  “二七”老工人郑国钧对他们的帮助。郑国钧本来是制动组的钳工，不直接在甲检台上干活，可是他对于在他的工作地附近的甲检台的工作时常留意。有一次，郑国钧看见甲检台正在起架机车，甲检台的四根丝杠有三根都在向上升起，有一根丝杠却在中途出了毛病，停止转动了。这个情况如果晚发觉一会儿，上边的机车就要翻倒下来，不仅要摔坏机车，而且要摔坏工人，由于郑国钧及时发现立即提醒甲检台工人的注意，就避免了这个大事故。
   “二七”老工人还帮助年轻的新工人学习技术。像前边所说过的七十岁的老刨床匠王荣才，就曾经教导好几个学徒在很短的时间内学会了刨床操作。经王荣才亲自教育出来的青年刨工刘家振，现在已经参加了东北某重工业工厂的建设。郑州机务段锅炉班老工匠、“二七”老工人刘志清，在解放后几年来，已经培养了五个学徒成为三级或四级工匠。刘志清的大徒弟、出色的铆钉工匠邓康贵，已经参加了湘江大桥的修建工程，现在又在建设汉水大桥。刘志清另外四个徒弟有的调到了铁路系统其他工厂做工，有的已经出国帮助朝鲜人民的恢复经济建设工作。
    爱护国家资财，积极贯彻经济核算，也是“二七”老工人的一个特点。如刘志清，他每天只要工作稍有个空闲，就要在车间和场院里四处搜寻，看有没有浪费现象。他看到有机械设备在场院里放着，怕生锈，就找人把它抬到库房里。他看到有些工人在工作中不大爱护材料，就提出严格的批评。为了反对浪费，有时，工厂的负责人没有及时接受他的合理意见时，刘志清就一直写信告到中国铁路工会郑州区委员会的主席和部长们那里。刘志清常常对人说：“你要糟塌工厂里一点材料，比糟塌我家里的东西还令我心疼。”像刘志清这样高度爱护国家物资的品质，对所有工人都有极大的教育意义。
