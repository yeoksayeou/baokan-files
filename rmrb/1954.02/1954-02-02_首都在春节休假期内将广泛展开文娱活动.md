The six film projection teams under the Beijing Municipal Cultural Affairs Administration will go to rural areas in the suburbs to show films. Urban cultural centers, such as the Xidan Cultural Center and the Qianmen Cultural Center, in coordination with trade unions, organized and guided workers' theatrical groups, preparing plays such as "The Group Leader and the Son-in-law" (Pingju), "The Person in My Heart" (opera), and "Sell the Surplus Grain to the State" (allegro play) to perform with peasants in Zhangguozhuang and other villages in Fengtai, holding joint performances.
