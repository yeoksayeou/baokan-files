Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th. A dispatch by Zhukov and Kraminov was published in "Pravda" on the 8th. This dispatch commented on the results of the second week of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, under the title: "What the Discussion of the German Question at the Berlin Conference Shows."

The reporters wrote: The second week of the Berlin Conference was devoted to discussing the German question and ways to ensure European security. The facts show that the Western three countries and the Soviet Union hold different attitudes on the German question. The Soviet delegation, understanding these differences, tried its best to accelerate the resolution of the German question in order to strengthen peace and security, and therefore put forward some pragmatic proposals. However, the Western delegations offered nothing other than the "Eden Plan," which advocated holding elections in Germany under the supervision of the occupying powers. In fact, the representatives of the Western countries have stubbornly adhered to their own views and systematically rejected all Soviet proposals.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov put forward a comprehensive plan to solve the German problem. The basic spirit of this plan is that a solution must be found that is sufficient to guarantee European peace and eliminate the danger of the revival of German militarism.

The Soviet delegation put forward a plan to strengthen cooperation between European countries, especially the three major continental powers of France, the Soviet Union, and Germany, to counter the plans of the Western countries.

The reporters then pointed out: The discussion of the "Eden Plan" at the Berlin Conference shows that this plan is consistent with the conspiracy of some Americans to turn Germany—mainly the western region—into the main base for aggression against Europe. On the one hand, the implementation of this plan would help anti-democratic militarists seize power when Germany is unified; on the other hand, it would be beneficial to pull the entire Germany into the European Six-Nation military bloc to deal with other European countries, thereby placing Germany's manpower and economic strength under the control of the Atlantic aggressive bloc.

Many Western European newspapers have had to admit that only the Soviet delegation put forward comprehensive, concrete, and pragmatic proposals last week in an effort to reach an agreement on outstanding issues.

The Soviet action plan proposed by Molotov on February 4 opened up a different path for Germany—the path of peace and progress.

The Soviet delegation believes that the decision on the German issue is mainly a matter for the German people themselves. Therefore, it suggested that the Parliament of the German Democratic Republic and the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany reach an agreement with the participation of democratic groups to form a temporary all-German government. In order to enable the temporary all-German government to complete its tasks, and to prevent foreign pressure during the all-German elections, the Soviet delegation suggested that all foreign troops withdraw from East and West Germany before the elections, leaving only a limited number of troops. Like rejecting all other Soviet proposals, the Western countries rejected this most important proposal.

The reporters summarized the results of the meeting and said: Therefore, the second week of the Berlin Conference not only shows that it is difficult to obtain a generally agreed solution on the German issue, but also shows that Western diplomats are openly unwilling to seek ways to overcome the difficulties.

The Soviet delegation adopted a different attitude. The Soviet delegation believes that the vitally important German question can and should be resolved on the basis of an agreement acceptable to both parties. But, obviously, an agreement can only be reached if all parties concerned have such a desire.

### “真理报”记者评四外长会议第二周的结果  美英法顽固拒绝苏联解决德国问题的建议

    “真理报”记者评四外长会议第二周的结果
    美英法顽固拒绝苏联解决德国问题的建议
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”在八日刊载了茹科夫和克拉米诺夫的电讯。这篇电讯评论四国外长会议第二周的结果，题目是：“柏林会议关于德国问题的讨论说明了什么”。
    记者写道：柏林会议的第二周专门讨论了德国问题和保障欧洲安全的办法。事实说明：西方三国和苏联在德国问题上抱着不同的态度。苏联代表团了解到这些分歧，竭力想加速德国问题的解决，以便加强和平与安全，因此提出了一些实事求是的建议。而西方代表团除提出一个主张在占领国家的监督下在德国举行选举的“艾登计划”外，什么也没有提出来。事实上西方国家的代表一直固执己见，有计划地拒绝苏联的一切建议。
    苏联外交部部长莫洛托夫提出了一个解决德国问题的全面计划。这个计划的基本精神是：必须找到一个足以保障欧洲和平和消除德国军国主义复活的危险的解决办法。
    苏联代表团提出了一个加强欧洲各国之间特别是法国、苏联、德国这三个大陆大国之间的合作的计划，来反对西方国家的计划。
    记者接着指出：柏林会议上关于“艾登计划”的讨论说明：这个计划和某些美国人士想把德国——主要是西部地区——变成侵略欧洲的主要基地的阴谋，是一致的。一方面，这个计划的实现会有助于反民主的军国主义分子在德国统一的时候夺取政权；另一方面，它有利于把整个德国拉进欧洲六国军事集团来对付其他欧洲国家，从而把德国的人力与经济力量放在大西洋侵略集团的支配之下。
    许多西欧报纸不得不承认，上星期只有苏联代表团提出了全面的、具体的、实事求是的建议，以求在悬而未决的问题上达成协议。
    莫洛托夫二月四日提出的苏联的行动计划，为德国开辟了一条不同的道路——和平与进步的道路。
    苏联代表团认为德国问题的决定主要是德国人民自己的事情，因此建议由德意志民主共和国议会和德意志联邦共和国议会在民主团体参加下达成协议，成立临时的全德政府。为了促使临时的全德政府完成其任务，为了防止外国在全德选举期间施行压力，苏联代表团建议所有外国军队在选举前撤出东德与西德，只留下有限数目的部队。西方国家像拒绝苏联其他所有建议一样，拒绝了这个最重要的建议。
    记者总结会议结果说：因此，柏林会议的第二个星期，不仅说明在德国问题上难于获得大家同意的解决办法，而且说明西方外交官公然不愿意寻求办法来克服困难。
    苏联代表团采取了不同的态度。苏联代表团相信，至关紧要的德国问题是能够而且应该在双方都能接受的协议的基础上来解决的。但是，显然，只有一切有关方面都有这样的愿望，协议才能达成。
