    U.S. "Time" Magazine Reveals Steps of U.S. Military Authorities' Involvement in Indochina War
    U.S. Ruling Group Wants to Send American Commander to Direct Aggressive War

    [Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd] U.S. "Time" magazine revealed that U.S. military authorities are attempting to appoint an American commander to replace France in directing the Indochina invasion war.

      "Time" magazine wrote on February 15th: "The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff have openly believed that the Indochina war will be lost due to France's poor tactics. From a purely military point of view, the Joint Chiefs of Staff hope to: (1) appoint an American commander; (2) support the commander with U.S. air power and a naval blockade of the Chinese coast; and (3) provide the commander with money and manpower to build an independent local army—much like the local armies Van Fleet built in Greece and South Korea."

      "Time" magazine also revealed some steps the Eisenhower administration is taking to further participate in the Indochina war, saying, "The 250 U.S. officers and airmen in Indochina will soon be reinforced by another 150. Their mission is to enable the damaged French Air Force to resume effective flight missions. The next action may be to blockade the coast of Indochina to prevent (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) from receiving reinforcements from the sea. This will require a task force of aircraft carriers to enter the South China Sea."

    According to "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, the U.S. Air Force "technicians" sent to Indochina are actually flight personnel. The magazine reported on February 19th, "Those 'technicians' sent to Indochina from the U.S. armed forces are often capable of both flying and maintaining military aircraft. It has been suggested that they could be called 'flying mechanics.'"

    [Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd] According to TASS, New York, February 21st: U.S. newspapers show that the U.S. ruling group is uneasy about the failures of the French occupation forces in Indochina and the rising movement within France to seek peace talks with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. According to reports, the U.S. ruling group is counting on expanding the Indochina war and direct U.S. intervention in this war.

    The "Christian Science Monitor" correspondent in Washington wrote: "Americans in Washington with direct knowledge of the situation on the Indochina front assert that in recent weeks, the French situation has not improved, but on the contrary, has deteriorated in terms of combat effectiveness." The correspondent reported that despite the occupying forces' superior armament, they cannot succeed because the residents resolutely oppose the occupying forces and support the Vietnamese People's Army.

    The correspondent said: "Washington authorities are uneasy about the general growth of neutralist tendencies in France and the rapidly strengthening French desire to negotiate a solution to the Indochina issue." Regarding the demands of French social groups for an immediate armistice agreement, the correspondent wrote: "But Washington semi-official sources raised the question: Is doing so in the interests of the United States? Will the U.S. government modify its policy toward Indochina at this time?" He did not specify what the so-called "modification" of the "Washington semi-official sources" meant. Washington had suggested sending a U.S. military delegation to train the French-commanded army. Regarding this matter, Associated Press correspondent in Washington, Scari, wrote: Obviously, this U.S. suggestion will be firmly opposed by the French government and the high-ranking leaders of the French army, and it is evident that "if France were to accept this U.S. suggestion, it would be entirely against its will." According to Scari, Democratic Senator Humphrey, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford and Acting Secretary of State Smith discussed in detail with the members of the committee the issue of sending a "training group" to Indochina at the secret meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 16th. "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously and firmly supported this proposal."

    美国“时代”杂志透露美军当局参与印度支那战争的步骤
    美国统治集团想派美国司令指挥侵略战争
    【新华社二十三日讯】美国“时代”杂志透露，美国军事当局企图任命一个美国司令官来代替法国指挥印度支那侵略战争。
      “时代”杂志在二月十五日写道：“美国参谋长联席会议已公开地认为由于法国战术的拙劣，印度支那战争将要输掉了。从严格的军事观点出发，参谋长联席会议希望：（一）任命一个美国司令官；（二）以美国空军力量和对中国海岸实行海军封锁的办法来支持该司令官；（三）以金钱和人力供给该司令官来建立一支独立的当地军队——大体上像范佛里特在希腊和大韩民国所建立的当地军队一样。”
      “时代”杂志并透露艾森豪威尔政府进一步参加印度支那战争的一些步骤说，“美国在印度支那的二百五十名军官和空军人员不久将获得另外一百五十人的增援。他们的任务是：使受损的法国空军能重新担任有效的飞行任务。下一个行动可能是封锁印度支那的海岸，以防止（越南民主共和国）从海上获得增援。这就需要以航空母舰组成的特遣舰队进入南中国海。”
    另据“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊透露，被派到印度支那去的美国空军“技术人员”，实际上是飞行人员。该刊二月十九日报道，“从美国武装部队中被派到印度支那去的那些‘技术人员’，往往既能驾驶军用飞机，又能保养飞机。有人建议说，他们可以被叫作‘飞行机械员’。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十一日讯：美国报纸表现出美国统治集团对于法国占领军在印度支那的失败与法国国内争取和越南民主共和国进行和谈的运动的高涨，感到不安。据报纸报道，美国统治集团指望扩大印度支那战争和美国直接干涉这个战争。
    “基督教科学箴言报”驻华盛顿记者写道：“华盛顿直接了解印度支那前线情况的美国人断言：最近几星期以来，法军情况不仅没有好转，相反的，从战斗力上来看是恶化了。”记者报道，尽管占领军在武装上占优势，可是他们不能获得成功，因为居民坚决反对占领军，支持越南人民军。
    这个记者说：“华盛顿当局由于法国普遍的中立倾向的增长和法国希望协商解决印度支那问题的愿望迅速加强而感到不安。”这个记者就法国社会团体要求立刻缔结停战协定一事写道：“但是华盛顿半官方人士提出了这样的问题：这样做是否符合美国的利益？美国政府在这个时候是否将修改对印度支那的政策？”他并没有说明“华盛顿半官方人士”的所谓“修改”是什么意思。华盛顿曾建议派遣一个美国军事代表团去训练法国指挥的军队，美联社驻华盛顿记者斯卡里就此事写道：显然，美国的这个建议将遭到法国政府和法国军队的高级领导人的坚决反对，而且显然看得出，“如果法国竟接受美国的这个建议，那也是完全非出自本意。”据斯卡里报道，民主党参议员、参议院外交委员会委员汉弗莱说，参谋长联席会议主席雷德福和代理国务卿史密斯在二月十六日参议院外交委员会召开的秘密会议上和该委员会的委员们详细地讨论了关于派遣“训练团”到印度支那的问题，“参议院外交委员会一致坚决赞成这种主张”。
