Jingjiang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative Members Write Letter
Reporting Determination to Run Agricultural Producers' Cooperative Well

Respectable Chairman Mao:

The first agricultural producers' cooperative in the Jingjiang flood diversion area has been established, and we are members of this agricultural producers' cooperative. After the completion of the great Jingjiang flood diversion project, we have forever freed ourselves from the painful days of "panic when the water comes" and "fleeing famine by breaching the dikes." We organized mutual aid teams, actively engaged in production, and achieved a bumper harvest last year. Take our cooperative member Wan Yongkai as an example. His harvest in the year before last totaled 1,569 jin of rice, but last year he harvested 4,869 jin, more than doubling the amount from the year before last. Our lives have greatly improved compared to the past.

Last winter, we studied the General Line and sold all of our surplus grain and oil crops (this is an economic crop area) to the state, and some of the money from the sales was invested in production, while some was deposited in the bank. After understanding the principle of moving towards socialism through mutual aid and cooperation, we increasingly felt the benefits of "organizing." Our vice-chairman Guan Hongxiang and cooperative members Luo Dehai, Yu Kexing, and Liu Rubo had a total of 51.3 mu of land among their four families. In the past, they felt they couldn't cultivate it all, but since organizing a mutual aid team the year before last, they felt they didn't have enough land to cultivate, and last year they expanded the cultivated area by 8 mu, and cultivated it better than others. Therefore, thirty households voluntarily organized an agricultural producers' cooperative. The whole cooperative has 119 people and 407 mu of land. In order to commemorate the great Jingjiang flood diversion project you directed, we named the cooperative "Jingjiang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative."

All of our cooperative members are determined to work together to run the agricultural producers' cooperative well, and to continuously consolidate, improve, and expand it. We will also pay attention to uniting and helping other farmers, and leading everyone together on the bright road of socialism.

We resolutely respond to your call to strive to produce more grain, increase the unit area yield of oil crops (soybeans, sesame, etc.) and cotton, and expand the cultivated area by 20 mu. The cooperative's total agricultural income this year is planned to be equivalent to 260,000 jin of rice, and the total output is expected to increase by 60% compared to last year. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, we have already established specific production plans for cultivation, fertilization, etc., and decided to select improved varieties for all crops, do a good job in water conservancy before production, and engage in sideline production such as fishing, digging lotus roots, and collecting firewood in a planned way without hindering agricultural production.

This year, we will also sell all of our surplus grain, oil crops, cotton, etc., to the state to support national construction and develop heavy industry. We see that a large dam like the Jingjiang flood diversion requires so much steel and machinery. We saw tractors on the farm, which plow the land quickly and well. We will produce more grain to support the workers, and the workers will produce more machinery to help the farmers produce. Our country will become more prosperous and strong every day, and in the future, we will live a happier and more fulfilling life like the farmers in the Soviet Union.

### 荆江农业生产合作社社员写信  向毛主席报告决心办好农业生产合作社

    荆江农业生产合作社社员写信
    向毛主席报告决心办好农业生产合作社敬爱的毛主席：
    荆江分洪区内第一个农业生产合作社已经成立了，我们就是这个农业生产合作社的社员。伟大的荆江分洪工程完成后，我们永远摆脱了“水来心慌”、“破堤逃荒”的痛苦日子，组织了互助组，积极生产，去年取得了丰收。就拿我们的社员万永楷来说，前年收成共折稻谷一千五百六十九斤，去年就收了四千八百六十九斤，比前年增加了二倍多。我们的生活比过去大大改善了。
    去年冬天，我们学习了总路线，把全部余粮和油料作物（我们这里是经济作物区）等卖给了国家，卖的钱有的投入了生产，有的存入了银行。懂得了通过互助合作走向社会主义的道理后，愈加感到“组织起来”的好处。我们的副社长关宏香、社员罗德海、余克兴、刘如伯四家共有五十一亩三分田，过去感到种不了，从前年冬天组织互助组后就感到田不够种，去年扩大了耕地面积八亩，还比别人种的好。因此，我们三十户自愿组织了农业生产合作社。全社共一百十九人，四百零七亩田地。为了纪念您指示建设的伟大的荆江分洪，我们就把社叫做“荆江农业生产合作社”。
    我们全体社员决心共同努力，把农业生产合作社办好，不断地巩固、提高和扩大；并且还要注意团结、帮助其他农民，带动大家一同走社会主义的光明大道。
    我们坚决响应您的号召，争取多打粮食，提高油料作物（黄豆、芝麻等）和棉花的单位面积产量，并扩大耕地面积二十亩。全社今年农业收入计划要折合稻谷二十六万斤，总产量要比去年提高百分之六十。为了保证这个计划的实现，我们已经订立了耕作、施肥等的具体生产计划，并决定各种作物均选用良种，在生产前搞好水利工作，在不妨碍农业生产的原则下有计划地搞捞鱼、挖藕、打柴等副业生产。
    我们今年还要把全部余粮和油料作物、棉花等卖给国家，支援国家建设，发展重工业。我们看到荆江分洪这样的大闸，要用多少钢铁和机器。我们在农场看到了拖拉机，耕田又快又好。我们多打粮食支援工人，工人多制造机器帮助农民生产，我们国家就会一天天繁荣富强，我们将来就会像苏联农民一样过着更幸福美满的生活。
          荆江农业生产合作社全体社员
