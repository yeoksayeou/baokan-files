Andong City Yonghua Food Factory
Successfully Trials Winemaking Using Corn Cobs

    Liang Fengshan, Deputy Director of the Andong City Yonghua Food Factory, has successfully trialed winemaking using corn cobs. In November of last year, Liang Fengshan began researching winemaking using corn cobs (the corn stalks after threshing). After fully drying the corn cobs, they were ground into powder and a small-scale experiment was conducted according to the "burning bran" method. The results showed that the "crude wine" yield reached 10.4%, with the quality being the same as wine made from sorghum bran. According to the laboratory results, it was determined that corn cobs contain 37.13% starch, and the future wine yield can be increased to over 25%.

    安东市永华食品厂
    利用玉米骨酿酒试酿成功
    安东市永华食品厂副厂长梁凤山，用玉米骨酿酒试酿成功。去年十一月份，梁凤山就着手研究用玉米骨子（脱粒后的玉米棒）酿酒。将玉米骨经过充分干燥以后，磨成粉末，按照“烧糠”的操作法进行小型试验，结果“?酒”出酒率达到百分之十点四，质量和用高粱糠酿成的酒相同。根据化验结果，判定：玉米骨含有淀粉百分之三十七点一三，将来出酒率可以提高到百分之二十五以上。
