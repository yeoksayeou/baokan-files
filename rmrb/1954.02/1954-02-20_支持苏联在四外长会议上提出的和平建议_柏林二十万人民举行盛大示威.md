    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 19th: According to TASS, Berlin, February 18th, two hundred thousand working people in the democratic sector of Berlin held a grand demonstration on February 18th, expressing their warm support for the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and demonstrating the unwavering will of German patriots to strive for the establishment of a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany.
    Demonstrators gathered on Unter den Linden, holding high the flags of the German Democratic Republic and banners with slogans demanding a peace treaty with a unified, democratic Germany, the immediate withdrawal of occupying forces, the abolition of the Bonn and Paris military treaties, and the establishment of a European collective security system.
    A mass meeting was held in front of the Humboldt University on Unter den Linden. The presidium of the meeting included Johannes Dieckmann, Chairman of the People's Chamber, government leaders headed by Otto Grotewohl, Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Friedrich Ebert, Mayor of Greater Berlin, and representatives of various democratic parties and mass organizations.
    Speeches were delivered by Herbert Warnke, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation, Otto Nuschke, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Union, and Hermann Kastner, General Secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party. They emphasized that the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference pointed the way to easing international tensions, peacefully resolving the German question, and guaranteeing European security. They condemned the attitude of the Western countries' representatives in rejecting the constructive proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, which fully conformed to the national interests of the German people, and instead advocating the militarization of West Germany and preparations for war.
    Warnke called on the German people to break the provocative "silent boycott" launched by the West German authorities and right-wing trade union leaders against the Soviet proposals, resolutely defend their national interests, and support the proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Conference. In his speech, Nuschke emphasized that the plan put forward by British Foreign Secretary Eden at the Berlin Foreign Ministers' Conference meant war, while Molotov's proposal meant peace; Eden's plan deepened the division of Germany, while Molotov's proposal pointed the way towards the establishment of a unified, democratic, independent, and peace-loving Germany. After the meeting, the demonstrators marched past the Soviet Embassy on Unter den Linden, shouting: "Long live the great Soviet Union!" "Long live German-Soviet friendship!"

    支持苏联在四外长会议上提出的和平建议
    柏林二十万人民举行盛大示威
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社柏林十八日讯：二月十八日，柏林二十万劳动人民在柏林民主区举行了盛大的示威，表示热烈拥护苏联代表团在四国外长会议上所提出的建议，并表示德国爱国者决心不屈不挠地为争取建立一个统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国而斗争的意志。
    示威者在菩提树下街集会，高举着德意志民主共和国的国旗和写着标语的横旗，他们要求与统一、民主的德国缔结和约，要求立刻撤退占领军，要求废除波恩和巴黎军事条约，建立欧洲集体安全体系等。
    在菩提树下街胡包特大学门前，举行了一个群众大会。大会主席团包括人民议院主席约·狄克曼、以奥·格罗提渥为首的政府首长，德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记瓦·乌布利希，大柏林市长弗·艾柏特及各民主党派和群众组织的代表。
    在会上演说的有：自由德国工会联合会常务委员会主席赫·瓦恩克，德意志民主共和国副总理、基督教民主联盟主席奥·努舍克和自由民主党总书记赫·泰什纳。他们强调指出：苏联代表团在柏林四国外长会议上提出的建议，指出了通向缓和国际紧张局势、和平解决德国问题及保证欧洲安全的道路。他们谴责西方国家代表拒绝苏联所提出的完全符合于德国人民民族利益的建设性建议，而主张使西德军国主义化和进行战争准备的态度。
    瓦恩克号召德国人民打破西德当局和右翼工会领袖对苏联建议所发动的挑衅性的“沉默抵制”，坚决地保卫他们的民族利益，支持苏联代表团在柏林会议上提出的建议。努舍克在发言中强调指出：英国外交大臣艾登在柏林外长会议上所提出的计划意味着战争，而莫洛托夫的建议意味着和平；艾登计划加深了德国的分裂，而莫洛托夫的建议指出了走向建立一个统一、民主、独立和爱好和平的德国的道路。在大会以后，示威者走过菩提树下街的苏联大使馆，他们高呼：“伟大的苏联万岁”！“德苏友谊万岁”！
