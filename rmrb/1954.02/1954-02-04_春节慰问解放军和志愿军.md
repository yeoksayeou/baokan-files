Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Liu Zhijian, Director of the Propaganda Department of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission, delivered a Spring Festival message, extending greetings to the People's Liberation Army border defense, coastal defense, and air defense forces, and all comrades in the army. The speech has been broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The full text is as follows: Heroes guarding the border, coast, and air defenses of the motherland! Dear comrades of the entire army!

    Today, as our great motherland enters the second year of the first Five-Year Plan, we celebrate the Spring Festival with even greater excitement and joy than in previous years. This is because in 1953, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country achieved the Korean Armistice and won a great victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea; successfully implemented the national construction plan, further developing our national economy on the basis of recovery, with the proportion of the socialist economy continuing to grow, national prices remaining stable, people's lives improving, the people's level of awareness further enhanced, and the people's democratic dictatorship further consolidated. Comrades, the people of the whole country know that our country's major achievements and the people's good life today are inseparable from your day and night presence on the most remote border and coastal defense lines, ready to strike at any invading enemy, conscientiously safeguarding the smooth progress of the country's economic construction, and protecting the beautiful life of the people. As all comrades celebrate the Spring Festival, please allow me, with a sense of respect, in the name of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government People's Revolutionary Military Commission, to extend my heartfelt greetings and respects to you – the heroes guarding the border, coast, and air defenses of the motherland, and to all dear comrades of the army!
    With the active support and encouragement of the people of the whole country, our entire army, together with the people of the whole country, has also achieved great success in various tasks. Through formal training, the military, political, and cultural levels of the troops have greatly improved; especially after recently studying the Party's general line for the transition period, the socialist consciousness of the entire army has been enhanced. The entire army unanimously and warmly supports the Party's general line for the transition period. Building China into a great socialist country is the ideal that our army has been bravely striving for day and night for decades. The education on the general line has greatly enhanced the patriotic enthusiasm of the entire army. Many comrades have written letters to mobilize their families and relatives to sell surplus grain to the state, and to encourage their families to take the path of mutual aid and cooperation. Comrades from one company of a certain unit of the public security forces stationed in Beijing alone wrote more than 400 such letters. The comrades of the entire army also actively responded to the government's call, practiced thrift and economy, and actively purchased the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. Many units have overfulfilled their planned quotas. The organs directly under the Military Commission and the troops stationed in Beijing purchased nearly five times the planned amount, and the comrades of the 3rd Company of a certain unit guarding the front line of coastal defense in East China have over-purchased twelve times the planned amount. Education on the general line has further strengthened the fighting will of the troops. Many comrades who are on guard duty are working harder to protect the border, coast, and air defenses, to protect the country's factories and mines, and to protect the safety of economic construction. These achievements have also supported the country's socialist construction.
    Comrades, although we have made many achievements in our work, we cannot relax in the slightest. Because when our country is carrying out socialist construction, imperialism and the hidden remnants of domestic counter-revolutionaries will try every means to conspire and sabotage, and the tasks before us are even more arduous and heavy. First of all, we must continue to deepen the study of the general line, resolutely implement the general line, implement the various policies and laws of the government, cherish the people, universally carry out the movement to support the government and cherish the people, and actively support and participate in the country's socialist construction. Strengthen the military training of the regular army, improve our military quality, and build our army into a strong, modernized revolutionary army, to fight for the defense of the socialist construction of the motherland, and the defense of peace in the Far East and the world.
    I wish the comrades success in their work and good health!

    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, delivered a Spring Festival message extending greetings to all commanders and fighters of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers. The speech has been broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station on February 2nd. The full text is as follows: Commander Peng Dehuai, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers:

    As the 1954 Spring Festival approaches, I would like to extend my sincere greetings to you on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    This year's Spring Festival comes as the people of our country have achieved great successes and brilliant victories in all aspects. The common struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against the American aggressors has achieved a great victory, and the Korean Armistice has been realized. This is a great victory for the cause of peace in the Far East, and it has great significance and far-reaching influence on the whole world. The realization of the Korean Armistice proves that our country has become a powerful stabilizing factor in the Asian and Pacific region.

    In terms of domestic construction, under the guidance of the general line for the transition period of gradually realizing socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, the people of our country have smoothly completed the task of the first year of the first Five-Year Plan. Now the people of the whole country are jubilantly striving to fulfill the task of the second year of the Five-Year Plan. The country's economic construction can achieve such brilliant achievements today, which is inseparable from the great victory you and the Korean People's Army have achieved against the U.S. imperialist aggression, the deadly enemy of our people. On this Spring Festival, the people of the whole country deeply miss you and thank you.

    Comrades, but we are closely watching that after the Korean Armistice, the U.S. government is still implementing a policy of preventing the easing of international tensions. The U.S. government is doing everything possible to obstruct the convening of the political conference, seriously undermining the implementation of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, and has recently openly colluded with the Syngman Rhee group and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to rob the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have failed to exercise their legitimate right of repatriation. All these indicate that the U.S. government is attempting to maintain and increase the instability of the Korean Armistice, and to maintain and increase international tensions.

    Under such circumstances, in order to defend the construction of the motherland and to defend world peace, the people of our country must adhere to the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and continue to strive for the convening of the political conference and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, all the people of our country will surely follow the general line of the country during the transition period, actively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to complete and over fulfill the national plan for 1954 and the current national acquisition of grain, purchase of construction bonds and other tasks. At the same time, the people of the whole country must wholeheartedly support you and the Korean military and civilians, continue to deepen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and continue to make unremitting efforts to ensure the thorough realization of the Korean Armistice and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

    Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    春节慰问解放军和志愿军
   【新华社三日讯】中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部宣传部部长刘志坚发表春节慰问讲话，慰问人民解放军边防、海防、空防部队和全军同志。讲话已经中央人民广播电台广播。全文如下：守卫着祖国边防、海防、空防的英雄们！亲爱的全军同志们！
    今天，是我们伟大祖国进入第一个五年计划建设第二年的春节，我们今年庆贺春节，比往年更加兴奋，更加愉快。因为在一九五三年，全国人民在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，争取了朝鲜停战，取得了抗美援朝战争的伟大胜利；顺利地执行了国家建设的计划，使我国国民经济在恢复的基础上有了进一步的发展，社会主义经济的比重继续增长，全国物价稳定，人民生活改善，人民觉悟程度进一步提高，人民民主专政更加巩固。同志们，全国人民都知道我们国家所以能有这样重大的成就，人民所以能够有今天的好生活，这与你们日日夜夜在最辽远的边防、海防线上，随时准备打击敢予进犯的敌人，兢兢业业地保卫着祖国经济建设的顺利进行，保卫祖国人民的美好生活是分不开的。当全体同志们欢度春节的时候，请让我怀着崇敬的心情，以中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部的名义，向你们——守卫在祖国边防、海防、空防的英雄们、向亲爱的全军同志们致亲切的慰问和敬礼！
    我们全军在全国人民积极支援与鼓舞下，和全国人民一道，在各项工作中也获得了很大的成绩。经过正规训练，部队的军事、政治和文化水平大大地提高了一步；特别是在最近学习了党在过渡时期的总路线以后，全军的社会主义觉悟得到了提高。全军上下都一致热烈拥护党在过渡时期的总路线。把中国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，这是我军数十年英勇奋斗日夜渴望的理想。总路线的教育大大提高了全军的爱国热忱。许多同志都纷纷写信动员家属、亲戚把余粮卖给国家，动员家属走互助合作的道路，仅驻京公安部队某部一个连的同志们就写了四百多封这样的信。全军同志并积极响应政府的号召，厉行节约，积极认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债，许多单位都超额完成了预定数字，军委直属机关和驻京各部队认购了将近预定数字的五倍，守卫在华东海防前线的某部第三连的同志们已超额认购了预定数字的十二倍。总路线教育，更加加强了部队的战斗意志。许多担负警备任务的同志，对于保卫边防、海防、空防，保卫国家的工厂矿山，保卫经济建设的安全更加努力。我们这些成绩，也就支援了国家的社会主义建设。
    同志们，虽然我们在工作中有了许多成绩，但是我们丝毫不能松懈。因为我们国家在进行社会主义建设的时候，帝国主义和潜藏的国内反革命残余是要千方百计地来阴谋破坏的，摆在我们面前的任务更加艰巨和繁重。我们首先必须继续深入总路线的学习，坚决执行总路线，执行政府的各项政策法令、爱护人民，普遍开展拥政爱民运动，积极支援和参加国家的社会主义建设。加强正规军的军事训练，提高我们的军事素养，把我军建设成一支强大的现代化革命军队，为保卫祖国的社会主义建设、保卫远东与世界和平而奋斗。
    祝同志们工作胜利，身体健康！
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民抗美援朝总会主席郭沫若发表春节慰问讲话，慰问英雄的中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员。讲话已经中央人民广播电台在二月二日广播。全文如下：彭德怀司令员、中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    一九五四年的春节来临了，我谨代表中国人民抗美援朝总会向你们致以热诚的敬礼。
    今年的春节，是在我国人民各方面都得到巨大成就和辉煌胜利的情况下到来的。朝中两国人民反对美国侵略者的共同斗争已经获得伟大胜利，朝鲜停战已经实现。这是和平事业在远东的伟大胜利，它对整个世界都有重大意义和深远影响。朝鲜停战的实现证明了我国已成为亚洲和太平洋区域强大的稳定因素。
    在国内建设方面，我国人民在逐步实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的过渡时期总路线的指引之下，已经顺利地完成了第一个五年计划的第一个年度的任务。现在全国人民正欢欣鼓舞地为执行五年计划的第二年的任务而努力奋斗。祖国的经济建设能够取得今天这样光辉的成就，是和你们与朝鲜人民军一道，对于我国人民的死敌美帝国主义侵略所取得的伟大胜利分不开的。当此春节，全国人民深深地怀念着你们，感谢着你们。
    同志们，但我们是严密地注意到的，朝鲜停战后，美国政府依旧在执行着阻止国际紧张局势缓和的政策。美国政府正千方百计地阻挠政治会议的召开，严重地破坏关于遣返战俘的协议的实施，最近并公然勾结李承晚集团和蒋介石匪帮，实行劫夺未能行使其正当遣返权利的朝中被俘人员。这些都表明美国政府企图保持和增加朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，保持和增加国际间的紧张局势。
    在这种情况下，为了保卫祖国建设和保卫世界和平，我国人民必须坚持抗美援朝的斗争，并继续努力争取政治会议的召开和朝鲜问题的和平解决。在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，我们全国人民一定遵循国家过渡时期的总路线，积极地开展增产节约运动，努力完成和超额完成一九五四年的国家计划以及当前国家收购粮食、认购建设公债等各项工作。同时，全国人民一定全心全意支援你们和朝鲜军民，继续深入地开展抗美援朝运动，为确保朝鲜停战的彻底实现、朝鲜问题和平解决，继续作不懈的奋斗。
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
