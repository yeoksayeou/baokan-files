    Produce More High-Quality and Low-Priced Light Industrial Products to Meet the Needs of the Country and the People

    Over the past four years, China's light industry has achieved remarkable progress in its recovery and development. Various major products, such as paper, salt, sugar, cigarettes, tires, rubber shoes, and medicines, had already exceeded their highest historical output by 1952. The total output value and output of major products of state-owned light industry in 1953 increased by an average of more than 150% compared to 1950. The growth rate of products such as automobile tires, glucose, and sulfonamide drugs was more than tenfold. At the same time, many new products and varieties have emerged, and the quality of products has generally improved compared to the past. Local state-owned light industry and private light industry have also developed significantly. Therefore, the gradually increasing needs of urban and rural people for industrial consumer goods have been basically met in recent years.

    However, due to historical reasons, China's light industry has several weaknesses, mainly manifested as: (1) production is out of sync with demand. Some equipment is excessively surplus (such as cigarettes, matches, oil extraction, rubber shoes, etc.), while some equipment is lacking and insufficient (such as papermaking, sugar refining, rubber tires, and pharmaceuticals). Moreover, the equipment is relatively outdated, scattered, and not interconnected. (2) It does not coordinate with the development of certain heavy industries and agriculture and forestry. Some major raw materials must rely on imports. (3) The regional distribution is unreasonable, with most industries concentrated in Shanghai and coastal cities, and many factories are far from raw material producing areas and sales markets. Since the national liberation, the Ministry of Light Industry and local authorities have carried out preliminary adjustments and transformations of major light industries, such as balancing and adding some production equipment, gradually achieving self-sufficiency in some raw materials, and controlling the production of important products, incorporating them into the national planning track, etc., partially overcoming the above-mentioned weaknesses. However, the imbalance between production and sales and the dependence on raw materials left over by history have not been completely eliminated. In the national light industry, capitalist enterprises still account for a large proportion, and handicraft production still accounts for a large proportion of some light industrial products (such as native sugar, native paper, salt, oil extraction, and leather, etc.). In addition, the light industry sector lacks in-depth investigation and research on the social demand for various products and potential production capacity and cannot grasp it comprehensively. Therefore, disconnections often easily occur between various links of supply, production, and sales in the light industry, causing temporary overstocking of certain products, temporary stock-outs, and abnormal phenomena such as factories sometimes operating at insufficient capacity and sometimes rushing into production. Equipment capacity is often not fully utilized, while the needs of the people cannot be met appropriately.

    In terms of production management of light industrial enterprises, except for a few state-owned factories with more advanced management levels, which have relatively comprehensive work plans and implement relatively strict technical management, most state-owned factories are still in the stage of production reform and trial implementation of planned management and technical management. Due to the lack of planning in organizing production in many enterprises, the phenomenon of uneven production and being loose at the beginning and tight at the end is still widespread. There are also many shortcomings in product quality. Some enterprises have the idea of emphasizing quantity over quality and neglect technical management, producing a considerable number of useless waste products and substandard products in the first half of last year, which not only wasted the wealth of the country and the labor of workers but also caused losses to the vast number of consumers. Some even affect the supply of military needs, and the consequences are very serious.

    In order to promote the further normal development of light industry to meet the needs of the country and the people, the light industry sector should focus on the following three tasks in the future:

    First, find out the overall situation and strengthen planning. The development of light industry must be based on the balance of supply, production, and sales. It is necessary to clearly recognize that the purpose of developing production is to ensure needs. Therefore, it is necessary to contact the development of the national economy and conduct in-depth investigations and research on the current demand and increased production trends of society for various products and their varieties. The development of production should be adapted to this, and the supply of raw materials and resources and the possibility of expanding production should also be considered. Distinguish the urgency of various needs and gradually meet them step by step and with emphasis. Because light industry has many product varieties, wide distribution, complex economic types, and large potential capacity, in order to fully utilize the potential capacity of existing equipment, it is necessary to investigate the basic situation of state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private, and private industries, and even handicrafts, conduct comprehensive analysis and research, and consider them comprehensively. On the one hand, it is necessary to develop state-owned and local state-owned enterprises, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to consider utilizing the existing production capacity of private light industry and the possibility of further improving productivity after carrying out state capitalist transformation on them. For some individual handicrafts that cannot be replaced by machine industry in the short term, the cooperation department should also gradually incorporate them into the national planning track from the aspects of organizing mutual assistance and cooperation, improving and upgrading technology. Only in the process of in-depth understanding of the overall supply, production, and sales situation and its development prospects can a relatively correct and practical development production policy be formulated for the main products of light industry; can equipment be reasonably adjusted according to the characteristics of each industry and factory, and production can be organized in a planned way; and can the guiding role of national planning for light industrial production and construction be strengthened, and the contradictions between supply, production, and sales disconnection, equipment imbalance, and the inability to fully utilize production capacity can be gradually overcome.

    Second, improve production management. At present, the development of management in light industrial enterprises is uneven. Therefore, the specific steps and priorities for improving production management should vary depending on the actual situation of each region and enterprise. Generally speaking, enterprises with a weak work foundation that have not yet carried out or have just started production reform should still start with production reform, carry out inventory checks and capital verification, establish a responsibility system, improve labor organization, and other work, and implement planned management on the basis of establishing original records and determining quotas. Enterprises that have initially established a responsibility system, quota management, and have some basis for planning and statistics work should immediately further strengthen planning management, formulate workshop operation plans, and carry out rhythmic and balanced production organized according to indicator charts step by step. Enterprises that already have some basis for planning management should consolidate and improve the balance of production, and further strengthen technical management, and gradually establish and improve the economic accounting system. Continuously reducing product costs is an important means to lower the prices of consumer goods and accumulate funds for the country. At present, state-owned light industry production mainly needs to strive to reduce costs by reducing waste, saving raw materials, adopting substitutes, improving labor organization, and increasing labor productivity. The work of strengthening equipment maintenance, paying attention to safe production, rectifying labor discipline, and further strengthening financial management should be effectively resolved in combination with the above-mentioned central work according to the actual situation.

    Third, improve technology and improve product quality. Over the past year, the quality of products of state-owned enterprises has been greatly improved through vigorous improvement, but it has not been completely stabilized. The quality of some products still has many shortcomings, which have not been completely resolved technically and managerially. Therefore, consolidating and improving quality, strengthening technical leadership, and continuing to repeatedly educate leading cadres and all employees of enterprises on improving quality are still important tasks that the light industry sector must pay serious attention to in the future. It must be understood that improving quality is being responsible to the people and serving consumers. It is necessary to create consumer goods with high use value to contribute to the people in order to meet the requirements of the general line. Therefore, one cannot be complacent and relax just because the quality has improved slightly but must continue to improve constantly and constantly fight against the idea of emphasizing quantity over quality. To improve quality, it is necessary to strengthen technical management. The main links of technical management are to formulate technical standards (especially the quality standards and formula management of finished products, semi-finished products, and raw materials), revise and implement operating procedures, and strengthen the inspection system from raw materials to finished products, and rationally use equipment, strengthen clean management system, establish and improve the quality responsibility system to strictly control the quality of each link in the production process. In light industry, grasping the key to production, improving technology, adopting technical and organizational measures, and promoting advanced experience are the main methods to break through weak links in equipment and tap potential capacity; it is also an important source of saving raw materials and reducing costs. This requires leaders at all levels of the ministry and bureau to grasp technical leadership and effectively solve key technical problems in each factory. In enterprises, enterprise leaders must be good at mobilizing all employees, uniting technical personnel to study hard, delve into technology, summarize and promote advanced experience, and plan to improve the technical level of existing technical personnel and skilled workers. Only on the basis of continuous improvement of technology can productivity continue to advance and develop.

    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the country needs to concentrate its efforts on the construction of heavy industry, and it is impossible to invest too much in the capital construction of new light industry enterprises. The development of light industry should be studied and decided according to the country's financial resources and the needs of the people. At present, state-owned and local state-owned light industries should focus on existing enterprises, give full play to their potential capacity through equipment adjustment and balance, expansion and reconstruction, and planned addition of new product varieties to supply the market. For the construction of new factories, the production capacity of state-owned enterprises, local state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, private enterprises, and handicrafts should be fully understood, comprehensively considered, and carefully carried out with emphasis according to needs and possibilities. It is necessary to overcome the idea of being greedy for more and advancing blindly, liking the new and being big in capital construction work. From the overall perspective of the national economy, the economic necessity and technical feasibility of each capital construction project should be carefully and prudently studied. New factories should correctly formulate the design task book for the enterprise, and the expansion and reconstruction of old factories should formulate the overall design of the enterprise. Act in accordance with the capital construction procedures to overcome the mistakes caused by subjectivism, blindness, and non-compliance with the capital construction procedures in the past. Generally speaking, the capital construction of light industry is easier than that of heavy industry, so the construction time should be seized, and it should be completed and put into production quickly so that the country's funds will not be accumulated in unfinished construction projects for a long time. At the same time, special attention should be paid to the effect of capital construction, which can be quickly reflected in the increase in production or the reduction in costs. In the future, the light industry sector should pay special attention to those expansion, reconstruction projects, and technical and organizational measures that require less investment, have greater benefits, have rapid turnover, and can supply social needs in a timely manner.

    Private enterprises account for a considerable proportion of the national light industry, which is a force that cannot be ignored in the transitional period of the country. It is necessary to give full play to its enthusiasm, prevent its blindness, and gradually incorporate it into the track of the national economic plan through various forms of state capitalism. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out joint state-private ownership step by step according to needs and willingness to change its production relations, improve its operation and management, and give play to its production potential.

    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, the light industry sector must complete the arduous and glorious task of developing production, ensuring needs, and accumulating construction funds for the country under the conditions of less state investment and difficulties in raw material supply. Comrades working in the light industry sector must work hard to study their business, overcome the shortcomings and difficulties in their work; with the active cooperation and support of other economic sectors, find out the overall situation, closely combine supply, production, and sales, organize production in a planned way, improve management, improve technology, mobilize the creativity and enthusiasm of all employees, increase production, practice thrift, and strive to manufacture more high-quality and low-priced light industrial products to meet the needs of the people's lives!

    生产更多的物美价廉的轻工业品满足国家和人民的需要
    过去四年中，我国轻工业的恢复和发展，已获得显著的成绩。各种主要产品如：纸张、食盐、食糖、卷烟、轮胎、胶鞋、药品等，在一九五二年即已超过历史上的最高产量。国营轻工业一九五三年的生产总值和主要产品的产量，比一九五○年平均约增长了一倍半以上，其中如汽车轮胎、葡萄糖、磺胺类药品等产品的增长速度则在十几倍以上。同时并出现了许多新的产品和新的品种，产品质量一般亦较过去有所改进。地方国营轻工业和私营轻工业也有很大的发展。因此几年来城乡人民逐步增长的对工业消费品的需要，基本上得到了满足。
    但是由于历史的原因，我国轻工业具有若干弱点，主要表现为：（一）生产与需要脱节，有些设备过剩很多（如卷烟、火柴、榨油、胶鞋等），有些设备则缺乏和不足（如造纸、制糖、橡胶轮胎、制药等），且设备比较陈旧，零星分散，互不衔接。（二）与某些重工业及农林业的发展不相配合，若干主要原材料须依靠进口。（三）地区分布不合理，多数集中在上海和沿海城市，不少工厂远离原料产区及销售市场。全国解放以后，轻工业部及各地主管部门对主要轻工业进行了初步的调整改造，如平衡和增添了若干生产设备，若干原料逐步做到自给，将重要产品的生产加以控制，纳入国家计划轨道等，部分地克服了上述弱点。但历史所遗留下来的轻工业的产销不平衡性与原材料的依赖性，则尚未彻底消除。在全国轻工业中，资本主义企业尚占着很大的比重，有些轻工业产品手工业生产还占着很大的比重（如土糖、土纸、食盐、榨油、皮革等）。加以轻工业部门对各种产品的社会需要量及潜在的生产能力缺乏深入的调查研究，不能全面掌握。因此轻工业的供产销各环节间就经常容易发生脱节，造成某些产品一时积压，一时脱销，工厂有时开工不足，有时突击生产的不正常现象。设备能力往往不能充分利用，同时，人民的需要却又不能很恰当地满足。
    在轻工业企业的生产管理方面，除少数国营工厂管理水平较为先进，已有较全面的作业计划，实施较严格的技术管理外，多数国营工厂还是处在生产改革和试行计划管理与技术管理的阶段。由于不少企业对组织生产缺乏计划性，生产不均衡和前松后紧的现象还是普遍存在。产品质量上亦存在着许多的缺点，有些企业存在着重量不重质的思想，忽视技术管理，在去年上半年生产了相当数量的没有使用价值的废品次品，不仅浪费了国家财富和工人的劳动力，而且造成广大消费者的损失，有些甚至影响军需任务的供应，其后果是很严重的。
    为了使轻工业得到进一步的正常发展，以满足国家和人民的需要，今后轻工业部门应着重做好下列三项工作：
    第一、摸清全面情况，加强计划性。轻工业的发展必须建立在供产销平衡的基础上，要明确认识到发展生产的目的，是为了保证需要。因此就须联系国民经济的发展，深入调查研究社会对各种产品及其品种的现在需要量和增产趋势。使生产的发展能与之相适应，同时也要考虑到原料、资源供应的情况及扩大生产的可能性，区别各种需要的轻重缓急，有步骤有重点地逐步满足。由于轻工业的产品品种多，分布广，经济类型复杂，潜在能力较大，为了充分利用现有设备的潜在能力，就必须对国营、地方国营、公私合营及私营工业以至手工业的基本情况加以调查，进行全面的分析研究，通盘考虑。一方面要发展国营与地方国营企业，同时也要考虑利用私营轻工业现有的生产能力，及对它们进行国家资本主义改造后生产力进一步提高的可能性。对若干短期内还不可能以机器工业代替的个体手工业，也应由合作部门从组织互助合作，改进提高技术等方面使其逐步纳入国家计划轨道。只有在对全面供产销情况及其发展远景深入了解的过程中，对轻工业的主要产品才能制订出比较正确和切合实际的发展生产的方针；才能根据各个行业及工厂的特点，合理地调整设备，有计划地组织生产；并加强国家计划对轻工业生产和建设的指导性，逐步克服供产销脱节、设备不平衡、生产能力无法充分利用的矛盾。
    第二、改进生产管理工作。目前轻工业企业管理工作水平的发展是不平衡的。因此，改进生产管理工作的具体步骤和重点，应视各地区各企业的实际情况而有所不同。一般地说，凡是工作基础薄弱，尚未进行或刚开始进行生产改革的企业，仍应从生产改革做起，进行清产核资，建立责任制，改善劳动组织等工作，并在建立原始记录，查定定额的基础上，实行计划管理。凡是初步建立了责任制度，定额管理，计划统计工作已有些基础的企业，应即进一步加强计划管理，制定车间的作业计划，有步骤地进行按指示图表组织有节奏的均衡生产。凡是计划管理已有些基础的企业，则应巩固与提高生产的均衡性，并进一步加强技术管理，逐步建立与健全经济核算制。不断地降低产品成本，是降低消费品价格及为国家积累资金的重要手段，目前国营轻工业生产主要须从减少浪费，节约原材料，采用代替品，改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率等方面来努力降低成本。关于加强设备的检修，注意安全生产，整顿劳动纪律及进一步加强财务管理等工作，则应根据实际情况，结合着上列中心工作有效地予以解决。
    第三、提高技术，改进产品质量。一年来国营企业的产品质量，经大力改进，已有了相当的提高，但还没有完全稳定下来。部分产品的质量仍存在着不少缺点，没有从技术上及管理上予以彻底解决。因此巩固与提高质量，加强技术领导，继续在企业领导干部及全体职工中反复进行提高质量的教育，这是轻工业部门今后仍须严重注意的工作。必须了解：提高质量就是对人民负责，就是为消费者服务，必须创造使用价值高的消费品贡献给人民，才合乎总路线的要求。因此不能因为质量稍有改进即自满松懈，而要继续不断地提高，经常与重量不重质的思想进行斗争。要提高质量，必须加强技术管理，技术管理的主要环节，则是制订技术标准（特别是成品、半成品、原材料的质量标准与配方管理）修订贯彻操作规程及加强从原材料到成品的检验制度，并合理使用设备，加强清洁管理制度，建立和健全质量的责任制，以严密控制生产过程中各个环节的质量。在轻工业中，抓住生产关键，改进技术，采取技术组织措施，推广先进经验是突破设备薄弱环节，挖掘潜在能力的主要方法；也是节约原材料，降低成本的重要源泉。这就需要部局各级领导机关抓紧技术领导，切实解决各个工厂中关键性的技术问题。在企业中，企业领导干部要善于发动全体职工，团结技术人员努力学习，钻研技术，总结推广先进经验，有计划地提高现有技术人员及熟练工人的技术水平。只有在不断提高技术的基础上，生产力才能继续向前推进和发展。
    在第一个五年建设计划期内，国家需要集中力量于重工业建设，对于轻工业新建企业的基本建设投资不可能过多。轻工业的发展应该根据国家的财力以及人民的需要来研究决定。目前国营及地方国营轻工业都应以现有企业为主，通过设备的调整平衡和扩建改建，充分发挥其潜在能力。并有计划地增添新的产品品种，供应市场。对于新厂的建设，应将国营企业、地方国营企业、公私合营企业、私营企业与手工业的生产能力全面了解，通盘考虑，根据需要与可能，有重点地妥慎进行。要克服基本建设工作中那种贪多冒进喜新好大的思想。从国民经济的整体观点出发，周密地、慎重地研究每一个基本建设项目的经济上的必要性与技术上的可能性。新厂要正确制定企业的设计任务书，旧厂扩建改建要制定企业的总体设计。按基本建设程序办事，以克服过去因主观主义盲目性及不遵照基本建设程序办事所产生的错误。一般地说：轻工业的基本建设比重工业较为容易，因此应该抓紧建设的时间，迅速竣工投入生产，使国家资金，不致长期积压在未完工的建设工程上。同时要特别注意基本建设的效果，能很快反映在生产的增长或成本的降低上。今后轻工业部门对于那些投资小，收效大，周转迅速而能及时供应社会需要的扩建改建工程及技术组织措施，应该特别加以重视。
    全国轻工业中私营企业所占比重相当大，这是在国家过渡时期中一支不可忽视的力量。必须充分利用它的积极性，防止其盲目性，通过国家资本主义的各种形式，使之逐步纳入国家经济计划的轨道，同时还要有步骤地根据需要与自愿，进行公私合营，以改变其生产关系，改善其经营管理，发挥其生产潜力。
    在第一个五年计划期间，轻工业部门要在国家投资较少，原料供应还有困难的条件下，完成发展生产，保证需要，为国家积累建设资金的艰巨而光荣的任务，轻工业部门的工作同志们必须努力钻研业务，克服工作中的缺点和困难；在其他经济部门的积极配合与支持下，摸清全面情况，使供产销密切结合，有计划地组织生产，改进管理，提高技术，发动全体职工的创造性积极性，增加生产，厉行节约，为制造出更多数量的物美价廉的轻工业品，满足人民生活需要而奋斗！
