    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 6th: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference held its twelfth meeting on the 6th, continuing the discussion of the second item on the agenda - "The German Question and the Task of Ensuring European Security."
    Dulles served as chairman of the meeting.
    As everyone knows, at the meeting on the 5th, the foreign ministers of the three Western countries refused to accept the Soviet proposal to establish a temporary all-German government and hold free all-German elections, even though this proposal opened up a reliable path for Germany to be reunified into a peace-loving and democratic country. It is worth noting that West German newspapers, acting according to the wishes of certain individuals, avoided discussing the essence of the Soviet proposal, simply clamoring that it was "unacceptable."
    The aim of the speeches of the foreign ministers of the three Western countries at the meeting on the 6th was still to portray the Soviet proposal as an unacceptable solution to the German question.
    The first to speak was Bidault, who once again defended Eden's plan. This plan seeks to use a parliamentary format as a solution to such an important issue, which is to restore Germany's unity in accordance with democratic and peaceful principles, so that Germany can no longer threaten the security of the people of Europe. Bidault openly said that he and his Western partners believe that the way to solve the German question lies in Germany's "union" with Western countries. In this way, he once again confirmed that the French, American, and British governments believe that their main task is to pull Germany into the Western military bloc, rather than to build a democratic and peace-loving Germany.
    Bidault's speech repeated the unconvincing arguments that contradict the facts, which the Western foreign ministers put forward on the 5th in an attempt to justify their refusal to accept the Soviet proposal.
    Bidault tried to prove once again that due to the differences in the systems of East and West Germany, it is impossible for the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Bonn government to establish contact.
    He reiterated his rejection of the Soviet proposal - to withdraw the occupying forces from East and West Germany before the election, leaving only a limited number of troops to perform security duties.
    The Soviet proposal not to pull Germany into any alliance or military union to deal with any country that had participated in the war against Hitler's Germany with armed forces was described by Bidault as "prohibiting Germany from uniting with its neighbors." In this way, Bidault once again explained the motives of the Western countries in demanding Germany's "union" with Western countries.
    Bidault had to admit that it is impossible to demand free elections under the supervision of the occupying countries on the one hand - as stipulated in the Eden Plan - and at the same time say that such elections will be free. He said that he intends to amend this part of the Eden Plan. However, as far as the whole issue is concerned, it is only a matter of making some insignificant changes to certain details of the plan, and there is no change in essence. Bidault said that he had not abandoned the proposal for the occupying countries to supervise the elections, but agreed to add some "restrictions" to this supervision. He suggested forming another supervisory committee composed of Germans and representatives of neutral countries. At the same time, Bidault still insisted that the election law be drafted by the four occupying countries, rather than by the temporary all-German government as proposed by the Soviet Union.
    Bidault finally said that the Soviet Union should not have any worries about the Eden Plan, because this plan will have some "reliable guarantees." Bidault said that he used "words of reconciliation" in his speech.
    Eden then spoke. He said that he believed that each side had fully explained its attitude towards the issue of German unification. He emphasized that there are great differences between the plans put forward by the three Western foreign ministers and the Soviet plan.
    Like Bidault, he reiterated that the Soviet proposal is unacceptable to the Western countries, first because it requires an agreement between two German regimes based on opposing principles of governance; second because the Soviet proposal advocates holding elections on a different basis from that advocated by the Eden Plan; and third because the Western countries believe that it is impossible to withdraw the four-country occupying forces from Germany before the election.
    Eden illogically said that the withdrawal of the occupying forces from Germany before the election - a proposal put forward by the Soviet government to avoid foreign pressure during the all-German elections - would supposedly become a new obstacle, hindering the German people from exercising their right to elect an all-German government in the shortest possible time.
    In order to justify his refusal to accept the Soviet proposal, Eden pretended to express doubts about the tasks of the limited troops, who, according to the Soviet proposal, should be left behind to perform security work within the scope of the four-country control tasks.
    Eden repeated that his plan supposedly gives the future all-German government the opportunity to freely decide whether to join the "European Defense Community," although, as the Soviet delegation convincingly pointed out during the discussion, the Bonn-Paris Treaty predetermines Germany's accession to the Western military bloc to deal with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    Eden added that he wanted to put forward a proposal. In his opinion, this proposal will make it possible to continue discussing the issues before the foreign ministers. He asked the Soviet delegation if it agreed to hold all-German elections "with guarantees of fair supervision." He pointed out that he was referring to the proposal made by Bidault at the meeting on the 6th.
    Eden finally repeated the clich√©s of the "European Defense Community." He described this group as a "defensive alliance" rather than against the Soviet Union. He demanded that no obstacles be created to prevent Germany from joining this so-called "defensive alliance." Eden said that the establishment of the "European Defense Community" with Germany's participation does not violate the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942. He said, "If we can use any other means to eliminate the Soviet Union's concerns about its security," he would be willing to consider it.
    V.M. Molotov then spoke on easing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war.
    Molotov said: We have just heard the opinions of Mr. Bidault and Mr. Eden. The Soviet delegation believes that it is possible to continue exchanging opinions on the issues under discussion.
    Today, the Soviet delegation believes it must urge everyone to pay attention to another issue.
    When discussing the German question, we must not overlook the issue of Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war.
    In its note of August 15, 1953, the Soviet government suggested to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to completely relieve Germany of the obligation to pay reparations and repay post-war national debts to the four countries, starting from January 1, 1954, with the exception of debts in trade obligations. In addition, the Soviet government proposed reducing the expenses incurred by the stationing of four-country troops in German territory, and relieving Germany of the debt for the four-country occupation fees paid in foreign currency since 1945.
    In view of the fact that Germany has fulfilled a considerable part of its financial and economic obligations to the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, it is obvious that the implementation of these measures is necessary. In addition to this, due consideration should be given to the need to improve Germany's economic situation, create favorable conditions for the development of a peaceful economy, and raise the living standards of the people.
    Since the proposal to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations has not yet been discussed by the four countries, and since there has been no opportunity to pass a unanimously agreed decision on this issue, the Soviet government has implemented corresponding measures to ease the German Democratic Republic's financial and economic obligations since January 1, 1954.
    Since the beginning of January 1954, the Soviet government has stopped collecting reparations from the German Democratic Republic, transferred Soviet enterprises in Germany to the German Democratic Republic free of charge, and reduced the occupation fees to no more than 5% of the German Democratic Republic's national budget revenue.
    In addition, the German Democratic Republic has also been relieved of the obligation to repay post-war national debts owed to the Soviet Union, including the debt for occupation fees paid in foreign currency since 1945.
    It would be unfair if the other part of Germany, namely West Germany, were to continue to bear the cost of the same obligations. According to official data, West Germany must repay approximately 7 billion marks of post-war national debt to foreign countries. West Germany also bears huge occupation costs:
    In the 1953-1954 fiscal year, it is planned to spend 9.6 billion marks on "defense expenditures" - mostly occupation costs - accounting for 34.5% of West Germany's budget revenue.
    We cannot fail to point out that West Germany has not yet been exempted from the obligation to pay reparations, and the Bonn Treaty postpones the solution of this issue indefinitely to the time of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. From the standpoint taken by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France at this conference, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany is being postponed indefinitely, so the above issue has not yet been addressed.
    All of this fully demonstrates the need to study the issue of easing Germany's financial and economic obligations at this conference. It is very important that the German people today fully understand that Germany should no longer be required to pay reparations, post-war debts, foreign occupation fees, etc.
    Based on this, the Soviet delegation makes the following proposal:
    "Measures to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war.
    In view of the fact that Germany has fulfilled most of its financial and economic obligations to the United States of America, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as a result of the war,
    Considering that measures to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war will greatly contribute to the development of Germany's peaceful economy and improve the material welfare of the people,
    The governments of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union have agreed that, starting from January 1, 1954:
    1. Germany shall be completely exempted from paying reparations of any form; and exempted from repaying post-war national debts to the four countries of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the exception of debts in trade obligations.
    2. The expenses of the four countries' troops stationed on German territory shall be reduced, and the annual total shall not exceed 5% of the annual budget of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
    3. Germany shall be completely exempted from paying the remaining balance of the four-country occupation fees that have accumulated since 1945."
    The Soviet delegation hopes that this proposal on easing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war will receive due consideration at the meeting.
    After V.M. Molotov spoke, Dulles continued to speak. He began by insisting that the Soviet Foreign Minister felt that there was no need to continue discussing the issue of German unification, although Molotov had said before Dulles's speech that the Soviet delegation believed that the exchange of opinions on the issues under discussion should continue.
    Dulles said: He hoped to express some opinions on the point that the Soviet delegation talked about easing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war. But in this part of his speech, he only groundlessly said that West Germany has made great progress economically due to the so-called "American aid." Dulles did not cite any facts to confirm this claim, because the facts clearly show the opposite. Everyone knows that the purpose of the United States' "aid" to West Germany is to militarize West Germany's economy and re-establish an arsenal for implementing the United States' war plan in Europe, which places a heavy burden on the vast masses of West Germany. Dulles did not mention the substance of V.M. Molotov's measures to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations at all.
    Dulles reiterated his previous untenable opposition to the Soviet proposal to establish a temporary all-German government and hold free all-German elections.
    Bidault and Eden, who spoke after Dulles, said that the Soviet delegation had not responded to their so-called "new" proposals.
    Regarding this point, V.M. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believed that the discussion of the German question would continue. Therefore, it has not yet expressed its opinions on Bidault and Eden's speeches on February 6th. Molotov said that the Western foreign ministers did not put forward new proposals at the meeting on February 6th. Bidault and Eden's speeches touched on the details of the issues currently under discussion, but did not talk about the main aspect, that is: whether the all-German elections will be conducted by the Germans themselves or by the occupying authorities.
    Bidault and Eden agreed that the discussion of the German question should continue. However, Eden suggested that after the secret meeting scheduled for February 8th, the foreign ministers should begin discussing the third item on the agenda - the Austrian peace treaty, and the discussion of the German question should be resumed after this.
    Molotov pointed out that, according to previous agreements, a secret meeting would be held on February 8th, and the second item on the agenda - the German question and the task of ensuring European security - could be continued on February 9th.
    Eden agreed with this opinion.
    Dulles suggested that the study of the Austrian peace treaty should begin immediately after the Austrian delegation arrives.
    Molotov pointed out that the procedure issues will also be discussed at the secret meeting on February 8th, and proposed that the procedure issues for discussing the third item on the agenda be considered at that meeting. No one objected to this proposal.
    The meeting was then adjourned.
