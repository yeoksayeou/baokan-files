    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 6th: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference held its twelfth meeting on the 6th, continuing the discussion of the second item on the agenda - "The German Question and the Task of Ensuring European Security."
    Dulles served as chairman of the meeting.
    As everyone knows, at the meeting on the 5th, the foreign ministers of the three Western countries refused to accept the Soviet proposal to establish a temporary all-German government and hold free all-German elections, even though this proposal opened up a reliable path for Germany to be reunified into a peace-loving and democratic country. It is worth noting that West German newspapers, acting according to the wishes of certain individuals, avoided discussing the essence of the Soviet proposal, simply clamoring that it was "unacceptable."
    The aim of the speeches of the foreign ministers of the three Western countries at the meeting on the 6th was still to portray the Soviet proposal as an unacceptable solution to the German question.
    The first to speak was Bidault, who once again defended Eden's plan. This plan seeks to use a parliamentary format as a solution to such an important issue, which is to restore Germany's unity in accordance with democratic and peaceful principles, so that Germany can no longer threaten the security of the people of Europe. Bidault openly said that he and his Western partners believe that the way to solve the German question lies in Germany's "union" with Western countries. In this way, he once again confirmed that the French, American, and British governments believe that their main task is to pull Germany into the Western military bloc, rather than to build a democratic and peace-loving Germany.
    Bidault's speech repeated the unconvincing arguments that contradict the facts, which the Western foreign ministers put forward on the 5th in an attempt to justify their refusal to accept the Soviet proposal.
    Bidault tried to prove once again that due to the differences in the systems of East and West Germany, it is impossible for the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Bonn government to establish contact.
    He reiterated his rejection of the Soviet proposal - to withdraw the occupying forces from East and West Germany before the election, leaving only a limited number of troops to perform security duties.
    The Soviet proposal not to pull Germany into any alliance or military union to deal with any country that had participated in the war against Hitler's Germany with armed forces was described by Bidault as "prohibiting Germany from uniting with its neighbors." In this way, Bidault once again explained the motives of the Western countries in demanding Germany's "union" with Western countries.
    Bidault had to admit that it is impossible to demand free elections under the supervision of the occupying countries on the one hand - as stipulated in the Eden Plan - and at the same time say that such elections will be free. He said that he intends to amend this part of the Eden Plan. However, as far as the whole issue is concerned, it is only a matter of making some insignificant changes to certain details of the plan, and there is no change in essence. Bidault said that he had not abandoned the proposal for the occupying countries to supervise the elections, but agreed to add some "restrictions" to this supervision. He suggested forming another supervisory committee composed of Germans and representatives of neutral countries. At the same time, Bidault still insisted that the election law be drafted by the four occupying countries, rather than by the temporary all-German government as proposed by the Soviet Union.
    Bidault finally said that the Soviet Union should not have any worries about the Eden Plan, because this plan will have some "reliable guarantees." Bidault said that he used "words of reconciliation" in his speech.
    Eden then spoke. He said that he believed that each side had fully explained its attitude towards the issue of German unification. He emphasized that there are great differences between the plans put forward by the three Western foreign ministers and the Soviet plan.
    Like Bidault, he reiterated that the Soviet proposal is unacceptable to the Western countries, first because it requires an agreement between two German regimes based on opposing principles of governance; second because the Soviet proposal advocates holding elections on a different basis from that advocated by the Eden Plan; and third because the Western countries believe that it is impossible to withdraw the four-country occupying forces from Germany before the election.
    Eden illogically said that the withdrawal of the occupying forces from Germany before the election - a proposal put forward by the Soviet government to avoid foreign pressure during the all-German elections - would supposedly become a new obstacle, hindering the German people from exercising their right to elect an all-German government in the shortest possible time.
    In order to justify his refusal to accept the Soviet proposal, Eden pretended to express doubts about the tasks of the limited troops, who, according to the Soviet proposal, should be left behind to perform security work within the scope of the four-country control tasks.
    Eden repeated that his plan supposedly gives the future all-German government the opportunity to freely decide whether to join the "European Defense Community," although, as the Soviet delegation convincingly pointed out during the discussion, the Bonn-Paris Treaty predetermines Germany's accession to the Western military bloc to deal with the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.
    Eden added that he wanted to put forward a proposal. In his opinion, this proposal will make it possible to continue discussing the issues before the foreign ministers. He asked the Soviet delegation if it agreed to hold all-German elections "with guarantees of fair supervision." He pointed out that he was referring to the proposal made by Bidault at the meeting on the 6th.
    Eden finally repeated the clichés of the "European Defense Community." He described this group as a "defensive alliance" rather than against the Soviet Union. He demanded that no obstacles be created to prevent Germany from joining this so-called "defensive alliance." Eden said that the establishment of the "European Defense Community" with Germany's participation does not violate the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942. He said, "If we can use any other means to eliminate the Soviet Union's concerns about its security," he would be willing to consider it.
    V.M. Molotov then spoke on easing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war.
    Molotov said: We have just heard the opinions of Mr. Bidault and Mr. Eden. The Soviet delegation believes that it is possible to continue exchanging opinions on the issues under discussion.
    Today, the Soviet delegation believes it must urge everyone to pay attention to another issue.
    When discussing the German question, we must not overlook the issue of Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war.
    In its note of August 15, 1953, the Soviet government suggested to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to completely relieve Germany of the obligation to pay reparations and repay post-war national debts to the four countries, starting from January 1, 1954, with the exception of debts in trade obligations. In addition, the Soviet government proposed reducing the expenses incurred by the stationing of four-country troops in German territory, and relieving Germany of the debt for the four-country occupation fees paid in foreign currency since 1945.
    In view of the fact that Germany has fulfilled a considerable part of its financial and economic obligations to the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, it is obvious that the implementation of these measures is necessary. In addition to this, due consideration should be given to the need to improve Germany's economic situation, create favorable conditions for the development of a peaceful economy, and raise the living standards of the people.
    Since the proposal to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations has not yet been discussed by the four countries, and since there has been no opportunity to pass a unanimously agreed decision on this issue, the Soviet government has implemented corresponding measures to ease the German Democratic Republic's financial and economic obligations since January 1, 1954.
    Since the beginning of January 1954, the Soviet government has stopped collecting reparations from the German Democratic Republic, transferred Soviet enterprises in Germany to the German Democratic Republic free of charge, and reduced the occupation fees to no more than 5% of the German Democratic Republic's national budget revenue.
    In addition, the German Democratic Republic has also been relieved of the obligation to repay post-war national debts owed to the Soviet Union, including the debt for occupation fees paid in foreign currency since 1945.
    It would be unfair if the other part of Germany, namely West Germany, were to continue to bear the cost of the same obligations. According to official data, West Germany must repay approximately 7 billion marks of post-war national debt to foreign countries. West Germany also bears huge occupation costs:
    In the 1953-1954 fiscal year, it is planned to spend 9.6 billion marks on "defense expenditures" - mostly occupation costs - accounting for 34.5% of West Germany's budget revenue.
    We cannot fail to point out that West Germany has not yet been exempted from the obligation to pay reparations, and the Bonn Treaty postpones the solution of this issue indefinitely to the time of the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. From the standpoint taken by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France at this conference, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany is being postponed indefinitely, so the above issue has not yet been addressed.
    All of this fully demonstrates the need to study the issue of easing Germany's financial and economic obligations at this conference. It is very important that the German people today fully understand that Germany should no longer be required to pay reparations, post-war debts, foreign occupation fees, etc.
    Based on this, the Soviet delegation makes the following proposal:
    "Measures to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war.
    In view of the fact that Germany has fulfilled most of its financial and economic obligations to the United States of America, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as a result of the war,
    Considering that measures to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war will greatly contribute to the development of Germany's peaceful economy and improve the material welfare of the people,
    The governments of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union have agreed that, starting from January 1, 1954:
    1. Germany shall be completely exempted from paying reparations of any form; and exempted from repaying post-war national debts to the four countries of the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union, with the exception of debts in trade obligations.
    2. The expenses of the four countries' troops stationed on German territory shall be reduced, and the annual total shall not exceed 5% of the annual budget of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
    3. Germany shall be completely exempted from paying the remaining balance of the four-country occupation fees that have accumulated since 1945."
    The Soviet delegation hopes that this proposal on easing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war will receive due consideration at the meeting.
    After V.M. Molotov spoke, Dulles continued to speak. He began by insisting that the Soviet Foreign Minister felt that there was no need to continue discussing the issue of German unification, although Molotov had said before Dulles's speech that the Soviet delegation believed that the exchange of opinions on the issues under discussion should continue.
    Dulles said: He hoped to express some opinions on the point that the Soviet delegation talked about easing Germany's financial and economic obligations resulting from the war. But in this part of his speech, he only groundlessly said that West Germany has made great progress economically due to the so-called "American aid." Dulles did not cite any facts to confirm this claim, because the facts clearly show the opposite. Everyone knows that the purpose of the United States' "aid" to West Germany is to militarize West Germany's economy and re-establish an arsenal for implementing the United States' war plan in Europe, which places a heavy burden on the vast masses of West Germany. Dulles did not mention the substance of V.M. Molotov's measures to ease Germany's financial and economic obligations at all.
    Dulles reiterated his previous untenable opposition to the Soviet proposal to establish a temporary all-German government and hold free all-German elections.
    Bidault and Eden, who spoke after Dulles, said that the Soviet delegation had not responded to their so-called "new" proposals.
    Regarding this point, V.M. Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believed that the discussion of the German question would continue. Therefore, it has not yet expressed its opinions on Bidault and Eden's speeches on February 6th. Molotov said that the Western foreign ministers did not put forward new proposals at the meeting on February 6th. Bidault and Eden's speeches touched on the details of the issues currently under discussion, but did not talk about the main aspect, that is: whether the all-German elections will be conducted by the Germans themselves or by the occupying authorities.
    Bidault and Eden agreed that the discussion of the German question should continue. However, Eden suggested that after the secret meeting scheduled for February 8th, the foreign ministers should begin discussing the third item on the agenda - the Austrian peace treaty, and the discussion of the German question should be resumed after this.
    Molotov pointed out that, according to previous agreements, a secret meeting would be held on February 8th, and the second item on the agenda - the German question and the task of ensuring European security - could be continued on February 9th.
    Eden agreed with this opinion.
    Dulles suggested that the study of the Austrian peace treaty should begin immediately after the Austrian delegation arrives.
    Molotov pointed out that the procedure issues will also be discussed at the secret meeting on February 8th, and proposed that the procedure issues for discussing the third item on the agenda be considered at that meeting. No one objected to this proposal.
    The meeting was then adjourned.

### 莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上发言  建议减轻德国的财政与经济义务

    莫洛托夫在四国外长会议上发言
    建议减轻德国的财政与经济义务
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林六日电：四国外长会议于六日举行第十二次会议，继续讨论第二项议程——“德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务”。
    杜勒斯担任会议主席。
    大家知道，在五日的会议上，三个西方国家的外长们拒绝接受苏联提出的成立临时的全德政府和举行全德自由选举的建议，虽然这个建议为德国重新统一为一个爱好和平与民主的国家开辟了可靠的道路。值得注意的是：看某些人士的眼色行事的西德报纸避而不谈苏联建议的本质，只是吵吵嚷嚷地说，这是“不能接受”的。
    西方三国外长们在六日会议上的发言目的，仍然是想把苏联的建议说成是不能被接受来作为解决德国问题的办法的。
    第一个发言的是皮杜尔，他再次为艾登的计划辩护。这个计划想以议会形式来作为这样一个重要问题的解决办法，这个重要问题就是：遵循民主、和平的方针来恢复德国的统一，使德国再不能威胁欧洲各国人民的安全。皮杜尔公然说，他与他的西方伙伴们认为：解决德国问题的途径在于德国与西方国家的“联合”。这样，他就再一次证实：法国、美国与英国政府认为它们的主要任务就是把德国拉进西方国家的军事集团，而不是要建立一个民主与爱好和平的德国。
    皮杜尔的发言重复着与事实矛盾的、不能令人信服的论点，这个论点是西方国家外长们在五日提出，想以此来为他们拒绝接受苏联建议辩护的。
    皮杜尔想再次证明：由于东西德制度的不同，德意志民主共和国政府与波恩政府是不可能建立联系的。
    他再次说他拒绝苏联提出的建议——在选举以前，自东西德撤退占领军队，只留下有限的部队来执行保安工作。
    苏联提出的不准把德国拉进任何同盟或军事联盟，来对付任何曾以武装部队参加对希特勒德国作战的国家的建议，被皮杜尔说成是“禁止德国与邻邦联合”。这样，皮杜尔就再次说明了西方国家要求德国与西方国家“联合”的动机。
    皮杜尔不得不承认，不可能一方面要求在占领国家的监督下举行自由选举——如艾登计划所规定的——同时又说这种选举将是自由的。他说，他打算修改一下艾登计划中的这一部分。然而就整个问题而言，只不过是就计划中的某些细节作一些微不足道的更动，而在本质上并没有任何改变。皮杜尔说，他并没有放弃关于由占领国家来监督选举的建议，但是同意对这种监督加上某种“限制”。他建议另外再成立由德国人与中立国代表组成的某种监督委员会。同时皮杜尔仍然坚持由四个占领国家，而不是如苏联建议所规定的由临时的全德政府来草拟选举法。
    皮杜尔最后说，苏联不应该对艾登计划有什么忧虑，因为这个计划将会有某种“可靠的保证”。皮杜尔说他在发言中用的是“和解的词句”。
    艾登接着发言。他说，他认为每一方都已经充分解释了它对德国统一问题的态度。他着重指出西方三国外长所提出的计划与苏联计划之间有很大分歧。
    和皮杜尔一样，他重申苏联建议是西方国家所不能接受的，首先是因为这需要两个建立在相反的治理原则上的德国政权取得协议；第二是因为苏联建议主张在一个与艾登计划所主张的不同的基础上举行选举；第三是因为西方国家认为在选举以前不可能自德国撤退四国占领军队。
    艾登违反逻辑地说，在选举以前自德国撤退占领军队——这是苏联政府为了避免外国在举行全德选举期间施加压力而提出的建议——据说会成为一个新的障碍，妨碍德国人民行使他们的权利，在最短期间内选出全德政府。
    为了为他的拒绝接受苏联建议辩护，艾登假装对有限的部队的任务表示怀疑，根据苏联的建议，这些部队应该留下来执行四国管制任务范围内的保安工作。
    艾登再次重复说，他的计划据说是使得将来的全德政府在是否加入“欧洲防务集团”问题上有自由决定的机会，虽然如苏联代表团在讨论过程中令人信服地指出的，波恩与巴黎条约事先决定了德国加入西方国家的军事集团来对付苏联与各人民民主国家的问题。
    艾登又说，他要提出一个建议。在他看来，这个建议将使得继续讨论外长们面前的问题成为可能。他问苏联代表团是否同意“在有公正监督保证的情况下”举行全德选举。他指出，他指的是皮杜尔在六日会议上提出的建议。
    艾登最后重复“欧洲防务集团”的陈词滥调。他把这个集团说成是“防御联盟”而不是对付苏联的。他要求不要造成什么障碍来妨碍德国加入这个所谓“防御联盟”。艾登说，建立有德国参加的“欧洲防务集团”并不违反一九四二年的英苏条约。他说，“假如我们可以用任何别的办法来消除苏联对它的安全的忧虑”，他愿意加以考虑。
    维·米·莫洛托夫接着就减轻德国由于战争后果而担负的财政与经济义务发言。
    莫洛托夫说：我们刚才听到了皮杜尔先生和艾登先生的意见。苏联代表团认为可以继续就讨论中的问题交换意见。
    今天，苏联代表团认为必须促请大家再注意一个问题。
    在讨论德国问题的时候，我们决不能略过德国由于战争后果所担负的财政与经济义务问题。
    在一九五三年八月十五日的照会中，苏联政府向美国、英国与法国政府建议自一九五四年一月一日起，完全解除德国支付赔偿费和向四国偿还战后国债的义务，贸易义务方面的债务除外。此外，苏联政府建议减少因四国军队驻留德国领土而承担的费用，并解除德国支付自一九四五年以来所积欠的以外币支付的四国占领费的债务。
    鉴于德国已经履行了它对美国、英国、法国与苏联的相当一部分财政与经济义务，显然，执行这些措施是必要的。除此以外，应该适当考虑到改善德国的经济情况、创造有利的条件以发展和平经济并提高人民的生活水平的必要性。
    由于减轻德国的财政与经济义务的建议迄今还没有经由四国讨论，由于还没有机会就这个问题通过一个一致同意的决定，苏联政府自一九五四年一月一日起已执行了相应的措施来减轻德意志民主共和国的财政与经济义务。
    自一九五四年一月开始，苏联政府已停止向德意志民主共和国收取赔偿费、无偿地把在德国的苏联企业移交给德意志民主共和国，并将占领费减少到不超过德意志民主共和国国家预算收入百分之五的数目。
    此外，还解除了德意志民主共和国偿付战后欠苏联的国债的义务，包括自一九四五年以来所积欠的以外币支付的占领费债务。
    假如德国的另一部分，也就是西德要继续担负同样义务的费用的话，那是不公平的。根据官方材料，西德必须偿付给外国大约七十亿马克的战后国债。西德还担负着庞大的占领费用：
    在一九五三—一九五四会计年度，打算在“防御开支”——大部是占领费用——项下支出九十六亿马克，占西德预算收入的百分之三十四点五。
    我们不能不指出，西德尚未免除支付赔偿费的义务，而波恩条约把这个问题的解决无限期地推迟到缔结对德和约的时候。而从美、英、法三国代表在这次会议上所采取的立场看来，对德和约问题是被无限期地延宕着，所以上述问题现在还未曾着手解决。
    这一切都充分说明，有必要在这次会议上研究减轻德国的财政和经济义务的问题。十分重要的是，今天德国人民已完全知道，不应再要求德国支付赔偿费、战后债务、外国占领费等等。
    苏联代表团根据这一点提出如下的建议：
    “关于减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政与经济义务的措施。
    鉴于德国已向美利坚合众国、英国、法国和苏联履行了由于战争后果所承担的财政和经济义务的大部分，
    认为关于减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政和经济义务的措施会大大有助于发展德国的和平经济和增进人民的物质福利，
    美、法、英、苏四国政府已经同意，自一九五四年一月一日起：
    一、德国将完全免予支付任何形式的赔偿；并免予偿付对美、法、英、苏联四国的战后国债，贸易义务方面的债务除外。
    二、四国在德国领土上驻军的开支应加以削减，其每年总数不得超过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国每年预算的百分之五。
    三、德国将完全免予支付自从一九四五年以来所积欠的四国占领费尾数。”
    苏联代表团希望，这个关于减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政与经济义务的建议能在会上受到适当的考虑。
    维·米·莫洛托夫发言以后，杜勒斯继续发言。他一开始便硬说苏联外交部部长认为没有必要继续讨论德国统一问题，虽然莫洛托夫在杜勒斯发言以前已经说过，苏联代表团认为应该继续就讨论中的问题交换意见。
    杜勒斯说：他希望就苏联代表团谈到的减轻德国由于战争后果所承担的财政和经济义务一点，表示几点意见。但是他在这一部分发言中，仅是没有根据地说什么西德由于得到所谓“美援”，在经济上已有很大的进展。杜勒斯没有举出任何事实来证实这种说法，因为事实恰恰说明相反的情况。大家知道，美国对西德的“援助”，目的是要使西德的经济军事化，是要重新建立一个为实行美国在欧洲的战争计划的兵工厂，这使得西德广大的群众负担沉重。杜勒斯根本没有谈到维·米·莫洛托夫关于减轻德国财政经济义务的措施的实质。
    杜勒斯重述他以前对苏联关于建立临时的全德政府和举行全德自由选举的建议所表示的站不住脚的反对论调。
    继杜勒斯之后发言的皮杜尔和艾登说，苏联代表团没有答复他们所提出的所谓“新”建议。
    关于这一点，维·米·莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团以为德国问题的讨论还将继续下去。因此还没有对皮杜尔和艾登二月六日的发言表示意见。莫洛托夫说，西方外长在二月六日的会议上并没有提出新的建议。皮杜尔和艾登的发言接触到目前所讨论的问题的细节，但是并没有谈到主要的一面，就是说：全德选举将由德国人自己来进行呢，还是由占领当局来进行。
    皮杜尔和艾登同意，德国问题的讨论应当继续进行。但是，艾登建议，在预定于二月八日举行的秘密会议之后，外长们应当开始讨论第三项议程——对奥和约，德国问题的讨论应当在此以后再恢复。
    莫洛托夫指出，根据以前的协议，将在二月八日举行秘密会议，在二月九日就可以继续讨论第二项议程——德国问题和保障欧洲安全的任务。
    艾登同意这意见。
    杜勒斯建议在奥地利代表团到达之后，立刻转而研究对奥和约。
    莫洛托夫指出，二月八日的秘密会议也将讨论程序问题，并提议在那次会议上考虑讨论第三项议程的程序问题。没有人对这一建议表示反对。
    会议至此宣布休会。
