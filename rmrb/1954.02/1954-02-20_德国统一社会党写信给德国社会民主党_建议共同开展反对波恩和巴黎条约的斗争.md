Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 19th: The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany wrote to the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party of Germany on February 15th, suggesting that the German working class and their organizations—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Communist Party of Germany, the Free German Trade Union Federation, and the German Trade Union Federation—together with all the German people, jointly launch a struggle against the Bonn and Paris Treaties and prevent their implementation.

    The letter stated that holding a referendum is the best way for all residents to express whether they are in favor of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and withdrawing the occupying forces, or whether they are in favor of the Bonn and Paris Treaties. The workers must resolutely demand, according to the suggestion of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, that occupation costs be reduced to 5 percent of the national budget and that reparations and post-war debts be cancelled.

    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party also suggested that the leading bodies of the Socialist Unity Party and the Social Democratic Party of Germany guarantee support for the joint actions of the workers to achieve the demands mentioned in the letter, and requested that a joint meeting be held by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, the National Executive Committee of the Free German Trade Union Federation, and the National Executive Committee of the German Trade Union Federation to discuss Molotov's proposal for an all-European treaty on guaranteeing collective security in Europe. The letter emphasized that Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal is very important and should become the basis for discussion among all German workers' organizations.

    德国统一社会党写信给德国社会民主党
    建议共同开展反对波恩和巴黎条约的斗争
    【新华社十九日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林十七日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会于二月十五日写信给德国社会民主党执行委员会，建议德国工人阶级和他们的组织：德国统一社会党、德国社会民主党、德国共产党、自由德国工会联合会和德国工会联合会，与全体德国人民一起，共同展开一次反对波恩和巴黎条约、阻止实现波恩和巴黎条约的斗争。
    信中说：举行一次公民投票是让全体居民表示他们是赞成缔结对德和约和撤退占领军还是赞成波恩和巴黎条约的最好办法。工人们必须坚决地根据苏联外长莫洛托夫的建议，要求减低占领费到国家预算的百分之五，解除赔偿费和战后的债务。
    统一社会党中央委员会还建议统一社会党和德国社会民主党领导机构保证支持工人们争取实现信中所提到的这种要求的联合行动，并要求由统一社会党中央委员会、德国社会民主党执行委员会、德国共产党执行委员会、自由德国工会联合会全国执行委员会和德国工会联合会全国执行委员会举行联合会议来讨论莫洛托夫提出的关于保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议。信中强调说，莫洛托夫外长的建议非常重要，应当成为德国所有工人组织在一起讨论的基础。
