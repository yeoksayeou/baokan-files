Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 7th: Yumen Oilfield will be gradually built into China's first petroleum base.

    Starting this year, Yumen Oilfield will systematically expand its production scale. The main oil layers in the mining area will be exploited simultaneously, and the planned crude oil output will double compared to last year. Forty-six percent of the crude oil will be continuously loaded onto trains for eastward transport, supplying refineries in Northeast and East China to produce various petroleum products. The Yumen Oilfield's own refinery will also be expanded this year. The cracking refinery will add a visbreaker furnace this year, increasing crude oil refining capacity by 26 percent. Yumen Oilfield's planned gasoline production this year will increase by 9 percent compared to last year, and kerosene will increase by about 1,000 tons. In addition, two new petroleum products will be refined: one is cylinder oil specifically for steam pumps, and the other is grease for machine bearings. In this way, Yumen Oilfield can produce fifteen kinds of petroleum products for the country this year to further meet the needs of industry, transportation, and farmers' lighting.
    In order to systematically expand the scale of exploitation, this year's investment in capital construction in Yumen Oilfield has increased by 2.7 times compared with last year, of which about 80 percent of the funds will be used to drill new production wells. It is estimated that the number of new oil wells put into production this year will be more than four times the number of new oil wells built last year. With the continuous increase of new oil wells, six new oil selection stations will be built this year, and one old oil selection station will be renovated. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, six water injection wells will also be drilled at the edge of the oil-bearing strata to protect the oilfield and ensure that all oil wells produce more crude oil. Due to the increase in the task of transporting crude oil eastward, a new five-kilometer-long oil pipeline will be laid in the mining area this year to increase crude oil flow; the number of special vehicles for transporting crude oil will also increase by four times compared to last year.
    This year, the total number of employees in the entire mine will increase by 28 percent compared with last year, mainly with the increase of oil extraction workers and transportation workers. Therefore, 15,000 square meters of employee dormitories will be newly built in the mining area this year.

    玉门油矿今年计划扩大开采规模
    【新华社西安七日电】玉门油矿将逐步建设成为我国第一个石油基地。
    从今年开始，玉门油矿将有计划地扩大开采规模。矿区内各主要油层都将同时进行开采，原油的计划产量将比去年增加一倍，其中百分之四十六的原油将源源装上火车东运，供应东北和华东的炼油厂炼制各种石油产品。玉门油矿本身的炼油厂今年也将扩建，裂炼厂今年将添建一座减粘炉，使原油炼量提高百分之二十六。玉门油矿今年的汽油计划产量比去年增加百分之九，煤油增加一千吨左右。此外还将增炼两种石油新产品，一种是专门供给蒸汽泵用的汽缸油，一种是供给机器轴承上用的黄油。这样，玉门油矿今年就可以为国家生产十五种石油产品，以进一步满足工业、交通和农民点灯的需要。
    为了有计划地扩大开采规模，今年玉门油矿的基本建设投资比去年增加了二点七倍，其中约有百分之八十的资金用来新凿生产油井。预计今年投入生产的新油井将比去年新建的油井增加四倍以上。随着新油井的不断增加，今年还要新建六个选油站和改建一个旧选油站。根据苏联专家的建议，在采油层的边缘还要开凿六口注水井，以保护油田，并保证所有油井多产原油。由于原油东运任务的增大，今年矿区内将敷设五公里长的新输油管线，以增加原油流量；运输原油的专用汽车也将比去年增加四倍。
    今年全矿职工人数将要比去年增加百分之二十八，主要是增加采油工人和运输工人。因此，矿区内今年还要新建一万五千平方公尺的职工宿舍。
