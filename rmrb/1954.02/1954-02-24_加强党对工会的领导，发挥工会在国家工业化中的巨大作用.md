As a result of the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country, and the infinite admiration of our working class and the people of the whole country for the socialist system, the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country will surely be victorious. The bright prospects of socialism and communism are inspiring the working class and the people of the whole country to advance bravely along the general line of the state's transition period.

However, this does not mean that there are no difficulties on the road to victory. On the contrary, the process of socialist construction and socialist transformation is a process of overcoming various difficulties, a process of struggle against various forces that oppose and hinder socialist construction and socialist transformation, and the fighting force is the working class and its ally—the peasantry. If our working class is strong and the worker-peasant alliance is consolidated, then our cause will be smooth. The great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation requires the working class to have a high degree of political consciousness and a considerable level of technical and cultural knowledge.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the working class of our country established a solid alliance with the peasants, waged decades of heroic struggle against domestic and foreign reactionaries, overthrew the reactionary regime, won the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, and led and united the people of the whole country to complete the task of restoring the national economy in a short period of three years, enabling our country to enter a period of planned economic construction. But we must not be complacent about this. Generally speaking, our working class is politically strong due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the practical training of long-term revolutionary struggle. However, with the progress of our country's industrialization, large numbers of non-working-class members will continue to enter the ranks of the working class, and the various forms of resistance of the bourgeoisie to socialist transformation will inevitably continue, thus increasing the influence and corrosive effect of bourgeois ideology on the working class, which requires us to continue to improve the political and ideological level of the working class, so that they can become more politically strong in the process of constantly overcoming the influence of bourgeois ideology. At the same time, it should also be seen that our working class is still quite backward in terms of culture and production technology; and the science and technology needed to build our country's strong industry is new to us; our technical cadres and skilled workers are still few; the cultural level of the vast majority of workers is still very low. If this backward phenomenon is not gradually changed, it will hinder the rapid improvement of our industrial production.

The above-mentioned weaknesses of our working class will certainly not fundamentally hinder our country from achieving the victory of socialist construction and socialist transformation, but it will have a major impact on the speed of our progress. And from all aspects, strengthening the speed of construction is very important and urgently needed for us. We must seize the time and advance at the fastest possible speed. As long as this speed is within our capabilities, it should not be regarded as rash advance.

In order to accelerate the progress of our socialist cause, the working class must have a high degree of political consciousness and a considerable level of technical and cultural knowledge. If the broad masses of workers have a high degree of political consciousness, then they will play a high degree of enthusiasm in the cause of socialist construction and show the heroic spirit shown in the revolutionary struggle period; in the union and struggle with the bourgeoisie, they will stand firm and show firmness and alertness; they will give sincere help to the peasants and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance with their own efforts. If the broad masses of workers have a considerable level of technical and cultural knowledge, then they will have the ability to carry out the cause of socialist construction. If this is the case, the speed of our socialist industrialization will be relatively fast.

For this purpose, the Party must strengthen its leadership over the work of trade unions. The trade union is "an educator of millions of people," "It is a school, an administrative school, a management school, a communist school." (Lenin: On Trade Unions, the Present Situation and Trotsky's Errors) "It is not 'on the one hand a school and on the other something else,' but from all aspects, ... the trade union is a school." (Lenin: More on Trade Unions, the Present Situation and Trotsky's and Bukharin's Errors). Trade unions must give full play to their role as "schools."

How can trade unions play their role as "schools"? The role of the trade union as a "school" is reflected in all aspects of trade union work, and the most important is reflected in production, that is, in labor emulation. Labor emulation is the basic method of socialist construction, and at the same time it is a communist practice in itself. When the "Communist Voluntary Saturday," which was a form of labor emulation, first appeared in the Soviet Union in 1919, Lenin attached great importance to it. Lenin said: "When ordinary workers rise up to overcome great difficulties, selflessly try to increase labor productivity, try to protect every pood of grain, coal, iron and other products, these products are not owned by the workers themselves and their 'close relatives,' but by their 'distant relatives,' that is, by the entire society, by millions of people who were initially united into a socialist state and then into a Union of Soviet Republics, - this is when communism begins." (Lenin: The Great Beginning) Labor emulation is precisely to cultivate the working masses with this communist spirit. When labor emulation becomes a regular labor method for the working masses, it can gradually guide the working masses to the level of socialism and communism, gradually overcome the many non-working-class ideas that still exist among the working masses, and our construction cause will advance at an increasingly faster pace.

Through labor emulation, not only can the masses be improved politically and ideologically, but also the masses can be improved in terms of production technology, because closely related to labor emulation are mass production meetings, rationalization proposals, and the promotion of advanced experience. The experience of the past four years has also pointed out that through the mass labor emulation, the reform of production technology and the improvement of workers' technical level are rapid.

"In Russia, only those trade unions that are good at gradually attracting the most backward labor strata to participate consciously in the work of improving the national economy are true communist schools." These words in the "Resolution on the Role and Tasks of Trade Unions" of the Tenth Congress of the CPSU (B) in March 1921 are also applicable to us. Trade unions that are good at organizing labor emulation are true communist schools. Of course, in addition to organizing labor emulation, trade unions must also take various forms (spare-time schools, lectures, seminars, research societies, etc.) in coordination with enterprise administration and the Youth League to organize mass technical learning and cultural learning, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, organize mass spare-time political learning.

Trade unions must also organize and improve the material and cultural life of the workers and staff according to the principle of collectivism, and instill communist spirit into the daily life of the masses. Every trade union worker should deeply care about the production cause (the long-term interests of the working class), and at the same time should deeply care about the daily life of the masses (current interests). It is wrong to harm long-term interests for the sake of the current interests of the masses, and economism must be opposed, but it is also wrong to only see long-term interests and ignore the current living problems that should and can be solved. Since opposing the economistic ideas of some trade union workers, a phenomenon of not caring or not daring to care about the lives of the masses has grown among some trade union workers, which is worthy of attention. It must be understood that as long as it is "improving the lives of the masses on the basis of developing production and according to the principle of needs and possibilities," rather than talking about improving life unilaterally away from the improvement of labor productivity and away from needs and possibilities, then it is not economism. When Stalin mentioned the origin of the Stakhanov movement in his "Speech at the First All-Union Conference of Stakhanov Workers," he said: "The fundamental improvement of the material conditions of the workers is the primary cause of the Stakhanov movement. Life is better, comrades. Life is happier. Since life is happy, work is more energetic. Thus, there are high yields. Thus, there are labor heroes, - male heroes, female heroes. The root of the Stakhanov movement lies first and foremost here." It can be seen from this that not taking the necessary measures to gradually improve the lives of the working masses is also detrimental to production, that is, to the long-term interests of the working class, and is therefore wrong.

In the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, trade unions have great responsibilities. Of course, trade union work has achieved results in recent years. It has attracted more than 10 million workers and staff to participate in trade union organizations, it has conducted a series of education for the broad masses of workers and staff, and it has mobilized the broad masses of workers and staff to actively participate in the restoration of the national economy and the democratic reform of enterprises. But it must also be pointed out that there are still many shortcomings and problems in trade union work. Generally speaking, in the past few years, trade union work has focused on the work of democratic reform of enterprises. It is accustomed to political movements and has not yet practically turned all its work to the normal production track. There is still some confusion in the work. Therefore, if trade unions are to shoulder their important responsibilities, they must continue to strengthen their ideological and organizational construction, continue to educate cadres and the masses with the Party's general line in the transition period and the various resolutions of the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions; continue to promote the advanced experience of the "May Third" factory and other industrial and mining enterprise trade union work, practically arrange various tasks according to the needs of production (the needs of labor emulation), practically strengthen group work, cultivate a large number of activists, carry out mass criticism and self-criticism, and establish normal work order and democratic life. The leading organs of trade unions at all levels must strive to make their work more in-depth and more meticulous, and according to the principle of "facing the grassroots, facing production, and facing the masses," solve the problems that the workers and staff urgently need to solve in production and life in a planned and step-by-step manner.

For the working masses in capitalist enterprises, class education must be strengthened to make them clearly draw a line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and clearly recognize that the interests of the working masses in capitalist enterprises are completely consistent with the interests of the working masses in state-owned enterprises. The working class is indivisible, and the interests of the working class are also indivisible. The greatest interest of the working class is to realize socialism and communism. The conspiracies of some bourgeois elements who attempt to split the working class, incite the working masses against the state, and undermine the socialist cause must be ruthlessly exposed and opposed. The greatest interest and the greatest responsibility of the working masses in capitalist enterprises is to supervise capitalists to abide by the laws of the state and to help and urge capitalists to take the road of state capitalism. In capitalist enterprises, labor emulation should be subordinate to and serve socialist transformation, that is, through labor emulation, the leadership of the working class over capitalist enterprises should be strengthened.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and under the brilliant light of the Party's general line in the transition period, trade union organizations at all levels must closely unite the broad masses of workers and staff around the Party, and constantly improve their level of awareness, level of organization, technical level, and cultural level by various means. The strength of the working class is one of the important factors determining the speed of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country, and the improvement of the working class depends to a large extent on the work of trade unions. Therefore, let us say again, we must strengthen the work of trade unions, so that trade union work can play a huge role in the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation of the country.

    加强党对工会的领导，发挥工会在国家工业化中的巨大作用
    中华全国总工会主席  赖若愚
    由于中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导，由于苏联对我国的全面无私的援助，由于我国工人阶级和全国人民对于社会主义制度的无限景仰，我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业是一定要胜利的。社会主义、共产主义的美好前景，正鼓舞着我国工人阶级和全国人民循着国家过渡时期的总路线奋勇前进。
    然而这并不是说在胜利的道路上没有困难。相反的，社会主义建设和社会主义改造的过程，就是克服各种困难的过程，就是与各种反对和阻碍社会主义建设和社会主义改造的势力进行斗争的过程，而战斗的队伍，就是工人阶级和它的同盟者——农民。如果我们工人阶级的队伍是坚强的，工农联盟是巩固的，那么我们的事业就会是顺利的。社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业，要求工人阶级具有高度的政治觉悟和相当的技术水平与文化水平。
    我国工人阶级在中国共产党的领导下，和农民建立了巩固的联盟，对国内外反动派进行了数十年的英勇斗争，推翻了反动政权，取得了新民主主义革命的胜利，并且领导和团结全国人民，在短短三年中完成了恢复国民经济的任务，使我国进入了有计划的经济建设时期。但我们决不能以此自满。大体说来，我国工人阶级由于共产党的正确领导和长期革命斗争的实际锻炼，在政治上是坚强的。但是随着我国工业化的进展，大批非工人阶级的成员将不断进入工人阶级的队伍，而资产阶级对于社会主义改造的各种形式的反抗又必将继续进行，因而资产阶级思想对工人阶级的影响和腐蚀作用必然增加，这就要求我们继续提高工人阶级的政治思想水准，使他们在不断战胜资产阶级思想影响的过程中在政治上更加坚强起来。同时，还应当看到我国工人阶级在文化和生产技术方面，还是相当落后的；而建设我国的强大工业所需要的科学技术，对于我们是新东西；我们的技术干部和技术工人还很少；广大工人群众的文化水平还很低。如果不逐渐改变这种落后现象，就会妨碍我们工业生产状况的迅速改进。
    我国工人阶级的上述弱点，固然不会从根本上阻挠我国取得社会主义建设和社会主义改造的胜利，但是它对于我们前进的速度却是有重大影响的。而从各个方面来说，加强建设的速度，对我们是十分重要和迫切需要的。我们必须抓紧时间，必须以尽可能快的速度前进。只要这种速度是我们力所能及的，那么它就不应被看作冒进。
    为了加快我们社会主义事业的进展速度，工人阶级就必须有高度的政治觉悟和相当的技术水平与文化水平。如果广大的工人群众具有高度的政治觉悟，那么他们在社会主义建设事业中，就会发挥高度的积极性，表现出像在革命斗争时期所表现的英雄气概；他们在和资产阶级进行联合和斗争当中，就会站稳立场，表现出坚定和机警；他们对于农民就会予以诚恳的帮助，以自己的努力来巩固工农联盟。如果广大的工人群众具有相当的技术水平和文化水平，那么他们就具备了进行社会主义建设事业的本领。能够这样，我们社会主义工业化的前进速度就会是比较快的。
    为此目的，党必须加强对工会工作的领导。工会是“千百万群众的教育者”，“它是一个学校，是一个行政的学校，一个管理的学校，一个共产主义的学校。”（列宁：论职工会、目前形势及托洛茨基底错误）“不是‘一方面是学校，另一方面是别的东西’，而是从各方面来看，……职工会是学校。”（列宁：再论职工会、目前形势及托洛茨基与布哈林底错误）。工会必须充分地发挥它的“学校”的作用。
    工会怎样来发挥它的“学校”的作用呢？工会的“学校”的作用是表现在工会工作的一切方面的，而最重要的则是表现在生产方面，即劳动竞赛方面。劳动竞赛是社会主义建设的基本方法，同时它本身就是一种共产主义的实践。当一九一九年苏联第一次出现了作为一种劳动竞赛形式的“共产主义义务星期六”的时候，列宁就予以极大的重视。列宁说：“当一般普通工人起来克服极大困难，奋不顾身地设法增加劳动生产率，设法保护每一普特粮食、煤、铁及其他产品，这些产品不是归劳动者本人及其‘近亲’所有，而是归他们的‘远亲’，即归全社会所有，归千百万起初联合为一个社会主义国家，然后又联合为苏维埃共和国联盟的人们所有，——这也就是共产主义开始了的时候。”（列宁：伟大的创举）劳动竞赛正是以这种共产主义的精神来培育工人群众的。当劳动竞赛成为工人群众的经常的劳动方式的时候，就可以逐步地把工人群众引导到社会主义、共产主义的水平，就可以逐步地克服在工人群众中间依然存在着的许多非工人阶级思想，而我们的建设事业也就会以越来越快的速度前进。
    通过劳动竞赛，不但可以在政治上、思想上提高群众，而且可以在生产技术方面提高群众，因为与劳动竞赛紧密联系着的是群众的生产会议、合理化建议和先进经验的推广。四年以来的经验也指明了，通过群众的劳动竞赛，生产技术的改革和工人技术水平的提高是迅速的。
    “在俄国，只有那些善于逐渐吸引最落后的劳动阶层参加自觉地改善国民经济工作的职工会，才是真正的共产主义的学校”。一九二一年三月联共第十次代表大会“关于职工会的作用与任务之决议”中的这些话，对于我们也是适用的。善于组织劳动竞赛的工会，才是真正的共产主义的学校。当然，除了组织劳动竞赛而外，工会还必须采取各种方式（业余学校、讲座、座谈会、研究会等等）协同企业行政和青年团，来组织群众的技术学习和文化学习，并在党委的统一领导下，组织群众的业余政治学习。
    工会还必须根据集体主义的原则，来组织和改进职工群众的物质、文化生活，把共产主义精神灌输到群众的日常生活中去。每一个工会工作者，对于生产事业（工人阶级的长远利益）要深切地关怀，同时对于群众的日常生活（当前利益）也应该深切地关怀。为了群众的当前利益而损害长远利益是错误的，经济主义是必须反对的，可是只看到长远利益而无视于应该而又可能解决的当前的生活问题也是错误的。自从反对了某些工会工作者的经济主义思想以来，一部分工会工作者中间，又滋生了一种不关心或不敢关心群众生活的现象，这是值得注意的。必须了解，只要是“在发展生产的基础上，根据需要与可能的原则来改善群众的生活”，而不是离开劳动生产率的提高、离开需要与可能而片面地谈改善生活，那就不是经济主义。斯大林“在第一次全苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者会议上的演说”中提到斯达汉诺夫运动的根源的时候，说：“成为斯达汉诺夫运动基本原因的，首先就是工人物质状况底根本改善。生活好些了，同志们。生活快乐些了。生活既然快乐，工作也就来得有劲。于是也就有高度的出产额。于是也就有劳动英雄，——男英雄，女英雄。斯达汉诺夫运动底根源，首先就在这里。”由此可见，不采取必要的措施来逐步地改善工人群众的生活，对生产也是不利的，即对工人阶级的长远利益也是不利的，因而是错误的。
    在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业中，工会的责任是重大的。当然，几年以来工会工作是有成绩的，它吸引了一千多万职工参加了工会组织，它对广大职工群众进行了一系列的教育，它发动广大职工群众积极地参加了国民经济的恢复与企业的民主改革。可是也必须指出，在工会工作中，还存在着许多缺点和问题。一般说来，过去几年的工会工作，是着重在企业民主改革方面的工作，它习惯于政治性的运动，还没有把自己的一切工作都切实转上正常的生产轨道，工作中还存在着某种混乱状态。因此，工会要担负起自己的重大责任，就必须继续加强自己的思想建设与组织建设，继续以党在过渡时期的总路线和中国工会第七次全国代表大会的各项决议来教育干部和群众；继续推广五三工厂及其它工矿企业工会工作的先进经验，把各项工作切实根据生产的需要（劳动竞赛的需要）加以安排，切实加强小组工作，培养大批积极分子，开展群众性的批评与自我批评，建立正常的工作秩序和民主生活。工会的各级领导机关，必须努力使自己的工作更加深入、更加细致，根据“面向基层、面向生产、面向群众”的方针，有计划有步骤地解决职工群众在生产中和生活中迫切需要解决的问题。
    对于资本主义企业中的工人群众，必须加强阶级教育，使他们明确地划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，明确地认识资本主义企业中的工人群众的利益和国营企业中的工人群众的利益是完全一致的。工人阶级是不可分割的，工人阶级的利益也是不可分割的。工人阶级的最大利益就是实现社会主义和共产主义。对于某些资产阶级分子企图分裂工人阶级、挑拨工人群众与国家的关系以破坏社会主义事业的阴谋诡计，必须予以无情的揭穿和反对。资本主义企业中的工人群众的最大利益也是最大责任，就是监督资本家遵守国家的法令，帮助和督促资本家走国家资本主义的道路。在资本主义企业中，应使劳动竞赛服从于并服务于社会主义改造，即通过劳动竞赛，要加强工人阶级对于资本主义企业的领导。
    在中国共产党的领导之下，在党的过渡时期的总路线的光辉照耀之下，工会各级组织，必须紧密地把广大职工群众团结在党的周围，并以各种办法来不断地提高他们的觉悟程度、组织程度和技术水平、文化水平。工人阶级的坚强程度，是决定我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造速度的重要因素之一，而工人阶级的提高在很大程度上是有赖于工会工作的。因此，让我们再说一次，必须加强工会工作，使工会工作在国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业中发挥巨大的作用。
