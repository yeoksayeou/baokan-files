    Sichuan Province: Various regions are closely integrating production with the establishment and expansion of agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    Sichuan Province will establish 412 agricultural producers' cooperatives before the spring plowing this year, and the original 46 agricultural producers' cooperatives will generally be expanded. In order to ensure that both production and the establishment/expansion of cooperatives are carried out without hindering each other, most regions have put forward slogans such as "do a good job in production to welcome the establishment or expansion of cooperatives" based on their local conditions. In Suining, Jiangjin, and other special districts, the water in the winter fallow fields is very shallow, and the water in the existing ponds and weirs is insufficient. Local agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams are leading the masses of farmers to first pay attention to repairing water conservancy facilities. The original agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams preparing to establish cooperatives in Xinfan, Wenjiang, Meishan, Fushun, Zizhong, and other places are all paying attention to strengthening field management of spring crops. When the Xinmin Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xinfan County and the Li Kaizhen Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Nanbu County began to expand, they paid attention to publicizing the general line and the significance and role of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives, mobilizing cooperative members to do a good job in production, and driving farmers preparing to join the cooperatives to create conditions for joining. Under the impetus of the Xinmin Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, all the farmers in the village actively carried out activities such as replanting seedlings, applying fertilizer, and processing the land. The Yue Shuiqing Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Qinggang Village, Bishan County, did not pay enough attention to combining cooperative expansion with production at the beginning. After the problem was discovered, they immediately conducted inspection and correction, and proposed taking doing a good job in production as a condition for cooperative expansion, driving all the farmers in the village to work intensively on weeding wheat, applying top dressing, and controlling rice borers. In addition, 83 households planted early-maturing crops. In the process of establishing a cooperative, the Diao Zhongchi mutual aid team in Ciyun Township, Jiangjin County, in order to ensure that the land of the entire cooperative would not suffer from drought, has newly built a weir, and is currently carrying out the renovation of a large pond and the rerouting of a river weir. Under this influence, 90 percent of the spring crop fields in the entire township have been weeded twice, and 60 percent of the spring crop fields have been top-dressed twice.

    四川省各地在建社工作中注意结合生产
    四川省各地紧密结合生产进行农业生产合作社的建立和扩大工作。
    四川省在今年春耕前将建立四百一十二个农业生产合作社，原有的四十六个农业生产合作社一般也要扩大。为了使生产和建社、扩社两不误，各地大多根据当地情况提出了搞好生产迎接建社或扩社的口号。遂宁、江津等专区的冬闲田里关水很浅，原有塘堰的水不够用，当地农业生产合作社和互助组便带动农民群众首先注意与修水利。新繁、温江、眉山、富顺、资中等地原有的农业生产合作社和准备建社的互助组都注意加强对小春作物的田间管理。新繁县新民村农业生产合作社和南部县李开珍农业生产合作社在开始扩社时，就注意宣传总路线和建立农业生产合作社的意义和作用，发动社员搞好生产，带动准备入社的农民创造入社条件。在新民村农业生产合作社的带动下，全村农民都积极进行补苗、施肥、土地加工等活动。璧山县青杠村岳水清农业生产合作社在开始扩社时没有很好注意和生产结合，发现后随即进行检查和纠正，提出以搞好生产为扩社条件，带动全村农民紧张进行薅麦子、施追肥和治螟等工作，还有八十三户农民种了早熟作物。江津县慈云乡刁仲篪互助组在建社过程中，为保证全社土地不受干旱，已新修了一条堰，并正进行一口大塘的培修和一条河堰的改道工作。在这一影响下，全乡随即有百分之九十的小春田薅了二道草，百分之六十的小春田施了二道追肥。
