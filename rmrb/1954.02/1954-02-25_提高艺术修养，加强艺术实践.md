Regular Concerts

Xinhua News Agency reports: The Central Conservatory of Music, East China Branch, held its first regular concert of 1954 at the Shanghai Art Theater from February 12th to 14th. The purpose of this performance is to strengthen artistic practice and allow more excellent musical works to meet the public regularly. The institute has decided to gradually increase performances of Chinese instrumental music and Chinese songs in the future, and to hold regular concerts every two weeks.

The music concert featured piano solos, vocal solos, cello solos, and violin solos, including works by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Schubert, and others. There was also "Yan River Ballad," developed and processed by Liu Shiying, a third-year student in the Composition Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, East China Branch, based on the Shaanxi folk song "Yan River Folk Rhyme," and "Korean Folk Song Theme," adapted by Wang Lisan, a second-year student in the Composition Department of the institute, based on the Korean folk song "Doraji."

Musical Groups Perform in Factories

Recently, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture organized the Tianjin Workers' Music Troupe, the New Song Chorus, the Tianjin Chinese Music Research Association, the Tianjin People's Radio Station Quyi Broadcasting Troupe, the Tianjin People's Art Theater Song and Dance Troupe, the Music Department of Hebei Normal College, the Central Conservatory of Music, the Soviet Music Chorus, the No. 3 Middle School of the city, and the Girls' No. 2 Middle School Chorus, totaling more than 300 people, to form the "Tianjin Municipal Music Groups Joint Performance Troupe." They rehearsed programs for two song and dance evenings, including chorus, solo singing, duet singing, instrumental performances, and folk dances. Since December 1953, they have toured performances at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill, the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Mill, the state-owned Tianjin No. 5 Cotton Mill, the Tianjin Paper Mill, the Textile Machinery Factory, and the state-owned 712 Factory. They performed more than ten shows, with more than 13,000 spectators. This performance has had a direct and significant impact on the development of factory song and dance activities, boosting workers' interest in participating in song and dance activities and their enthusiasm for production labor. This performance also laid the foundation for future factory performances, making the direction and tasks of some municipal amateur music groups clearer. The members felt that serving the workers and serving production and construction was a glorious task. This performance also focused on listening to the opinions of workers. The workers' most liked performances were those with healthy emotions, simplicity, beauty, and lyricism. Those performances that expressed personal feelings and self-appreciation were not welcomed by the workers.

Meeting Between Actors and Audience

The entire cast of the drama "Julius Fucik," performed by the Chongqing Municipal Literary and Art Troupe, held a meeting with the audience on January 30th. The audience consisted of labor models, young workers, students, government cadres, primary school teachers, and Young Pioneer instructors from Chongqing. This meeting was organized by the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. Liao Bokang, Deputy Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, called on the youth at the meeting to learn from Fucik's great example of revolutionary heroism and become shock troops in the country's transition to socialism.

When the actors stepped off the stage and met with the audience, enthusiastic applause resounded everywhere. The audience left their seats, crowded the aisles, and surrounded the actors to talk. The audience intimately cared about the actors' lives and work, inquired about the process of creating the roles, and cared about the actors' health. The actors listened to the audience's opinions, answered the questions raised by the audience, sang the "Partisan Song" from the play that the audience liked, and performed the dances from the play. When the actor representatives spoke on the stage, they all thanked the audience for their care with excited hearts, believing that this was the happiest day for the actors.

This kind of meeting between actors and the audience strengthens the connection between actors and the audience, which is beneficial to both actors and the audience. (Shi Man)

Graduation of the Cantonese Opera Actors' Amateur Training Class

The Cantonese Opera Actors' Amateur Training Class, sponsored by the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture, started in mid-September last year and completed all political and professional courses by the beginning of January this year. The young artists who participated in this study, after lectures, discussions, and internships, further realized the impact of imperialism and feudalism on Cantonese opera, attached importance to learning and carrying forward the excellent heritage of national opera, straightened out their artistic thoughts, and clarified the importance of hard study and hard training. During the study period, the students rarely asked for leave or were absent. Some troupes rushed back to Guangzhou early to attend classes even when they were performing near their hometown. The lecturers also repeatedly studied and prepared lessons, sparing no effort. The old artists and famous actors who participated in the teaching work performed various old stage arrangements that had long been lost even more conscientiously. The training class graduated on January 31st.

At the graduation ceremony, Huang Ningying, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Opera Reform Committee, Ding Bo, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture, old artist Dou Piyu, and famous actors Wen Juefei and Lang Junyu all spoke, pointing out that the training class was the beginning of long-term and serious study in the future.

At the same time as the graduation ceremony, an oath-taking ceremony was held to join the League. Cantonese opera young actors Xiao Mulan and Chen Daowei swore to join the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. (Li Yi)

    提高艺术修养，加强艺术实践
    经常音乐会
    中央音乐学院华东分院二月十二日到十四日在上海艺术剧场举行了一九五四年第一次经常音乐会。这种演出的目的是为了加强艺术实践，使更多优秀的音乐作品能经常和群众见面。该院已决定今后逐步增加有关中国器乐和中国歌曲的演出，并每隔两星期举行一次经常音乐会。
    这次音乐会演出的有钢琴独奏、独唱、大提琴独奏、小提琴独奏，节目内容有巴哈、贝多芬、萧邦、舒伯特等人的作品，还有中央音乐学院华东分院作曲系三年级学生刘世瑛根据陕西民歌延水民谣发展加工的“延水谣”，该院作曲系二年级学生汪立三根据朝鲜民歌“刀拉基”改编的“朝鲜民歌主题”等。　（据新华社讯）
    音乐团体下厂演唱
    天津市文化事业管理局最近组织了天津市工人音乐团、新歌合唱团、天津中国音乐研究会及天津市人民电台曲艺广播团、天津人民艺术剧院歌舞团、河北师范学院音乐系、中央音乐学院、苏联音乐合唱团、市三中、女二中合唱团共三百余人，组成了“天津市音乐团体联合演出团”，排练出两个歌舞晚会的节目，内容包括合唱、独唱、对口唱、器乐演奏及民间舞蹈等节目。自一九五三年十二月起，在国营天津第一棉纺织厂、国营天津第三棉纺织厂、国营天津第五棉纺织厂、天津造纸总厂、纺织机械厂和国营七一二厂巡回演出。共演出十余场，观众一万三千余人。这次演出对工厂的歌舞活动的开展直接影响很大，鼓起了工人参加歌舞活动的兴趣和生产劳动热情。这次演出，也为今后的下厂演出工作打下了基础，使市级的一些业余音乐团体的方针任务更加明确起来，团员们都感到为工人服务，为生产建设服务是光荣的任务。这次演出还着重听取了工人同志的意见，工人最喜欢的是情感健康的、朴实的、优美抒情的演唱，那些以抒发个人感情，自我欣赏的演唱，是不受工人欢迎的。
    演员和观众的见面会
    重庆市文艺工作团演出的话剧“尤利斯·伏契克”的全体演员们，在一月三十日举行了和观众见面的大会，见面的对象是重庆市的劳动模范、青年工人、学生、机关干部、小学教师和少年先锋队辅导员等。这次见面会，是由青年团重庆市委员会组织的。青年团重庆市委副书记廖伯康在会上号召青年们学习伏契克革命英雄主义的伟大榜样，在祖国向社会主义过渡中，成为一个突击队员。
    当演员们走下舞台和观众普遍见面的时候，到处响起了兴奋热烈的掌声。观众们离开了自己的位子，拥塞了夹道，围拥着演员们交谈；观众们亲切地关怀着演员们的生活和工作，询问着创造角色的经过，关心着演员们身体的健康。演员们听取了观众的意见，答复了观众们所提出的问题，唱了为观众们所喜爱的剧中的“游击队员之歌”，表演剧中的舞蹈。演员代表们在台上讲话时，都以激动的心情感谢观众们对于演员的爱护，认为这是演员们最快乐的一天。
    这种演员和观众的见面会，加强了演员和观众的联系，对演员和观众，都有益处。　（石曼）
    粤剧演员业余讲习班结业
    广州市文化局主办的粤剧演员业余讲习班，自去年九月中旬开课后，至今年一月初止，已学完了政治、业务的全部课程。参加此次学习的青年艺人，经过讲授、讨论和实习后，更加认识了帝国主义、封建主义思想对粤剧的影响，重视了学习和发扬民族戏曲的优秀遗产，端正了艺术思想，明确了苦学苦练的重要性。学员们在学习期间不但绝少请假、缺席，有些剧团在近乡演出，也一早赶路回广州听课。讲师们也反复研究备课，不辞辛劳，参加教学工作的老艺人和名演员更认真表演各种久已湮没的旧排场。讲习班已于一月三十一日结业。
    在结业典礼大会上，广东省、广州市戏曲改革委员会副主任委员黄寗婴、广州市文化局副局长丁波、老艺人豆皮元、名演员文觉非、郎筠玉等都讲了话，指出讲习班是今后长期认真学习的开端。
    在举行结业礼典的同时，举行了入团宣誓大会，粤剧青年演员小木兰、陈道薇等宣誓加入中国新民主主义青年团。　（李峄）
