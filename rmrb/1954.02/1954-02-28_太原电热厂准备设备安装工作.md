To meet the electricity needs of industry in the Taiyuan area, the newly built Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant has decided to start generating some electricity around the time of the October Revolution Day this year, sending an amount of electricity equivalent to one-half of Taiyuan's existing electricity. This year, the Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant has a large equipment installation task, with the installation task accounting for about 60% of the total investment. Workers will have to install several thousand tons of machinery, lay huge ash removal pipelines of 3,000 meters, and complete riveting work of 3,000 tons. These huge installation tasks have very strict technical requirements. It is expected that installation can begin in May, trial operation can begin in October, and electricity can be generated around the time of the October Revolution Day. The entire installation time is only more than five months.

After analyzing the characteristics of the project, the Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to seize the time to do a good job in preparing for equipment installation. At present, technicians are compiling equipment installation plans under the guidance of Soviet experts. More than 900 metal installation workers have been transferred to the construction site from all over the country, and more than 900 more are arriving one after another. According to the construction situation, the plant has formed seven site organizations: boiler, steam turbine, motor, hardware, machine repair, lifting, and pipe. The installation planning team was established as early as January 27. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, it will formulate installation progress, materials, tools, labor allocation, technical guidance, and measures plans for each site by the end of February. The draft plan stipulates that the organizational installation method will be implemented during installation, with continuous installation in three shifts, day and night. In terms of installation operations, civil engineering balanced operation will be implemented. Installation will begin before the completion of civil engineering construction, building houses while installing machines. In order to expand mechanical construction, various mechanical equipment are being rapidly assembled. A 25-ton crane and a 50-ton bridge crane have been transported to the construction site. 180 sets of pipe cutting machines, pipe cutting machines, steam hammers, and various lathes for construction have been transported to the construction site. An oxygen distribution station, an acetylene station, and an air compression station have been established at the steam turbine site. Workers at the electrical site are erecting and repairing circuits to solve the problem of electricity consumption for installation, and have prepared installation equipment such as motors, water supply pumps, and grinding doors.

Now, workers are leveling the ground for the huge cranes, and boiler workers are carefully inspecting the new Soviet boilers. The workers are determined to actively improve their skills and strive to realize the plan to generate some electricity around the time of the October Revolution Day this year.

    太原电热厂准备设备安装工作
    【本报讯】新建太原电热厂为满足太原地区工业用电的需要，决定提前在今年十月革命节前后开始部分发电，发送的电量相当于太原现有电力的二分之一。今年太原电热厂的设备安装任务很大，安装任务约占全部投资的百分之六十。工人们要安好数千吨机器，铺设巨大的除灰管道三千公尺，铆焊工作量达三千吨。这些巨大的安装工作，技术要求非常严格，预计五月份可开始安装，十月份开始试运转，十月革命节前后发电，全部安装时间只有五个多月。
    中共太原电热厂委员会分析了工程特点以后，决定争取时间做好设备安装前的准备工作。目前，技术人员们正在苏联专家指导下，编制设备安装计划，九百余名金属安装工人已从全国各地调来工地，还有九百多人正陆续到达。根据施工情况，该厂组成了锅炉、汽机、电机、五金、机修、起重、管子等七个工地机构。安装计划小组早在一月二十七日就成立了，在苏联专家指导下，将在二月底作出安装进度、材料、工具、劳力配备、技术指导和各工地的措施计划。计划草案中规定，安装时实行组织安装法，三班连续安装，昼夜不停。在安装作业上，实行土木平衡作业，在土木建设未完工前，就开始安装，边盖房，边安装机器。为扩大机械施工，现正迅速调集各种机械设备。二十五吨吊车和五十吨桥式行车已经运到工地，施工用的切管机、割管机，汽锤、各式车床已有一百八十部运到工地。汽机工地成立了氧气分配站、乙炔站、空气压缩站。电气工地的工人正架修电路，解决安装用电问题，并准备了电动机、给水泵、研磨门等安装设备。
    现在，工人们正为巨大的行车铲平地面，锅炉工人正精细地检修苏联新式锅炉。工人们决心积极提高技术，为实现在今年十月革命节前后部分发电的计划而奋斗。
