To adapt to national construction and meet the needs of urban and rural material exchange, the Southwest region has undertaken large-scale transportation construction. In 1953, the investment in transportation construction in the Southwest region accounted for 30% of the region's total national economic investment in 1952. This included: continuing the construction of one new railway line, surveying and designing one railway line, building twenty-three new highways, restoring three, reconstructing one, surveying, designing, and reconnaissance thirteen, and building some local post roads, dredging a small number of inland rivers. By the end of 1953, most of these construction projects had been completed ahead of schedule or on time. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway was laid to Zhongba three days ahead of the original plan, and 165 kilometers had been laid northwards from Chengdu. The middle section of the Kangding-Tibet Highway has been completed westward from Qamdo, 416 kilometers ahead of schedule. The region's local highways completed 95.7% of the annual plan, and the six Guizhou highway projects transferred from 1952 were fully opened to traffic before the fourth quarter of last year. In 1953, the region completed the construction of more than 2,000 kilometers of highways. The surveying and design work for railways and highways also completed the original plan.

With the increase in the mileage of highways opened to traffic, the volume of highway freight transportation is also increasing. In 1953, the volume of automobile freight turnover increased by approximately 117% compared to 1952. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is expected to handle more than 200,000 tons of freight in 1954.

The development of transportation has brought great benefits to the people in remote mountainous areas. After the Kunming-Luohe Highway was opened to traffic to Simao, the price level in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province decreased by 3% to 8%. After the Weining-Shuicheng Highway in western Guizhou was opened to traffic, the cost of salt transportation along the route was reduced by 25%, and the local Yi people were able to eat cheap salt.

According to the construction guidelines of the First Five-Year Plan, the basic construction of transportation in the Southwest region in 1954 will still be carried out steadily and with emphasis. This year, the total investment will still account for more than 30% of the region's total national economic investment, and the construction projects will be more concentrated. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway will continue to be laid northward, the Chengdu-Kunming Railway will continue to be surveyed and designed, and the Kangding-Tibet Highway will continue to be constructed eastward from Lhasa and westward from Qamdo, facing each other. Several highways in Yunnan will also continue to be built southward. In order to cooperate with the urgent needs of industrial construction, Guizhou will also selectively reconstruct the Guiyang-Jinchengjiang Highway; Sichuan will also renovate some highways. At present, the transportation construction departments throughout the region are transferring construction teams and carrying out construction preparation work to meet this year's heavy construction and surveying and design tasks.

    适应国家建设需要、密切城乡联系
    西南区交通建设获得显著成就
    为了适应国家建设，满足城乡物资交流的需要，西南区进行了规模巨大的交通建设。西南区一九五三年交通建设的投资额为一九五二年全区整个国民经济投资总数的百分之三十。计：继续新建铁路一条，测量设计铁路一条，新建公路二十三条，恢复三条，改建一条，测量、设计、踏勘十三条，并新建部分地方驿道，疏浚少数内河。这些建设项目至一九五三年底止，大部分都已提前或按时完成。宝成铁路较原计划提前三天铺到中坝，由成都向北已铺筑了一百六十五公里。康藏公路中段已自昌都向西提前修通四百一十六公里。地方公路全区完成年度计划的百分之九十五点七，贵州六条一九五二年接转公路工程，在去年第四季度前已完全通车。全区一九五三年共修通公路二千多公里。铁路、公路的测量、设计工作也都完成了原订计划。
    随着公路通车里程的增加，公路运输的货运量也在增加。一九五三年汽车货运转量比一九五二年增加了约百分之一百一十七。宝成铁路一九五四年即将担负二十万吨以上的货运量。
    交通运输事业的发达，给偏僻的山区群众带来了很大的好处。昆洛公路通车到思茅后，云南西双版纳傣族自治区物价降低了百分之三到百分之八；贵州西部的威（宁）水（城）公路通车后，沿路食盐运费降低了成本百分之二十五，当地彝族人民吃到了廉价的食盐。
    根据第一个五年计划的建设方针，一九五四年西南区的交通基本建设仍将稳步地有重点地进行，今年投资总额仍占全区整个国民经济投资的百分之三十以上，而建设项目更加集中。宝成铁路将继续向北铺筑，成昆铁路继续进行测量设计，康藏公路将由拉萨向东、昌都向西继续相向施工。云南的几条公路也将继续向南修建。为了配合工业建设的迫切需要，贵州还将择要改建贵阳到金城江线公路；四川也将对部分公路进行整修。目前全区交通建设部门正在转移施工队伍，进行施工准备工作，以迎接今年繁重的施工及测量设计任务。
