Report on Nine Villages in Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong
Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee

Editor's note: From early October to mid-December last year, the Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Committees of the CPC in the Northeast Region dispatched a large number of cadres to conduct relatively in-depth and comprehensive rural surveys in forty-two villages in sixteen counties throughout the region. This further clarified the economic situation in the countryside and greatly helped in carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture in the countryside. Now, we are publishing the "Investigation Report on Nine Villages in Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong" by the Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee for reference by various localities.

Beginning in mid-October 1953, we conducted surveys in Nongfeng, Tianmao, and Jinbu villages in Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province; Xinxing, Xin'an, and Xinzao villages in Yongji County, Jilin Province; and Sitaizi, Guantun, and Beilitun villages in Gaiping County, Liaodong Province for more than a month with the assistance of the local Party committees. Shuangcheng is an old area, while Yongji and Gaiping are areas that were liberated later. Among the nine villages, one is an advanced work village, five are general villages (two of which are upper-middle level villages locally), and three are weak villages. From the perspective of the entire Northeast region, the work level of most villages in the survey is relatively low.

  I. The Development Status of the Rural Economy and
     Class Changes

In terms of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and supply and marketing and credit cooperation: the number of households organized in the nine villages accounted for 63.5% of the total number of agricultural households, an increase of 6.5% compared with 1952. Among them, the three villages in Shuangcheng accounted for 80.2% of the total number of agricultural households, the three villages in Yongji accounted for 57.6%, and the three villages in Gaiping accounted for 40.6%. There are five agricultural production cooperatives, with participating farmers accounting for 3.5% of the total number of agricultural households; 69 permanent teams accounting for 31.8% of the organized households; 57 major seasonal teams accounting for 32.3%; and 147 temporary teams accounting for 30.5%. Four of the five agricultural production cooperatives were successfully piloted, and one did not do well. The four successful agricultural production cooperatives significantly increased grain production, and with government support or member fundraising, they added production materials, accumulated more fertilizer, had larger sideline income, and made better preparations for production in 1954, thus establishing a clear banner among the broad masses of farmers.

The supply and marketing cooperatives in the nine villages all have a relatively solid foundation, organizing an average of 78.2% of the farmers, with capital increasing by 12% compared with 1952, and sales increasing by 9%. More than 70% of farmers' production and living materials and product sales are conducted through the supply and marketing cooperatives. Another approximately 10% is sold directly to state-owned commercial enterprises. The activities of capitalist commerce in these rural areas have been basically eliminated. What remains are mostly speculative small traders or handicraft workshops in markets and towns or among farmers. In the three villages of Shuangcheng, their operating proportion is less than 10%, while in the several villages of Yongji and Gaiping, it accounts for about 20%. The rest is mutual exchange among farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives in four villages have credit departments, absorbing deposits of 9.8 million yuan. With the support of the state bank, they have lent out 70,000 jin of grain, 83,000 bean cakes, 35 draft horses, 19 carts, 21,500 jin of seeds, 14,200 jin of horse feed, 700 jin of chemical fertilizer, and 60,000 jin of grain straw in three quarters. They have played a certain role in developing agricultural production, supporting poor farmers, consolidating mutual aid and cooperation, and combating usury. In terms of agricultural production: the cultivated area has increased by 4.4% compared with before liberation. Due to disaster and poor harvest in 1953, the average yield per hectare (15 mu) was 2,867 jin, 17.7% lower than in 1952, but still exceeded the highest annual yield during the pseudo-Manchukuo period before liberation by about 10%. The area of commodity grain and industrial raw material crops has also increased. The area of crops such as soybeans, wheat, cotton, hemp, and sugar beets in each village is all above 40%. In the three villages of Gaiping, the cotton field area has slightly decreased, and the orchard area has been increasing year by year. Sideline production has also developed. According to statistics from six villages, the average sideline income of farmers accounts for 9.9% of the total income, an increase of 1.6% compared with 1952. The purchasing power of farmers has also increased. The average purchasing power of the eight villages has increased by 12.2% compared with 1952, with an average of 540,000 yuan per person in 1952 and 600,000 yuan in 1953, with the proportion used to purchase production materials accounting for 30%, an increase of about 7% compared with 1952. The total number of draft animals, vehicles, and farm tools in the nine villages has generally increased, with a total of 1,972 draft animals, an increase of 83; 531 vehicles, an increase of 51; and 2,090 farm tools, an increase of 54. Among them, due to some deviations in the implementation of policies in Sitaizi in Gaiping and Xinzao in Yongji in 1952, the enthusiasm of some farmers for individual production was somewhat dampened, and the number of draft animals slightly decreased. In Tianmao Village in Shuangcheng, some farmers changed horses to oxen, so the number of mules and horses slightly decreased, and the number of oxen increased. In 1952, there were a total of 212 mules and horses and 16 oxen. In 1953, the number of mules and horses decreased to 209, and the number of oxen increased to 46. However, good teams and cooperatives have seen significant increases in vehicles, horses, and farm tools, and there are also various types of new farm tools. In addition, due to the increasing number of farmers entering industrial and mining enterprises, the labor force in the nine villages has decreased.

With the development of mutual aid and cooperation, varying degrees of agricultural technology reform have been carried out in each village. The area for promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience in eight villages averaged 14.3%, with an average increase of 5 to 10 dou of grain per hectare. Among them, the area promoted in Nongfeng Village reached 43% of the total cultivated area, with an average increase of about 15 dou of grain per hectare. At the same time, four sets of horse-drawn farm tools were promoted. The land cultivated with these farm tools increased production by an average of about 30% per hectare. Therefore, it effectively educated the farmers and created conditions for continuing to promote technological reforms in 1954, and also proved that under the current circumstances, agricultural production still has great potential.

Along with the development of the agricultural economy, class relations have also undergone new changes. The average proportion of middle peasants in the nine villages accounts for 69% of the total number of agricultural households (of which prosperous middle peasants account for 15.2% of the total number of agricultural households), poor peasants account for 29.4%, new rich peasants account for 1.2%, and hired laborers account for 0.3%. Among them, in the advanced village (Nongfeng Village, Shuangcheng), middle peasants account for an average of 78.7% of the total number of agricultural households, an increase of 13.3% compared with 1950 (of which prosperous middle peasants account for 23.6% of the total number of agricultural households, an increase of 16.4% compared with 1950), and poor peasants account for 21.3%, a decrease of 13.3% compared with 1950. In the five general villages, middle peasants account for 70.1% of the total number of agricultural households, an increase of 11.3% compared with 1950 (of which prosperous middle peasants account for 16.8%, an increase of 9.8% compared with 1950), poor peasants account for 28.5%, a decrease of 11.5% compared with 1950, and new rich peasants account for 1.2%. In the three weak villages, middle peasants account for 64.1% of the total number of agricultural households, an increase of 8.1% compared with 1950 (of which prosperous middle peasants account for 10.2%, an increase of 5.7% compared with 1950), poor peasants account for 33.7%, a decrease of 9.1% compared with 1950, and new rich peasants account for 1.7%, an increase of 1.2%.

Middle peasants are well-fed and warmly clothed in their lives. Their common thought is: "This foundation is very thin, it is not easy to build this foundation. If it collapses, it will be difficult to recover, and we have to work hard." Therefore, most of them participated in mutual aid and cooperation and are diligent and active, but they are afraid of taking risks and damaging their families' assets.

Prosperous middle peasants have complete means of production and have enough to eat and wear. Most of them also participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Among them, 66.9% of households have no exploitation, and only 33.1% have slight exploitation. Most of them have become wealthy through mutual aid and cooperation, becoming wealthy farmers on the new road, and some have become the backbone of mutual aid and cooperation. This type of person is more numerous in villages with a stronger foundation of mutual aid and cooperation. Another considerable portion cannot meet their desire to expand production because mutual aid teams have not been upgraded in a timely manner, and they are wavering within the teams. There are also a small number of prosperous middle peasants who are working independently, wholeheartedly taking the old road, striving to break free from any constraints and restrictions, and developing exploitative operations openly or secretly. Some people call these people the "vanguards" of the old road.

The lives of poor peasants have also improved compared to the past. The vast majority do not have vehicles or horses. Except for those in good mutual aid teams and cooperatives, their cultivation is often not timely, they lack manure, and they produce 1 to 1.5 shi less grain per hectare. Households lacking grain account for about 7% of the total number of agricultural households in the nine villages. They are not only economically weak, but also politically discriminated against in most villages, facing difficulties in joining teams and being excluded in mutual aid teams. They are pessimistic and passive in their thinking, and some have impatient emotions due to long-term poverty and frustration.

Hired laborers are a very small minority. There are only eight households in the nine villages. Half are outsiders without land. The rest mainly earn income by selling monthly or odd jobs, and they cultivate a small amount of land themselves.

There are a total of 36 new rich peasant households in the nine villages, of which 19 have been continuously exploiting for more than three years and are relatively established. Most of them hire a large number of temporary workers to operate the land, engage in usury, and a few pull rubber-wheeled carts for hire and engage in commerce. Some people are beginning not to prioritize agriculture, believing that speculation and exploitation earn more money and "come faster." Therefore, some farmers still admire them very much. Some comrades in Jilin said: "Wherever there is a new rich peasant in a village, a small 'flagpole' is erected." They are in sharp opposition to mutual aid and cooperation and are suspicious and wary of the Party and the People's Government. They often win over a small number of backward prosperous middle peasants, create public opinion, and spread dissatisfaction with the Party and the People's Government.

From the above, it can be seen that: (1) In the development of the rural economy, the leading role is played by the socialist state-owned economy and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production and supply, marketing and credit under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. The development and changes of this movement affect and determine the development and changes of various economic components and aspects in the countryside; (2) The emergence of agricultural production cooperatives has established a clear banner for the development of the small-scale peasant economy towards a new road of common prosperity, driving the development and improvement of a large number of labor mutual aid organizations with socialist budding nature, and forming the basic force for developing agricultural production; (3) The spontaneous trend of the small-scale peasant economy blindly developing towards capitalism has also grown more than before. Although the rich peasant economy is not large in number, it still has a certain influence or attraction among farmers;
(4) Therefore, it can also be seen in these villages that the main contradiction in the current rural economic development is the contradiction between the mutual aid and cooperation movement led by the Party and the spontaneous trend of the small-scale peasant economy. The main aspect or leading force of the contradiction is the mutual aid and cooperation movement led by the Party. However, we cannot ignore that the spontaneous trend of the small-scale peasant economy has both "vanguards" and
"flagpoles." The old road is not just empty talk.

  II. The Situation and Problems in the Rural
      Cooperativization Movement

Mutual aid and cooperation and supply, marketing, and credit cooperation have all developed and improved in the nine villages.

The advanced village with stronger work - Nongfeng Village in Shuangcheng, all farmers in the village have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations. There is one agricultural production cooperative in the village, with the number of households joining the cooperative accounting for 7.9% of the total number of households in the village; eleven permanent teams, with the number of participating households accounting for 76.3% of the total number of households in the village; and the remaining households are organized into three major seasonal teams and one temporary team. Recently, three teams are preparing to establish cooperatives, which have already been fully discussed.

The five agricultural production cooperatives, because the leading cadres are strong and the land and draft animals are collectively used, there are no disputes in the order of cultivation; new farm tools have been used to varying degrees, and some have also replaced good carts and horses, and technological reforms have been carried out smoothly, thereby significantly increasing grain production. The average output of the three cooperatives is more than 20% higher than that of the mutual aid teams in the same village (of which the Majigui Cooperative in Nongfeng Village averaged 1.5 shi more grain per hectare), and after deducting public grain, horse feed, seeds, and public accumulation funds, each labor day received 35 jin of grain. Each person averaged 160 labor days. Among the cooperative members, except for a few wealthy households with exploitative income before joining the cooperative, those with particularly weak labor or too much absenteeism, their income is more than in previous years. Cooperative members are happy, and farmers outside the cooperative are envious. Some mutual aid teams are eager to try, and some farmers directly request to join the cooperative. People who originally thought that cooperation was "society" (socialism) and would "average" or "pile up" have now begun to bottom out and gradually dispel their doubts. Therefore, it effectively drove the mutual aid teams, and with the development of supply, marketing, and credit cooperation, spontaneous forces were greatly weakened, and the small number of wealthy farmers who were obsessed with exploitative operations have begun to lose their appeal, and they themselves feel dishonorable. However, the three better cooperatives still have some problems: poor planning, more idleness, the contracting method of organizing labor is not reasonable enough, and there is a phenomenon of egalitarianism in calculating labor. The political work system has not yet been established, and there are some chaotic phenomena in production and management and financial and accounting systems. There are still some contradictions in the distribution of labor fruits between cooperative members who own more or less land and means of production.

Mutual aid teams also received great tests and training in the production of 1953. Most permanent teams implemented the methods of dividing help, frequent rotation, fast shoveling, and fast weeding in the case of heavy rain and thick grass, achieving relatively mutually beneficial and fair results. The quality of cultivation and the amount of harvest were mostly better than individual households. On the other hand, mutual aid teams also carried out fierce struggles with spontaneous forces inside and outside the team. Wealthy farmers outside the team hired workers at high prices and quickly shoveled and weeded, which had a great impact on the mutual aid teams. Most teams adjusted labor prices in a timely manner and strengthened education for team members, thus consolidating their position. However, some mutual aid teams with weak leadership excluded poor farmers when inserting into teams, and after inserting into teams, they rotated poor farmers to the back in cultivation, so some teams "scattered flowers" and "cracked". Some wealthy farmers in some mutual aid teams increasingly felt that they could not meet their desire to expand production within the team. Some were half-hearted in the team; some "messed around" and "snatched the lead" in the team; and some simply withdrew to work independently, or won over a small number of poor team members and pulled them out to form small groups, which were actually disguised forms of hired labor, or mixed in with low-level teams that were almost the same as individual work, and worked "happily", developed quickly, and "spreading" more and more. The more this happened, the more the erosion and disintegration effect on the mutual aid team was enhanced. In the five general villages, this situation has begun to appear. Although the mutual aid and cooperation movement has a certain foundation here, it still needs to be greatly developed, rectified, and improved. First, the mutual aid teams with a better foundation should be upgraded to agricultural production cooperatives in a timely manner, and various types of mutual aid teams should be further rectified and strengthened, so as to consolidate and develop the existing positions and their leading position. Because the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is weak in the three weak villages, it is necessary to carry out solid work, make good examples, and vigorously improve low-level teams in order to reverse the backward situation.

In terms of the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation, the existing problems are: except for Nongfeng Village, there is a tendency of drift to varying degrees. Cooperatives are mostly "contracted by a few experts" and have not yet been listed as the main regular work topics of the county and district Party committees. In addition, many leading cadres of teams and cooperatives have some practices that are divorced from the masses, such as: "Everything must be big when doing things", "Everything must be advanced", and instead of adopting gradual transformation and improvement methods for low-level teams and old habits, they require cumbersome manpower exchange, mutual aid in everything, and so on. Therefore, only by earnestly overcoming these shortcomings can the mutual aid and cooperation movement be smoothly accelerated forward.

Supply and marketing cooperatives have been overcoming the tendency of suppressing grades and prices, corruption, waste, and simply pursuing profits to varying degrees in the past year, and have been further improved. The number of supplies of farmers' production and living materials has increased compared to before, and the variety of goods has generally increased by more than 100 kinds; the relationship with the members of the cooperative, the relationship with the higher-level cooperatives, and the relationship with state-owned commercial enterprises have all become closer than before. The existing problems are: the leading cadres of the cooperatives in several villages all have varying degrees of conservative and backward thinking, their mass viewpoint is not strong, bureaucratic styles are growing, they are divorced from the leadership of the branch, they do not investigate the needs of the members of the cooperative, they do not pay attention to planning, they do not accept advanced experience, and their management level is very low, most of them lose money, and they often run out of stock. In addition, it is necessary to overcome the county and district Party committees' attitude of only managing production and not managing supply and marketing, or to varying degrees, their attitude of neglecting commerce, and strengthen leadership, so as to improve the ideological awareness and business ability of the leaders and staff of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives.

The credit cooperation organizations in the four villages were all newly established in 1953. Although they lack experience, they have all established a certain prestige among the masses. The main problems currently existing are: the district and village leaders do not sufficiently recognize the important significance of credit cooperation, relax leadership, do not provide enough support and publicity for credit cooperation, and the masses still have some concerns. The credit departments of the four supply and marketing cooperatives lose money due to small business, and at the same time, due to the unclear direction and policies, they only face wealthy farmers in absorbing deposits, instead of relying on the broad masses of farmers, and there are shortcomings of egalitarianism in lending. Therefore, credit cooperation is currently a relatively weak link in the rural cooperativization movement. The existing credit cooperation organizations need to be earnestly consolidated and improved, and those that do not have them should be actively developed and constructed. You can start by promoting the method of establishing credit groups within teams and cooperatives, and if conditions permit, you can also directly establish credit cooperatives.

  III. The Situation of Grassroots Leadership

After the three district committees and the eight village branches underwent Party rectification, promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience, and learning of the Central Committee's "Resolution on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Agricultural Production" and other three major documents, their leadership work has improved, the phenomena of coercion, commandism, and violation of laws and regulations have been basically corrected, the leadership of mutual aid and cooperation has been strengthened compared to before, they have also paid attention to learning production technology, and thus their connection with the masses has become closer than before.

The advanced branch with stronger work, such as the Nongfeng Village branch in Shuangcheng, not only grasped the center of production and mutual aid and cooperation year-round in its leadership work, but also began to learn the working methods of the mass line, that is, the backbone taking the lead, participating in leading production, making good examples, promoting the general, cultivating activists, leading the masses, consulting with old farmers, learning production technology, and so on; they also paid attention to the combination of mutual aid and cooperation, technical increase in production, and ideological education. In this way, the mutual aid and cooperation movement occupied a consolidated position, socialist factors are growing rapidly, and capitalist factors are gradually weakening.

The leadership work of the branches in the five general villages has also improved. However, since summer hoeing, they have shown varying degrees of spontaneous drift, which has become the main deviation in their work. In the case of the growth of the spontaneous forces of the small-scale peasant economy, spontaneous drift is "supported" and "legal". When spontaneous drift comes, some farmers praise "life is passable". Spontaneous forces have begun to erode a small number of Party cadres. Some Party members are not actively participating in mutual aid and cooperation due to family involvement, and their class consciousness, boundaries, and direction are gradually blurring. Individual members are beginning to degenerate and deteriorate, thus weakening and dissolving the Party's combat and unity forces. Although the ideological awareness of most Party members has been further improved after Party rectification, and they are active and willing to work hard in mutual aid and cooperation, they receive little education in the midst of tense production, and therefore some people are frustrated and passive because the contradictions and difficulties within the team have not been resolved in a timely manner. Here, it can be clearly seen that the spontaneous forces of the small-scale peasant economy erode the Party's grassroots leadership and promote its spontaneous drift, and spontaneous drift in turn facilitates the growth of spontaneous forces.

In the three weak villages, one does not have a Party branch, and the regime is impure; the two have always had a backward work foundation, and the backbone force is weak. These are all the results of the county and district's long-term abandonment of leadership.

But regardless of whether it is in general villages or weak villages, most of the backbone Party members have a certain political awareness, and there are a considerable number of activists in the mutual aid teams and youth and women's organizations. Most farmers also have the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation. The current central issue is to strengthen leadership and overcome the tendency of spontaneous drift.

The common problems of the eight village branches are the lack of a normal collective leadership system and Party life, the failure to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and everything is done by the Party, government, youth, and women as a whole. Party members, mass representatives, and activists are mixed together. If this continues to develop, the fortress role of the branch will be further weakened.

The improvements and existing deviations in the work of the eight village branches are inseparable from the leadership of the county and district Party committees. In the past year, the county and district Party committees have firmly grasped the center of production, led the broad masses of farmers to fight against natural disasters, and cultivated advanced models and banners in developing and improving mutual aid and cooperation and technical increase in production. These are the basic aspects. The problem is that in the objective aspect, there are few backbones, and there is a large turnover; in agricultural production, there are many natural disasters, and it is difficult to cope with them. These have increased the difficulty of leadership work and are also one of the reasons for "grasping points and abandoning the surface". In the subjective aspect, it is that in their leadership thinking, they have not clearly seen that the main contradiction in the current countryside is the contradiction between the cooperativization movement led by the Party and the spontaneous trend of the small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, they cannot constantly, consciously, and correctly implement policies such as consolidating and improving mutual aid and cooperation, especially the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives, and restricting rich peasant exploitation. For branch work, there is a relaxation in ideological construction and organizational construction, and there is no due consolidation work for the results of Party rectification, and the phenomenon of the Party not managing the Party still exists. At the same time, some counties and districts are still satisfied with the ideological education given to Party members during Party rectification and lack vigilance against the erosion of grassroots organizations by spontaneous forces. From this, it can be concluded that to promote rural cooperativization, develop agricultural production, make the broad masses of farmers richer, and increase the production of more commercial grain for the country, the decisive factor is to give play to the leading role of the Party.

The propaganda and education work of the Party's general line and general task during the transition period has begun in these places, and everyone's eyes are brighter. Coupled with the rich experience of hard work over the past year, we believe that the work of the three counties and their subordinate districts and villages will be greatly improved in the future.

    松江、吉林和辽东九个村的调查报告
    中共中央东北局农村工作部
    编者按：中共中央东北局和中共东北区各省省委的农村工作部，从去年十月上旬到十二月中旬，抽调了大批干部，在全区十六个县的四十二个村进行了比较深入的全面的农村调查，进一步摸清了农村的经济情况，对于在农村进行农业的社会主义改造工作有很大帮助。现在把中共中央东北局农村工作部关于“松江、吉林和辽东九个村的调查报告”发表出来，供各地参考。
    从一九五三年十月中旬开始，我们在松江省双城县的农丰、田茂、进步三村，吉林省永吉县新兴、新安、新造三村和辽东省盖平县四台子、官屯、北李屯三村，在当地党委协助下，分别地进行了一个多月的调查。双城是老区，永吉、盖平都是解放较晚地区。九个村当中，一个工作先进村，五个一般村（其中两个在当地属中上等村），三个薄弱村。从东北全区来看，调查中的多数村工作水平偏低。
      一、农村经济的发展状况和
          阶级变化
    在农业生产的互助合作和供销、信用合作方面：九个村组织起来的户数占总农户的百分之六十三点五，比一九五二年增加百分之六点五。其中双城三村占总农户的百分之八十点二，永吉三村占百分之五十七点六，盖平三村占百分之四十点六。其中有五个农业生产合作社，入社农民占总农户的百分之三点五；六十九个常年组占组织起来农户的百分之三十一点八；五十七个三大季组占百分之三十二点三；一百四十七个临时组占百分之三十点五。五个农业生产合作社四个试办成功，有一个没办好。四个农业生产合作社都显著地多打了粮食，并由政府扶助或社员集资增添了生产资料，积肥较多，副业收入较大，并且给一九五四年的生产做了较好的准备，因而在广大农民当中树立了鲜明的旗帜。
    九个村的供销合作都有比较巩固的基础，组织了平均百分之七十八点二的农民，资金较一九五二年增加了百分之十二，供销额增加了百分之九。农民生产、生活资料及产品推销的百分之七十以上都通过供销社。另有百分之十左右直接销售于国营商业。资本主义商业在这些农村里的活动已基本被排除，剩下来的多是集、镇或农民中间的投机小贩或手工作坊，其经营比重，在双城三村不到百分之十，在永吉和盖平数村约占百分之二十左右。其余为农民中间的互相串换。四个村的供销合作社设有信用部，吸收存款九千八百万元。在国家银行支持之下，三个季度借出粮食七万斤，豆饼八万三千片，耕马三十五匹，大车十九辆，种籽二万一千五百斤，马料一万四千二百斤，化学肥料七百斤，谷草六万斤。对发展农业生产，扶助贫困农民，巩固互助合作，打击高利贷等方面，都起到一定作用。在农业生产方面：耕地面积较解放前增加百分之四点四。一九五三年因灾歉收，每垧（十五市亩）产量平均为二千八百六十七斤，低于一九五二年百分之十七点七，但较解放前伪满时期最高年产量仍超过百分之十左右。商品粮和工业原料作物面积也有增加。各村大豆、小麦、棉、麻、甜菜等作物面积都在百分之四十以上。盖平三村，棉田略有减少，果树面积逐年增大。副业生产也有发展，六个村的统计，农民副业收入平均占总收入的百分之九点九，较一九五二年增加百分之一点六。农民购买力也有提高，八个村平均较一九五二年提高百分之十二点二，计一九五二年每人平均为五十四万元，一九五三年为六十万元，用于购买生产资料者占百分之三十，较一九五二年增多百分之七左右。九个村的耕畜、车辆、农具总的看来都有增加，计耕畜一千九百七十二匹（头），较一九五二年增加八十三匹（头）；车辆五百三十一台，增加五十一台；农具二千零九十件，增加五十四件。其中盖平四台子、永吉新造两村因一九五二年执行政策有若干偏差，部分农民个体生产的积极性受到一些挫伤，耕畜略有减少。双城田茂村部分农户将马变牛，因而骡马略有减少，耕牛增加，一九五二年骡马共计二百一十二匹，牛十六头，一九五三年骡马减少为二百零九匹，牛增至四十六头。但凡好组、好社车马农具皆有显著增长，并且还有各类新式农具。另外由于农民进入工、矿企业者逐年增多，九个村的劳动力都有减少。
    随着互助合作的发展，各村都进行了不同程度的农业技术改革。八个村推广肇源丰产经验的面积平均为百分之十四点三，每垧平均多打五斗至一石粮，其中农丰村推广面积达总耕地面积的百分之四十三，每垧平均多打一石五斗左右粮食。同时推广了四套马拉农具。用这些农具耕种的地平均每垧增产百分之三十左右。因此，有效地教育了农民，并为一九五四年继续推广技术改革工作创造了条件，也证明在目前情况下，农业生产仍有很大潜力。
    与农业经济发展同时，阶级关系也有新的变化。九个村平均中农占总农户的百分之六十九（其中富裕中农占总农户的百分之十五点二），贫农占百分之二十九点四，新富农占百分之一点二，雇农占百分之零点三。其中先进村（双城农丰村）中农平均占总农户的百分之七十八点七，较一九五○年增加百分之十三点三（其中富裕中农占总农户的百分之二十三点六，较一九五○年增加百分之十六点四），贫农占百分之二十一点三，较一九五○年减少百分之十三点三。五个一般村，中农占总农户百分之七十点一，较一九五○年增加百分之十一点三（其中富裕中农占百分之十六点八，较一九五○年增加百分之九点八），贫农占百分之二十八点五，较一九五○年减少百分之十一点五，新富农占百分之一点二。三个薄弱村，中农占总农户的百分之六十四点一，较一九五○年增加百分之八点一（其中富裕中农占百分之十点二，较一九五○年增加百分之五点七），贫农占百分之三十三点七，较一九五○年减少百分之九点一，新富农占百分之一点七，较一九五○年增加百分一点二。
    中农，在生活上吃得饱，穿得暖。他们共同的思想是：“这点底子挺薄，打下这个底子不易，如若垮下去了，一时爬不起来，还得使劲干。”因此多数参加了互助合作并勤劳积极，但害怕搞冒了伤家底子。
    富裕中农，生产资料齐全，吃穿有余，多数也参加在互助合作组织当中。他们中间有百分之六十六点九的户并无剥削，只有百分之三十三点一有轻微剥削。他们大部经由互助合作发家，成为走新道路的富裕农民，有的成为互助合作中的骨干分子。这类人在互助合作基础较强的村为数较多。另有相当部分因互助组未能适时提高，不能满足其扩大生产的愿望，在组内表现摇摆不定。还有少数单干的富裕中农，一心走旧道路，力求挣脱任何束缚限制，公开地或隐避地在发展剥削经营。有人把这些人叫做走旧道路的“排头”。
    贫农，在生活上也较过去提高。绝大多数没有车马，除在好的互助组和合作社里的以外，耕作多不应时，缺粪，每垧地少打一石到一石五斗粮，多数够吃不够穿。缺粮户占九个村总农户的百分之七左右。他们不仅经济地位低，在多数村里，政治上也受歧视，入组时有困难，在互助组里受排斥，思想上表现消极、悲观，有些人因长期贫困、蹩气，有急躁情绪。
    雇农，是极少数。九个村一共只有八户。一半是外来户，没有土地。其余都以卖月工、零工为主要收入，自耕少量土地。
    新富农，九个村共三十六户，其中十九户已连续剥削三年以上，较为定型。多数雇用大量零工经营土地，兼放高利贷，少数拴胶皮车拉脚，兼营商业。有些人开始不以农业为重，认为投机、剥削赚钱多，“来的快”。因而有些农民对他们还很羡慕。吉林有的同志说：“哪个村有新富农，哪里也就竖起了一根小小的‘旗杆’”。他们与互助合作尖锐对立，对党和人民政府猜疑、戒备。时常拉拢少数落后的富裕中农，制造舆论，散放对党和人民政府的不满情绪。
    从以上可以看出：（一）在农村经济的发展当中，起主导作用的是在社会主义性质的国营经济的支持和党与人民政府领导之下的农业生产和供销、信用的互助合作运动，这一运动的发展变化，影响与决定着农村中各种经济成分和各个方面的发展变化；（二）农业生产合作社的出现，为个体分散的小农经济向大家富裕的新道路发展中，树立了鲜明的旗帜，带动着大量的带有社会主义萌芽性质的劳动互助组织的发展和提高，并组成为发展农业生产的基本部队；（三）小农经济盲目地向资本主义发展的自发趋势较前也有滋长，富农经济虽然数量不大，但在农民中间还有着一定的影响或吸引力；
  （四）因此，在这些村里，同样可以看出：当前农村经济发展中的主要矛盾是党所领导的互助合作运动和小农经济的自发趋势之间的矛盾。矛盾的主要方面或主导力量是党所领导的互助合作运动。但不能忽视小农经济的自发趋势既有“排头”，又有
  “旗杆”。旧道路也不是一句空话。
    二、农村合作化运动中的情况
          和问题
    九个村互助合作和供销、信用合作都有发展和提高。
    工作较强的先进村——双城农丰村全村农民都参加了互助合作组织。全村有一个农业生产合作社，入社户数占全村户数百分之七点九；十一个常年组，参加户数占全村户数百分之七十六点三；其余户都组织在三个三大季组和一个临时组内。最近有三个组准备建社，已经酝酿成熟。
    五个农业生产合作社，四个社都因领导骨干较强，土地、耕畜集体使用，在耕作先后上没有争执；多少不同地使用了新式农具，有的还换了好车好马，顺利地进行了技术改革，从而显著地多打了粮食。三个社的产量平均高于本屯互助组百分之二十以上（其中农丰村马吉贵合作社每垧平均多打一石五斗粮），扣除公粮、马料、种籽、公积金外，每个劳动日分得三十五斤粮。每人平均做了一百六十个劳动日。在社员当中除少数入社前有剥削收入的富裕户、劳力特别弱或误工太多者外，收入都多于往年。社员欢喜，社外农民羡慕。有的互助组跃跃欲试，有些农民直接要求入社。原以为合作就是“社会”（社会主义），就要“平均”或“归大堆”的人，现在也开始托底，逐渐地解除了疑虑。因此，有效地带动了互助组，加上供销、信用合作的开展，自发势力大大地被削弱，少数迷恋于剥削经营的富裕农民已开始呼唤不灵，自己也觉得不体面。但三个较好的合作社也还存在一些问题：计划性差，窝工较多，在组织劳动上的包工办法还不够合理，在计算劳动上，有平均主义的现象。政治工作制度还没有建立起来，生产经营和财、会制度上都存在若干混乱现象。占有土地、生产资料较多与较少的社员在劳动果实的分配上，还存在一些矛盾。
    互助组，在一九五三年的生产当中也受到很大的考验和锻炼，多数常年组在雨多草厚的情况下，实行了分帮、勤轮、快铲、快?的方法，做到比较两利公平，耕作质量和收获量多数也比单干户好。另方面，互助组也和组内、外的自发势力进行了激烈的斗争。组外富裕农民高价雇工，铲?迅速，对互助组影响很大。多数组适时地调整了工价，加强了对组员的教育，因而巩固下来。但有一些领导不强的互助组，在插组时排斥贫困农民，插组后在耕作上把贫困农民轮在后面，部分组因而“散花”“裂纹”。有些互助组内有的富裕农民日益觉得在组内不能满足扩大生产的愿望。有的在组内是三心二意；有的在组“胡搅蛮缠”、“耍尖抢头”；有的就干脆退出单干，或者拉拢少数贫困组员，拉出去自成小组，实际上是变相雇佣劳动，或者混在和单干相差无几的低级组里，干得“欢”，发展快，“铺派”越来越大。而越是这样，对互助组的侵蚀、瓦解作用也就越加增强。在五个一般村里，这种情况都开始显现。在这里互助合作运动虽有一定基础，但还需大力进行发展、整顿和提高。首先把基础较好的互助组适时地提高成为农业生产合作社，并进一步整顿加强各类互助组，这样才能巩固、发展已有的阵地和自己的主导地位。三个薄弱村因互助合作基础微弱，必须进行踏实的工作，搞好样子，大力提高低级组，才能扭转落后局面。
    在互助合作的领导工作方面，存在的问题是：除农丰村外，程度不同地都有自流的偏向。对于合作社多是少数“专家包办”，还没有列为县、区党委主要的经常的工作议题。另外，不少组、社的领导干部都有一些脱离群众的做法，如：“要办都要大”，“要搞就高级”，对低级组、旧习惯，不是采取逐步改造、提高的方法，而是一律要求繁琐的人马换工、事事互助等等。因此，只有认真克服这些缺点，才能顺利地把互助合作运动加速地推向前进。
    供销合作社一年来都在不同的程度上克服了压等压价、贪污浪费和单纯追求利润的偏向，进一步地得到提高，对农民生产、生活资料的供应数量较前增多，商品品种一般的都增加一百多种；和社员群众的联系，和上级社及国营商业的关系都较前更加密切。存在的问题是：在几个村社的领导干部当中都存在着程度不同的保守落后思想，群众观点不强，机关、官办作风滋长，脱离支部领导，不调查社员需要，不重视计划，不接受先进经验，经营水平很低，多数赔钱，时常脱销。除此以外，克服县、区党委只管生产不管供销，或程度不同的轻商观点，加强领导，这样才能提高基层供销社领导及工作人员的思想觉悟和业务能力。
    四个村的信用合作组织，都是一九五三年新办，虽然经验不足，但都在群众中建立了一定的威信。目前存在的主要问题是：区、村领导对信用合作的重要意义认识不足，放松领导，对信用合作的支持和宣传作得不够，群众还有若干顾虑。四个供销社的信用部因业务小而赔钱，同时因对方针、政策还不明确，在吸收存款当中，单纯面向富裕农户，而不依靠广大农民，放款中则有平均主义的缺点。因此信用合作是目前农村合作化运动中较为薄弱的一环，已有的信用合作组织，还需认真加以巩固、提高，没有的应积极进行发展、建设，开始创办可推广在组、社内部建立信用小组的方法，有条件也可直接建立信用合作社。
    三、基层领导状况
    三个区委和八个村的支部经过整党、推广肇源经验和学习中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”等三大文件之后，领导工作都有改进，强迫命令和违法乱纪的现象基本上得到纠正，对互助合作的领导较前加强，也注意了学习生产技术，因而和群众的联系较前更加密切。
    工作较强的先进支部，如双城农丰村支部，在领导工作中不仅常年抓住了生产中心和互助合作，并且开始学会了群众路线的工作方法，这就是骨干带头、参加领导生产，搞好样子、推动一般，培养积极分子，带领群众，和老农商量，学习生产技术等等；还注意了互助合作、技术增产和思想教育三者的结合。这样，就使互助合作运动，占领了巩固的阵地，社会主义因素在迅速增长，资本主义因素则在逐渐削弱。
    五个一般村的支部的领导工作，也有提高。但自夏锄以来都显露了程度不同的自流的现象，成为工作中的主要偏向。在小农经济的自发势力滋长的情况下，自流是受“拥护”并且“合法”的。自流开来，有些农民就颂扬“日子得过”。自发势力已开始侵蚀着少数的党员干部，有的党员因家庭牵扯，不积极参加互助合作，阶级觉悟、界线、方向逐渐模糊起来，个别分子开始蜕化、变质，因而使党的战斗团结力量，松弛涣散下来。虽然多数党员经过整党后思想觉悟进一步得到提高，在互助合作当中积极肯干，但在紧张的生产当中，受教育很少，因而也有些人因为组内矛盾、困难未能适时得到解决而苦闷、消极下来。在这里可以清楚地看到：小农经济的自发势力侵蚀着党的基层领导并促其自流，而自流又便利了自发势力的滋长。
    三个薄弱村，一个没有党的支部，政权不纯；两个一向工作基础落后，骨干力量单薄，这都是县、区长期放弃领导的结果。
    但不管在一般村或薄弱村，多数的骨干党员都有一定的政治觉悟，在互助组和青年、妇女的组织当中，都有相当数量的积极分子，多数农民也都有互助合作的积极性，当前的中心问题是加强领导，克服自流偏向。
    八个村支部共同的问题是缺乏正常的集体领导制度和党内生活，批评和自我批评不开展，有事是党、政、青、妇一揽子来进行，党员和群众代表、积极分子溶化在一起，长此发展下去，支部的堡垒作用，将更加削弱。
    八个村支部在工作中的改进和存在的偏向都是和县、区党委的领导分不开的。县、区党委在一年当中，紧紧地掌握了生产中心，领导广大农民和自然灾害作斗争，在发展提高互助合作和技术增产方面，都培养了先进的典型和旗帜，这是基本的方面。问题是在客观方面，骨干少，流动大；在农业生产当中自然灾害较多，苦于应付。这都增加了领导工作的困难，也是造成“抓点扔面”的原因之一。主观方面，是在领导思想上，还没有清楚明确地看到当前农村中的主要矛盾是党所领导的合作化运动和小农经济的自发趋势之间的矛盾，因而对巩固、提高互助合作，特别是对发展农业生产合作社的工作和限制富农剥削等政策，不能够经常地、清醒地、正确地进行贯彻。对于支部工作，在思想建设和组织建设方面，都有放松，对整党成果没有进行应有的巩固工作，党不管党的现象依然存在。同时，有的县、区还满足于整党当中所给予党员的思想教育，对自发势力对基层组织的侵蚀，缺乏警惕。由此可以得出经验，要推行农村合作化，发展农业生产，使广大农民更加富裕并为国家增产更多的商品粮食，决定的因素是发挥党的领导作用。
    党在过渡时期的总路线、总任务的宣传教育工作，在这些地方已经开始，每个人的眼睛都更加明亮了，加上一年来艰苦工作的丰富经验，我们相信，三个县和所属区、村工作，今后将会大大提高一步。
