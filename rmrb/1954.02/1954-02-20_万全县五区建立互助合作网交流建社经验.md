    Wanquan County Fifth District Establishes Mutual Aid and Cooperation Network to Exchange Experiences in Building Cooperatives

    The Fifth District of Wanquan County, Hebei Province, with the Majiafang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative as its base, established a mutual aid and cooperation network to exchange experiences in building cooperatives, which has yielded great results.

    Affected by the increased production of the Majiafang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative last year and having studied the General Line, the farmers in various villages in the Fifth District of Wanquan County have been requesting to establish agricultural production cooperatives. Due to a lack of experience in running cooperatives, each village vied to invite cadres from the Majiafang Agricultural Production Cooperative to provide specific assistance. To solve this problem, He Xianshi, the county cadre stationed in this cooperative, led the farmers to establish a mutual aid and cooperation network with the Majiafang Agricultural Production Cooperative as its base. Representatives were selected from the cooperative-building farmers of five villages, including Majiafang, Shangyingfang, Shangyingtun, and Lijiafang, and Liang Zhilong, the deputy director of the Majiafang Agricultural Production Cooperative, was publicly elected to be in charge of the leadership. The mutual aid and cooperation network holds regular meetings to exchange experiences and promptly solve problems in the establishment of new cooperatives. For example, many households in Lijiafang Village agreed to establish a cooperative, but a few were still hesitant. After discussion and analysis, everyone believed that these households still had concerns, so they used the income distribution of the old cooperative to illustrate the benefits of joining the cooperative, helping these households solve their ideological problems. Each cooperative also introduced methods of clearing up people's thinking in propaganda and deliberation, to achieve the consent of the whole family. Representatives from Shangyingtun introduced methods of patiently persuading women and the elderly. After exchanging experiences with each other, everyone felt that they had found ways to conduct propaganda. In addition, it was found at the meeting that some mutual aid teams were unwilling to absorb households with difficulties when transitioning to cooperatives. The Shangyingtun Agricultural Production Cooperative introduced their method of reversing this kind of thinking among the members. For example, in the eighteen households they organized, Cao Yong had a large deficit because his father died, and he lacked food after joining the cooperative. Some people were unwilling to let him join the cooperative. The cooperative cadres led everyone to study the General Line and conducted education on unity and fraternity, making everyone realize the principle that everyone should turn over together and everyone should prosper together. Everyone expressed that they could not let Cao Yong sell land, borrow money, or become a hired worker because of his current difficulties, so as to achieve unity in production.

    Everyone believes that the mutual aid and cooperation network is very good and can learn the methods of running cooperatives in a timely manner, thereby enhancing their confidence in running cooperatives.

    万全县五区建立互助合作网交流建社经验
    河北省万全县五区，以马家房村农业生产合作社为基点，建立了互助合作网，互相交流建社经验，收效很大。
    万全县五区各村农民受了去年马家房村农业生产合作社增产的影响，又学习了总路线，纷纷要求成立农业生产合作社。因为缺少办社经验；各村都争着请马家房农业生产合作社的干部去具体帮助。为解决这个问题，住在这社的县干部何贤仕，就领导农民以马家房农业生产合作社为基点，建立了一个互助合作网，由马家房、上营房、上营屯、李家房等五个村的建社农民选派代表参加，公推马家房农业生产合作社副社长梁志龙负责领导。互助合作网定期开会，交流经验，及时解决建立新社当中的问题。如李家房村许多户都同意办社了，可是还有几户犹豫不定。经过大家研究分析，认为这些户还有顾虑，就应用旧社的收益分配情况来说明入社的好处，帮助这几户解决了思想问题。各社还介绍了在宣传酝酿中打通群众思想，作到全家同意的方法。上营屯的代表介绍了耐心说服妇女和老年人的办法。经过互相交流经验，都觉得在宣传上有了办法。另外，在会上发现有的互助组转社时，不愿吸收有困难的户参加。上营屯农业生产合作社就介绍了他们扭转社员这种思想的办法，如他们组织的十八户中，曹勇因死了父亲，亏空挺大，入社后就缺吃的，有些人不愿让他入社。社里干部领导大家学习了总路线，又进行了团结友爱的教育，使大家认识了要翻身大家都翻身，要富裕都富裕的道理，都表示不能让曹勇为眼下这点困难卖地、借债或当雇工，作到了团结生产。
    大家都认为互助合作网很好，能够及时学到办社的办法，增强了办社信心。
