    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 26th: A grand mass rally was held in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, on February 21st to commemorate "Colonial Youth Day." The meeting was presided over by Rizwanullah. Speakers at the meeting included Mubarak Sharga, Secretary of the Pakistan Socialist Party, and prominent Karachi figures Sakir Meshadi and Mumod Usmani.
    The speakers condemned the Turkish-Pakistan agreement, saying that this agreement "is not beneficial to Pakistan or other Islamic countries." They reminded the Pakistani people that this alliance was formed at the behest of the United States—for its own interests. This alliance will bring enslavement and destruction, not peace. During the meeting, the crowd enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Down with the US-Pakistan Treaty" and "Down with the Turkish-Pakistan Treaty."
    The resolution condemning these treaties, passed by the meeting, pointed out that Asian and African countries "should have the right to decide their own future without being influenced by foreign political or military forces." The meeting also expressed strong support for the struggle of colonial youth against imperialism and colonialism.
    On the same day, a mass rally attended by 50,000 people was held in Dhaka, East Pakistan, to commemorate the second anniversary of the Dhaka student martyrdom (a bloody incident occurred at that time because the police opened fire on the Dhaka student parade). Participants in the meeting held anti-American signs, and many people denounced the US-Pakistan "military aid" agreement in their speeches. Before the meeting, a two-mile-long parade was held on the main streets of Dhaka. The marchers held various signs and flags condemning the planned US-Pakistan military treaty.
    Maulana Abdul Hamid Bhashani, leader of the East Pakistan People's Islamic League and chairman of the conference, stressed in his speech that the united strength of the people can shatter this alliance.

    巴基斯坦人民反对美巴条约和土巴协定
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】二月二十一日，巴基斯坦首都喀喇蚩举行盛大的群众集会，纪念“殖民地青年日”。会议由里兹瓦努拉主持。在会上发表演说的有：巴基斯坦社会党书记穆巴拉克·沙迦，和喀喇蚩著名人士萨基尔·麦沙迪、穆莫德·乌斯马尼。
    演说者谴责土巴协定说：这个协定“无论是对巴基斯坦，或是对其他回教国家都没有好处”。他们提醒巴基斯坦人民说：这个联盟是在美国——为了它自己的利益——的命令下缔结的。这个联盟将带来奴役与毁灭，而不是和平。会议进程中，群众热烈地呼喊着“打倒美巴条约”、“打倒土巴条约”的口号。
    会议通过的谴责这些条约的决议指出：亚洲和非洲国家“应该得到权利来决定它们自己的未来，而不受外国的政治或军事力量的影响”。会议同时表示强力支持殖民地青年反对帝国主义与殖民主义的斗争。
    同天在东巴基斯坦的达卡举行了一个有五万人参加的群众大会，纪念达卡学生殉难两周年（当时因警察向达卡学生游行行列开火而发生流血事件）。会议的参加者拿着反美的标语牌，许多人在发表演说中指责美巴“军事援助”协定。会前，在达卡的主要街道上举行了行列长达二英里的大游行，游行者手执各种各样的标语牌与旗帜，谴责在策划中的美巴军事条约。
    大会主席东巴基斯坦人民回教联盟领袖毛拉纳·阿卜杜勒·哈密德·巴沙尼在致词中强调指出：人民的联合力量是能够粉碎这种联盟的。
