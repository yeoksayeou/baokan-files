Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th: The winter construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant project, one of the 141 key projects in China with the comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, is progressing rapidly. By the end of January, the main building, the largest in the plant, had basically completed its first layer of construction, and the brick walls around the four auxiliary plant buildings, including the coal pulverizer room and the material warehouse, had also been built several people high. Prior to this, from the start of construction in October last year to New Year's Day this year, thousands of workers used winter construction methods such as building warm sheds and lighting stoves to excavate more than 18,000 cubic meters of earth on the vast land, tie hundreds of tons of steel bars from more than five meters underground, and pour 3,000 cubic meters of cement, completing the foundation of the main building on schedule, and overfulfilling the foundation engineering of four auxiliary plant buildings. In January, all construction sites successively entered a tense phase of high-altitude work, and in the wind and snow, the workers skillfully built dozens of huge reinforced concrete pillars of the main building towards the sky. After inspection, more than 95% of all these projects have reached the specified quality standards, especially the quality of the foundation works hidden underground is very good and fully meets the design requirements.

The smooth progress of winter construction has laid a good foundation for the completion of this year's plant construction plan. By November this year, the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant will begin partial power generation. The plant's construction workers unanimously made this guarantee at the recent first workers' representative meeting. Due to the rapid increase in industrial electricity consumption in the Taiyuan area, the power generation capacity of existing power plants can no longer meet the needs of further development of industrial production and construction. Therefore, the earlier the new power plant is completed, the greater the significance for ensuring the expansion of industrial production and accelerating the pace of construction in the Taiyuan area.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th: The leadership of the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Committee has powerfully guaranteed the smooth progress of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant construction work.

Before the start of construction of this major project, the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Committee equipped the plant with a full set of cadres from the Party, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League, as well as the plant director, construction site director, and other main administrative responsible cadres. Because Taiyuan's industrial development is in urgent need of electricity, only a short time passed from the decision to construct the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant to its official commencement on October 24 last year. In order to effectively help the plant overcome the specific difficulties in manpower, materials, and technology in the construction preparation work, the Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Committee specially convened a meeting of Party member responsible cadres from all state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan, mobilizing all factories and mines to give full support to the new power plant by displaying a high degree of unity and mutual assistance. In the past three months, seven units, including the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the provincial and municipal construction companies, have transferred more than 700 skilled workers to the plant. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, the Mining Machinery Plant, and the Dongshan Coal Mine and other four units also promptly supported the winter construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant with machinery such as bulldozers, belt conveyors, cement mixers, and pneumatic picks.

After the start of winter construction, the Shanxi Provincial Committee promptly helped the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant establish a system of one-chief responsibility under the leadership of the Party Committee, established core leadership, and at the same time prompted the plant to quickly reorganize the construction organization. The General Branch Committee of the CPC in the Thermal Power Plant also sent more than 30 cadres to go deep into the construction site to strengthen political and ideological work, establish an inspection system for implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, and improve work order, which played a great role in the timely completion of the foundation of the main building. In order to lead the construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant in a timely and concrete manner, Tao Lujia, the First Secretary of the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee, and the Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee personally inspected the work on the construction site almost every week and presided over the meeting of responsible cadres of the plant, and promptly studied and resolved many problems. This in-depth leadership and cordial concern of the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Committee greatly inspired the construction enthusiasm of all employees.

    在中共山西省委和太原市委直接领导下
    新建太原电热厂工程冬季施工进展迅速
    【新华社太原十日电】苏联全面帮助我国建设的一百四十一项重点工程之一——太原电热厂工程冬季施工进展迅速。到一月底，全厂规模最大的主厂房已基本上完成了第一层建筑，碎煤机室、材料库等四个附属厂房周围的砖墙也已砌了好几人高。在此以前，从去年十月破土兴工到今年元旦，数千职工就用搭起暖棚，生上炉子等冬季施工方法，在广阔的土地上挖掉了一万八千多方土，从五公尺多深的地下绑扎起数百吨钢筋，浇灌好三千多立方公尺的水泥，按期完成了主厂房的基础工程，并超计划地完成了四项附属厂房的基础工程。一月份各个工地相继进入紧张的高空作业，在风雪中职工们把主厂房数十根巨大的钢筋水泥房柱巧妙地筑向高空。所有这些工程经过检查以后，百分之九十五以上都达到了规定的质量标准，特别是隐蔽在地下的基础工程质量很好，完全合乎设计要求。
    冬季施工的顺利进展，给今年建厂计划的完成打下了良好的基础。到今年十一月份，太原电热厂就将开始局部发电，建厂职工已在最近召开的首次职工代表会上一致提出了这个保证。由于太原地区工业用电量的迅速上涨，现有电厂的发电能力已不能满足工业生产建设进一步发展的需要。因此，新电厂的早一天建成，对于保证太原地区扩大工业生产和加快建设速度有着重大的意义。
    【新华社太原十日电】中共山西省委和太原市委的领导，有力地保证了太原电热厂建厂工作的顺利进行。
    在太原电热厂这一重大工程动工兴建以前，中共山西省委和太原市委就给该厂配备了全套的党、工会和青年团的干部，以及厂长、工地主任等主要行政负责干部。由于太原地区工业发展对于电力的需要很迫切，太原电热厂从决定施工到去年十月二十四日正式动工只经过很短的时间。山西省委和太原市委为了切实帮助该厂克服施工准备工作中的人力、物力和技术等方面的具体困难，曾专门召集了太原市所有国营、地方国营厂矿党员负责干部会议，动员各厂矿发挥高度团结互助的精神，给新电厂以全力的支援。三个多月来，太原钢铁厂和省、市建筑公司等七个单位就曾调给该厂七百多个技术工人。太原重型机器厂、矿山机器厂、东山煤矿等四个单位也以推土机、皮带运输机、水泥搅拌机、风镐等机械，及时支援太原电热厂的冬季施工。
    冬季施工开始后，山西省委又及时帮助太原电热厂建立党委领导下的一长负责制，树立了核心领导，同时促使该厂迅速整顿了施工机构。电热厂的中共总支委员会也派出三十多个干部深入工地加强政治思想工作，建立执行苏联专家建议的检查制度，改进工作秩序，对主厂房基础工程的按期完成起了很大作用。为了及时具体地领导太原电热厂的建厂工作，中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳和太原市委书记几乎每星期都亲自检查工地工作，主持该厂的负责干部会议，及时研究和解决了许多问题。中共山西省委和太原市委的这种深入的领导和亲切关怀，大大鼓舞了全体职工的建设热情。
