Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: Following the conclusion of grassroots election work in various districts within Beijing city in late January, grassroots election work in the suburbs began comprehensively in mid-February.

Over 3,000 cadres from municipal and district-level agencies, as well as township cadres, are participating in the suburban grassroots elections. Before the work began, Chai Zemin, Secretary-General of the Municipal Election Committee, delivered two mobilization reports to the cadres transferred from the city to the suburbs. The cadre training work in each district concluded on February 16th, and work groups were formed. Currently, each work group has arrived in various townships to fully launch the general election work.

The population in Beijing's suburbs mainly consists of farmers and factory and mine workers. The election committees of each district have paid attention to this characteristic, which differs from the city. Before the work groups went to the countryside, the election committee reminded cadres to ensure that the general election was closely integrated with production. At the same time, specific arrangements were made for the integration of the general election and production. All factories and mines conducting general elections have transferred responsible cadres to personally lead the grassroots election work. The Deputy Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Committee and the Chairman of the Trade Union of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Deputy Secretary of the General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party of the Shijingshan Power Plant are personally leading the general election work in their respective plants. Currently, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Shijingshan Power Plant have conducted mobilization among workers and their families. Factory and mine workers and the broad masses of farmers in the suburbs are welcoming the general election movement with great enthusiasm.

    北京市郊区各乡镇基层选举工作全面开始
    【新华社二十四日讯】北京市城内各区基层选举工作一月下旬结束后，二月中旬郊区的基层选举工作已全面开始。
    参加郊区基层选举工作的有市、区两级机关干部和乡干部共三千多人，工作开始前，市选举委员会秘书长柴泽民向从城内调往郊区的干部，做了两次动员报告。各区的训练干部工作于二月十六日先后结束，并编成工作组。目前各工作组已到达各乡、镇全面展开了普选工作。
    北京市郊区的人口主要是农民和厂矿职工。各区选举委员会都注意了这个和城内不同的特点。在工作组下乡前选举委员会就提醒干部注意普选必须密切结合生产进行；同时对普选和生产结合的问题作了具体安排。进行普选的各厂矿都抽调了负责干部亲自领导基层选举工作。石景山钢铁厂的中共党委员会副书记、工会副主席、石景山发电厂的中国共产党总支副书记都亲自领导本厂的普选工作。目前石景山钢铁厂和石景山发电厂都已在职工、家属中进行了动员。郊区各厂矿职工和广大农民正以极大的热情迎接普选运动。
