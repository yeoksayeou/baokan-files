    政务院第二零四次政务会议
    同意绥远省与内蒙古合并的报告
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府政务院在一月二十八日第二百零四次政务会议上，一致同意内蒙古自治区人民政府和绥远省人民政府提出的绥远省第一届第三次各界人民代表会议上通过的关于将绥远省划归内蒙古自治区并撤销绥远省建制的四项决议的报告，除报请中央人民政府委员会正式批准外，已命内蒙古自治区人民政府和绥远省人民政府遵照执行。绥远省第一届第三次各界人民代表会议的四项决议是：
    （一）绥远、内蒙古自治区合并，撤销绥远省建制，统一由内蒙古自治区人民政府领导。
    （二）改集宁专区为平地泉行政区，陕坝专区为河套行政区，并应结合普选于春季完成。平地泉行政区成立后除原辖丰镇、萨拉齐县、集宁、兴和、凉城、卓资、和林格尔、托克托县、武东、武川、清水河等十一县和平地泉一镇外，将土默特旗与东四旗亦划归该行政区管辖。河套行政区成立后除原辖五原、临河、安北、狼山四县和陕坝一镇外，杭锦后旗与达拉特后旗亦划归该行政区管辖，原伊盟驻陕坝办事处即行撤销。两行政区均为内蒙古自治区人民政府领导下的一级政权。
    （三）绥东旗县并存问题应结合普选即行解决，将绥东四旗改为三旗。取消陶林县建制，划陶林东部与集宁东北部为察哈尔右翼后旗（即原正红旗），陶林西南部与卓资县北部为察哈尔右翼中旗（即原镶蓝镶红联合旗），以原正黄旗为基础适当调整，改为察哈尔右翼前旗，并均划归平地泉行政区管辖。具体划界问题，由政府组成专门委员会处理。
    （四）伊克昭盟和乌兰察布盟自治区取消区域自治，成为内蒙古自治区人民政府领导下的一级政权，改称伊克昭盟人民政府和乌兰察布盟人民政府。
