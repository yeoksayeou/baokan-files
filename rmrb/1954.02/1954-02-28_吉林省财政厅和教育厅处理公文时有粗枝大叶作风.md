    Jilin Provincial Department of Finance and Education Department Show Careless Work Style in Handling Official Documents

    A letter from Ding Yi, Li Jingwen, and others of the Changling County People's Government, Jilin Province: On January 19th of this year, the Jilin Provincial People's Government's Department of Finance and Department of Education jointly issued a notice to their respective subordinate counties and cities' Finance and Education Sections regarding the "Expenditure Standard for Elementary Education Funds (Tentative) for 1954." While our county was studying this instruction, on the afternoon of January 28th, we received a telegram from the Provincial Department of Finance and Department of Education, stating: In the joint notice issued on January 19th, the item concerning union funds (i.e., wage subsidies), where 20 percent of the total wages of all school employees should be submitted to the union, should be changed from 20 percent to 2 percent. The telegram's wording was complex and lengthy, using three pages of telegram paper, totaling one hundred and fourteen characters; moreover, the telegram was sent to both the Education Section and the Finance Section. Judging from the original notice, it had gone through several layers of "drafting," "approval," "proofreading," "typing," and "sealing" by the two departments before it was issued, and there should have been no mistakes. But the reality was the opposite. This incident exposed the poor work style of certain staff members in the above-mentioned units, who were careless and hasty in handling official documents and signing and stamping them. This kind of work style not only brings trouble to the work below but also causes losses to state property.

### 吉林省财政厅和教育厅处理公文时有粗枝大叶作风

专栏：读者来信摘要

    吉林省财政厅和教育厅处理公文时有粗枝大叶作风
    吉林省长岭县人民政府丁一、李景文等来信：今年一月十九日吉林省人民政府财政厅和教育厅给所属各县、市财政科和文教科发下一个关于“一九五四年度小学教育经费（暂定）开支标准”的联合通知。当我县正在研究这个指示时，一月二十八日下午又接到省财政厅、教育厅的电报，内称：一月十九日所发联合通知中的工会经费（即工资补助费）按全校职工人数总工资百分之二十提交工会一项，应将百分之二十改为百分之二。电文字句繁复冗长，共用了电报纸三页，达一百一十四个字；而且这个电报给文教科和财政科各打了一封。从原通知上看，在这个通知发出之前，曾经过两个厅“拟办”、“批示”和“校对”、“打字”、“监印”等好几道层次，应该不会再有差错了。但事实却恰恰相反。这件事却暴露了上述单位某些工作人员在处理公文中粗枝大叶，草率签署盖章的不良作风。这种工作作风不仅给下边工作带来麻烦，而且造成了国家财产的损失。
