Actively Subscribe to National Bonds to Support National Economic Construction

    More Than Forty Years of Private Savings
    In Louxia Village, Area 1, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, there is an 84-year-old woman named Xu Baoying. After hearing the publicity about the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, she was so happy that she couldn't sleep. She recalled the bitter days before liberation when her son spent all day gambling with gamblers, forcing her to beg for food. After liberation, her son changed for the better, was allocated land, and life became better day by day. After hearing the publicity about the general line, her son and daughter-in-law sold surplus grain to the state and joined the agricultural production cooperative. Her son and daughter-in-law were even more filial to her. Chairman Mao not only gave her a good life but also educated her son well.
    When the national economic construction bonds were issued this time, the old woman learned about it and couldn't sleep at night, so she planned to buy bonds. The next morning, she called her son to her and said, "You know how our lives have become better. When I was young, I worked hard spinning, weaving, netting, and selling eggs, accumulating twenty silver dollars, saving them for more than forty years to provide for my old age. Back then, you were gambling all the time, so I didn't dare to tell you about this money. Now, you have been educated well by Chairman Mao, and I don't need to keep private savings for my old age. Now that we need to build the country, take the silver dollars and buy bonds!" Her son, Peng Jinhan, took the silver dollars and bought bonds that day. The old woman held the bonds and said, "In the past, the older generation saved for their children and grandchildren, but now I am using the money to buy bonds, saving a great cause for future generations."

    Learning the Patriotic Spirit of the Soviet People
    Liu Cuilian, a worker at the state-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory, received a bonus of 2.5 million yuan in 1952 for improving the roving splicing method. In the past few years, she had also saved some money, planning to put it together to buy an accordion and a gold watch.
    At the end of last year, the news of the bond issuance was announced. She remembered that when she visited the Soviet Union, it coincided with the Soviet Union's bond issuance. Every Soviet citizen regarded buying bonds as their glorious responsibility, so they quickly overfulfilled the bond subscription work. She thought: I want to learn the patriotic spirit of the Soviet people. Buying bonds to build the motherland is important; I can buy the watch and accordion later. From then on, she looked forward to the start of the bond subscription work so that she could subscribe.
    A few days ago, Liu Cuilian received a notice to join the delegation to慰问 (express sympathy and appreciation to) the People's Liberation Army and would be leaving soon. She thought: The task of慰问 the People's Liberation Army is very important, but the factory has not yet started subscribing to bonds. Time is running out, what should I do? She took out her savings from the bank and entrusted the party branch secretary of the workshop to buy 4 million yuan of bonds on her behalf.

    Glorious Money for Glorious Deeds
    In the trade union office of the state-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 1, the trade union chairman and several trade union members were studying how to promote the publicity of bond sales. Zhang Mengxuan from the general affairs section rushed in, handed a red paper packet to the trade union chairman, and said, "I have kept it for more than a month, and the seal has not been opened yet..." Before he could finish speaking, the trade union chairman recognized the paper packet as the bonus that he had personally given to Zhang Mengxuan at the award ceremony.
    Zhang Mengxuan is a service worker in the general affairs section. He works with three other people. In the fourth quarter of last year, the factory's production tasks increased, and the workshop was short of manpower. The leadership decided to transfer a young service worker to directly participate in production work. After one person was transferred, Zhang Mengxuan did most of the cleaning work alone to take care of the other two service workers (one older than Zhang, one with a health condition). Because of his active work, he was selected as an advanced worker when evaluating the work performance in the fourth quarter, and he was awarded a bonus of 100,000 yuan at the award ceremony.
    Zhang Mengxuan regarded this bonus as "glorious money" and did not touch it during the Spring Festival because he had already made plans. He came to the trade union office this time to ask the trade union to buy economic construction bonds with this "glorious money" on his behalf.

    Carefully Calculating Household Expenses
    Zhang Cunlu, the head of the mutual aid group in the West Street of Chengnai, Area 12, Suizhong County, Liaoxi, heard that the government was issuing national economic construction bonds this year, so he discussed it with his wife. She said, "With our family's money to buy bonds, what can the country build?" Zhang Cunlu said: Although one family's money is small, the total amount in the country is quite a lot. If everyone buys bonds, they can support the country's industrialization. Zhang Cunlu also said: In the past, I ran around all year round carrying and working for others. Now I have been allocated land and houses, and I am organized with everyone to produce, and the grain we produce is increasing year by year. Our family of ten has enough to eat and wear, and the gray-roofed brick house is also equipped with electric lights. Where did my family's good life come from without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party? Buying bonds and using surplus money to support national economic construction is to let everyone enter socialist society earlier and live a good life. At this point, his wife understood. They calculated the details: This year, in addition to buying 3 million yuan of production materials, there are still 2 million yuan left. 1 million yuan for annual living expenses is enough. In this way, there will be at least 1 million yuan to spare. The next day, Zhang Cunlu bought all of the extra 1 million yuan of bonds.

    In Order to Live Like Soviet Peasants
    Zhao Gang is the women's production team leader of the agricultural production cooperative in Gaokan Village, a suburb of Shenyang. After studying the general line and general task of the country during the transition period last winter, she understood more clearly the benefits of national industrialization for peasants. She thought: In the second year of Shenyang's liberation, her husband died of illness. At that time, she took six children and her niece and nephew to participate in production alone, planting twenty mu of land, and only harvested a dozen shi of grain each year. Later, after joining the production cooperative, horses and farm tools were used for planting and harvesting; tractors and threshers were used for plowing and threshing, and farming methods were also reformed. Women carried sprayers to apply pesticides, kill insects, and overcome natural disasters. The cooperative members were able to harvest more grain, and life became better year by year. Last year, Zhao Gang earned 108 workdays, plus the workdays of her niece and nephew, totaling more than 17,000 jin of grain.
    When the country issued economic construction bonds this time, she thought: To allow our country to build more factories, develop mines, and produce more machines and various chemical fertilizers, develop agricultural production, and transition to socialist society as soon as possible, we must live a happy life like Soviet peasants. Therefore, she took out 1.3 million yuan from the more than 2 million yuan she earned from selling surplus grain to buy bonds, and said that she would lead women to actively produce and increase production; the production cooperative will also raise more pigs and chickens next year. Female cooperative members must learn scientific breeding methods to increase the production of pigs and chickens and supply the needs of urban people.

    Beneficial to Everyone
    Guo Fenglin, the manager of the Benxi Erheshun Soy Sauce Factory, although he subscribed to 1,400 points of victory real value bonds when the country issued them in 1950, he did not understand the meaning of subscribing to bonds enough. However, from that subscription to now, not only has 800 points of principal been repaid, but also 5.36 million yuan in appreciation and interest has been received; Erheshun's business has not suffered losses due to the subscription of bonds. On the contrary, due to the support of the government and the state-owned economy, the business has developed greatly.
    In the first half of 1952, Erheshun needed sorghum rice to make vinegar, and the Grain Company promptly met their needs; in October last year, they could not buy yeast to make vinegar, and the Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau sent people to accompany the factory personnel to Harbin for procurement.
    Guo Fenglin realized that subscribing to bonds not only helped the country raise funds but was also beneficial to himself. Therefore, Erheshun Soy Sauce Factory subscribed to 26.5 million yuan of bonds this time.

### 踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设

    踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设
    四十多年的体己钱
    山东省荣成县一区楼下村，有个八十四岁的老太太许保媖。她听到国家过渡时期的总路线总任务宣传后，乐得睡不着觉。她想起解放前儿子整天跟赌棍们在一起赌钱，自己只好要饭吃的苦滋味。解放后，儿子改好了，分得了土地，日子就一天比一天好过。儿子和媳妇听了总路线的宣传以后，把余粮卖给了国家，并且参加了农业生产合作社。儿子和媳妇对她更孝顺了。毛主席不但给了好日子，还教好了她的儿子。
    这次发行国家经济建设公债，老太太知道了，晚上睡不着觉，就盘算买公债的事。第二天早晨，她把儿子叫到面前说：“咱们的日子怎么好起来的，你是知道的。我年轻的时候，吃苦受累纺花织布、结头网、卖鸡蛋，积攒了二十块银洋，攒了四十多年，留着防老。那时候，你成天赌钱，我就没敢告诉你有这笔钱，如今，你叫毛主席教育好了，我也用不着留体己钱防老了。现今要建设国家，你把银洋拿去买公债吧！”她儿子彭晋翰当天就把银元拿去买了公债。老太太手里拿着公债券说：“早先，老辈攒家业是留给儿孙，现在我把钱买了公债，是给后人攒个大家业。”
    学习苏联人民的爱国精神
    国营上海第九棉织厂的工人刘翠莲，一九五二年因为改进了粗纱接头法，得到了二百五十万元奖金。几年来，她又陆续储蓄了一些钱，打算凑在一起，买架风琴和一只金壳手表。
    去年年底，发行公债的消息公布了。她想起自己去苏联参观那年，正碰上苏联发行公债。每个苏联人民都把买公债看做是自己光荣责任，所以很快地就超额完成了公债的认购工作。她想：我要学习苏联人民的爱国精神。买公债建设祖国要紧，手表、风琴可以以后再买。从那时候起，她天天盼望着认购公债工作快些开始，就好认购。
    前些日子，刘翠莲接到参加慰问解放军代表团的通知，并且很快就要动身。她想：慰问解放军的任务很重要，可是厂里还没有开始认购公债。时间很急，怎么办呢？她把银行的存款取出来，委托车间的党支部书记代她买四百万元公债。
    光荣钱办光荣事
    在国营上海卷烟一厂工会办公室里，工会主席和几个工会委员正在研究怎样展开推销公债的宣传工作。总务科的张蒙选兴冲冲跑了进来，把一个红纸包递给了工会主席说：“我把它保存了一个多月了，封口还没有开呢……”他还没有说完，工会主席就认出这个纸包，正是在给奖大会上自己亲手发给张蒙选的奖金。
    张蒙选是总务科的勤务工。和他一起工作的还有三个人。去年第四季度，厂里生产任务增加，车间里缺少人手，领导上决定抽出一个年轻的勤务工，到车间里直接参加生产工作。从调走了一个人以后，张蒙选为了照顾另外两个勤务工（一个年纪比老张大，一个身体有病），他一个人做了大部分的清洁工作。由于他积极工作，在评比第四季度工作成绩时，大家评选他为先进工作者，在给奖大会上奖了他十万元奖金。
    张蒙选把这笔奖金看作是“光荣钱”，过春节也没有动过，因为他早有了打算。这回到工会办公室里来，就是要请工会代他把这份“光荣钱”购买经济建设公债。
    仔细核算家庭开支
    辽西绥中县十二区城内西街互助组组长张存禄，听说政府今年要发行国家经济建设公债，他就和老婆核计。她说：“凭咱家拿这一些钱买公债，国家拿来建设啥呀？”张存禄说：一家的钱虽少，全国合起来可就不少。大家买公债，就能支援国家工业化。张存禄又说：从前我一年到头东跑西颠给人家扛活做工，如今分到了田地和房屋，和大家组织起来生产，打的粮食一年比一年多。全家十口人，吃穿不缺，住的灰顶砖房还装上了电灯。没有毛主席、共产党，我家这好日子打那儿来？买公债，把余钱支援国家经济建设，是为了让大家早些走到社会主义社会，过好日子。说到这里，他老婆思想通了。他俩算了细账：今年除了买生产资料三百万元，还剩二百万元。一年的生活杂费有一百万元足够了。这样，至少可多余一百万元。第二天，张存禄就把那多的一百万元全部买了公债。
    为了过像苏联农民一样的生活
    赵纲是沈阳市郊高坎村农业生产合作社的妇女生产队长。去年冬天，她学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务以后，更明白了国家工业化对农民的好处。她想到：在沈阳解放的第二年，她的丈夫就病死了，那时她一人带着六个孩子和她的侄女、侄子参加生产，种二十亩地，每年只打十几石粮。后来加入生产合作社以后，种地、收割都使用马拉农具；翻地、打场使用拖拉机和脱谷机，还改革了耕作方法；妇女们背着喷雾器打药水、杀虫子、战胜自然灾害，社员们能多打粮食，生活一年比一年好。去年，赵纲得了一百零八个劳动日，加上她侄女、侄子的劳动日，共得了一万七千多斤粮食。
    这次国家发行经济建设公债，她心想：要让我们国家多修建工厂，开发矿山，多造出机器和各种化学肥料，发展农业生产，早日过渡到社会主义社会，才能过像苏联农民那样幸福的生活。所以她在卖余粮所得的两百多万元中，拿出一百三十万元购买了公债，并表示要领导妇女积极生产，增加产量；明年生产合作社还要多养猪、鸡。女社员要学好科学的饲养方法，增加猪鸡的产量，供给城市人民的需要。
    对谁都有好处
    本溪二合顺酱油制造厂经理郭枫林，在一九五○年国家发行胜利折实公债的时候，虽然认购了一千四百分公债，但对认购公债的意义还不够了解。但是，从那次认购到现在，不仅已还本八百分，还收入了增值与利息五百三十六万元；二合顺的营业并没有因为认购公债受到损失，相反的，由于政府与国营经济的扶植，营业有很大发展。
    一九五二年上半年，二合顺做醋需要高粱米，粮食公司及时满足了他们的需用量；去年十月，做醋买不到曲子，烟酒专卖局就派人陪同该厂人员到哈尔滨采购。
    郭枫林认识到认购公债不仅帮助国家筹集了资金，而且对自己也有好处。所以，这次国家发行经济建设公债，二合顺酱油制造厂认购了二千六百五十万元。
