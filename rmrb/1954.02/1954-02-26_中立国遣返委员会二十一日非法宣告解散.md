Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 25th – The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission illegally declared its dissolution at 24:00 on February 21st, before completing the duties stipulated in the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Lieutenant General Thimayya of India, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, left Korea by plane on the 23rd, transiting through Japan to return to India. The last batch of Indian custodial troops also returned home by ship on the 23rd.

The day before his departure, General Thimayya, in a conversation with reporters, once again pointed out the fact that the U.S. side had deployed a large number of secret agents in the East Camp prison camps to threaten and control prisoners of war. Thimayya also condemned the so-called "voluntary repatriation" principle created by the U.S. side.

    中立国遣返委员会二十一日非法宣告解散
    【新华社开城二十五日电】中立国遣返委员会在尚未完成朝鲜停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定的职责的情况下，于二月二十一日二十四时非法地宣告解散。
    中立国遣返委员会主席印度蒂迈雅中将二十三日乘飞机离开朝鲜，转道日本返回印度。最后一批印度看管部队也在二十三日乘船返国。
    蒂迈雅将军在启程前一天对记者发表谈话时再度指出美方在东场里看管营场中布置大批特务以威胁和控制战俘的事实。蒂迈雅并谴责美方制造的所谓“自愿遣返”原则。
