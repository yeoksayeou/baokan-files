    Vigorously Publicize Creative Labor
    As the publicity of the General Line deepens daily, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of workers and technicians has been raised, a socialist attitude towards labor has been established, and new phenomena and many new creations have emerged in production. This is a tremendous force for realizing the General Line and building socialism. Our newspapers should attach great importance to the publicity in this area. The continuous reports in the Shijiazhuang Daily, starting on December 16th of last year, on the successful trial production of wheat peeling machines and the promotion of the bran-first flour milling method by the workers of the Shijiazhuang General Flour Factory, is a good example.
    In its reports, the Shijiazhuang Daily provided a detailed introduction to the process of trial production of wheat peeling machines and the promotion of the bran-first flour milling method by the workers of the Shijiazhuang Flour Factory. The report stated that in studying the General Line, the workers of the Shijiazhuang Flour Factory clarified the relationship between their daily labor and the construction of socialism, understanding that producing one more jin of flour from wheat was contributing one more share to the construction of socialism. Therefore, they actively improved production techniques to increase the flour yield of wheat. Last December, with the strong support of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, all the workers of the factory, with their collective wisdom, selfless labor, and the tenacious spirit of "never giving up until success," successfully trial-produced the wheat peeling machine, making the promotion of the bran-first flour milling method a success. This is another major achievement in China's flour milling industry after the "front-end flour extraction method." Using this method of flour milling can produce more than five jin of flour per hundred jin of wheat compared to the old method (crushing the wheat first and then extracting the flour), and shorten the flour milling process by six or seven steps. Taking only the three flour factories in Shijiazhuang as an example, using the same amount of wheat for flour milling can produce 36,000 more jin of flour for the country every day, which can increase the wealth of the country by 18 billion yuan a year. If it is promoted nationwide, the grain saved and the wealth created will be even more astonishing. The Shijiazhuang Daily attached great importance to this creative labor of the workers of the Shijiazhuang Flour Factory. The newspaper successively published two editorials and two speeches by propagandists, which not only clarified the political and economic significance of this creation, but also emphasized that this was a good example of the working class implementing the General Line with practical actions. All the workers in the city should use it as a "model" to compare themselves, engage in creative labor in their own work positions, in order to strive for the early arrival of socialism.
    In order to deepen the creative spirit of the flour factory workers in the hearts of the people, the newspaper published an interview with technician Jin Tianmin, the initiator of the bran-first flour milling method, as well as articles by the people who created the wheat peeling machine, vividly reflecting the Shijiazhuang General Flour Factory workers' love for socialism and their enthusiasm for improving production. At the same time, the newspaper vigorously reported on the activities of the Shijiazhuang municipal Party and government leading organs and trade unions to reward and promote this creation, and published speeches by many local technicians at the symposium jointly convened by the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. In these speeches, the technicians attending the symposium all expressed that they would learn from the creative spirit of the flour factory workers and put forward their own action plans for implementing the General Line. For example, Lu Ziping, an engineer at the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory, proposed to continue to overcome all difficulties and make the enamel rotary furnace he was designing a success, in order to replace manual operation.
    It is precisely because the newspaper made a relatively prominent and in-depth publicity of the examples of the workers and masses implementing the General Line with practical actions, that it generated a huge educational force. After seeing the newspaper, the broad masses of local workers wrote letters to the newspaper and the flour factory workers, putting forward their own specific plans for implementing the General Line. Even many farmers in the suburbs wrote letters to the newspaper, expressing that they would increase grain and industrial raw material production even more to support the country's industrial construction and build socialism together with the working class. This shows that as long as the newspaper is good at using vivid facts to influence the masses, it can effectively guide the laboring people's enthusiasm for building socialism to the actual actions of increasing production and practicing economy.

    大力宣扬创造性的劳动
    随着总路线宣传的日益深入，广大职工、技术人员的社会主义觉悟提高了，社会主义的劳动态度确立起来了，并在生产上涌现出新的气象和不少新的创造。这是实现总路线建设社会主义的巨大力量。我们的报纸应该十分重视这方面的宣传。石家庄日报从去年十二月十六日开始的关于石家庄面粉总厂职工试制小麦脱皮机，推行先出麸皮制粉法成功的连续报道，就是一个较好的例子。
    石家庄日报在报道中，对石家庄面粉总厂职工试制小麦脱皮机和推行先出麸皮制粉法的经过作了详细的介绍。报道中说，石家庄面粉厂职工在学习总路线中，明确了自己的日常劳动和建设社会主义的关系，懂得使小麦多碾出一斤面粉就是对建设社会主义多贡献一分力量，因而积极地改进生产技术，以提高小麦的出粉率。去年十二月间，在中共石家庄市委的大力支持下，全厂职工以集体的智慧、忘我的劳动和“不成功决不歇手”的顽强精神试制了小麦脱皮机，使先出麸皮制粉法推行成功。这是我国面粉业继“前路出粉法”之后的又一重大成就。用这种方法制粉，可使每百斤麦子比旧法生产（先碎麦后取粉）多出五斤多面粉，并使制粉过程缩短六、七道工序。仅就石家庄三个面粉厂计算，用同等数量的小麦制粉，每天就可为国家多出三万六千斤面粉，一年就可为国家增加财富一百八十亿元。如果把它推广到全国，则节约的粮食和创造的财富将更为惊人。石家庄日报对石家庄面粉厂职工的这种创造性劳动给予了极大的重视。报纸连续发表了两篇社论和两篇宣传员讲话，不仅阐明了这个创造在政治上和经济上的意义，而且强调指出这是工人阶级用实际行动贯彻总路线的良好榜样，全市职工都应该把它作为“样板”来对照自己，在自己的工作岗位上，从事创造性的劳动，以争取社会主义的早日到来。
    为使面粉厂职工的这种创造精神深入人心，报纸发表了先出麸皮制粉法的倡议人金天民技师的访问记，以及创造小麦脱皮机的人们的文章，生动地反映了石家庄面粉总厂职工热爱社会主义的心情和提高生产的积极性。报纸同时大力报道了石家庄市党、政领导机关及工会奖励和推广这一创造的活动，并发表了当地许多技术人员在市委和市工会联合会联合召开的座谈会上的讲话。在这些讲话中，出席座谈会的技术人员都表示要学习面粉厂职工的创造精神，并提出自己贯彻总路线的行动计划。如石家庄搪瓷厂工程师卢子平就提出要继续克服一切困难，使自己正在设计的搪瓷用转盘炉制造成功，以代替手工操作。
    正由于报纸对职工群众中以实际行动贯彻总路线的范例作了比较突出和深入的宣传，因而产生了巨大的教育力量。当地广大职工看到报纸后，纷纷写信给报社和面粉厂职工，提出了自己贯彻总路线的具体计划。就连郊区的许多农民也写信给报社，表示要更多地增产粮食和工业原料，支援国家工业建设，和工人阶级一道建设社会主义。这就说明了只要报纸善于用生动的事实来影响群众，就能有效地将劳动人民建设社会主义的热情，引向增产节约的实际行动。　（万春）
