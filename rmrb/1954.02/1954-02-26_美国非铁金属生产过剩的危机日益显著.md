Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 25th: The crisis of overproduction in the American non-ferrous metal industry is becoming increasingly prominent. The copper, lead, and zinc piled up in warehouses and unable to be sold are accumulating more and more. Many large companies have recently further cut production.

According to figures from the American Copper Institute, domestic copper demand in January of this year fell to its lowest level since July 1949. At the end of January, the inventory held by copper mine capitalists was 83 percent higher than at the end of December 1952, reaching the highest record since December 1949. According to the Associated Press, the situation for zinc is also one of "decreasing domestic consumption and increasing unsold inventory." The agency reported on the 20th that at the end of January, the amount of zinc accumulated in the hands of smelters was the highest since October 1946. The phenomenon of oversupply of other important non-ferrous metals is also very serious.

The pressure of reduced consumption and increased inventory has first forced the prices of many non-ferrous metals to fall again and again. According to the Associated Press, in the week ending February 20, the price of lead had fallen to its lowest record since May 1953, and the price of zinc had fallen to its lowest level since October 1949. Many copper buyers are already pressing down the price of scrap copper. In discussing the "decline in the prices of non-ferrous metals, especially zinc and lead" on the 11th, United Press International admitted: "The buying and selling of copper, lead, and zinc has been very disappointing recently, reflecting an oversupply of these materials."

In the face of this situation, many large metal mining and smelting companies have drastically cut production. Kennecott Copper Corporation, the largest copper mining company in the United States, recently announced a reduction in monthly copper production of 5,100 tons, Phelps Dodge Corporation announced a monthly reduction of 1,100 tons, and Anaconda Copper Mining Company announced that the operating hours of all its plants and mines in Montana would be reduced from six days a week to five days. American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Company announced that it would completely cease zinc production in the near future, and American Zinc, Lead & Smelting Company announced that it would indefinitely suspend zinc production at its Hillsboro plant in Illinois starting from March 1. St. Joseph Lead Company, one of the large companies that first started reducing zinc production last year, recently announced a further reduction in production.

### 美国非铁金属生产过剩的危机日益显著

    美国非铁金属生产过剩的危机日益显著
    【新华社二十五日讯】纽约消息：美国非铁金属工业生产过剩的危机日益显著。堆在仓库里卖不出去的铜、铅、锌已经越积越多。许多大公司最近都进一步削减生产。
    根据美国铜矿研究所的数字，今年一月，国内铜矿的需求量下降至一九四九年七月以来的最低水平。在一月底时，积存在铜矿资本家手中的存货比一九五二年十二月底多了百分之八十三，达到一九四九年十二月以来的最高纪录。据美联社消息说，锌的情况也是“国内消费减少，卖不出去的存货增加”。该社二十日报道，在一月底时，积存在冶炼业手中的锌是一九四六年十月以来最多的。其他一些重要非铁金属过剩的现象也很严重。
    消费减少，存货增加的压力首先迫使许多非铁金属的价格一跌再跌。据美联社说，在到二月二十日为止的一周中，铅价已下降至一九五三年五月以来的最低纪录，锌价已下降至一九四九年十月以来的最低水平。铜的许多买主已在压低废铜的价格。合众社十一日消息在谈到“非铁金属、特别是锌和铅的价格均告下降”时承认：“铜、铅、锌的买卖最近很令人失望，反映了这些物资供过于求。”
    在这种情况面前，许多大金属开采冶炼公司已大量削减生产。美国最大的铜矿公司肯奈柯特铜公司最近已宣布每月产铜量减少五千一百吨，菲尔普斯·道奇公司宣布每月减产一千一百吨，安那康达铜矿公司宣布该公司在蒙大拿州的全部厂矿的开工时间从每周六天减至五天。阿夫列特开采冶炼公司宣布不久将全部停止锌的生产，美国锌铅冶炼公司宣布从三月一日开始无限期地停止伊利诺斯州赫尔斯博罗厂锌的生产。去年首先开始减少锌的生产的大公司之一、圣约瑟夫铅公司最近也宣布进一步削减生产。
