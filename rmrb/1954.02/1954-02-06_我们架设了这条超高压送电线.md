    We Erected This Ultra-High-Voltage Power Line
    Shao Yanxiang
    Stride boldly across high mountains,
    Across rivers, depressions, and plains,
    Across the fields of agricultural production cooperatives,
    Across the sides of heavy industrial cities;
    Across the continuous autumn rains,
    Across the winter winds and swirling snow,
    Across the sky, across the ground,
    Stride boldly across time…
    —Please tell me, who is it
    Who, on their beloved homeland,
    Erected the first
    Largest ultra-high-voltage power line?
    We—are!
    Although the sun in the sky is warm and bright,
    It only shines during the day and not at night,
    It cannot replace millions of hands
    Pushing millions of gears to rotate;
    It is precisely our power line
    That makes the brilliant lights even more brilliant,
    Spurring our industrial steeds
    To gallop forward day and night!
    —When pouring the concrete foundations,
    Who poured their heart and soul into them?
    Those ten thousand tons of rebar, steel plates, and steel frames,
    In whose hands are they so obedient and compliant?
    Who is it that works on the top of high mountain towers,
    With frost and sweat congealing on their backs?
    Who is it that lets those nine hundred-plus iron towers
    Seem like nine hundred-plus intimate brothers,
    Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder,
    Standing in formation for hundreds of miles, how majestic!
    Us!
    Precisely us!
    We are tower assembly workers.
    We are wire stringing workers.
    We are people who work with our hands,
    And also people who work with our hearts.
    Our names are written on the task orders,
    Our task has been completed ahead of schedule!
    —Who is it that uses their frostbitten hands
    To stroke the cold tower body back and forth?
    When the power line hums,
    Who is it that feels like they are hearing a friend's voice?
    When the power is turned on and the lights flash on,
    Who is it that feels like they are seeing the eyes of a loved one?
    Who is it that bids farewell to the construction site with such reluctance,
    And is about to participate in a new project?
    Us!
    Us!
    Precisely us!
    We are the proud children of the era.
    The forerunners of the great descendants.
    On every footprint we leave,
    Please behold the birth of socialism!

    我们架设了这条超高压送电线
    邵燕祥
    大踏步地跨过高山，
    跨过河流、洼地和平原，
    跨过农业生产合作社的田野，
    跨过重工业城市的身边；
    跨过阴雨连绵的秋季，
    跨过风刮雪卷的冬天，
    跨过高空，跨过地面，
    大踏步地跨过时间……
    ——请问是谁，
    在自己可爱的国土上，
    架起了第一条
    最大的超高压送电线？
    我——们！
    天上的太阳虽然温暖光明，
    它只照白天不照夜晚，
    它不能代替千万双手
    推动千万个齿轮旋转；
    正是我们的这条线路
    使灿烂的灯火更加灿烂，
    策动着我们工业的骏马
    日夜不停地朝前赶！
    ——浇灌混凝土基础的时候，
    是谁，把自己的心血也浇进里边？
    那万吨的钢筋、钢板和钢架，
    在谁的手中这样听话服软？
    是谁，在高山塔顶上干活，
    背上的冰霜汗水凝成一片？
    是谁，让那九百多座铁塔
    好像九百多亲热的弟兄，
    手拉着手，肩并着肩，
    几百里站成阵，好不威风！
    我们！
    正是我们！
    我们是组塔工人。
    我们是放线工人。
    我们是用手工作的人，
    又是用心工作的人。
    我们的名字写在任务书上，
    我们的任务已经提前完成！
    ——是谁，用自己冻裂的手
    来回抚摸冰凉的塔身？
    当电线嗡嗡发响的时候，
    是谁，像听到了朋友的声音？
    通上电，那电灯刷地亮了，
    是谁，像望见了亲人的眼睛？
    是谁，这样留恋地告别了工地，
    又要去参加新的工程？
    我们！
    我们！
    正是我们！
    我们是时代的骄子。
    伟大的后人的先人。
    在我们每一步脚印上，
    请你看社会主义的诞生！
