Comrade Ren Guodong, Model Worker of Patriotic Production and Secretary of the CCP Heilongjiang Province Guo Hou Banner Committee, proposes to rural workers in various regions: Based on the specific conditions in each locality and summarizing the existing experiences of farmers, guide them in vigorously improving the quality of spring plowing operations to ensure the completion or overfulfillment of the state's agricultural production increase plan for this year.

Currently, Ren Guodong has put forward the slogan "Strive to Start Everything Early, Improve the Quality of Spring Plowing Operations, and Lay the Foundation for Increased Production Throughout the Year" to Guo Hou Banner. He has also dispatched more than ten cadres to go deep among the farmers, combining the inspection of spring plowing preparations and the consolidation of mutual aid teams with the work of establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives, to study specific methods for improving the quality of spring plowing operations.

In further summarizing agricultural production in Guo Hou Banner last year, Ren Guodong realized that improving the quality of spring plowing operations has a significant impact on the entire growth process of crops and can lay the foundation for improving summer hoeing and autumn harvesting operations. Last year, Guo Hou Banner suffered unprecedentedly severe natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and early frosts from the end of spring sowing to the autumn harvest, but the total output of various crops in the banner still increased by 21% compared to 1950, a year of favorable weather and bountiful harvests. Ren Guodong found that the main reasons for the relatively good harvest last year were: based on the successful trial creation of the new cultivation method of "equal-distance wide sowing, thinning and seedling preservation, and staged topdressing" in 1952, the quality of spring plowing operations in the banner was further improved last year, from seed treatment, fertilization, and sowing to moisture retention, all of which were done better than in previous years, thereby effectively enhancing the crops' resistance to natural disasters.

Ren Guodong gained many new insights in studying the general line of the state during the transition period. He believes that the effectiveness of a Communist Party member in implementing the general line lies in correctly implementing policies and continuously improving their work. The state's socialist construction undertakings have brought new demands to rural workers. Rural work is more arduous, complex, and meticulous than at any time in the past. Therefore, it is necessary to change the practice of evenly distributing efforts in spring, summer, autumn, and winter and strengthen leadership over the fundamental links and key issues in the work.

### 中共郭后旗委书记任国栋向各地农村工作者提议  领导农民大力改进春耕作业的质量

    中共郭后旗委书记任国栋向各地农村工作者提议
    领导农民大力改进春耕作业的质量
    爱国丰产模范工作者、中共黑龙江省郭后旗委员会书记任国栋向各地农村工作者提议：根据各地具体条件，总结农民既有的经验，领导农民大力改进春耕作业的质量，以保证完成或超额完成国家今年的农业增产计划。
    现在，任国栋已向郭后旗提出“争取一切早动手，提高春耕作业质量，打下全年增产基础”的口号。他并已派出十多名干部深入到农民中，结合检查春耕准备和整顿互助组，建立农业生产合作社的工作，研究改进春耕作业质量的具体办法。
    任国栋在去年进一步总结郭后旗的农业生产中，体会到改进春耕作业的质量对农作物的整个生长过程都有很大影响，并能为改进夏锄和秋收作业打下基础。去年，郭后旗从春耕播种结束到秋收，曾连续遭受涝、旱、早霜等空前严重的自然灾害，但全旗各种农作物的总产量，仍比风调雨顺，获得丰收的一九五零年增加百分之二十一。任国栋研究出去年收成较好的主要原因是：在一九五二年试创“等距宽播、间苗保苗、分期追肥”新耕作法得到成功的基础上，去年全旗进一步改进了春耕作业的质量，从种籽处理、施肥、播种到保墒等，都比往年做得好，因而有效地增强了农作物对自然灾害的抵抗力。
    任国栋在学习国家在过渡时期的总路线中，得到很多新的启示。他认为：一个共产党员贯彻总路线的成效，就是正确地执行政策，不断提高自己的工作。国家的社会主义建设事业，为农村工作者带来了新的要求。农村工作比以往任何时期都更加艰巨、复杂和细致。因此，必须改变那种对春、夏、秋、冬四季工作平均使用力量的做法，加强工作中根本环节和关键问题的领导。（新华社）
