The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "Improving the people's health and enhancing the people's physique is an important political task of the Party." Trade union organizations should resolutely implement the spirit of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and carry out mass sports work for workers and staff. Physical education is a part of communist education. Only by strengthening this aspect of work can we cultivate a new generation of workers who are healthy, optimistic, able to actively engage in socialist labor, and brave in defending the motherland.

The broad masses of workers and staff, in order to realize the great historical task of the Party's general line during the transition period, need not only a higher level of awareness and organization, a higher level of technical skills and culture, but also a healthy body. However, the current health status of workers and staff cannot meet the needs of production. Many factories and mines are often affected by the absence of workers and staff due to illness, which affects production. To change this situation, in addition to strengthening health work and gradually improving operating conditions, carrying out sports activities is the most active and effective method.

In recent years, with the restoration and development of the national economy, the material and cultural life of workers and staff has been continuously improved. Thanks to the concern of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for the physical health of workers and staff, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels and the help and guidance of the sports committees of the people's governments at all levels, mass sports activities for workers and staff in some factories and mines have been preliminarily launched. It has achieved significant results in enhancing the physical fitness of workers, reducing illnesses, ensuring attendance rates, improving labor efficiency, and strengthening unity among workers. However, due to lack of leadership, mass sports activities for workers and staff in factories and mines have not been able to be carried out normally and widely.

In order to carry out mass sports activities for workers and staff in factories and mines in a planned, led, and prepared manner, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions hereby issues the following instructions:

1.  The trade union organizations in factories and mines must, based on the principle of serving production and serving the masses, carry out mass sports activities for workers and staff in their spare time, and promote gymnastics before and after work or during work breaks in a prepared and planned manner. The goal is to enhance the physical fitness of workers, reduce illnesses, ensure attendance rates, and improve labor efficiency, so as to ensure the completion and strive for the over-completion of the national production plan.

2.  The launch of mass sports activities for workers and staff in factories and mines, like any other work, must adopt the method of pilot projects. In cities with a large number of factories and mines, the local federation of trade unions can select a small number of factories and mines for pilot projects based on the strength of the cadres, in order to gain experience and promote the general.

3.  The trade union organizations of all factories and mines should make full use of the existing sports venues and equipment, improve the utilization rate of these venues and equipment, and then, according to needs and possibilities, after obtaining the consent of the Party and government leaders of the factories and mines, appropriately expand them. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the management of sports venues and equipment and overcome the phenomenon that no one is responsible for certain public sports venues.

4.  In factories and mines, the development of mass sports activities for workers and staff should mainly rely on activists to carry out activities in their spare time. Under the propaganda departments of the trade union federations or industrial trade unions at all levels, and the propaganda committees of some grassroots trade union organizations in factories and mines with a large number of people, full-time cadres may be appointed or specialized institutions established to manage matters related to mass sports activities for workers and staff.

5.  With the consent and support of the local Party and government leading organs, and with the guidance and assistance of the local sports committees, trade union organizations at all levels can use their spare time to run training courses for activists in sports activities, and organize various sports competitions in workshops, the entire factory, and the entire city, to improve the sports skills of workers and staff and promote the development of mass sports activities. In any training class or competition for mass sports activities of workers and staff, it is necessary to implement the policy of communist education, cultivate new sports ethics, promote the collectivist spirit of the working class, and overcome the individualistic, medal-oriented, and other capitalist ideas that remain in the sports activities of workers and staff.

6.  The launch of mass sports activities for workers and staff in factories and mines must be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee, combined with the establishment of a normal order for the work of factory and mine trade unions. In the arrangement of spare time, the sports activities of workers and staff should be placed in an appropriate position so that they have a certain amount of time for sports activities.

7.  The launch of mass sports activities for workers and staff in factories and mines must be based on the principle of voluntariness, adopting an attractive approach, and not allowing the use of coercive orders. Mass sports activities for workers and staff are a regular activity, and a policy of gradual expansion and gradual improvement must be adopted. In accordance with the spirit of economy, a variety of simple and easy-to-implement forms should be adopted in a practical and realistic manner.

8.  It is necessary to use propaganda tools and venues such as newspapers, periodicals, radio stations, clubs, and cultural palaces to publicize the significance and role of sports activities to workers and staff. In particular, it is necessary to publicize the typical experiences of factories and mines that have achieved significant results in promoting the physical health of workers, reducing sickness, ensuring attendance rates, and improving labor efficiency due to the good development of sports activities for workers and staff, so as to promote the widespread development of sports activities for workers and staff. At the same time, wrong views and practices regarding the sports activities of workers and staff should also be appropriately criticized, so that the sports activities of workers and staff in factories and mines can be carried out normally and healthily.

    中华全国总工会关于开展厂矿企业中职工群众体育运动的指示
    （一九五四年一月二十六日中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团第四次会议通过）
    中共中央指出：“改善人民的健康状况，增强人民体质，是党的一项重要政治任务”。工会组织应坚决贯彻党中央指示的精神，开展职工群众体育工作。体育是共产主义教育的一部分，只有加强这方面的工作，才能培养出健康的、乐观的、能够积极地从事社会主义劳动，和勇于保卫祖国的新的一代工人。
    广大职工群众，为了实现党在国家过渡时期的总路线的伟大历史任务，不仅需要有更高的觉悟程度和组织程度、更高的技术水平和文化水平，而且需要有健康的身体。但是，目前职工群众的健康状况还不能适应生产的需要，不少厂、矿往往由于职工群众的疾病欠勤而影响了生产。要改变这种情况，除了加强卫生工作和逐步改善操作条件外，开展体育运动是一种最积极有效的方法。
    几年来随着国民经济的恢复与发展，职工群众的物质生活与文化生活有了不断的改善。又由于中国共产党和人民政府对职工群众身体健康的关怀，在中共各级党委的领导和各级人民政府体育委员会的帮助与指导之下，部分厂矿企业中的职工群众的体育运动有了初步开展，对于增强职工体质、减少疾病、保证出勤率、提高劳动效率以及加强职工之间的团结等方面，已收到了显著的效果。但是由于缺乏领导，厂矿企业中的职工群众的体育运动还没有能够正常地广泛地开展起来。
    中华全国总工会为了在厂矿企业中有计划、有领导、有准备地开展职工群众的体育运动，特作如下之指示：
    1．厂矿企业中的工会组织，必须根据为生产服务、为群众服务的原则，在业余时间内开展职工群众的体育运动，以及有准备有计划地推行劳动前后或工作间隙时的体操，从增强职工体质、减少疾病、保证出勤率、提高劳动效率等方面，来保证完成并争取超额完成国家生产计划。
    2．厂矿企业中，职工群众的体育运动的开展，也像其他任何工作一样，必须采取试点的方法。在厂矿较多的城市，当地工会联合会可根据干部的力量，选择少数厂矿进行试点，以便取得经验，推动一般。
    3．各厂矿企业的工会组织，应充分利用现有的体育运动的场所和设备，提高这些场所和设备的利用率，然后再根据需要与可能，在取得厂矿党政领导方面的同意后，适当地予以扩充。同时必须加强体育运动的场所和设备的管理工作，克服某些公共运动场所无人负责的现象。
    4．在厂矿企业中，职工群众的体育运动的开展，主要地应依靠积极分子在业余时间内进行。在各级工会联合会或产业工会的宣传部及某些人数众多的厂矿工会基层组织的宣传委员会之下，可酌设专职干部或成立专门机构，管理职工群众的体育运动的活动事项。
    5．工会各级组织，在取得当地党政领导机关的同意与支持、取得当地体育委员会的指导与帮助之下，可利用业余时间举办体育运动的积极分子训练班，并组织车间、全厂以及全市性的各种体育运动的比赛，借以提高职工群众的体育运动的技术，推动群众性的体育运动的开展。在任何一种职工群众的体育运动的训练班或比赛中，必须贯彻共产主义教育的方针，培养新的体育道德，发扬工人阶级的集体主义的精神，克服职工群众在体育运动中所残存的个人主义、锦标主义等资本主义思想。
    6．厂矿企业中，职工群众的体育运动的开展，必须在党委的统一领导下，结合着建立厂矿工会工作的正常秩序来进行。在业余时间的安排上，应把职工群众的体育运动放在一个适当的位置，使他们有一定的体育运动的活动时间。
    7．厂矿企业中，职工群众的体育运动的开展，必须根据自愿原则，采取吸引的方式，不许采用强迫命令的办法。职工群众的体育运动，是一种经常性的活动，一定要采取逐步扩大、逐步提高的方针，根据节约精神，实事求是地采取多种多样、简单易行的形式来进行。
    8．要利用报纸、刊物、广播电台、俱乐部、文化宫等宣传工具和宣传场所，对职工群众进行体育运动的意义和作用的宣传，尤其要宣传那些由于职工群众的体育运动开展得好，在增进职工身体健康、减少病号、保证出勤率、提高劳动效率等方面已取得显著成绩的厂矿的典型经验，以推动职工群众的体育运动的广泛开展。同时对于那些对职工群众的体育运动的错误的看法和作法，也要加以适当的批判，使厂矿企业中职工群众的体育运动，得以正常地健康地开展起来。
