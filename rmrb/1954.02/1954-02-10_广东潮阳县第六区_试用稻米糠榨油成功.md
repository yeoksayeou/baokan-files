Guangdong Chaoyang County Sixth District

Successfully Trials Rice Bran Oil Extraction

Zhang Xiuting, the head of the Sixth District of Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, and oil pressing workers such as Zhang Sigu successfully trialed rice bran oil extraction. They began their experiments in January this year after studying the rice bran oil extraction methods used by the Longxi County Grain Bureau in Fujian Province and the Dazhong Oil and Rice Mill in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province. The method they adopted is very simple: first steam the rice bran in a steamer, then take it out and make it into bran cakes, and then press it on an ordinary wooden peanut oil press. After testing, every 100 jin of rice bran can yield 9 jin and 12 liang of oil and 93 jin and 5 liang of by-product—rice bran cake. The oil extracted from rice bran is rich in Vitamin B, which can be used for consumption, and can also be used as an industrial lubricant. Some people used bran oil to fry tofu, and the taste is as fragrant as peanut oil. The by-product bran cake still contains a considerable amount of oil and can be used as feed and fertilizer.

Currently, the rice bran oil extraction method has been promoted in various districts of Chaoyang County. The County People's Government Grain Bureau is preparing to supply all rice bran to cooperative oil presses in various districts. According to preliminary estimates, the county produces 3 million jin of rice bran annually. If all of it is used for oil extraction, it can produce 290,000 jin, enough for the entire county's population to eat for five to six months; the bran cake can be used as feed for more than 155,000 pigs for half a year, or it can provide fertilizer for 140,000 mu of fields once.

    广东潮阳县第六区
    试用稻米糠榨油成功
    广东省潮阳县第六区区长张秀廷和榨油工人张四鹄等试用稻米糠榨油成功。他们是在今年一月间，研究了福建省龙溪县粮食局和江苏省兴化县大众油米北厂榨米糠油的方法后，开始进行试验的。他们所采用的方法很简单：先把米糠放进蒸笼里蒸，然后取出做成一片片的糠饼，放在普通榨花生油的木制榨油机上榨制。经试验，每用一百斤米糠就可以榨出九斤十二两油和九十三斤五两副产品——米糠饼。用米糠榨出来的油含有丰富的维他命乙，可供食用，还可作工业上的油润原料。有人用糠油炸豆腐，味道和花生油一样香。副产品糠饼仍含相当大的油量，可作饲料及肥料。
    目前，米糠榨油的方法已在潮阳县各区推广。该县人民政府粮食局准备把全部米糠供应各区合作社榨油。据初步估计，该县每年产米糠三百万斤，如果全部用来榨油，可榨出二十九万斤，足供全县人民食用五个月至六个月；糠饼可作十五万五千多头猪半年的饲料，或可供十四万亩田上一次肥料。（新华社）
