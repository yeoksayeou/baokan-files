    A Leaderless Local State-Owned Factory
    Reader Liu Hengqing writes: The Hebei Province Brick and Tile Equipment Company has adopted an attitude of abandoning leadership and ignoring the Zhoukoudian Lime Factory under its jurisdiction, so that many problems in the factory's production and operation have not been resolved for a long time.
    The factory produced an average of 1,200 tons of lime per month last year, but it was entirely self-produced and self-sold and was not included in the national plan. The factory director ran around everywhere, going to Beijing and Zhangjiakou to find cargo owners, and to Baoding to borrow money. Last November, the factory had an overstock of more than 1,000 tons of lime that could not be sold. In December, due to the suspension of capital construction in various places, the sales of lime became even more difficult, and production was almost unsustainable.
    The factory frequently produces defective products in production. According to workers, the amount is more than 70 tons per month. The leadership has done a very poor job in ideological education for employees, and some staff members have lax labor discipline. The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign has not been launched in the factory either. The reasons for this situation are partly due to the abandonment of leadership of the factory by the Hebei Province Brick and Tile Equipment Company, and partly due to the fact that the factory's Party, Youth League organizations, and trade union are under the leadership of the Jingxi Mining Area, and have not cooperated with the administrative leadership in their work.
    I suggest that the Hebei Province Brick and Tile Equipment Company strengthen its leadership over the Zhoukoudian Lime Factory, and help the factory solve the problem of disconnection between the work of the administrative and Party, Youth League organizations, and trade union.

### 一个无人领导的地方国营工厂

专栏：读者来信摘要

    一个无人领导的地方国营工厂
    读者刘恒青来信：河北省砖瓦器材公司对所属周口店石灰厂采取了放弃领导、不加过问的态度，以致使该厂在生产和经营中有不少问题长期不能得到解决。
    该厂去年每月平均产石灰一千二百吨，但完全是自产自销，没有被包括在国家计划之内。该厂厂长东奔西走，一会儿上北京、张家口找货主，一会儿上保定借款。去年十一月，厂里积压了一千多吨石灰销不出去，十二月份因各地基本建设停工，石灰的销路更困难，生产几乎无法维持。
    该厂在生产中经常出废品，据工人反映，每月在七十吨以上。领导方面对职工的思想教育工作做得很差，部分职员劳动纪律松弛。增产节约运动在该厂也没有开展。造成这种情况的原因，一方面由于河北省砖瓦器材公司对该厂放弃领导，另一方面也由于该厂党、团组织和工会属京西矿区领导，在工作中没有和行政领导上互相配合。
    我建议河北省砖瓦器材公司加强对周口店石灰厂的领导，并帮助该厂解决行政和党、团组织及工会之间工作脱节的问题。
