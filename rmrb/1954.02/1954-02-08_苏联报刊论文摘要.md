    The Question of Reducing the Cost of Industrial Products
    The fifteenth issue of "Communist" magazine in 1953 published an article by L. Maikinburg on reducing the cost of industrial products. The abstract is as follows:
    In socialist society, saving social working time and saving living and materialized labor are important sources for continuously improving production and, on this basis, raising people's consumption.
    The saving of materials and labor is generally reflected in the reduction of product costs. Therefore, cost is a basic indicator of the quality of enterprise work. Unlike product cost and those indicators that can only show the quality of a particular task of the enterprise (equipment utilization rate, raw material consumption quotas, average output per worker, etc.), it is the most comprehensive indicator of the quality of enterprise work.
    Ensuring the completion of the task of reducing product costs as stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan is a very important and arduous task. However, some of our economic, financial, and planning agencies have not paid enough attention to this work. The production costs of many extremely important industrial products are very high, and there are still many loss-making enterprises, which proves that many economic leaders still do not pay attention to production costs and profit issues. Some ministries, general administrations, and enterprises often implement a special kind of "division of labor": all leaders and engineering and technical personnel put all their efforts into completing production plans and basic construction plans, while the formulation and execution of cost and accumulation plans are left to a small number of planning personnel who do not directly participate in this type of work.
    The Party has repeatedly pointed out that product cost is a basic indicator of the quality of enterprise work. Every economic worker who wants to become a true leader of an enterprise must be concerned about the calculation of product value, be familiar with the actual consumption of each basic element of cost in each unit of finished product, and guide the enterprise's economic activities so that it can unconditionally complete the cost plan and profit plan. The reason why many enterprises cannot complete the plan to reduce the cost of industrial products well is primarily because the increase in labor productivity in their factories is lower than the level stipulated in the national plan. As a result, the actual number of workers in the enterprise exceeds the plan's provisions, thus making the wage cost per unit of product higher than planned.
    The abnormally high price of industrial products (especially in the machinery manufacturing industry) is often caused by rush production. If an enterprise does not have a good organization of production and the planning of work within the factory (without the necessary amount of material storage, without a good organization for the repair of machinery and equipment, and other things), if it does not receive a uniform and complete supply of raw materials, semi-finished products, and complete sets of products, the enterprise cannot carry out production in a balanced way; this will result in underutilization of production capacity at the beginning of the month and shutdowns; and at the end of the month, it will overuse machinery and equipment, pay excessive overtime pay, relax supervision of compliance with operating procedures, and cause an increase in defective products.
    Some ministries and their subordinate general administrations often do not pay attention to the production costs of enterprises and ensure that enterprises make profits when determining the production plans of enterprises. The phenomenon of dispersed production is often allowed to exist. The same product is often manufactured by many enterprises at the same time without any necessity. This makes the degree of specialization of each enterprise insufficiently clear and hinders the centralized manufacturing of products with advanced operating methods on the basis of large-scale production. As a result, the same product has different costs in different factories, and even some factories that produce general industrial tools at very low costs are operating at less than full capacity, while other non-specialized factories are manufacturing the same thing at extremely high costs.
    If supply units violate the prescribed deadlines and prescribed categories, and do not supply raw materials uniformly and in complete sets, it will also increase the production costs of many enterprises, resulting in unplanned losses due to increased defective products, excessive expenses for reprocessing, and increased transportation costs.
    Not making accurate statistics on stored materials, lacking strict supervision of the turnover of semi-finished products between workshops within the factory, and not having a good organization of warehouse management—all of this will greatly increase the loss of raw materials, materials, and finished products. The conservation system requires accurate statistics on all materials. However, in some factories, this statistical work is basically unattended. When supply units send raw materials, semi-finished products, and fuel, they are often received without prior weighing and quality inspection procedures. Therefore, the fact that the supply is insufficient is often discovered after a long time, and at this time it is impossible to ask the original supply unit to compensate for the loss. Most commonly, when semi-finished products within the factory are transferred between workshops and work shifts, the quantity or weight of these semi-finished products is not checked, nor is their quality examined. This excessive "trust" often makes it difficult to investigate responsibility and allows workers who produce defective products to evade their material responsibility.

    Primary School Teachers
    An editorial published in the "Teacher's Newspaper" on October 14, 1953, pointed out the great significance of helping primary school teachers improve their teaching ability in the period of preparing for the transition to a ten-year universal secondary education in the Soviet Union. The abstract is as follows:
    The work of primary school teachers, at first glance, seems very ordinary, but it has a very important meaning in education.
    The Central Committee of the Party has repeatedly emphasized in its resolutions on schools the importance of primary education for helping students master the basic knowledge of science smoothly. Now, as our country is preparing to transition to a ten-year universal secondary education, the role of primary schools has not only not been reduced, but has also increased.
    However, in some places, there is still an incorrect attitude towards primary schools. In many cases, primary schools have not received the attention of various education departments and their local agencies. Not only inspectors from the Ministry of Education and state national education agencies, but even staff from district national education agencies rarely go to various primary schools, rarely study the situation of these schools, and do not help teachers improve their teaching methods.
    There are many objective reasons why the teaching work in some primary schools is not good, such as a lack of teaching equipment, the absence of good teaching guidance, and other things. However, the practical experience of Soviet teaching work proves that the quality of primary school work primarily depends on the teacher himself, his general cultural level and teaching skills, and his attitude towards children. Therefore, when analyzing the shortcomings and tasks of primary education, the first thing that should be noted is the teacher himself, his work, and his various needs.
    Education is a difficult task. It requires each teacher to constantly improve and refine. A teacher's experience often requires collective review. However, what primary school teachers, especially rural primary school teachers, lack is precisely this review. Most of them work alone or in schools with a small number of people, so they especially yearn for help, care, and advice. Unfortunately, many national education departments pay the least attention to this type of teacher. The quality of teaching and educational work depends on the teacher's familiarity with teaching methods and his political level. However, the guidance work on teaching methods for primary school teachers is organized the worst. In the current dispersed state of rural primary schools, it is difficult to ensure that the district education agencies can comprehensively lead this work. However, in this case, why not use the powerful force of rural seven-year school and rural middle school teachers? The leaders of the district national education agencies and education trade union organizations are even unwilling to think about how to carry out this work. They sometimes only formally organize some teaching and research groups for various subjects, but they do not care whether these research groups hold meetings regularly and whether they help primary school teachers solve some pressing problems in educating children.
    Books are the best friends and assistants of teachers. Rural primary school teachers especially feel this urgently. But can he receive the latest teaching reference books, social and political science books, and literature books? Unfortunately, we still have to admit that it is still difficult for books to reach the countryside. The Ministry of Education, the Central Committee of the Middle and Primary School Trade Union, and various book sales organizations rarely try to ensure that rural teachers can continuously obtain a supply of books. This situation cannot be allowed under any circumstances.
    However, even if a rural primary school teacher can get a teaching reference book, he will be greatly disappointed. These books really say too little about the teaching work in rural primary schools. It is difficult for us to find books that elaborate on the organization and content of multi-grade teaching and discuss leading children's activities in the vicinity of rural primary schools or in the Young Pioneers.
    All of these are extremely serious shortcomings in leading primary school work, and they must be thoroughly corrected. It should be understood that without making proper arrangements for primary education, it is impossible to transition to a ten-year universal comprehensive technical education, and it is impossible to enable students to achieve excellent results and eliminate grade retention. Whether it is the primary school teacher himself, or the teachers in seven-year schools and secondary schools who have a close interest in the work performance of primary school teachers, or the leaders of the national education agencies, they must pay serious attention to improving the teaching work in primary schools. Here, a series of issues must be considered, ranging from strengthening the material equipment of primary schools to improving the culture and work style of primary school teachers. Solving these problems correctly will open up new and powerful reserves for the further development of Soviet schools.

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    降低工业品成本的问题
    一九五三年第十五期“共产党人”杂志刊载了里·马伊金堡写的论降低工业品成本的论文，摘要如下：
    在社会主义社会中，节省社会工作时间、节省活的劳动和物化劳动是不断提高生产，并在这个基础上提高人民消费的重要源泉。
    对物资和劳动的节约，总的表现在产品成本的降低中。所以成本是企业工作质量的基本指标。产品成本和那些只能表明企业某一个别工作的质量指标（设备利用率、原料消耗定额、每个工人的平均产量等）不同，它是最具有概括性的企业工作质量指标。
    保证完成第五个五年计划规定的降低产品成本的任务是一个非常重要而艰巨的工作。但是我国一些经济、财务和计划机关却没有充分注意这一工作。许多极重要的工业品生产费很高，还有不少亏本的企业，这证明许多经济领导人仍不重视生产成本和赢利问题。一些部、总管理局和企业常实行这样一种特别的“分工”：所有的领导人和工程技术人员把全部力量都放在完成生产计划和基本建设计划方面，而成本和积累计划的制定和执行，却交给一小部分不直接参加这类工作的计划人员去负责。
    党曾屡次指出，产品成本是企业工作质量的基本指标，每一个想成为企业的真正领导者的经济工作人员，都必须关心产品价值的计算，熟知在每个单位成品中成本的各项基本要素的实际耗费量，并指导企业的经济活动，使它能无条件地完成成本计划和利润计划。许多企业之所以不能很好地完成降低工业品成本的计划，首先是因为在它们工厂中劳动生产率的提高低于国家计划规定的水平。结果使该企业的实际工人人数超过计划的规定，因而使每一单位产品所含的工资费用高出计划之上。
    工业品价格的异常昂贵（特别是机器制造业）常是因突击生产引起的。如果一个企业没有良好地组织生产和厂内工作的计划化（没有必要数量的器材储存，没有很好地组织对机器设备的检修以及其它等等），如果它得不到原料、半制品和成套制品的均匀的、完备的供应，这个企业就不可能均衡地进行生产；这时就会使生产能力在月初不能充分利用，发生停工现象；而月末又会过度使用机器设备，过多付出加班费，放松对遵守操作规程的监督和引起废品的增加。
    一些部及其所属各总管理局在确定企业的生产计划时，常不注意企业的生产耗费和保证使企业取得赢利。生产的分散现象往往听其存在。同一产品常毫无必要地由很多企业同时制造。这使各企业的专业化程度不够明确，并妨碍了在大规模生产基础上以先进操作方法进行产品的集中制造。结果就造成同一产品在不同工厂里成本互异，甚至有些以十分低廉的成本生产一般工业用具的工厂开工不足，而另一些未专业化的工厂却在以极高的成本制造同一的东西。
    供售单位违反规定期限和规定品类，不是均衡地、成套地供应原材料，也会使许多企业的生产费用增大，造成由于废品增加的超计划损失，重新加工的超额开支和运费的增大。
    对储存的物资不作精确的统计，对厂内各车间之间半制品的流转缺乏严格的监督，没有良好地组织仓库管理——这一切都会大大增加原料、材料和成品的损耗。节约制要求对所有的物资都进行精确统计。但是，在一些工厂里这种统计工作基本上处于无人过问状态。在供售单位送来原料、半制品和燃料时，常不经过事先过磅和检查质量等手续便接收下来。因此供应不足额的事实常是过了许久才被发现，而这时要求原供售单位赔偿损失已不可能了。最常见的是厂内半制品在本厂各车间之间、工作班之间流转时，常不检查这些半制品的数量或重量，也不查考它们的质量。这种过分的“信任”常使追究责任发生困难，并使造出废品的工人得以规避他所负的物质责任。
    小学教师
    “教师报”一九五三年十月十四日发表社论，指出在苏联准备过渡到十年制中等普及教育时期中，帮助小学教师提高教学能力的重大意义，摘要如下：
    小学教师的工作，初看起来似乎很平凡，但它在教育工作上，却具有十分重要的意义。
    党中央委员会在它关于学校的各次决议中，曾屡次强调指出，初级教育对于帮助学生顺利掌握科学基本知识的重要性。现在，由于我国正准备过渡到十年制中等普及教育，初级小学的作用不仅未降低，而且更为增大了。
    但是，在某些地方仍有以不正确的态度对待初级小学的事。在许多场合下，初级小学没有受到各个教育部及其地方机关的注意。不仅教育部和州的国民教育机关的视察员，甚至区的国民教育机关的工作人员都很少到各个小学去，很少研究这些学校的情况，不帮助教师改进教学方法。
    某些初级小学的教学工作不好，可以找到很多客观原因，如缺乏教学设备，没有良好的教学指导和其他等等。可是苏联教学工作的实际经验证明，小学工作的质量，首先取决于教师本人、他的一般文化程度和教学修养、他对儿童的态度。因此，在分析初等教育的缺点和任务问题时，应当首先注意的，正是教师本身，他的工作和他的各种需求。
    教育是一项繁难的工作。它要求每个教师不断地提高和改进。一个教师的经验常常需要集体的审查。但是小学教师，特别是乡村小学教师所缺乏的，正是这种审查。他们中的大多数都是单独工作，或是在人数很少的学校中工作，因此特别渴望得到帮助、关切和忠告。可惜，很多国民教育部门最不注意的正是这一类教师。教学和教育工作的质量取决于教师对教学法的熟悉和他的政治水平。但是，对小学教师的教学法的指导工作却组织得最不好。在现存的乡村小学的分散状态下，要保证区的教育机关能对这一工作加以全面领导，是困难的。可是，在这种情况下，为什么不利用乡村七年制学校和乡村中学教师这一强大的力量呢？区的国民教育机关和教育工会组织的领导人甚至不愿动脑筋想一想如何去进行这一工作。他们有时只限于形式地组织一些各科教学研究会，可是并不关怀这些研究会是否定期举行会议，它们是否帮助小学教师解决了在教育儿童方面的一些迫切问题。
    书籍是教师的最好的朋友和助手。乡村小学的教师尤其迫切地感到这点。但是他是否能收到最新的教学参考书、社会政治科学、文学的书籍呢？可惜，我们还不得不承认，书籍的到达乡村仍是困难的。教育部，中小学工会中央委员会，各个书刊销售组织很少设法使乡村教师能源源不断地获得书籍的供应，这种情况是无论如何都不能允许的。
    可是，即使一个乡村小学教师能够拿到一本教学参考书，他也会大大失望的。这些书对于乡村小学的教学工作，真是说得太少了。我们很难找到阐述复式教学的组织和内容问题、论述在乡村小学的学校附近或少先队中领导儿童活动的书。
    所有这些都是在领导小学工作中的极严重的缺点，必须彻底加以纠正。应当明白，不对小学教育作应有的安排，就不可能过渡到十年制普及综合技术教育，就无法使学生获得优良成绩，并消灭留级现象。无论是初级小学教师本人，或是与小学教师的工作成绩有密切利害关系的七年制学校和中等学校中的教师，或国民教育机关的领导者，都必须严重注意小学教学工作的提高。这里，必须估计到由加强初级小学的物质设备起，直到提高小学教师的文化和工作作风止等一系列的问题。正确地解决这些问题，将会为进一步发展苏联学校开辟新的强有力的后备力量。
