Under the guidance of the idea that "agricultural production is the overriding central task in rural work," Hebei Province has achieved certain successes in spring ploughing preparations. According to incomplete statistics, more than 12 million cartloads of fertilizer have been accumulated in more than 30 counties including Chicheng, Laiyuan, and Wu'an. In Changli, Fengrun, and Qian'an counties, in areas near rivers and with pits, the masses were mobilized to dig 110 million catties of river and pit mud. In Qu'yang, Dingxian, and other six counties, 600 new pigsties and more than 100 toilets have been built in 81 townships. Wheat fields in irrigated areas of Neiqiu, Longyao, Baixiang, and Shahe counties have been universally watered once with "frozen water". In the Zhangjiakou area, 58 soil and grass dams have been built along the Hongtang River and the Da and Xiao Yang Rivers, which can collect water for more than 100,000 mu of land in the spring. More than a dozen river dams have been built in the areas of the Ximalin River and the Ancient City River to block water and preserve ice. More than 40 ice-preserving sites have been built in mountainous areas and stream areas, with some ice already more than two feet thick. The entire area is expected to use ice water to irrigate land in the spring, enabling 1.2 million mu of land to be sown in a timely manner.

In the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives, leaders at all levels have grasped the policy of closely integrating with production. After the cadres who are establishing cooperatives arrive in the village, they first inspect production and help the village arrange production. Agricultural production cooperatives that have been newly established or are being established in the Cangxian area are actively engaged in production. In the two cooperatives in the Nan Zhangbai Village of Jianguo County, 100 cartloads of manure were sent out, 140 mu of wheat were rolled, and 100 cartloads of pit soil were dug in seven days during the establishment of the cooperative. Mutual aid teams that are being transformed into cooperatives are also carrying out preparations for spring ploughing, such as sending manure and repairing farm tools.

In mid-January, the Dingxian area sent three inspection teams to Dingxian, Anguo, and Xingtang to focus on inspecting cotton seeds. It was found that many farmers did not preserve enough cotton seeds, and some farmers were preparing to reduce the area planted with cotton. According to this situation, the counties have taken effective measures. On the one hand, through publicizing the general line, they further publicized the importance of planting cotton to the farmers and reversed the farmers' ideas of reducing cotton fields. On the other hand, according to the actual shortage of cotton seeds, the original plan for preserving cotton seeds was revised in order to supply cotton seeds in a timely manner. For example, Wuji County originally planned to preserve 180,000 catties of cotton seeds, but now it has been changed to 420,000 catties. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties also immediately purchased the farmers' lint cotton, and organized private gins in a planned way to solve the difficulties for farmers in processing seed cotton for preservation. In addition, farmers were mobilized to exchange and adjust to solve the problem of insufficient cotton seeds.

In order to lead farmers to do a good job in spring ploughing preparations in a timely and universal manner, ensure timely sowing, increase the production of grain and industrial raw materials, and support national industrial construction, the Hebei Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions to vigorously carry out spring ploughing production work, requiring all localities to prepare the land early to conserve soil moisture, carry out water conservancy projects, and strive to sow seeds in a timely manner even in the event of no rain or little rain in spring; implement the policy of farmers' self-accumulation of fertilizer as the main factor, supplemented by commercial fertilizer, and mobilize farmers to accumulate and apply fertilizer in large quantities; continue to strengthen the field management of wheat to strive for a good wheat harvest; economic departments must, under the unified leadership of the local party and government organs, supply farmers with production materials in a timely manner according to their production needs and purchasing power. Agricultural and forestry departments should focus on agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and actively promote technology to support spring ploughing production.

    河北省加强领导春耕准备工作
    在“农业生产是农村工作中压倒一切的中心任务”的思想指导下，河北省各地春耕准备工作已获得一定成绩。据不完全统计，赤城、涞源、武安等三十余县已积肥一千二百多万车。昌黎、丰润、迁安三县靠河和有坑地区，发动群众挖河、坑泥一亿一千多斤。曲阳、定县等六县的八十一个乡新垒猪圈六百多个、修厕所一百多个。内邱、隆尧、柏乡、沙河等县的水地麦田都普遍浇了一次冻水。张家口专区在洪塘河、大小洋河一带筑起蓄水土草坝五十八条，春天可汇地十多万亩。在洗马林河、古城河等处筑拦河堰十几道，挡水养冰，并在山峪泉溪地带养冰四十余处，有的已养冰二尺多厚。全专区今年预计利用冰水春汇地，可使一百二十万亩地适时播种。
    在建立农业生产合作社工作中，各级领导上已都掌握了紧密结合生产的方针，建社干部到村后，首先检查生产，帮助村里安排生产。沧县专区各地新建和正在建立的农业生产合作社，都在积极进行生产。建国县南张白村的两个社在建社中，七天送出一百多车粪，轧麦一百四十亩，挖坑土一百多车。各地转社的互助组也都进行送粪、修理农具，赶作春耕生产准备。
    定县专区在一月中旬派出三个检查组，到定县、安国、行唐等地重点检查棉花种子情况，发现很多农民没有保存足够的棉种，并有些农民准备缩小种棉面积。各县根据这一情况已采取了有效措施，他们一面通过宣传总路线，进一步向农民宣传种棉重要性，扭转农民缩小棉田的思想。一面又按照实际缺棉种情况，修改了原来保存棉种计划，以便及时供应棉种，如无极县原计划保存棉种十八万斤，现改为四十二万斤。各县供销合作社也立即收购农民的皮棉，并有计划地组织私人轧车，解决农民留种籽棉加工的困难。此外，还发动农民互换调剂，解决棉种不足的问题。
    为了领导农民及时地普遍地做好春耕准备，保证适时播种，以增产粮食和工业原料，支持国家工业建设，河北省人民政府最近又发出大力开展春耕生产工作的指示，要求各地及早整地保墒，兴修水利，争取在春季无雨少雨的情况下，也能适时播种安苗；贯彻农家自积肥料为主，商品肥料为辅的方针，发动农民大量积肥、施肥；继续加强小麦田间管理，争取小麦丰收；经济部门必须在当地党、政机关统一领导下，按照农民生产需要和购买能力，及时供应农民生产资料。农林事业部门要以农业生产合作社、互助组为重点，积极进行技术推广，以支持春耕生产。
