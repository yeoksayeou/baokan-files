Xinhua News Agency, 11th: According to Vietnam News Agency on the 10th: Under the pressure of the Vietnam People's Army's might, the enemy was forced to successively withdraw from three important strongholds, Dak To, Dak Sut, and Dak Pet, north of the capital of Kontum province, during the three days from February 2nd to 4th. These defeated enemy forces did not dare to flee to the capital of Kontum province because it was already surrounded by the Vietnam People's Army and instead fled to the northwest.

The Vietnam People's Army immediately tracked and pursued these fleeing enemy forces, catching up with them in the area north of Kontum city. After a battle, the People's Army killed many enemy soldiers, routed another 1,000 enemy soldiers, and seized 36 tons of ammunition and a large number of weapons. The People's Army is currently searching for the routed enemy hiding in the jungle.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: According to Vietnam News Agency: "Voice of Vietnam" radio commented on the major victory of liberating Kontum province on the 10th, stating that the Vietnam People's Army had entered the capital of Kontum province at 6:00 AM on February 7th. Thus far, the People's Army has basically liberated the entire province of Kontum after thirteen days of fighting.

Kontum province is a large province in the northern Central Highlands of Vietnam and an important strategic area on the entire Vietnamese front. It borders southern Laos and eastern Cambodia to the west, and the liberated areas of Quang Ngai and Quang Nam provinces to the east and northeast. It has an area of 14,000 square kilometers and a population of about 200,000 (mostly ethnic minorities). The people scattered across this vast land mostly live by agriculture, hunting, and animal husbandry. Strategic Highway 14 runs from Saigon through Kontum City to Da Nang.

Currently, the liberated areas of central Vietnam have stretched from the coast all the way to the Lao border, connecting with the newly liberated areas on the Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos.

The victory in Kontum province is the first major victory in the central and southern regions of Vietnam, bringing great excitement and joy to the people of the Central Highlands of the Fifth Lien Khu and the people of Vietnam. The victory in Kontum province proves the bankruptcy of the French aggressors' vicious plot to create discord among the various ethnic groups in Vietnam and to force ethnic minorities to join the Bao Dai puppet army. It is also a heavy blow to the French aggressors who used Kontum province as a springboard to attack the liberated areas of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces. Just as the enemy recently concentrated part of its forces to attack the Tuy Hoa area of Phu Yen province in central and southern Vietnam, the liberation of Kontum province will add new difficulties for the enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th: According to Vietnam News Agency: "Voice of Vietnam" radio commented on Navarre's recent failures in the Red River Delta, stating that the regular army, local forces, and guerrillas of the Vietnamese people in the Red River Delta have recently become more active than before. In less than twenty days in January, they fought the enemy eighteen times, annihilating from a platoon to a battalion of enemy troops each time, and removing or forcing the enemy to withdraw from more than twenty strongholds, including the important strongholds of Phu Luu and Hoang Dan controlling the banks of the Dai River, and many important strongholds in Thai Binh province such as the salt fields controlling the salt marsh area.

The commentary continued that although the enemy carried out many "sweeps" into the increasingly expanding people's guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases in Guang'an, Ha Dong, Nam Dinh, and northern Luc Giang, the enemy could only concentrate five or six mobile battalions for each "sweep"; while in the several "sweeps" before the end of 1953, the enemy had concentrated more than twenty battalions at a time. The enemy's recent "sweeps," like the previous "sweeps," have all been crushed.

The commentary pointed out that, contrary to the facts and Navarre's boastful propaganda (that he would concentrate his forces to "pacify" the Red River Delta), the threat to enemy forces in the Red River Delta has never been as serious as it is now since the Hoa Binh campaign at the end of 1951 and the beginning of 1952.

The commentary concluded that the above-mentioned defeats of the enemy in the Red River Delta are only the initial setbacks it has suffered since its forces were dispersed to various fronts; as the military situation develops, Navarre will have to disperse his forces even more. He will inevitably suffer even more serious defeats on the Red River Delta battlefield.

### 越南人民军追歼崑嵩以北的逃敌  “越南之声”指出红河三角洲敌军将遭到更大失败

    越南人民军追歼崑嵩以北的逃敌
    “越南之声”指出红河三角洲敌军将遭到更大失败
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社十日讯：在越南人民军的威势的压迫下，敌人被迫在二月二日到四日的三天中接连撤出了位于崑嵩省省会以北的达克陶、达克苏特、达克培特等三处重要据点。这些溃败的敌军不敢逃往崑嵩省省会而向西北逃窜，因为当时崑嵩省省会已被越南人民军包围。
    越南人民军立即跟踪追击这些溃逃的敌军，在崑嵩城以北地区追上了逃敌。经过一场战斗，人民军击毙许多敌军，并击溃另外一千名敌军；缴获弹药三十六吨和大量的武器。现人民军正搜索躲藏在丛林中的溃敌。
      【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台十日评述解放崑嵩省的重大胜利说，越南人民军已在二月七日早晨六时进入崑嵩省省会。至此为止，人民军经过十三天战斗，基本解放了崑嵩省全省。
    崑嵩省是中越高原北部的一个大省份，也是整个越南战线上的一个重要的战略地区。它西邻寮国南部和高棉东部，东面和东北与广义、广南两省的解放区接连，面积一万四千平方公里，人口约二十多万（大部是少数民族）。散居在这片广阔土地上的人民大都靠农业、狩猎和饲畜为生。第十四号战略公路从西贡经过崑嵩城到岘港。
         目前，中越的解放区已从海岸一直伸展到寮国边界，并与寮国南部波罗芬高原上新解放的地区连成一片。
    崑嵩省的胜利是中越南部地区的第一个重大胜利，这次胜利给中越第五联区高原上的人民以及越南全国人民带来了极大的兴奋和喜悦。崑嵩省的胜利证明了法国侵略者企图在越南各族人民中制造不和以及强迫少数民族参加保大伪军的恶毒阴谋的破产，同时也是对利用崑嵩省作为进攻广南和广义两省解放区跳板的法国侵略者一个沉重的打击。正当敌人在不久前集结部分兵力进攻中越南部富安省绥和地区的时候，崑嵩省的解放将给敌人增加新的困难。
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”电台评述最近纳瓦尔在红河三角洲的失败说：越南人民在红河三角洲的正规军、地方部队和游击队最近比以前更加活跃了。在一月份不到二十天中，与敌人作战十八次，每次都歼灭敌军一排到一营，拔除和强迫敌人撤出二十多处据点，其中包括控制带河沿岸的府流和黄丹据点，以及太平省内控制盐芦河地区的盐田等许多重要据点。
    评论接着说，敌人虽然向广安、河东、南定和禄江北部的日益扩展的人民游击区和游击基地进行许多次“扫荡”，但是敌人每次“扫荡”所能集中的兵力只有五、六个机动营；而在一九五三年年底以前的几次“扫荡”中，敌人曾一次集中过二十多个营。敌人最近的“扫荡”也正如前几次“扫荡”一样，都被粉碎了。
    评论指出，事实和纳瓦尔的大言不惭的宣传（他说他要集中兵力来“绥靖”红河三角洲）相反，自一九五一年年底到一九五二年年初的和平战役以来，红河三角洲的敌军所受到的威胁从来没有现在这样严重。
    评论最后说，上述敌军在红河三角洲的败绩只不过是它从兵力分散到各战线去之后初次受到的挫折；随着军事形势的发展，纳瓦尔将来不得不把他的兵力更加分散。在红河三角洲战场上必然会遭到更严重的失败。
