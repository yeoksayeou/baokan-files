    Investigation of Pond Fish Farming in Beijing

    Xiao Ying, Readers' Letters Group of this Newspaper
    Beijing is undergoing large-scale construction, the population is increasing daily, and the need for non-staple foods by citizens is increasing greatly. Among them, the need for aquatic products has increased. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Administration for Industry and Commerce, the sales volume of fish in Beijing in the eleven months of 1953 increased by 66% compared with the entire year of 1952. Fish should be a cheap non-staple food, but the price of fish in Beijing is higher than other non-staple foods. Taking the market price in mid-December 1953 as an example: the wholesale price of carp was 5,200 yuan per catty, and the retail price was 6,000 yuan; the wholesale price of crucian carp was 3,500 yuan per catty, and the highest retail price was 5,000 yuan; the wholesale price of mandarin fish was 7,500 yuan per catty, and the retail price reached 9,000 yuan. In the vegetable market, you can often hear housewives say: "Fish is too expensive!"
    The fish sold in Beijing, marine fish mainly come from Tanggu, Beitang, Shanhaiguan, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Qingdao, Shanghai and other places, freshwater fish mainly come from Baotou, Fengzhen, Xiaogan, Hankou, Jinan, Xuzhou, Mingguang, Anci, Baodi, Gaobeidian and other places. The aquatic products needed by the city's citizens are completely dependent on distant places, which is the main reason for the small quantity and high price of fish in the market. The best way to solve this problem is to develop fish farming on the water surfaces under the jurisdiction of Beijing.

    Beijing has very good conditions for developing freshwater fish farming.

    According to our preliminary investigation, the water surface that can be used for fish farming in Beijing is extremely wide: (1) Lakes and swamps cover more than 10,000 mu. With a little tidying up, they can all become excellent fish ponds. In particular, Kunming Lake in the western suburbs, Dapaizi in the southern suburbs, and Shichahai in the urban area have even better conditions. If fish farming can be fully utilized and developed, with an average annual production of 200 catties of fish per mu, these water surfaces can produce 2 million catties of fish annually.
  (2) It is estimated that there are about 800 mu of ponds in total. There are reservoirs in Gaobeidian in the eastern suburbs; distributed in Liulitun, Xin's Village and Majiabao in the southern suburbs are kiln pits where mud was extracted for manufacturing bricks and tiles in the past, which have accumulated water all year round. Although these water surfaces have the disadvantage of poor water source flow; because the water surface is small, it is easy to control. It is estimated that using them for fish farming can produce an average of 250 catties of fish per mu, and 200,000 catties of fish can be produced annually. (3) There are about 20,000 mu of paddy fields in the suburbs. We can choose those with sufficient water, convenient water injection and drainage, and relatively high water retention capacity to promote rice-fish farming. Because fish can eat pests in the field and excrement can be used as fertilizer, which is beneficial to rice cultivation. If after several years of promotion work, there are 10,000 mu of rice fields for fish farming, with an output of 50 catties of fish per mu, a total of 500,000 catties of fish can be produced annually. (4) Rivers. Major rivers such as the Yongding River, Bai River, Qing River, Chang River, Liangshui River, Feng River, and Long River can also be used to draw water into ponds for appropriate utilization.

    The above-mentioned water surfaces that can be used for fish farming are generally rich in water, semi-transparent in color, rich in organic matter, the water temperature is close to 30 degrees Celsius in summer, the bottom is mostly muddy, the water quality is good, and there are many planktonic animals and plants for fish to eat, which have superior conditions for fish farming; and with the progress of Beijing's municipal construction, the water surface in the suburbs will gradually expand, and the fish farming industry will have better development prospects in the future.

    Current Fish Farming Situation in Beijing

      (1) The Garden Bureau controls the largest water surface in the city, with a total of 5,641 mu. Except for a small number of fish stocked in Kunming Lake and Beihai to eat aquatic plants, the rest have not been utilized. (2) The Reed Pond Management Office controls a water surface of 3,295 mu. From 1951 to now, in the past three years, only more than 70,000 fish fry have been stocked in ponds such as Liulitun in the eastern suburbs and Dapaizi in the southern suburbs. All other water surfaces have not been utilized. (3) The water surface within the Peking University campus is about 150 mu. In 1951, the former Yenching University Farm stocked about 90,000 fish fry. (4) The fish pond of the Majiabao Ministry of Railways Farm is about 10 mu, and the fish farming results are very good. This year, 3,000 catties of fish have been caught, and another 662 catties of fish fry, about 80,000, have been stocked. It is estimated that 5,000 catties can be harvested next year. (5) The mass fish farming industry in Majiabao was quite developed in the past, but during the Japanese occupation and reactionary rule, the people's living standards declined, and the number of fish farmers gradually decreased. Most of the old fish ponds have become reed ponds or are completely abandoned. At present, about 12 mu of kiln pit storage water is used for fish farming. This year, 400 catties of fish fry, about 5,000, have been stocked.
  (6) Gaobeidian in the eastern suburbs, on the north bank of the Tonghui River, is the most developed area for fish farming in the suburbs of Beijing. There are about 80 fish farming households, with a total fish pond area of more than 251 mu. The large ones have an area of 7 mu, and the small ones have an area of 1 or 2 mu. The depth is generally about 5 feet. These fish ponds are distributed on both sides of the Tonghui River, and water is drawn from the Tonghui River once every summer flood season. However, farmers only raise grass carp (locally known as "thick fish") for edible fish. Stocking is done every spring, and feeding is stopped after 100 days of feeding. Harvesting begins in August. Fish farmer Lin Hua reported that fish farmers in Gaobeidian can earn an average of 1.5 million yuan per mu of water surface. Because fish farming requires little capital and yields high profits, the area of fish ponds is still expanding. In addition, the masses in Xin's Village in the eastern suburbs also use kiln pits for fish farming.

    At present, many people in Beijing are interested in fish farming, but due to the difficulty in supplying fish fry and the lack of sufficient attention from the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry to mass fish farming, and the failure of the Central Aquatic Products Management Bureau to promptly supervise and help the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry, the fish farming industry in the suburbs of Beijing has not been able to develop as it should. Some public water surfaces are not managed by anyone, and some fish farming is only for weeding and ornamental purposes. Many agencies in charge of water surfaces are afraid that fish farming will be unprofitable or emphasize that there are no technicians, so most of the water surfaces that can be used for fish farming are used to grow reeds or are completely abandoned.

    Preliminary opinions on developing fish farming in Beijing in the future

    In order to develop the capital's fish farming industry, we put forward the following preliminary opinions: (1) The more than 3,000 mu of water surface under the jurisdiction of the Reed Pond Management Office should focus on fish farming, convert reed ponds into fish ponds, and do a good job of dredging sludge and clearing ponds before fish farming. (2) The more than 5,000 mu of water surface under the jurisdiction of the Garden Bureau should be actively used for fish farming. (3) State-owned farms should choose appropriate paddy fields for fish farming to create experience and promote it to the masses. (4) Abandoned ponds that are currently unmanaged should be uniformly managed and utilized by the Reed Pond Management Office. (5) In order to better complete the above work, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry should establish appropriate agencies to lead the public water surface and the private fish farming industry, give appropriate investment, promote advanced fish farming technology, increase the fish yield per unit water surface, and set an example for other cities with conditions for fish farming.

    北京市湖塘养鱼情况的调查
    中央农业部水产管理总局　金炤
    本报读者来信组　萧颖
    北京市正在进行着大规模的建设，人口日渐增多，市民生活不断改善，副食品的需要量大为增加。其中水产品需要的增长情况，据北京市人民政府工商管理局统计，北京一九五三年十一个月的鱼类销售量较一九五二年全年销售量增加了百分之六十六。本来鱼类应该是一种廉价的副食品，但北京市鱼类价格却较其他副食品高。拿一九五三年十二月中旬的市场价格为例：鲤鱼批发价每斤为五千二百元，零售价为六千元；鲫鱼批发价每斤为三千五百元，零售最高价为五千元；桂鱼批发价每斤七千五百元，零售价达九千元。在菜市场里，常常可以听到主妇们说：“鱼太贵了！”
    北京市所销售的鱼类，海鱼主要来自塘沽、北塘、山海关、秦皇岛、烟台、青岛、上海等地，淡水鱼主要来自包头、丰镇、孝感、汉口、济南、徐州、明光以及安次、宝坻、高碑店等地。全市市民所需的水产完全仰给于远地，这就是市场中鱼类量少价高的主要原因。解决这一问题的最好办法，是发展北京市所辖水面的养鱼事业。
    北京市发展淡水养鱼业的条件非常良好
    根据我们初步调查，北京市可以用作养鱼的水面极为宽广：（一）湖沼约一万余亩，只要稍加整理，都能成为优良的鱼塘。特别是西郊的昆明湖，南郊的大泡子，市区的什刹海，条件更为优良。如果能充分利用发展养鱼业，平均每亩每年可产鱼二百斤，这些水面每年就能生产二百万斤鱼类。
  （二）水池估计共约八百余亩。在东郊高碑店有贮水池；分布在六里屯、辛四村及南郊马家堡各地的是过去制造砖瓦取泥的窑坑，现已常年积水。这些水面虽然有水源不通畅的缺点；但因水面小，容易控制，用作养鱼估计每亩平均可产鱼二百五十斤，每年即可产鱼二十万斤以上。（三）郊区水稻田共约二万亩，可以选择水量不缺、注水排水方便、保水力比较大的推广稻田养鱼。因为鱼在田中能吃害虫，粪可作肥料，对于稻作有益无害。如果经过几年的推广工作，有一万亩稻田养鱼，每亩产鱼五十斤，每年共可产鱼五十万斤。（四）河流。主要河流如永定河、白河、清河、长河、凉水河、凤河、龙河等也可以引水为池，加以适当利用。
    上述可以养鱼的水面，一般的都是水量丰富、水色半透明，富有机物，水温夏季近摄氏三十度，底质以泥土居多，水质良好，多浮游性动物植物供鱼类食用，具备了养鱼的优越条件；而且随着北京市政建设的进行，市郊水面亦将逐步扩大，将来养鱼事业将会有更好的发展前途。
    北京市现在养鱼情况
      （一）园林处掌握全市最大的水面共有五千六百四十一亩，除昆明湖及北海放养少数的鱼类来吃食水草以外，其余均未利用。（二）苇塘管理所掌握水面共三千二百九十五亩。从一九五一年至今，三年来仅在东郊六里屯、南苑大泡子等塘放养鱼种七万多尾，其余所有水面均未利用。（三）北京大学校园内水面共约一百五十亩。一九五一年由前燕京大学农场放养鱼种约九万尾。（四）马家堡铁道部农场鱼池约有十亩，养鱼成绩很好，今年已捕鱼三千斤，又继续放养鱼种六百六十二斤，约八万尾，估计明年可收五千斤。（五）马家堡群众养鱼事业过去相当发达，但在日寇及反动统治时代，人民生活水平下降，养鱼户逐渐减少，旧日鱼池多已变成苇塘或完全荒废。目前利用窑坑贮水养鱼的共约十二亩，本年放养鱼种四百斤，约五千尾。
  （六）东郊高碑店在通惠河北岸，是京郊养鱼事业最发达的地方，养鱼的约八十户，鱼池总面积二百五十一亩多，大的面积七亩，小的一、二亩不等，深度一般在五尺左右。这些鱼池分布在通惠河的两旁，每年夏季大水期由通惠河引水一次。但农民养殖食用鱼类仅草鱼（土名厚鱼）一种。每年春季放养，饲养一百天后就停止给食，八月间开始捕捞。养鱼户林华反映：高碑店养鱼户每亩水面平均可收益一百五十万元；由于养鱼本小利大，鱼池面积还在扩充。此外东郊辛四村群众也有利用窑坑养鱼的。
    现在北京市不少群众对养鱼事业是有兴趣的，但由于鱼种供应困难以及北京市农林局对于群众养鱼业没有足够重视，中央水产管理总局又未能及时地给北京市农林局以督促和帮助，致使京郊养鱼事业不能得到应有的发展。而公有的水面，有些还没有人管理，有些养鱼只是为了除草和观赏。不少管辖水面的机关害怕养鱼无利或者强调没有技术人员，以致大部分可以养鱼的水面都用以种芦苇或完全荒废。
    对北京市今后发展养鱼事业的初步意见
    为了发展首都的养鱼事业，我们提出以下的初步意见：（一）苇塘管理所管辖的三千多亩水面应以养鱼为主，将苇塘改为鱼塘，并在养鱼以前做好挖取污泥及清塘工作。（二）园林处管辖的五千多亩水面应该积极用于养鱼。（三）国营农场应选择适当的水田来养鱼，以创造经验，向群众推广。（四）现在无人管理的荒废池塘应由苇塘管理所统一管理利用。（五）为了更好地完成上述工作，北京市农林局应成立适当机构领导公有水面和民间的养鱼事业，并给以适当投资，推广先进养鱼技术，提高单位水面的鱼产量，给其他有条件养鱼的都市树立一个榜样。
