A New Period of Sino-Soviet Cultural Exchange
General Secretary of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association  Qian Junrui

    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance four years ago opened a new period of friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. Cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union is an extremely important aspect of realizing this sincere unity, friendship, and cooperation.

    Cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union has a long history. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his work "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "The Chinese found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. ... The salvo of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." He also said: "Only at this time did a brand new era appear in the thinking and life of the Chinese people." From that time on, thanks to the efforts of China's advanced figures, the theory of the Soviet revolution was introduced to China, Soviet literature was introduced to China, and Soviet drama and film, Soviet art and prints were also introduced to China. All of this brought great encouragement to the Chinese people under heavy oppression and was therefore greatly loved by the Chinese people. The reactionary rulers of old China, from the Northern Warlords to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, treated Soviet culture as a monstrous flood. They used all kinds of shameless and barbaric means to contain the spread of Soviet culture. Those who read progressive Soviet books had to suffer torture and even death. But all these means were in vain. Because the suffocating Chinese people regarded information about the socialist Soviet Union as fresh air.

    In the Chinese People's Liberation Areas before the founding of the People's Republic of China, Soviet culture was widely and deeply disseminated. Despite extremely difficult material conditions, Soviet books were still printed in large quantities, even circulated through mimeographing and hand-copying. There, Soviet books and periodicals played a huge educational role. Just to give one example, "Krikun" is still a cautionary tale for Chinese journalists today, and as everyone knows, this is a character in the Soviet writer Korneichuk's play "The Front."

    The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution ended the old China and founded the new China, a country where the people are their own masters. Under this new historical condition, the friendly unity of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, fixed by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, has become more consolidated and developed, and cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union have also developed vigorously on an unprecedented scale.

    China is an ancient country and also a young country. Our ancestors created a rich and brilliant culture and made great contributions to all mankind. However, due to long-term feudal rule, especially in the last hundred years, due to imperialist aggression and oppression, China has not only lagged behind economically, but also culturally. After the Chinese people won the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, they must build their motherland into a great socialist country and also build a new socialist culture. Therefore, Sino-Soviet cultural exchange has acquired new and even greater significance for the Chinese people. On the one hand, this exchange helps the peoples of China and the Soviet Union to enhance mutual understanding and friendship through various cultural tools; on the other hand, this exchange first helps the advancement of all construction work of the Chinese people and promotes the construction of our new culture.

    In the past four years, the scale and achievements of Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges have been enormous.

    In terms of publishing, from the founding of the People's Republic of China to the end of 1953, according to incomplete statistics, China translated and published 5,036 kinds of Soviet books. Among them, 52 kinds of Lenin's works were published, with a total of more than 3 million copies; 56 kinds of Stalin's works were published, with a total of more than 9 million copies. It is particularly important to point out that the publication of Stalin's Complete Works is a major event in the spiritual life of our people, and the first and second volumes that have been published have been printed in one million copies each. These classic works of Marxism-Leninism, as well as the documents of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have played a great educational role for the vast number of people in our country, especially the cadres.

    Soviet literary books have been loved by the broad masses of the Chinese people, especially the youth. These books powerfully appeal to our readers with their high ideological content and excellent skills. Books such as "How Steel Was Tempered," "A Common Soldier," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," "A Real Man," "Far From Moscow," and "Harvest" have had a particularly great impact. The characters in these books live in the hearts of the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, in the hearts of the socialist builders of new China, and in the hearts of Chinese students, encouraging their struggles, work, and study, and guiding them to overcome all difficulties and forge ahead bravely.

    Many Soviet plays have been performed in Chinese theaters. Each performance has been warmly welcomed by the audience. The play "Dawn Over Moscow" has been performed in many parts of the country and has a particularly large number of audiences. The theater in Beijing is now performing Sofronov's play "One Cannot Live Like That," helping us to improve our political vigilance and the ideological transformation of old scientific and technical personnel. Watching Soviet movies is an indispensable part of the daily life of the Chinese people. The audience of films such as "Unforgettable 1919" and "Kuban Cossacks" reached about 20 million.

    Introducing Soviet exhibitions is an effective way to help the masses understand the Soviet Union. In China, some large-scale exhibitions have been held, such as the Soviet Construction Picture Exhibition, the Stalin's 70th Birthday Exhibition, the Lenin's Life and Career Exhibition, and the Soviet Propaganda Painting and Cartoon Exhibition. In order to come to these exhibitions to learn, some viewers came from afar carrying luggage. As for small exhibitions, they have penetrated into factory workshops, rural areas, and street store windows, and the number is countless. In large cities such as Shanghai, fixed street window exhibitions of considerable scale have also appeared.

    In the past four years, exchanges between cultural delegations and representatives of China and the Soviet Union have been increasing. They have made great contributions to the cultural exchange between the two countries. Every Soviet delegation and cultural figure who came to China contacted and discussed with Chinese cultural circles. They brought the achievements of Soviet culture to us, and many of their lectures and symposium speeches have been translated and published. Every Chinese delegation to the Soviet Union was warmly received by the Soviet people and given full opportunities to study and visit, returning with great success.

    In order to learn from the Soviet Union more directly and cultivate talents to build the motherland, our country has sent nearly 2,000 students to study in the Soviet Union in the past four years. Under the kind guidance of Soviet teachers and the care of Soviet comrades, they are studying smoothly.

    The Chinese intellectual community is responding to Chairman Mao Zedong's call and launching an enthusiastic movement to learn from the Soviet Union. The Chinese scientific community warmly welcomes the resolution made by the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on further expanding and strengthening cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientists. Dr. Qian Chongshu, director of the Institute of Plant Classification of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, can represent the views of general Chinese scientists: "I very much need to learn from advanced Soviet science, so even though I am seventy years old, I am still actively learning Russian. I wholeheartedly welcome the resolution passed by the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences." Now, Chinese biologists and agronomists are studying the theories of Michurin, Lysenko, and Lepeshinskaya, and the medical community is studying Pavlov's theories and implementing advanced treatment methods such as tissue therapy and sleep therapy. The Chinese literary and art circles are learning the creative method of socialist realism. It should also be pointed out that the Soviet experts who have been hired to work in China have given great help to Chinese engineering and technical personnel and cultural and educational workers. This kind of learning is not only theoretical research, but also quickly applied to practice, and has achieved great results. Advanced Soviet theories and experiences have greatly broadened the horizons of Chinese intellectuals and helped them criticize and gradually correct the influence of bourgeois ideology they have received.

    The Chinese people are very excited to note that China's cultural achievements have received great attention from the Soviet people. Comrade Mao Zedong's works are highly admired by Soviet readers; Chinese dramas "Qu Yuan," "The West Chamber," "The White-Haired Girl," "Growing Up in Battle," and "San Cha Kou" have been successfully performed in the Soviet Union. Chinese films are shown not only in Soviet cities, but also in Soviet collective farms. Outstanding Chinese literary works have won Stalin Prizes and are widely circulated in the Soviet Union. Soviet scientists are enthusiastically and concernedly studying the achievements of Chinese science. Academician Lysenko's high evaluation of Chinese farming experience has become the motto for promoting the transformation and development of our national heritage in the Chinese scientific community. In introducing Chinese culture to the Soviet people, we have done some work, but our work is not enough, far from meeting the wishes of Soviet comrades, and we need to strengthen it greatly in the future.

    It is very clear that the cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union in the past four years have greatly promoted the close unity of our two peoples and have given great help to our country's construction. Here, we would like to express our sincere and cordial respect to the great Soviet people and the comrades in the Soviet cultural circles. The Chinese people are carrying out vigorous work to build socialism. A high tide of cultural construction will follow the high tide of economic construction and appear in the new China. There is no doubt that the development of Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges will promote the arrival of this high tide.

    中苏文化交流的新时期
    中苏友好协会总会总干事  钱俊瑞
    四年前中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，开辟了中苏两国人民友好合作的新时期。中苏两国的文化交流就是实现这种真诚团结、友好、合作的一个极其重要的方面。
    中苏两国的文化交流有着长远的历史。毛泽东同志在他的著作“论人民民主专政”里面说：“中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。……十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”他又说：“这时，也只是在这时，中国人从思想到生活，才出现了一个崭新的时期。”从这时起，在中国先进人物们的努力下，苏联革命的理论传到中国来了，苏联的文学传到中国来了，苏联的戏剧与电影传到中国来了，苏联的美术、版画也传到中国来了。这一切给在重压下的中国人民带来巨大的鼓舞，因此受到中国人民的极大热爱。旧中国从北洋军阀到蒋介石匪帮这些反动统治者，对待苏联文化，都是视若洪水猛兽的。他们用百般无耻与野蛮的手段，来遏制苏联文化的传布。读进步的苏联书籍的人曾不得不遭苦刑和杀身之祸。然而这一切手段都是徒劳。因为在窒息中的中国人民，对于社会主义苏联的信息有如清新的空气一样。
    在中华人民共和国成立以前的中国人民解放区里，苏联的文化得到了广泛深入的传播。尽管是在极端困难的物质条件下，苏联的书籍仍是大量的印刷，甚至用油印、手抄的办法流传。在那里，苏联的书刊起着巨大的教育作用。随便举一个例子，
  “克里空”直到今天仍是中国新闻工作者的一个戒条，而大家知道，这乃是苏联作家考涅楚克的剧本
  “前线”中的一个角色。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，结束了旧的中国，创立了新的中国，人民自己当家作主的国家。在这种新的历史条件下，由中苏友好同盟互助条约固定起来的中苏两国人民的友好团结更加巩固和发展了，中苏两国的文化交流也以前所未有的规模蓬勃地发展起来了。
    中国是一个古老的国家，又是一个年青的国家。我们的先人曾创造了丰富的、灿烂的文化，对整个人类有过极大的贡献。可是，由于长期的封建统治，特别是近百年来，由于帝国主义的侵略与压迫，中国不仅在经济上落后了，而且在文化上也落后了。中国人民取得了新民主主义革命的胜利之后，就要把自己的祖国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，同时也就要建设新的社会主义的文化。因此，中苏文化交流对于中国人民来说，获得了新的更加重大的意义。一方面，这种交流通过各种文化工具，帮助着中苏两国人民增进相互的了解和友谊；另一方面，这种交流首先是帮助中国人民的各项建设工作的前进，推动我们建设自己的新文化。
    四年来，中苏文化交流的规模和成就是巨大的。
    在出版方面，从中华人民共和国成立起到一九五三年年底止，据不完全统计，中国所翻译出版的苏联书籍达五千零三十六种。其中列宁著作出版了五十二种，共印了三百多万册；斯大林著作出版了五十六种，共印了九百多万册。特别要提出的是斯大林全集的出版，这是我国人民的精神生活中的一个重大事件，已出版的第一卷和第二卷都印行了一百万册。这些马克思列宁主义的经典著作，以及苏联共产党的文献，对于我国广大人民，首先是干部起了极大的教育作用。
    苏联的文学书籍，受到了中国广大群众特别是青年群众的热爱。这些书籍以其高度的思想性与卓越的技巧强有力地感召着我国的读者。“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“普通一兵”、“卓娅与舒拉的故事”、“真正的人”、“远离莫斯科的地方”、
  “收获”等书影响尤大。这些书中的人物活在朝鲜前线的中国人民志愿军的战士们的心中，活在新中国社会主义建设者们的心中，活在中国青年学生们的心中，鼓舞着他们的战斗、工作和学习，指导着他们克服一切困难，奋勇前进。
    中国的剧院里演出了不少的苏联剧本。每次演出都受到观众的热烈欢迎。“曙光照耀着莫斯科”一剧，曾在全国许多地区演出，拥有特别众多的观众。现在北京的剧院正在上演索佛朗诺夫的剧本
  “非这样生活不可”，帮助我们提高政治警觉和对旧科学技术人员的思想改造工作。看苏联电影更是中国人民群众日常生活中不可缺少的事情。“难忘的一九一九年”、“库班哥萨克”各影片的观众达到了二千万人次左右的数目。
    介绍苏联的展览会是帮助群众认识苏联的有效形式。在中国，曾经举办过一些大型的展览会，像苏联建设图片展览会、斯大林七十寿辰展览会、列宁生平事业展览会、苏联宣传画和讽刺画展览会等。为了到这些展览会上来学习，有些观众从远道背负着行李赶来。至于小型的展览会，则已深入到工厂的车间、农村和街道商店的橱窗，且数目是不可胜计的。如上海等大城市里，还出现了固定的相当规模的街头橱窗展览。
    四年来，中苏两国文化界代表团和代表的来往日益增多。他们对于两国的文化交流有巨大的贡献。每一个来华的苏联代表团和文化界人士，都和中国的文化界接触、座谈，他们把苏联文化的成就带给了我们，他们的讲稿和座谈会发言，有许多已经翻译出版。每一个到苏联的中国代表团，总是受到苏联人民的热情接待，得到充分的学习和参观的机会，满载而归。
    为了更直接地向苏联学习，培养建设祖国的人才，四年来我国派遣了近二千名留学生，到苏联学习。他们在苏联教师的亲切教导下和苏联同志的关怀下，顺利地进行学习。
    中国知识界响应毛泽东主席的号召，展开着热烈的学习苏联运动。中国科学界热烈欢迎苏联科学院主席团会议所作的关于进一步扩大和加强中苏科学家合作的决议。中国科学院植物分类研究所所长钱崇澍博士的话可以代表一般中国科学家的意见：
  “我十分需要学习苏联的先进科学，所以我虽然已经七十岁，还在积极学习俄文。我衷心欢迎苏联科学院主席团会议通过的决议。”现在，中国的生物学家、农学家们学习着米丘林、李森科和列别辛斯卡亚的学说，医学界学习着巴甫洛夫的学说，并实行了组织疗法、睡眠疗法等先进的治疗方法。中国的文艺界则学习着社会主义现实主义的创作方法。还要指出的是，应聘来中国工作的苏联专家们对中国的工程技术人员和文化教育工作人员给了巨大的帮助。这种学习，不仅是理论上的钻研，而且很快地应用于实践，收到很大的成效。苏联的先进理论与经验大大扩展了中国知识分子们的眼界，并帮助他们批判和逐步纠正自己所受到的资产阶级思想的影响。
    中国人民十分兴奋地注视到，中国的文化成就受到苏联人民的极大重视。毛泽东同志的著作，受到苏联读者的热烈推崇；中国戏剧“屈原”、“西厢记”、“白毛女”、“在战斗中成长”、“三岔口”已在苏联成功地演出。中国影片不仅在苏联各城市，而且在苏联的集体农庄中放映。中国的优秀文学著作获得斯大林奖金，并在苏联广泛流传。苏联的科学家们热诚和关切地在研究中国科学的成果。李森科院士对于中国农作经验的高度评价成为推动中国科学界改造和发扬我国民族遗产的座右铭。在向苏联人民介绍中国文化方面，我们曾作了一些工作，但我们的工作做得很不够，远不能满足苏联同志们的愿望，需要我们今后大力加强。
    很显然，中苏两国四年来的文化交流，已经大大促进了我们两国人民的紧密团结，已经给我国的建设以巨大的帮助。在这里，我们特向伟大的苏联人民和苏联文化界的同志们致以诚挚和亲切的敬意。中国人民正在进行着蓬蓬勃勃的建设社会主义的工作。一个文化建设的高潮将紧跟着经济建设的高潮之后在新中国出现。毫无疑问，中苏文化交流的发展将促使这个高潮的到来。
