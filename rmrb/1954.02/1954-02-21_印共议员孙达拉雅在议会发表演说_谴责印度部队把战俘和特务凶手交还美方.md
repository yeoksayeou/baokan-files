Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 19th: P. Sundarayya, a Communist Party of India (CPI) Member of Parliament, delivered a speech in the Indian Council of States on February 17th, criticizing the work of the Indian Custodial Forces in Korea and condemning the transfer of seventeen special agent murderers to the U.S. side. He stated: The Indian Custodial Forces did not take action to break up the terrorist organizations in the Korean POW camps, with the result that explanatory work with the POWs could not be carried out for a full ninety days. He also condemned the return of POWs to the United Nations Command, saying that this action meant forcibly enlisting them into the armies of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee. He continued: "This is nothing more than being intimidated by the threats of the U.S. side. Worst of all, we detained seventeen special agent murderers who committed murder in the Korean POW camps. Witnesses must be summoned, and trials must begin. The trial began, but because the United Nations Command refused to allow witnesses to come, we handed these special agent murderers back under protest. But, what is the use of protesting?"

    印共议员孙达拉雅在议会发表演说
    谴责印度部队把战俘和特务凶手交还美方
    【新华社新德里十九日电】印度国会共产党议员普·孙达拉雅二月十七日在印度国会联邦院发表演说，批评印度看管部队在朝鲜的工作，并且谴责把十七名特务凶手移交给美方。他说：印度看管部队并没有采取行动来打破在朝鲜战俘营中的恐怖组织，结果是，对战俘的解释工作不能进行整整九十天。他还谴责把战俘交还给联合国军方面，他说，这个行动意味着把他们强迫征入蒋介石和李承晚军队。他接着说：“这不是别的，就是因为被美方的威胁吓倒了。最糟糕的是，我们拘留了十七个在朝鲜战俘营中犯了谋杀罪的特务凶手。必须传唤证人、开始审讯。审讯开始了，但是由于联合国军司令部不肯让证人前来，我们就在抗议下把这些特务凶手交还了。但是，抗议有什么用处呢？”
