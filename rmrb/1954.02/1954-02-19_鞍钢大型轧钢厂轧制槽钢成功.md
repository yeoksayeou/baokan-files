Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill successfully rolled China's first Grade A channel steel on February 12th. This type of channel steel is 300 mm wide and 7.5 mm thick, and is intended for use in building factories and bridges. Rolling channel steel is much more difficult than rolling heavy steel rails and round steel, and the steel is prone to roller breakage if the temperature is even slightly low. Before this rolling, the factory's employees, under the guidance of Soviet experts, made full preparations. The workers were in high spirits and offered guarantees: they must follow operating procedures and roll China's first channel steel well. At just after nine o'clock on the morning of the 12th, the factory director issued the order, and the steel billet was poured out of the heating furnace and ran onto the roller table, then smoothly passed through the last rolling mill, turning into channel steel. At this time, all the employees and Soviet experts were very excited. Soviet expert Karnilov warmly shook the workers' hands and said very happily: "China's first channel steel has been rolled out!" After strict inspection by experts, it was proven that the first channel steel fully met the quality standards.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂轧制槽钢成功
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂在二月十二日胜利地轧出了我国第一根甲种槽钢。这种槽钢宽三百粍、厚七点五粍，是供给建筑工厂和桥梁用的。轧制槽钢，比轧制重型钢轨、圆钢艰难得多，钢的温度稍低一点就容易断辊。此次轧制之前，该厂职工在苏联专家指导之下，做了充分的准备工作。工人们的情绪很高，纷纷提出保证：一定要执行操作规程，轧好中国第一根槽钢。十二日早上九点多钟，厂长发出命令，钢胚就从加热炉倾吐出来，跑在辊道上，接着顺利地穿过最后一道轧钢机，变成了槽钢。这时全体职工和苏联专家都非常兴奋。苏联专家卡尔尼洛夫热情地握住工人的手，十分高兴地说：“中国第一根槽钢轧出来了！”经过专家严格检查，证明第一根槽钢完全合乎质量标准。
