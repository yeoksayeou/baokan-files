    Minsheng Shipping Company Embarks on the Bright Road of State Capitalism
    Tong Shaosheng, Deputy General Manager of Minsheng Shipping Company
    Minsheng Shipping Company has only been reorganized into a joint state-private enterprise since September 1952, but the changes in the company itself have been significant. I have personally witnessed Minsheng Shipping Company transforming from a decadent old capitalist enterprise into a vibrant new enterprise. I deeply feel that the transformation of Minsheng Shipping Company into a joint state-private enterprise, taking the path of state capitalism, is truly a bright road.
    Minsheng Shipping Company is the largest private shipping company in the country, with a history of over twenty years. However, due to its past bloated and unwieldy structure and poor management, it incurred losses year after year. After liberation, although the People's Government continuously provided loans and assistance, it was still operated according to capitalist methods, and the management was still the old system. Therefore, it still could not reverse the situation of annual losses. In the three years after liberation, it lost over 130 billion yuan. This was truly detrimental to the country, detrimental to the enterprise, and detrimental to the workers. Under these circumstances, the company's board of directors requested the People's Government to form a joint state-private enterprise. The Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government accepted this request and invested 100 billion yuan in the company. From September 1st of the year before last, it was reorganized into a joint state-private enterprise, and the Ministry of Transportation also sent cadres to represent the state shares and participate in the board of directors. Subsequently, in response to the specific situation of the company, a series of democratic reforms were carried out, management was improved, the organizational structure was reorganized, a workers' representative meeting was held, and a campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched. As a result, Minsheng Shipping Company quickly presented a new situation, the workers' enthusiasm for labor was greatly improved, the business was greatly developed, and the company quickly turned from loss to profit.
    First, from the perspective of operation: Minsheng Shipping Company's past operating policy was to pursue profit regardless of the needs of the country and the people. Regarding the issue of freight rates, in the past, it did not focus on reducing freight rates to increase transportation, but only emphasized unreasonable costs and demanded excessively high freight rates to meet unreasonable expenses. When there was little cargo, they competed for cargo everywhere, but when there was a lot of cargo or when the country had urgent transportation tasks, they could not arrange and dispatch it well. This not only affected the exchange of goods and materials and the national economy and people's livelihood, but also caused the enterprise itself to continue to lose money. After the transformation into a joint state-private enterprise, because of the direct leadership of the state-owned economy, the capitalist operating methods were completely changed, and a new operating policy of serving national construction and the needs of the people was established. A policy of low profit and high volume transportation was adopted to strive to transport the surplus grain from Sichuan to areas in need of grain by waterway. This not only met the needs of the country and the people, but also reversed the phenomenon of continuous losses in the enterprise itself. From September to December 1952, there was a surplus of more than 12 billion yuan in just four months. This also shows that the interests of the enterprise itself are consistent with the interests of the country. The enterprise will only benefit itself by serving the needs of the country and the people.
    Secondly, from the perspective of management, the former Minsheng Shipping Company had a complex structure and chaotic organization. Among the more than 8,000 employees, there were several nominal consultants and commissioners who were high above, getting paid without doing anything. This not only increased the burden on the enterprise, but also led to embezzlement and waste, which further hindered the development of the business. After the transformation into a joint state-private enterprise, the organizational structure was reorganized, democratic management was implemented, and the original substantive personnel were employed according to their abilities, taking into account their original situation, based on the government's policy of unity and education, saving 35% of the manpower. A responsible attitude was also adopted towards the redundant personnel, and proper arrangements were made. Training classes were established in Chongqing, Shanghai, and Hankou, and they were introduced to East China universities for further study. After studying, they were transferred to production and served as trainee crew members on ships. In addition to the students, some were transferred to the head office to enrich the head office's organization. For those who had completely lost their ability to work due to old age and frailty, retirement was encouraged in accordance with the provisions of the Labor Insurance Regulations, in cooperation with the trade union and on the principle of voluntariness. Sound management systems were established, and work efficiency was improved. For example, in terms of ship dispatch, it was very chaotic in the past. The companies in Chongqing, Hankou, and Shanghai each acted on their own, grabbing ships wherever there was a profit, regardless of the overall needs. After the unified dispatch system was reformed, the past decentralized, blind, and chaotic phenomena were eliminated, and the operating efficiency of ships was greatly improved.
    Furthermore, from the perspective of the change in the labor attitude of the workers, after Minsheng Shipping Company was transformed into a joint state-private enterprise, because the nature of the enterprise and the relations of production changed, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers were greatly improved. In the safety and hygiene inspection campaign alone, the workers put forward more than 3,000 improvement suggestions, which played a great role in ensuring safe navigation. According to preliminary estimates, navigation loss accidents are now reduced by more than 90% compared to the past. The workers also raced to find tricks and tap potential, so that the carrying capacity of ships increased by nearly one-third compared to the past, with the highest being nearly one-half. The workers also created many new records. For example, it used to take as long as eight days to travel from Hankou to Chongqing, but now, with the use of moonlight night航, it only takes four days. With the efforts of the workers, the volume of transportation has greatly increased. Before the joint state-private enterprise, the highest annual transportation volume of Minsheng Shipping Company was only 380,000 tons, but after the joint state-private enterprise in September 1952, the transportation volume reached 280,000 tons in just four months by the end of the year, increasing the annual transportation volume of 1952 to 540,000 tons. The plan for 1953 was further increased to 940,000 tons. On the basis of increased production, the workers also worked hard to reduce costs, so that the cost expenses were also saved by 30% compared to the past.
    After Minsheng Shipping Company became a joint state-private enterprise, because the business developed and there was a surplus, the welfare of the workers was also improved, and the private shareholders could also receive dividends. In the years when the company was constantly losing money, worker welfare was out of the question, but what about now? The company is building worker dormitories and worker hospitals in Hankou and Chongqing, and this year it plans to use approximately 20 billion yuan to improve worker welfare. For more than ten years in the past, private shareholders had never received dividends, but only a few months after the joint state-private enterprise, a shareholders' meeting was held and dividends were distributed. The shareholders were very happy about this. The distribution of profits is based on the principle that after the final accounts are made each year, the enterprise's profits, after paying income tax and making up for previous losses, setting aside 25-30% for the public accumulation fund, and distributing dividends at an annual interest rate of 4% (the 1953 dividend was 4%, and the bonus was 1.5%, totaling 5.5%), the remaining balance is distributed according to the following percentages: 60% for shareholder bonuses, and 40% for the manager fund. This plan has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation of the Central Government and passed by the company's board of directors and supervisors. The shareholders are very satisfied with this.
    After Minsheng Shipping Company became a joint state-private enterprise, the assets were cleared and the share values ​​were determined in accordance with the principles of fairness, reasonableness, and seeking truth from facts, and the rights and interests of shareholders were protected. The business has developed in a short period of time, there has been a surplus, and dividends have been issued. The shareholders are very happy. They are not only happy about receiving dividends, but also about seeing that the company has embarked on a bright road. Chairman Zhou Xiaohuai said at the board meeting: "I have been a director for more than 20 years, and I have never come to a meeting. Now, although I am old, I still want to come to the meeting, which proves that our company is newborn." At each meeting of the company's board of directors and supervisors, a democratic method of "prior consultation and meeting resolution" is adopted. All major issues related to the company are discussed and resolved by the board of directors and supervisors, and the general manager reports on his work to the board of directors, and the board of directors and supervisors review the company's budget and final accounts. Because the representatives of the public and private shares respect each other, the directors and supervisors all feel that they have duties and rights, and actively put forward work opinions.
    In order to enable Minsheng Shipping Company to better serve national construction and the needs of the people, we are carrying out capital construction. In 1953 (including the work volume spanning years), the total investment in capital construction was 131.8 billion yuan. The source of funds is mainly the use of depreciation expenses and the disposal of some subsidiary businesses and dead waste materials. There are a total of 30 basic projects. A passenger ship capable of accommodating 968 passengers is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in August 1954. A cargo ship that originally only carried 400 tons is being rebuilt to carry 1,500 tons. In addition, a batch of barges are being refitted and newly built. After completion, together with the increased carrying capacity due to the exploitation of potential, it is estimated that the transportation capacity will be increased by more than 21,000 tons by the end of the year. At the same time, we are also strengthening port equipment and warehouse equipment to meet the country's continued increase in transportation needs. We must consolidate our existing achievements and continue to carry out the socialist transformation of enterprises under the direct leadership of the state-owned economy.
    After leaving school, I participated in shipping work, and I have been in Minsheng Company for 19 years now. For more than 20 years, all I knew was the capitalist operating method. After liberation, I still believed that Minsheng Shipping Company had a greater strength and had many more ships than the People's Shipping Company of the Sichuan River at that time. Therefore, I could not well accept the idea of ​​taking the state-owned economy as the leader. I had no understanding of the world created by labor and the great wisdom of the working masses, and I did not know how to mobilize the masses and rely on the masses to run the enterprise well. When considering issues, I did not combine personal interests or enterprise interests with the overall interests of the country. The idea of ​​serving the people was even more insufficient. Undoubtedly, these shortcomings inherited from the old society, like many old intellectuals and private industrialists and businessmen, are serious. After liberation, through various democratic reform movements, especially after the joint state-private enterprise, under the correct leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy, I personally received a lot of practical education, which greatly helped me.
    For example, in 1951, the government called for the transportation of Sichuan grain, but at that time, I did not establish the concept of serving the people and serving the needs of the country, nor did I realize the benefits of the low-profit and high-volume transportation policy. I still used the old capitalist operating methods, and the result was detrimental to both the public and private sectors. The country's grain could not be transported out, and the company encountered the difficulty of having no cargo to transport. After the joint state-private enterprise, due to the reorganization of the leadership and the improvement of the operating methods to meet the needs of the country and the people, the government's call was responded to in a timely manner, and freight rates were reduced. In this way, large quantities of Sichuan grain were transported out. For Minsheng Company, it also reversed the situation of losses, shareholders received dividends, and worker welfare was improved, which was beneficial to the country, the enterprise, and the workers. This fact greatly educated me. It powerfully shows that the old capitalist operating methods are backward operating methods, which are not beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, nor to the capitalists themselves. If we want to run the enterprise well, we must first improve our old operating methods and, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, adapt to the needs of the country and strive to become a state capitalist economy. This is the correct bright road.
    In terms of enterprise management, I used to proceed from subjective wishes, unwilling to consult with the masses, and acted arbitrarily. If others raised opinions, it seemed to damage my dignity, lose face, and be embarrassing. Naturally, there was no talk of democratic management. Therefore, I often stumbled in the face of truth. For example, in 1951, the company's income and expenditure were unbalanced. In order to save expenses, I adopted the method of reducing meal expenses, never considering that meal expenses were part of the workers' wage income, and the trade union law stipulated that they could not be reduced casually. Moreover, I did not consult with the trade union in advance, which was wrong in terms of both reason and emotion. As a result, it only increased labor-capital disputes and did not achieve the purpose of saving. This not only shows that our management is not democratic, but also shows that our serious exploitative consciousness has restricted the workers' enthusiasm for production. This incorrect attitude was not recognized until after the workers' representatives meeting criticized it. Therefore, I realized that private enterprises must adopt the method of labor-capital consultation and carry out democratic management. Without this, production cannot be done well.
    Because I did not understand the great wisdom and strength of the masses, I mistakenly believed that the past development of Minsheng Company was achieved by my own and a few people's talents. I locked myself in a small circle and did not seek progress. I did not approve of using moonlight night航on the Sichuan River; I did not think we needed to promote the one-column tow-barge transportation method, especially on the Sichuan River, because I was afraid of danger. Looking back now, I was really short-sighted, ideologically conservative, and afraid of difficulties. Today's facts make me realize that because the enterprise has embarked on the road of state capitalism, the relations of production have changed, and the workers can give full play to their high creativity and enthusiasm when they are the masters of their own affairs, and they can overcome difficulties that cannot be overcome in general. Due to the education of these facts, I realized that it is very important to strengthen learning, improve understanding, transform my old thinking, and establish a correct viewpoint of serving the people. Otherwise, if I only proceed from personal interests, I will often feel depressed, pessimistic, and disappointed. For example, when the joint state-private enterprise was about to be formed, I was worried about my position and status, and I did not proceed from the overall interests. I only thought about personal gains and losses, and I did not adopt a positive and responsible attitude to do a good job, but was afraid of having duties but no rights, so I once had the idea of ​​leaving Minsheng to work elsewhere. Although this was only a very short time, later facts proved that it was completely unnecessary and wrong. I am now responsible for shipping, supply, and other business work in Minsheng Company. I have duties and rights, and I am happy physically and mentally. My ideological understanding has also gradually improved. This should be attributed to the leadership of the People's Government and the state-owned economy. I sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party for its help, and in the future, I will work harder to learn and use practical actions to better serve the people to thank the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government.

    民生轮船公司走上了国家资本主义的光明大道
　　民生轮船公司副总经理　童少生
    民生轮船公司从一九五二年九月起改组为公私合营，到现在虽只有一年多的时间，但公司本身的变化是很大的。我亲眼看到民生轮船公司已经由一个资本主义的腐朽的旧企业变成一个生气勃勃的新企业了。我深深感到民生轮船公司改为公私合营，走国家资本主义的道路，真是一条光明大道。
    民生轮船公司是全国私营航业中最大的一家，已有二十多年的历史。但因它过去机构臃肿庞大，经营不善，以致年年亏本。解放后，虽经人民政府不断地贷款扶助，但仍是按照资本主义的方式经营，管理上还是旧的一套，因此仍不能扭转它年年亏本的局面，解放以后三年间，就亏本一千三百余亿元。这真是对国家不利，对企业不利，对职工也不利的；在这种情况下，公司董事会向人民政府要求公私合营。后经中央人民政府交通部接受了这一要求，并向公司投资一千亿元，从前年九月一日起，就改组为公私合营，交通部还派了干部代表公股参加董事会。接着就针对公司具体情况，进行了一系列的民主改革，改善了经营管理，整顿了组织机构，召开了职工代表会，开展了增产节约运动。这样一来，民生轮船公司很快地出现了新的局面，职工的劳动积极性大大地提高了，业务大大地发展了，公司也很快由亏本转为有盈余了。
    首先从经营方面来看：民生轮船公司过去的经营方针是为了营利而不顾国家和人民的需要。如运价问题，过去不是从降低运费增加运输着眼，只是强调不合理的成本，要求过高的运价来满足不合理的开支。货少时到处争夺货源，货多或遇国家有紧急运输任务时，又不能很好地安排调度。这样就不仅影响了物资交流，影响了国计民生，同时也使企业本身继续不断地亏本。改为公私合营以后，因为有了国营经济的直接领导，就彻底改变了资本主义的经营方式，树立了为国家建设为人民需要服务的新的经营方针。采取低利多运的政策，争取从水运上把四川多余的粮食运到需粮的地方去。这样不但满足了国家和人民的需要，而且也扭转了企业本身不断亏本的现象。从一九五二年九月到十二月的四个月中就有了一百二十余亿的盈余。这也就说明了企业本身的利益和国家的利益是一致的。企业只有为国家和人民的需要服务，才会对企业本身有利。
    其次从管理方面来看，过去的民生轮船公司，机构复杂编制混乱，八千多职工里有若干挂名的顾问专员，高高在上，拿钱不做事。这不仅增加了企业的负担，而且有人贪污浪费，更妨碍了业务的发展。改为公私合营以后，整顿了组织机构，实行了民主管理，对原有实职人员根据政府团结教育的方针，参酌原有情况，量才使用，节省了百分之三十五的人力；对编余人员也采取负责的态度，妥善安排，分别在重庆、上海、汉口设立训练班和介绍到华东高等学校去学习，学习后转入生产，到船上充当练习船员。除去学习人员以外，一部分调总公司充实总公司机构。对全部丧失劳动力的年老体衰者，则协同工会按照劳保条例规定，在自愿原则下动员退休。建立了健全的管理制度，提高了工作效率。如在船舶调度方面，过去是很混乱的，重庆、汉口、上海各地公司各行其是，那里有利就那里抓船，根本不顾整体的需要。经改建了统一调度制度后，就消灭了过去分散的盲目的混乱现象，大大提高了船舶的运转效率。
    再从职工劳动态度的转变来看，民生轮船公司改为公私合营以后，因为企业的性质起了变化，生产关系起了变化，这就大大地提高了职工的积极性和创造性。只在安全卫生大检查运动中，职工们就提出了三千多条改善意见，对保证安全航行起了很大的作用。据初步估计，航行损失事故现在比过去减少了百分之九十以上。职工们还争先恐后地找窍门，挖潜力，使船舶的载运量比过去提高了将近三分之一，最高的将近二分之一。职工们又创造了许多新纪录，如过去从汉口航行重庆，需时有多到八天的，而现在利用月色夜航，只需要四天就到了。在职工的努力下，运输量有了很大的增加，公私合营以前，民生轮船公司的最高年运量只三十八万吨，而在一九五二年九月份公私合营以后，到年底仅四个月，运量就有二十八万吨，把一九五二年的年运量提高到五十四万吨，一九五三年的计划更提高到九十四万吨。在增加生产的基础上，职工们还努力降低成本，使成本费用也比过去节省了百分之三十。
    民生轮船公司公私合营以后，因为业务发展了，有盈余了，职工的福利也就改善了，私股股东也可以分红了。在以前公司不断亏本的年代里，职工福利根本说不上，而现在呢？公司正在汉口、重庆修建职工宿舍和职工医院，今年计划用到改善职工福利的费用约达两百亿元。过去十多年来私股股东就不曾分得过股息和红利，而公私合营后才几个月，就开股东大会分得了股息，股东们对此都很高兴，对盈余的分配，是在每一年度决算后，企业盈余除缴纳所得税及弥补前期亏损、提公积金百分之二十五——三十，分派股息年息四厘外（一九五三年股息四厘，红利一厘五，共为五厘五），其余额依下列百分比分配：股东红利百分之六十，经理基金百分之四十。此一方案已经中央交通部批准，并在公司董监事会上通过，股东们对此十分满意。
    民生轮船公司公私合营后，本公平合理、实事求是的原则，清理了财产，确定了股值，股东权益有了保障。短期间业务获得发展，有了盈余，又发放了股息，股东们都非常高兴。高兴的不仅为得到了股息，而是看到公司已走上了光明大道。董事长周孝怀在董事会上就说：“我当了二十多年的董事，从来没有来开过会。现在年纪虽然老了也要来开会，这证明我们的公司新生了。”公司董监事会每次开会，都采取“事先协商，会议议决”的民主方式，凡有关公司重大问题，都经过董监事会的协商与议决，总经理并向董事会作工作报告，董监事会审查公司预决算。由于公私股代表双方互相尊重，董监事们都感到有职有权，积极提出工作意见。
    为了使民生轮船公司更好地为国家建设和人民需要服务，我们正进行基本建设。一九五三年全年（包括跨年度工作量）基本建设投资总额为一千三百一十八亿元。资金来源主要是运用折旧费及处理一些附属事业和呆废料等。基本工程共三十项，现正在建造一艘可容九百六十八个旅客的客船，约一九五四年八月完成；改建一艘原只装四百吨的货船，使能装载一千五百吨。此外又改装和新建一批驳船，在完成之后，连同发挥潜力所增的载量，估计到年底将要增加二万一千多吨的运输力。同时，我们还正在加强港务设备和仓库设备，以适应国家继续增加的运输需要。我们一定要巩固既有的成绩，在国营经济的直接领导下，继续进行企业的社会主义改造。
    我离开学校后，就参加了航运工作，进民生公司到现在也已有十九年了。二十余年来，我知道的只是资本主义的经营方式。解放以后，我还认为民生轮船公司实力较大，比当时的川江的人民轮船公司的船多得多，因此对以国营经济为领导的思想不能很好的接受。对劳动创造世界和劳动群众的伟大智慧，根本没有认识，也不知道发动群众，依靠群众来搞好企业。考虑问题没有把个人利益或企业利益与国家的整体利益结合起来。为人民服务的思想更是不够。无疑的这些从旧社会遗留下来的缺点，正如许多旧知识分子和私营工商业者一样，是严重的。解放后经过各种民主改革运动，尤其是公私合营后，在人民政府和国营经济的正确领导下，我亲身受到了许多实际的教育，大大地帮助了我。
    例如：一九五一年政府号召川粮下运，但我当时没有建立为人民服务、为国家需要服务的观点，也没有认识到低利多运政策的好处，仍然沿用老一套的资本主义经营方式，结果是公私两不利。国家粮食运不出，公司遇到无货可运的困难。公私合营后，由于改组了领导，改善了经营方式，以适应国家人民的需要，及时地响应政府的号召，降低运价，这样，川粮大批下运了。在民生公司来说也扭转了亏折的局面，股东分得了股息，改善了职工福利，对国家、企业、职工都有好处。这一事实，大大地教育了我，它有力地说明旧的资本主义经营方式，是落后的经营方式，对国计民生，对资本家自己都没有好处，我们要想搞好企业，首先必须改善我们旧的经营方式，在国营经济的领导下，以适应国家的需要，进而争取成为国家资本主义经济，才是正确的光明大道。
    在企业管理方面，我过去一向凭主观愿望出发，不愿与群众商量，独断独行，别人提意见，就好像有损尊严，失面子，难为情，这当然就谈不上民主管理。因此，使自己在真理面前常常碰钉子。如一九五一年公司收支不平衡，为了节省开支，我采用降低膳费的办法，从未考虑到膳费是职工工资收入的一部分，工会法规定是不能随便减少的；而且事前也不与工会协商，于情于理都不对。结果徒增劳资纠纷，并未达到节省目的。这不特说明了我们的管理不民主，同时也表现了我们对工人严重的剥削意识束缚了职工生产积极性。这种不正确的态度，一直到职工代表会批评后，才得到了认识。因此我体会到私营企业一定要采取劳资协商的办法，进行民主管理，不如此，生产无法搞好。
    由于我不了解群众的伟大智慧和力量，误认为民生公司过去的发展是凭自己和几个人的才能取得的。把自己关在一个小圈子里，不求进步。我不赞成在川江利用月色夜航；推行一列式拖驳运输法，我认为我们不需要，特别是川江不可能，怕危险。现在看来，我过去实在是眼光短浅，思想保守，害怕困难。今天的事实使我认识到，由于企业走上了国家资本主义的道路，生产关系有了变化，工人当家作主人就能发挥高度的创造性与积极性，就能克服一般所不能克服的困难。由于这些事实的教育，使我认识到必须加强学习，提高认识，改造自己的旧思想，树立正确的为人民服务的观点，是很重要的。否则只从个人利害出发，自己就会经常感到苦闷，悲观失望。如在将要公私合营时，我就顾虑到自己的职务和地位问题，不从整体利益出发，只想到个人的得失，不从积极负责的态度来搞好工作，而怕有职无权，因而曾一度产生离开民生另行工作的想法。这虽然只是很短暂的时间，但后来的事实证明是完全不必要的，而且是错误的。我现在在民生公司负责航运、供应等业务工作，有职有权，身心愉快，在思想认识上也逐渐的有所提高，这应归功于人民政府和国营经济的领导，我衷心感谢中国共产党的帮助，今后当更加努力学习，以更好地为人民服务的实际行动来感谢中国共产党与人民政府。
