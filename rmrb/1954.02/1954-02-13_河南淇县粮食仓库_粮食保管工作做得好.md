Henan Qixian County Grain Depot

    The grain depots in Qixian County, Henan Province, are mostly ordinary civilian houses with poor equipment, and the grain storage points are relatively scattered. The modern storage equipment consists of only six powder sprayers, eight sprayers, and six moisture measuring devices. However, the county's grain storage work has been carried out in such a way that there is basically no insect infestation or spoilage, which is entirely due to the subjective efforts of the grain depot cadres.
    First, they resolutely implemented the grain storage policy of "prevention is more important than cure." Before the grain is put into storage, the empty warehouses are thoroughly disinfected. After the grain is put into storage, the warehouses are kept clean and sanitary inside and out. In February and March last year, and before the autumn grain collection, they carried out three large-scale warehouse cleaning and disinfection operations in a timely manner, especially the first one to eliminate overwintering warehouse insects and disinfection work, which was carried out universally and thoroughly. It is estimated that the disinfection of warehouses accounted for more than 95% of the total warehouse capacity in the county. When cleaning the warehouse, the ceiling, purlins, beams, corners, rat holes, and other places in the warehouse were carefully inspected, cleaned, and blocked, and then the inner walls of the warehouse were evenly brushed with thick lime water.
    Secondly, they did a good job in reducing the moisture and impurities in the grain, separating the quality, classifying and storing it according to its nature. Last year, the newly marketed wheat had a high moisture content, which added difficulties to grain storage work. The cadres of the Qixian County Grain Depot conscientiously implemented the policy of "collecting, sorting, and storing grain at the same time." All grains with a moisture content of more than 12% were first exposed to the sun to reduce the moisture content to 11% before being put into storage. In the autumn of 1952, there was continuous rain before the autumn grain was put into storage, and most of the grain put into storage exceeded the safety standard. Some corn had a moisture content of 16% to 17.5%. They took measures such as small piles and small stacks, ventilated stacking, and thin-layer spreading to reduce moisture. At the same time, they also divided all kinds of grain into three grades, A, B, and C, and stored them separately according to quality, and paid attention to accumulating experience in storing different kinds of grain.
    Another reason why Qixian County has achieved considerable results in grain storage is the serious establishment of an inspection system. The county has formulated a regular inspection system based on different seasonal conditions. From January to February, a general inspection is carried out every 14 days, and a random inspection every 7 days; from March to May, a general inspection is carried out every 10 days, and a random inspection every 5 days; from June to September, a general inspection is carried out every 5 days, and a random inspection every 3 days. In special circumstances, inspections are sometimes carried out two or three times a day. Whenever it rained, the warehouse cadres checked in the rain and dealt with problems in a timely manner. In addition, the leading cadres of the county grain bureau organized four large-scale inspections in March, April, July, and November last year, which played a significant role in improving the storage work of various grain depots.

    河南淇县粮食仓库
    粮食保管工作做得好
    河南省淇县的粮食仓库，大部是普通民房，设备很差，存粮点又比较分散。现代化的保管器材仅有喷粉器六架、喷雾器八架，水分测定器六部。但是这个县的粮食保管工作作到了基本上没有生虫、霉坏，这完全是靠粮库干部主观努力得来的。
    他们首先坚决贯彻了“防重于治”的粮食保管方针，粮食入库前，彻底进行空仓消毒；粮食入库后，经常保持仓库内外的清洁卫生。去年二、三月间，夏征以前，秋征以前，他们及时地进行了三次规模巨大的清仓消毒工作，尤以第一次消灭越冬仓虫和消毒工作作得普遍而彻底。计消毒仓房占全县仓库容量百分之九十五以上。在打扫仓库时，把仓库的天花板、檩、梁、墙角、鼠洞等处，都作了细致地检查和掏、堵，然后用浓石灰水把仓库的内壁均匀地粉刷了一遍。
    其次，他们作好了降低粮食水分、杂质、分质、分类按性质保管的工作。去年新上市小麦水分很大，给粮食保管工作增加了困难。淇县粮库干部认真执行了“边收、边整、边入库”的方针，凡入库粮水分在百分之十二以上的，都先加以曝晒，把水分降低到百分之十一才入库。一九五二年秋，秋粮入库前阴雨不断，入库的粮食大部都超过安全标准，有的玉米含水分达百分之十六到十七点五。他们就采取小堆小垛，通风码垛、薄层摊晾等办法来降低水分。同时，他们还把各种粮食都分成甲、乙、丙三等，按质量分别保管，并注意积累了保管不同粮种的经验。
    淇县保管粮食工作所以有不少成绩的另一个原因，是认真建立了检查制度。该县根据各个季节的不同情况制定了定期检查制度。一月至二月，十四天一普查，七天一抽查；三月至五月，十天一普查，五天一抽查；六至九月，五天一普查，三天一抽查。遇到特殊情况，有时也一天检查二、三次。每逢下雨，仓库干部都冒雨检查，发现问题及时处理。另外，该县粮食局领导干部在去年三月、四月，七月和十一月组织了四次大规模的检查，对各粮库改进保管工作起了不小的作用。
