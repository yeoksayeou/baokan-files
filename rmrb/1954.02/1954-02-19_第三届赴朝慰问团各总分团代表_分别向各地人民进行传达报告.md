Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Representatives from various general and sub-delegations of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea have begun delivering reports to people from all walks of life across the country. In some regions, the reporting work has essentially concluded.

The Second General Sub-Delegation of the慰問团 (慰問团-Comfort Delegation) began delivering reports to people from all walks of life in the Northwest region in late January. In the cities of Xi'an and Lanzhou alone, over 100,000 people directly heard the reports from the delegation. Representatives from the Third General Sub-Delegation returned to the Southwest region in late January and began delivering reports in cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Ya'an in early February. Representatives from the Second Sub-Delegation of this General Sub-Delegation delivered over 170 reports to over 150,000 people from all walks of life in Chengdu. On the 12th, they set off in nine groups to deliver reports to all special districts, cities, and counties throughout Sichuan Province. The Fourth General Sub-Delegation is currently delivering reports in the East China region. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as Shanghai, Nanjing, Jinan, Fuzhou, Hefei and other cities, nearly one million people have directly heard the reports from the delegation representatives. In Wuhan, over 130,000 people have heard the reports from the representatives of the Fifth General Sub-Delegation. From January 14th to 27th, representatives from the Sixth General Sub-Delegation delivered over 930 reports to people from all walks of life in the North China region, reaching over 910,000 listeners. The Seventh General Sub-Delegation began delivering reports to the people of the Northeast region in late January. After the Spring Festival, the representatives of the Seventh General Sub-Delegation went deeper into key factories, mines, forestry areas, military units, schools, and rural areas to deliver reports. The Eighth General Sub-Delegation and some representatives of the Sixth General Sub-Delegation are coordinating with each other to deliver reports in cities above the league, city, county, and banner levels, as well as in larger rural and pastoral areas in the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region. During the reporting process, some representatives of the general and sub-delegations also broadcast reports to the entire region on local people's radio stations.

After hearing the reports from the delegation representatives, people across the country were deeply inspired by the great victories and heroic deeds of the Korean people and army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. They expressed their determination to follow the general line of the state during the transition period, actively participate in national construction, and continue to deepen the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, so as to support the Korean people and army and the Chinese People's Volunteers with practical actions. Inspired by the heroic deeds of the Volunteers, the excavators of the Red Star Second Team of the Jiawang Coal Mine in Jiangsu Province firmly stated that they would work hard to overcome difficulties and increase production. They said: "The Volunteers can tunnel through mountains with simple tools. Can we, in a peaceful environment, be blocked by difficulties while using machines to dig mine shafts?" After listening to the report, workers at the Taiyuan Municipal State-Owned Jinsheng Textile Factory immediately had forty-nine groups and sixteen workers propose that the attendance rate for the first quarter of this year should reach 100%. Thirty groups and sixty-five workers wrote letters of determination, expressing their determination to comprehensively over fulfill this year's production tasks. Workers at the Andong Municipal State-Owned Silk Spinning Factory, in conjunction with the spirit of the report, discussed the production plan for February in the first quarter of this year and guaranteed to improve product quality on the original basis and complete or over fulfill the February production tasks. Employees of private automobile transportation in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, proposed to strengthen unity and earnestly supervise the capitalists to accept socialist transformation. All members of the Du Zhicheng mutual aid team in Lijia Village on the outskirts of Xi'an City guaranteed that on the basis of last year's average wheat yield of 387 jin per mu, they would increase wheat production by another 30 jin per mu to support the Volunteers and the country's economic construction. Farmers in Ningbo, Jiaxing, Fuzhou and other places also proposed to take the road of agricultural collectivization, increase production, and sell surplus grain to the state after hearing the reports. Inspired by the heroic behavior of Korean electrical workers, the workers of the Wuhan Line Work Area of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau strengthened line patrols and inspections during the Spring Festival and carried out key maintenance. Tang Shuyun, a resident of Huguang Street in Chengdu, decided to take out a portion of her surplus money each month to purchase national economic construction bonds to support national construction and the Volunteers after hearing the report. People from all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region also expressed their determination to learn from the patriotism of the Korean people and actively participate in the socialist construction of the great motherland.

Currently, the various general and sub-delegations of the慰問团 (Comfort Delegation) are continuing to deliver reports in various regions. All general and sub-delegations will complete their reporting work within one month after the start of reporting.
