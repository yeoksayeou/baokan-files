    Zunyi Farm Implement Factory Cadres Clarify Business Direction After Studying the General Line, Actively Manufacturing New Farm Implements According to Local Rural Needs
      After studying the General Line, the cadres of the Guizhou Local State-Owned Zunyi Farm Implement Factory clarified their understanding of the factory's business direction. They are now actively manufacturing inexpensive and high-quality new farm implements based on the needs of the local rural areas to support farmers' production.

    In the past, the leading cadres of the farm implement factory had serious capitalist business ideas. They believed that there was no market for new farm implements and that it was more profitable to produce weighing scales, screws, and noodle machines. Therefore, they focused their main efforts on leading workers to produce weighing scales, screws, and noodle machines, with the production of new farm implements only accounting for a small portion. When manufacturing new farm implements, they did not conduct in-depth investigations and research in rural areas, but instead rigidly copied the styles of some new farm implements from the north. As a result, the farm implements produced were of poor quality, and the styles were not suitable for the needs of the local rural areas, leading to many complaints from farmers.

    After studying the General Line, the factory cadres gradually realized the glorious responsibility of farm implement factories in promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture by the state. Therefore, in formulating this year's production plan, they decided to focus on the production of new farm implements. Based on actual needs, the planned production quantity of new farm implements this year has significantly increased compared to last year. Taking corn threshers and rice threshers as examples: the planned production of corn threshers this year is almost six times higher than the actual production last year, and rice threshers are increased by twenty-four times compared to last year. In order to improve the quality of new farm implements, the factory also organized a farm implement trial research group, which regularly goes to the countryside to listen to farmers' opinions. In addition, the factory also held a product quality exhibition in conjunction with the ongoing verification work. The exhibition used concrete examples to illustrate that if the quality of new farm implements is not good, it will not be possible to help farmers improve agricultural production, and it will affect the worker-peasant alliance and industrial construction. Starting from January, the factory also established an inspection system, assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for inspection work, stipulating that finished and semi-finished products must meet the standards before they are allowed to be put into storage or leave the factory.

    遵义农具加工厂干部学习总路线后明确认识了经营方向
    按照当地农村需要积极制造新式农具
      贵州地方国营遵义农具加工厂的干部，学习总路线后，明确认识了该厂的经营方向，现正根据当地农村需要，积极制造价廉物美的新式农具，支援农民生产。
    过去，农具加工厂领导干部思想上存在着严重的资本主义经营思想，认为生产新式农具没销路，不如生产磅秤、螺丝、面机赚钱多，所以就以主要精力领导工人生产磅秤、螺丝、面机，新式农具的生产只占很小一部分。制造新式农具时也不深入农村调查研究，而是硬搬北方一些新式农具的式样，结果制造出来的农具质量低劣，式样也不适合当地农村的需要，农民意见很多。
    该厂干部学习了总路线后，逐渐认识到农具加工厂在促进国家对农业实现社会主义改造中的光荣责任，因此在制订今年生产计划中，便确定以生产新式农具为主。根据实际需要，今年计划生产的新式农具数量比去年有显著增加。以玉米脱粒机、水稻脱粒机为例：玉米脱粒机今年的计划生产量比去年实际产量增加将近六倍，水稻脱粒机比去年增加二十四倍。为了改进新式农具的质量，厂里还组织了一个农具试制研究组，经常深入农村，听取农民的意见。此外，该厂还结合目前正在进行的查定工作，举行了产品质量展览会，展览会中用具体事例说明了制造新式农具质量不好，就不能帮助农民搞好农业生产，就要影响工农联盟及工业建设。从元月份起，厂里还建立了检验制度，固定专人负责检验工作，规定成品、半成品一定要合乎标准，才准许入库、出厂。
