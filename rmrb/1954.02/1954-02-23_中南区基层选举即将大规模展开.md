    Large-Scale Basic-Level Elections to be Launched in the Central-South Region
    A large-scale basic-level election campaign will soon be fully launched in the vast urban and rural areas of the Central-South Region. The Central-South Administrative Committee's Election Guidance Office specifically convened a meeting of the heads of the election committees or the responsible cadres of the people's government's political and legal departments of various provinces and cities from February 7th to 9th to discuss and deploy the region's basic-level election work.
    Since the establishment of the election committees at all levels in the Central-South Region around April last year, they have launched pilot projects for basic-level elections in batches. By the end of last year, 8,000 townships, towns, and urban basic-level units in the region had completed the election work. Through the pilot work, they accumulated experience and trained a group of cadres and technicians to lead the election work. In those areas where elections have been completed, the broad masses of the people have raised their political consciousness, and basic-level cadres have undergone a mass appraisal and education. As a result, the ties between the people's government and the people have been further strengthened, and the enthusiasm of the people in engaging in socialist construction has been greatly encouraged. At present, various localities are summarizing the experiences of the pilot work in preparation for the universal launch of basic-level election work.
    The Central-South Region's general election work conference made specific arrangements for the basic-level election work based on the region's work situation, requiring all provinces and cities to quickly complete the basic-level election work within a limited time, in conjunction with the publicity of the general line. The convocation of the people's congresses of counties and province-administered cities should also be prepared early. The conference emphasized that after the comprehensive launch of the basic-level election campaign, the leading organs at all levels must strengthen the leadership of the general election work, ensure the correct implementation of the Election Law in the election work, and successfully complete the election work. The conference determined that the political and legal committees of all provinces and cities should urge the civil affairs, public security, judicial, and supervisory departments to closely cooperate with the general election work to prevent and punish the sabotage activities of bad elements against the election work, and effectively guarantee the smooth progress of the election work.
    The conference pointed out that in carrying out basic-level election work, all localities must conscientiously implement the publicity and education of the Party's general line for the transition period; at the same time, in rural areas, it should be particularly closely integrated with agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement to prevent practices that hinder production. The conference also discussed issues such as the basic-level elections in ethnic minority areas and the specific steps and methods in the election work. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Since February, Henan Province has successively launched a comprehensive basic-level election work in the vast rural areas. In early February this year, the Henan Provincial Election Committee made arrangements for how to carry out the general election work throughout the province, and each special zone and county also arranged this work through expanded cadre meetings. At present, the general election movement has been fully launched in seventeen counties including Xichuan, Dengfeng, and Jiyuan, and thirty-seven counties including Zhenping and Xixia are being launched one after another.
    From July to November last year, the provincial and county election committees in Henan Province selected key villages to pilot basic-level election work. After publicizing the general line and launching the grain sales campaign, the counties successively selected some key villages for pilot projects. A total of 451 townships and towns throughout the province carried out pilot work. Through the general election pilot projects, various localities not only provided experience for leading rural basic-level elections, but also cultivated a large number of cadres. According to statistics, there are more than 35,000 general election guidance cadres and technical cadres with basic-level election experience in the province. In early February this year, the Henan Provincial Election Committee arranged to comprehensively launch rural basic-level elections throughout the province, and compiled and distributed documents such as "How to Carry out Rural Basic-Level Election Work" based on the experience of key pilot projects in various localities. In addition, the Provincial Election Committee will also form a number of rural general election work guidance groups to conduct巡回指导 in various places. Some counties have also formulated detailed plans to conduct general elections in conjunction with production. Rural basic-level elections in each county are generally carried out in two or three batches in a staggered manner. Around the end of February, rural basic-level election work in Henan Province will soon be popularized throughout the province. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南区基层选举即将大规模展开
    大规模的基层选举运动即将在中南区广大城乡中全面展开。中南行政委员会指导选举办公室在二月七日到九日专门召集各省、市选举委员会的负责人或人民政府政法部门的负责干部开会讨论和部署全区的基层选举工作。
    中南区各级选举委员会在去年四月间先后建立起来以后，曾经分批展开了基层选举的试办工作，截至去年年底全区已有八千个乡、镇和城市的基层单位完成了选举工作，通过试办工作，积累了经验，并培养了一批领导选举工作的干部和技术人员。在那些已经完成选举的地区，广大人民群众提高了政治觉悟，基层干部受了一次群众性的鉴别和教育，因而进一步密切了人民政府和人民群众的联系，极大地鼓舞了人民群众的从事社会主义建设的热情。目前，各地正总结试办工作经验，为普遍展开基层选举工作进行准备。
    中南区此次普选工作会议根据全区工作情况，对基层选举工作作了具体的安排，要求各省、市在限定的时间以内，结合总路线的宣传，迅速地完成基层选举工作。县和省辖市人民代表大会的召开，各地亦应及早准备。会议强调指出，基层选举运动全面展开以后，各级领导机关必须加强对普选工作的领导，保证在选举工作中正确地执行选举法，圆满地完成选举工作。会议确定：各省、市政治法律委员会应督促民政、公安、司法、监察等部门密切配合普选工作，以防止和惩处坏分子对选举工作的破坏活动，切实保障选举工作的顺利进行。
    会议指出，各地在进行基层选举工作中，必须认真贯彻国家在过渡时期总路线的宣传教育；同时，在乡村中还应该特别和农业生产及互助合作运动密切结合起来，防止妨碍生产的作法。关于少数民族地区的基层选举以及选举工作中的具体步骤、方法等问题，会议也都进行了讨论。　（新华社）
    河南省自二月份起已相继在广大农村中全面展开基层选举工作。河南省选举委员会在今年二月初对全省范围内如何展开普选工作作了布置，各专区和县也都通过扩大干部会议布置了这一工作。目前该省普选运动已在淅川、登封、济源等十七个县全面展开，镇平、西峡等三十七个县正陆续展开。
    河南省从去年七月到十一月期间，省、县选举委员会都选择了重点乡村试办基层选举工作。在宣传总路线以及开展售粮运动以后，各县又陆续选择了一些重点乡村进行试办。全省前后共在四百五十一个乡、镇中进行了试办工作。各地经过普选试办，不但为领导农村基层选举提供了经验，而且培养了大批干部。据统计，全省具有基层选举经验的普选指导干部和技术干部已有三万五千多人。今年二月初，河南省选举委员会便布置在全省范围内全面展开农村基层选举，并根据各地重点试办经验编发了“怎样进行农村基层选举工作”等文件。另外，省选举委员会还将组成若干农村普选工作指导组到各地巡回指导。有的县还制订了结合生产进行普选的周密计划。各县农村基层选举一般都分作两批或三批交错进行。到二月底前后，河南省农村的基层选举工作即将普及全省。　　　　（新华社）
