Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 7th: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Meeting held a session on the 5th, continuing discussions on the second agenda item, chaired by Molotov.

Dulles spoke first. He stubbornly claimed that the Soviet delegation's proposal for holding free all-German elections did not guarantee respect for the democratic rights of the German people and was therefore unacceptable. He made sweeping attacks on the German Democratic Republic, saying that the Bonn government would not agree to the Soviet proposal, and the Western Three would certainly not advise the Bonn government to accept it. He also insisted that the Soviet proposal was intended to obstruct the German elections.

It is noteworthy that Dulles remained silent on the U.S. attitude towards the Soviet delegation's other proposal, which advocated withdrawing occupying forces from East and West Germany before the elections, leaving only a limited number of troops to maintain security.

Bidault spoke next. He repeated Dulles's argument, saying that the Soviet delegation's proposal was unacceptable and unworkable. He insisted that it was impossible, as proposed by the Soviet Union, to establish a temporary all-German government by the parliament of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, with the broad participation of democratic groups, before holding all-German elections. He belittled the German people, saying that the Soviet proposal -- the suggestion that the German people themselves formulate the election law and hold elections -- was "strange," saying that it would be difficult to elect truly democratic and peace-loving people in this way.

Bidault said that he believed it was impossible to reach an agreement between East and West Germany because the Bonn government did not want to contact the East German government. He also said that the Bonn government could not abandon the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, thereby isolating itself from the Western bloc. In this way, Bidault's argument contradicted his previous argument, which held that the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty were not obstacles to German unification.

He believed that the Soviet proposal to withdraw the occupying forces to avoid foreign pressure during the all-German elections was unacceptable. He insisted that the solution to the German question must begin with the all-German elections stipulated in the Eden Plan.

Eden spoke next. He stubbornly claimed that the Soviet delegation did not trust the parliamentary system, and said that the Soviet proposal was unacceptable, saying that he saw no reason to change his plan. He also made it seem as if the British plan would give the future all-German government the opportunity to decide for itself whether to join "European Army," a military group of Western countries.

Eden believed that the German people should not be allowed to formulate the election law themselves, and insisted that German elections should be held under the supervision of the occupying powers. He groundlessly said that the Soviet delegation made proposals in order to prevent Germany from holding elections. He rejected the Soviet proposal to withdraw the occupying forces from Germany before the elections, and insisted that East Germany had armed forces, while concealing the fact that West Germany had already rebuilt a large number of armed forces under the guise of police, border guards, and other troops.

Molotov spoke next. He described the main provisions of the Soviet delegation's proposal, and pointed out that the representatives of Western countries distorted the Soviet delegation's attitude, stubbornly claiming that the Soviet Union did not want to hold free elections in Germany. In fact, it was the Soviet Union that advocated the unification of Germany, advocated holding free elections in Germany without delay, and advocated that the German people themselves hold such elections. The Soviet proposal ensured that Germany could hold truly free and democratic elections.

Molotov said: The foreign ministers of Western countries attacked the political system of the German Democratic Republic, which reflects their unwillingness to consider historical facts. The system of the German Democratic Republic is different from that of the Federal Republic of Germany, but this does not mean that the two sides cannot find ways to make their actions consistent, if both sides regard ensuring peace and security as a common goal.

Molotov then pointed out: When the foreign ministers of Western countries talked about the Soviet proposal to withdraw the occupying forces, they said that the police force of the German Democratic Republic was larger than that of West Germany, which was not in line with the facts. He pointed out that the government of the German Democratic Republic had in the past and still did propose to the West German government to reach an agreement on the number, weapons, and distribution of police forces in East and West Germany.

Molotov concluded: It can be considered that some of the speeches at the 5th meeting were a refusal to reach an agreement on the issues under discussion. But the Soviet Union advocated seeking ways to reach an agreement.

After Molotov's speech, Dulles suggested holding a closed-door meeting on the 8th to discuss the issues submitted for closed-door discussion during the discussion of the first agenda item -- measures to ease international tensions and convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China. There was no opposition. The four foreign ministers also unanimously agreed to discuss procedural issues in a closed-door meeting.

### 四国外长会议继续讨论第二项议程  莫洛托夫重申统一德国的建议

    四国外长会议继续讨论第二项议程
    莫洛托夫重申统一德国的建议
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：四国外长会议于五日举行会议，继续讨论第二项议程，由莫洛托夫担任主席。
    杜勒斯第一个发言。他硬说苏联代表团关于举行全德自由选举的建议没有保证尊重德国人民的民主权利，因此是不能接受的。他对德意志民主共和国滥施攻击，并说波恩政府不会同意苏联的建议，西方三国也绝不劝波恩政府接受这个建议。他还硬说苏联的建议是为了要阻挠德国的选举。
    值得注意的是：杜勒斯缄口不谈美国对于苏联代表团的另一个建议的态度，这个建议主张在选举以前就从东西德撤退占领军，只留下有限的军队来维持安全。
    皮杜尔接着发言。他重复杜勒斯的论调，说苏联代表团的建议是不能接受的，而且是行不通的。他硬说，要按照苏联的建议那样，在举行全德选举前由德意志民主共和国议会和德意志联邦共和国议会在民主团体的广泛参加下成立临时的全德政府，是不可能的。他轻视德国人民，说苏联的建议——由德国人民自己来制订选举法并举行选举的建议“很奇怪”，说这样就很难选出真正民主与爱好和平的人来。
    皮杜尔说，他认为东西德之间无法达成协议，因为波恩政府不希望和东德政府发生联系。他又说，波恩政府不能放弃波恩条约和巴黎条约，从而自绝于西方集团。这样，皮杜尔的论调和他以前的论调就有了矛盾，以前他认为波恩条约和巴黎条约并不是德国统一的障碍。
    他认为苏联关于撤退占领军以免在全德选举期间有外国施行压力的建议是不能接受的。他坚持解决德国问题必须从艾登计划所规定的举行全德选举开始。
    艾登接着发言。他硬说苏联代表团不信任议会制度，又说苏联的建议无法接受，说他看不到有什么理由要改变他的计划。他还把事情说成好像是英国的计划能使未来的全德政府有机会决定自己是否参加“欧洲军”这个西方国家的军事集团似的。
    艾登认为不能让德国人民自己来制订选举法，而坚持德国选举应在占领国的监督下举行。他毫无根据地说，苏联代表团提出建议，是为了要阻止德国举行选举。他拒绝苏联关于在选举前从德国撤退占领军的建议，并且硬说东德有武装部队，而掩饰西德已经在警察、边防军及其他部队的幌子下重建了大量武装部队。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。他叙述了苏联代表团的建议的主要条文，并且指出：西方国家的代表歪曲苏联代表团的态度，硬说苏联不要在德国举行自由选举。其实正是苏联主张统一德国，主张毫不迟延地在德国举行自由选举，而且主张由德国人民自己来举行这种选举。苏联的建议确保德国能够举行真正自由与民主的选举。
    莫洛托夫说：西方国家的外长们攻击德意志民主共和国的政治制度，这反映出他们不愿考虑历史事实。德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国制度不同，但这并不表示双方就不能想办法使它们的行动一致，如果双方都把确保和平和安全当作共同目标的话。
    莫洛托夫接着指出：西方国家的外长们在谈到苏联关于撤退占领军的建议时，曾说德意志民主共和国的警察部队人数多于西德，这是不合事实的。他指出：德意志民主共和国政府过去和现在一直都向西德政府建议，就东西德的警察人数、武器和分布问题达成协议。
    莫洛托夫最后说：可以认为五日会议上的某些发言是拒绝对讨论中的问题达成协议。但是苏联主张寻求途径来达成协议。
    莫洛托夫发言后，杜勒斯建议在八日举行秘密会议，来讨论在第一项议程——关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议——讨论过程中提交秘密会议讨论的问题。没有人反对。四国外长还一致同意在秘密会议上讨论程序问题。
