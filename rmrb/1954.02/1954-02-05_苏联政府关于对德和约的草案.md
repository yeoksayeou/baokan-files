Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 2nd: The full text of the Soviet government's draft on the German peace treaty is as follows:

The war against Germany ended nearly nine years ago, but Germany still does not have a peace treaty, remains divided, and remains in a position of unequal rights with other countries. This abnormal situation must be terminated. Terminating this situation is fully in line with the wishes of all peace-loving people. If a German peace treaty is not concluded quickly, it will not be possible to adopt a fair attitude towards the legitimate national interests of the German people.

Concluding a German peace treaty is of great importance to promoting peace in Europe. After the conclusion of a German peace treaty, it will be possible to finally resolve the various problems arising from the Second World War. Solving these problems is of vital interest to European countries that have suffered Nazi aggression, especially Germany's neighbors. Concluding a German peace treaty will help improve the overall international situation and thus facilitate the establishment of lasting peace.

Since the relevant resolutions of the Potsdam Conference have not yet been implemented, the danger of the revival of German militarism, which launched two world wars, has not been eliminated, which determines the need to accelerate the conclusion of a German peace treaty. The German peace treaty must ensure the elimination of the possibility of the revival of German militarism and the resurgence of German aggression.

Concluding a German peace treaty will establish a lasting state of peace for the German people, will help Germany develop into a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving country in accordance with the Potsdam resolutions, and will ensure that the German people have the opportunity to cooperate peacefully with other countries.

For these reasons, the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have decided to immediately begin drafting a German peace treaty.

The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France believe that when drafting the treaty, Germany must participate, that is, a pan-German government representing Germany must participate, and at the same time, the German peace treaty must be based on the following principles:

	Principles of the German Peace Treaty

    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社柏林二日讯：苏联政府关于对德和约的草案全文如下：
    对德战争结束已经将近九年了，但是，德国仍然没有一个和约，仍然处于分裂状态，处于与其他国家权利不平等的地位。这种不正常的局势必须终止。终止这种局势是完全符合一切爱好和平的人民的愿望的。如果不迅速缔结对德和约，也就不可能对德国人民合法的民族利益采取公正的态度。
    缔结对德和约对于促进欧洲的和平有巨大的重要性。缔结对德和约之后，就可能最后解决因为第二次世界大战而产生的种种问题。解决这些问题，对于曾遭受过纳粹侵略的欧洲各国、首先是德国的邻国，都有着切身的利害关系。缔结对德和约将有助于改进整个国际形势，并因此而有利于建立持久的和平。
    由于波茨坦会议的有关各项决议迄今没有履行，曾经两次发动世界大战的德国军国主义复活的危险还没有消除，这就决定了必须加速缔结对德和约。对德和约必须保证消除德国军国主义复活和德国侵略再起的可能性。
    缔结对德和约将为德国人民确立持久的和平状况，将有助于德国按照波茨坦决议发展成为一个统一、独立、民主和爱好和平的国家，并将保证德国人民有机会和其他国家和平合作。
    根据这些理由，苏联、美国、英国和法国政府决定立即开始草拟对德和约。

      （六）一切前德国军队的服役人员，包括军官和将领，一切前纳粹分子，如非曾因罪行而被法庭判刑者，一律得享有与其他德国人民同等的公民权利和政治权利，以便他们能参与建设爱好和平、民主的德国。
