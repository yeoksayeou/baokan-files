　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. Our special correspondent reports: Nearly two weeks have passed since the Korean-Chinese side proposed to the U.S. side to resume the Panmunjom talks on February 1st, and the proposed date for the resumption of talks by the Korean-Chinese side has also passed for a full week. However, up to today, the U.S. side has not yet made a reply. This action of the U.S. side deliberately delaying a reply to the Korean-Chinese side's proposed date for the resumption of talks goes beyond international norms, proving to the world that it is unwilling to convene the Korean political conference and does not hope to achieve genuine peace in Korea.

　　While resisting the resumption of bilateral talks, the U.S. side is also using its majority in the United Nations to overturn India's proposal that the United Nations General Assembly reconvene on February 9th, preventing the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the Korean issue, where the situation is serious due to the destructive policies of the United States. The U.S. ruling group's public opinion is now openly discussing the fact that the convening of a political conference is nowhere in sight, and the resolution of the Korean issue is bound to be delayed for a long time. According to a January 22nd report in the "Wall Street Journal," Washington officials blatantly stated that "there is no hope of achieving a peaceful resolution (of the Korean issue) in the near future."

　　Facts show that what the U.S. authorities care about is not convening a political conference in accordance with the armistice agreement; all its measures are exactly the opposite. Currently, following their actions to undermine the prisoner-of-war agreement, the U.S. side is rushing to support the battered and bruised Lee Seung-man puppet army in order to increase Lee Seung-man's capital to engage in new adventures. U.S. Far East Commander Hull flew to Korea on the 5th to discuss with Lee Seung-man the plan to expand the Lee puppet army in accordance with the U.S.-Lee "Mutual Defense Treaty." According to International News Service, Lee Seung-man's "this plan aims to strengthen the military strength of South Korea so that it can use military means to 'unify' Korea without foreign aid." In addition, the U.S. side violated the armistice agreement by arbitrarily disassembling combat materials into parts and transporting them into South Korea. It also unreasonably asserted in the Military Armistice Commission that combat materials could be disassembled into parts and transported into Korea, which would not be considered a violation of the armistice agreement. Its purpose is to openly mobilize a large number of aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition to strengthen the Lee Seung-man puppet army. However, while the U.S. side is so violently violating the agreement, they shamelessly accuse the Korean-Chinese side of disassembling combat materials into parts and transporting them into Korea to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, claiming that it is a violation of the armistice agreement. This accusation has long been proven baseless by the investigation of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

　　The purpose of this series of absurd actions by the U.S. side is obviously to continue to maintain and create tense situations in Korea and Asia. The whole world has seen that the path chosen by the U.S. authorities is diametrically opposed to the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries.

### 美方延不答复我方恢复双方会谈的建议  证明美方是要继续保持和制造紧张局势

    美方延不答复我方恢复双方会谈的建议
    证明美方是要继续保持和制造紧张局势
    【新华社开城七日电】本社特派记者报道：朝中方面向美方提出在二月一日恢复板门店会谈的建议以来，为时已将近两周，而朝中方面建议的复会日期也已经过去了整整一个星期。但是直到今天，美方还没有提出答复。美方这一故意拖延对朝中方面建议的复会日期不作答复的行动，超越了国际的常轨，向全世界证明了它不愿召开朝鲜政治会议，不希望实现真正的朝鲜和平。
    美方一面抵制双方会谈的复会，一面又挟持它在联合国中的多数，推翻了印度提出的联合国大会在二月九日复会的建议，使联合国大会不能讨论由于美国的破坏政策而造成严重局势的朝鲜问题。美国统治集团的舆论现在已在公开谈论政治会议的召开遥遥无期，朝鲜问题的解决势必要长期拖延下去。据一月二十二日“华尔街日报”报道，华盛顿的官员们露骨地表示“在最近的任何时候获致（朝鲜问题的）和平解决的希望是没有的”。
    事实表明：美国当局关心的不是按照停战协定来召开政治会议，它的一切措施正好与此相反。目前，继他们破坏战俘协议的行动之后，美方又正在急急忙忙地扶植遍体鳞伤的李承晚傀儡军队，以增加李承晚从事新的冒险的资本。远东美军总司令赫尔五日飞往朝鲜和李承晚商谈按照美李“共同防御条约”来扩充李伪军的计划，据国际新闻社透露，李承晚提出的“这个计划目的在于加强南朝鲜的部队实力，以便在没有外援的情况下就可以采用军事的办法来‘统一’朝鲜”。此外，美方又违反停战协定，任意将作战物资拆成零件运入南朝鲜，并在军事停战委员会上蛮横无理地主张作战物资可以拆成零件运入朝鲜，不算违反停战协定，其目的就是要公开调集大量飞机、装甲车辆、武器与弹药来加强李承晚伪军。但是在美方这样横暴地违反协定的时候，他们却又毫无廉耻地向中立国监察委员会诬控朝中方面将作战物资拆成零件运入朝鲜，指称是违反停战协定。这一诬控早已为中立国监察委员会的调查证明为毫无根据。
    美方这一连串乖谬的行动，其目的显然是要在朝鲜和亚洲继续保持和制造紧张局势。全世界都看到了：美国当局所选择的就是这样一条与各国人民的和平愿望截然相反的道路。
