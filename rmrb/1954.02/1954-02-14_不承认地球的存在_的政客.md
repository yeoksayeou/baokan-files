A politician "who does not recognize the existence of the earth"
He Sheng

The great Russian writer Saltykov-Shchedrin, in his legendary novel "The Enthusiastic Civil Servant," described a bureaucrat who was short-sighted, dull-witted, and extremely self-confident. One day, he suddenly saw another country appearing on the horizon and became furious, shouting that he wanted to "close it off"! One can imagine how similar those who still "do not recognize" the People's Republic of China, refuse to allow the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations, and oppose holding a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China are to the bureaucrat in Saltykov-Shchedrin's story!

Not long ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Morton even clamored: "There is no question of recognizing the Communist Chinese regime." U.S. Senator Wiley also openly said: "The important thing is not to allow China to obtain a seat in the United Nations General Assembly." Another U.S. Senator, Nolan, even threatened that if other countries were to vote to allow the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations, "the United States would withdraw." And U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at the recent Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, again arrogantly denied the People's Republic of China the right to participate in resolving international issues. Look, these short-sighted, dull-witted "bureaucrats" have completely fallen into the realm of obliterating facts and denying historical development. As Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out at the Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference: "This is by no means a good situation."

However, the great People's Republic of China, which exists and is developing, cannot be "closed off" or obliterated by any "bureaucrat." Even many bourgeois figures in Western countries have to admit this. "Can people seriously talk about peace in Asia if they do not listen to China's opinion?" This question from the French bourgeois newspaper "L'Aurore" is quite representative. Recently, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lloyd also said:
	“It is wrong not to take into account the fact that the Central People’s Government is the real effective government of China,” “The UN organization can never be a global organization if a government governing hundreds of millions of people is permanently excluded from the UN organization.” Former U.S. President Hoover also stated in private conversations that the United States "cannot pretend that 400 million people do not exist."

The great Chilean poet Neruda said it well:

	"These gentlemen do not want to know the existence of the People's Republic of China,
	They may also not acknowledge the existence of the Earth, but the Earth still
	Keeps rotating and running.
	The Earth will not retreat, but only move forward." (Attached image)

	Politicians with extremely short-sighted vision say: "People's China? We can't see it!"

    “不承认地球的存在”的政客
  　禾生
    俄国大作家谢德林曾在他的传奇小说“热心服务的官员”中，描写过这样一位官僚：他目光短浅，生性鲁钝，可是又极端自信。一天，他忽然看到天际云边出现了另一个国家，就勃然大怒，叫嚷着要把它“封闭起来”！可以想想，那些直到如今还“不承认”中华人民共和国，拒绝中华人民共和国进入联合国，反对召开有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议的人们，和谢德林笔下的这位官僚多么相像！
    不久以前，美国助理国务卿摩顿还叫嚣：“承认中共政权是谈不上的”。美国参议员维利也公开地说：“重要的一点是：不使中国在联合国大会中获得一个席位”。另一位美国参议员诺兰甚至威胁说：如果别的国家要投票使中华人民共和国进入联合国的话，“美国就要退出来”。而美国国务卿杜勒斯，最近在柏林四外长会议上又蛮横地否认中华人民共和国有参与解决国际问题的权利。请看，这些目光短浅，生性鲁钝的“官僚”，已经完全陷入抹杀事实，否认历史发展的境地了。正如苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在柏林四外长会议上所指出的：“这绝不是什么好的境地”。
    不过，存在着并发展着的伟大的中华人民共和国，是任何“官僚”所不能“封闭”和无法抹杀得了的。这一点连西方国家中不少资产阶级人士也不得不承认了。“如果不听取中国的意见，人们能够严肃地谈论亚洲的和平吗？”法国资产阶级报纸“震旦报”的这个发问是具有相当代表性的。最近英国外交副大臣劳埃德还说：
  “如果不考虑到中央人民政府是中国的真正有效的政府这一事实，是错误的”，“假使永远将一个管理数亿人口的政府排斥在联合国机构之外，联合国机构就不可能是全世界性的组织。”美国前总统胡佛在私人谈话中也表示：美国“不能装作四万万人民是不存在的样子。”
    智利大诗人聂鲁达说得好：
    “这些大人先生不愿意知道中华人民共和国的存在，
    他们也可以不承认地球的存在，可是地球还是
      不停地旋转运行。
    地球不会后退，只会前进。”（附图片）
    目光极端短浅的政客们说：“人民中国吗？我们可看不到呀！”
