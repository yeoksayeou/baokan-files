Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th — Ladislav Simovic, Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary Ambassador, representative of the Czechoslovak Republic to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, issued the following statement to Xinhua News Agency and Korean Central News Agency reporters on February 18, 1954:

    Today, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission passed a resolution by majority vote to dissolve the Commission on February 21, 1954.

    I, on behalf of the Czechoslovak delegation, express strong protest against this resolution and point out that this resolution violates the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the Armistice Agreement, and is therefore illegal. I also emphasize its serious consequences, particularly that the issue of prisoner of war repatriation remains unresolved due to the Commission's dissolution before completing its task, making a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and easing international tensions more difficult. The fact that the issue remains unresolved means more suffering for prisoners of war forcibly detained by the US side and poses a serious threat to their sacred right to repatriation.

    During today's Commission meeting when discussing this draft resolution, I made the following statement:

    The Indian delegation has proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that it be dissolved on February 21, 1954. If I, on behalf of the Czechoslovak delegation, am to express our attitude towards such a proposal that would bring about serious factual and political consequences, I must remind and correctly clarify to the members of the Commission the fundamental factors that have led to the current situation of the Commission.

    1. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was established by mutual agreement between the belligerent parties. The relevant provision of Article 51 (f) of the Armistice Agreement is as follows:

    "All prisoners of war not directly repatriated shall be released from military control and custody of the detaining side and shall be transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for disposition in accordance with the provisions of the Annex hereto entitled 'Terms of Reference for Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.'"

    Due to this extremely important provision of the Armistice Agreement, the issue of prisoners of war not directly repatriated was finally resolved after lengthy negotiations, thereby removing the obstacles that had long hindered the realization of the armistice. According to this provision, the belligerent parties have completely entrusted the right and obligation to deal with prisoners of war not directly repatriated to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and regard it as the only relevant institution. The fundamental purpose of Article 51 (f) of the Armistice Agreement is recognized and further elaborated in the articles of the "Terms of Reference". The purpose of establishing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and thus also the Commission's main task, is stated in the first article of the "Terms of Reference" as follows:

    "To ensure that all prisoners of war shall have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the Armistice..."

    2. In order for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to complete this basic task, that is, to complete all the purposes of the "Terms of Reference" which are an important part of the Armistice Agreement, it has the obligation to carry out many tasks, the most fundamental of which are:

    A. To accept custody of prisoners of war not directly repatriated so that they can exercise their right to be repatriated;

    B. After accepting custody of prisoners of war, to ensure that the original detaining side completely and effectively ceases military control and any influence over these prisoners of war;

    C. To ensure that no force or threat of force is used against prisoners of war, but this provision shall not be interpreted as weakening the power of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission;

    D. To ensure that the side to which the prisoners of war belong conducts explanations freely and without any interference within a period of ninety days;

    E. To submit the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated within the ninety-day explanation period to the political conference convened in accordance with Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement.

    The above is the task entrusted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by the mutual agreement of the belligerent parties, if not all, at least the most basic task. Without completing these tasks, there is no way to achieve the purpose of Article 51 (f) of the Armistice Agreement and the "Terms of Reference", nor can the work of the Commission be concluded. Everyone knows that none of these most basic tasks has been completed. This is a topic that has been debated repeatedly in the Commission and has been confirmed by the Commission's "Interim Report" and "Final Report."

    I don't think it is necessary to elaborate on the various tasks of the Commission in detail again. Just comparing the above-mentioned tasks with the facts can lead to a convincing overall picture of the Commission's work:

    A. As everyone knows, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have never been able to exercise effective custody over the prisoners of war in the custodial camps in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone, let alone guarantee that the prisoners of war have the opportunity to freely exercise their right to be repatriated. The Commission came to the following conclusion in its "Interim Report", which was also affirmed in the Final Report:

    "These activities" (i.e., the constant interference by the former detaining side), "together with the activities of the prisoner of war organizations and their 'representatives,' are not conducive to creating conditions for prisoners of war to exercise their right to repatriation without coercion. These activities weakened the custody and control of this Commission and made it extremely difficult for it to establish the freedom of choice of prisoners of war at any time."

    If we consider that even the execution of administrative duties without interference in the Southern Camp – the obvious daily work of any prisoner of war camp custodial authority – was impossible, then it is clear how much the Commission or the Indian Custodial Forces were obstructed in exercising effective custody over the prisoners of war in the Southern Camp. For example, the "Final Report" states:

    "The attitude of the prisoners of war 'representatives' once again made it difficult for the Indian Custodial Forces to perform even normal administrative duties."

    Regarding this point, we can only feel regret that the Commission did not accept the suggestions made by the Czechoslovak and Polish delegations from the beginning of the Commission's work to take effective measures that could guarantee effective custody of prisoners of war. In addition to the direct responsibility of the United Nations Command, the members of the Commission who refused to accept these suggestions are also responsible for the situation formed in the prisoner of war camps in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone.

    B. The execution of all tasks by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces has been opposed from the beginning by activities of the United Nations Command, which were carefully planned in advance and carried out directly by the United Nations Command or through its special agents or organizations controlled by special agents. Since its establishment, the Commission has been forced to declare more than once that the United Nations Command has grossly violated the "Terms of Reference" and the Armistice Agreement, and has concluded in its "Interim Report" that:

    "This Commission cannot judge that the prisoners of war in the Southern Camp under its custody are completely free from the influence of the former detaining side, especially the authorities of the Republic of Korea. Its violations made it impossible for this Commission to reach any other conclusion."

    And: "Indeed, even this Commission itself is under the threat and intimidation of the Republic of Korea."

    The Commission also determined that all hostile activities aimed at obstructing the Commission from carrying out its tasks came from areas controlled by the United Nations Command and were directed by agencies under that Command, which, through a whole system of organizations, became the masters of all fifty-five camp sites in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone. Therefore, there is no doubt that the United Nations Command, which has violated the Armistice Agreement in many ways, bears the primary responsibility for undermining the Commission's execution of its basic tasks. Moreover, it cannot be concealed that despite the specific proposals made by the Czechoslovak and Polish delegations in this regard, the majority in the Commission were negligent in their duties and did not take the necessary measures to stop such hostile activities.

    C. The daily activities in the prisoner of war camps in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone made the Commission aware from the beginning that the situation in the camp sites was not as stipulated by the articles and spirit of the Geneva Conventions, but was under the extremely brutal and terrifying control of the agents of Rhee and Chiang. The victims of despicable murders – the sole purpose of which, as the Commission clearly determined, was to suppress the desire for repatriation – are powerful evidence, though not the only evidence, of this reign of terror. I can say that no meeting of the Commission has failed to discuss the various forms and consequences of this reign of terror. The Commission has also had to use a considerable portion of its report to describe the nature and evil purposes of the terrorist organizations controlled by these agents. To prove that their main method is the use of force in violation of the provisions of Article 3 of the "Terms of Reference", it is sufficient to cite the brief summary in the "Interim Report", which says:

    "The situation in the prisoner of war camps is definitely unfavorable to the implementation of Article 3 of the 'Terms of Reference'."

    D. As far as the Commission's most important task – guaranteeing the free and uncoerced conduct of explanation work – is concerned, it is very obvious that the Commission has not completed its task. In this regard, it is enough to mention one thing, that is, due to the hostile activities of the former detaining side, due to the constant violence and terrorist activities of its agents, and – it must be added – the unwillingness of the command of the Indian Custodial Forces and some members of the Commission to take effective measures, the Korean People's Army Command and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command were only able to conduct ten days of explanation work, instead of the stipulated ninety days. In addition, the environment in which the explanation work was conducted made it impossible to conduct uncoerced work, and maintained the illegal influence of the former detaining side, its agents, and the organizations controlled by them. All of this made it impossible for the overwhelming majority of prisoners of war belonging to the Korean People's Army Command and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command to listen to the explanations, and even those prisoners of war who had listened to the explanations could not freely exercise their right to be repatriated. The Commission concluded in its "Interim Report" that:

    "Even though this Commission has made every effort to create a proper atmosphere for the conduct of the explanation work, this Commission cannot judge that even those prisoners of war in the Southern Camp under its custody who have undergone individual explanations are completely free from the force or threat of force from the prisoner of war camp organizations and their leaders, and who are closely related to the prisoner of war camp organizations and their leaders."

    In the "Final Report," the following short passage was added to this:

    "Fear of the leaders and influence of that organization... persisted until the very end."

    If we simultaneously remember that the "Terms of Reference" stipulate that ninety days of free and uncoerced explanation work is a very basic and indispensable method for guaranteeing the basic and inalienable right of prisoners of war – the right to repatriation, then we can fully realize the seriousness of the Commission's failure to complete this most basic task.

    E. The Commission, which was granted the right by both parties to interpret the "Terms of Reference", made the following clear interpretation in its resolution of January 21, 1954:

    "...According to the 'Terms of Reference', the issue of handling prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated should be submitted by the Commission to the political conference convened in accordance with Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement. Submitting this issue to the political conference is a mandatory provision and cannot be replaced by any other procedure."

    Therefore, according to its own interpretation, the Commission has an inescapable responsibility to submit the issue of handling prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated to the political conference. The Commission has not fulfilled this responsibility to this day.

    3. Even according to a strict interpretation of the "Terms of Reference", the proposal to dissolve the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is untenable. The Czechoslovak delegation proved earlier when interpreting the provisions of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference" that the articles of the "Terms of Reference" form a complete and indivisible whole, and that a correct interpretation is only possible by understanding their interrelationships. This also fully applies to the interpretation of the provisions of Article 11 regarding the dissolution of the Commission. The implementation of this final measure of the Commission must create some indispensable conditions in advance, that is, a series of distinct steps must be taken consecutively:

    A. Conduct ninety days of free and unrestricted explanation work as stipulated,

    B. Submit the issue of handling prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated to the political conference,

    C. The political conference considers and resolves this issue within thirty days,

    D. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission declares the termination of prisoner of war status of prisoners of war who have not yet exercised their right to be repatriated and for whom the political conference has not agreed on any other treatment, and makes them civilians,

    E. Then – Article 11 clearly uses the word "then", which means that after all the above conditions for declaring the termination of prisoner of war status and making them civilians have been achieved – assist prisoners of war who are willing to go to neutral countries to go to neutral countries,

    F. Only after this work is completed can the Commission announce its dissolution.

    The above conclusion drawn according to the articles of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference" is undoubtedly correct. From the well-known and indisputable facts, none of the necessary conditions for announcing the dissolution of the Commission have been met. This has been clearly indicated by the Commission itself. It made this judgment when rejecting Sweden's proposal of January 12, 1954, and passing the resolution of January 21, 1954, that the necessary conditions for terminating prisoner of war status and making them civilians had not been met. The Commission also refused to announce the termination of prisoner of war status and making them civilians, and declared that such measures by any party were illegal and would violate the "Terms of Reference" and the Armistice Agreement. The Commission came to this binding judgment, believing that since the necessary conditions had not been met, even releasing prisoners of war to become civilians was not permissible, and thus it was bindingly stated that further measures, namely dissolving the Commission, were not permissible. Therefore, any measure aimed at dissolving the Commission at the current stage would completely violate the Commission's own resolution and would greatly violate the articles and spirit of the "Terms of Reference" and the Armistice Agreement.

    Therefore, I must state very emphatically that the Czechoslovak delegation believes that the proposal to dissolve the Commission before it has completed its important tasks is unfounded and illegal. Therefore, the Czechoslovak delegation cannot agree to this proposal and will vote against it.

    捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表的抗议声明
    【新华社开城二十日电】中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表、特命全权大使拉吉斯拉夫·西莫维茨于一九五四年二月十八日对新华通讯社和朝鲜中央通讯社记者发表如下声明：
    中立国遣返委员会今天以多数通过了关于在一九五四年二月二十一日解散委员会的决议。
    我代表捷克斯洛伐克代表团对这个决议表示坚决抗议，并指出，这个决议违反了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和停战协定，因此是非法的。我也着重指出它的严重后果，特别是，由于在委员会尚未完成其任务以前就予以解散，战俘遣返问题仍然不得解决，和平解决朝鲜问题与缓和国际紧张局势将更难实现。问题未获解决这一事实对于被美方强迫扣留的战俘说来，就意味着更多的痛苦，就意味着他们被遣返的神圣权利受到严重的威胁。
    在今天委员会会议讨论这个决议草案时，我曾发表如下声明：
    印度代表团已向中立国遣返委员会提出于一九五四年二月二十一日解散委员会的建议。如果我要代表捷克斯洛伐克代表团对这样一个会带来事实上和政治上的严重后果的建议表明我们的态度，我就不得不向委员会各委员提醒，并正确地阐明引起委员会目前局势的根本因素。
    一、中立国遣返委员会是由交战双方共同协议成立的。停战协定第五十一款（丑）项的有关条文如下：
    “各方应将未予直接遣返的其余战俘，从其军事控制与收容下释放出来统交中立国遣返委员会，按照本停战协定附件‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’各条的规定予以处理。”
    由于停战协定的这个极端重要的条文，不直接遣返的战俘的问题终于在长期的谈判后获得了解决，从而清除了长期阻挠停战实现的障碍。根据这个条文，交战双方已把处理不直接遣返战俘的权利与义务完全赋与中立国遣返委员会，并视其为唯一有关机构。停战协定第五十一款（丑）项条文的根本目的在“职权范围”的条文中得到了承认和进一步的阐释。成立中立国遣返委员会的目的，因而也是委员会的主要任务，在“职权范围”第一款中是这样说的：
    “为保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利……”
    二、为了要使中立国遣返委员会能够完成这个基本任务，也就是能够完成作为停战协定的一个重要部分的“职权范围”的全部目的，它有义务进行许多工作，其中最基本的是：
    甲、接受对不直接遣返的战俘的看管，以使他们能够行使其被遣返的权利；
    乙、在接受对战俘的看管后，保证原拘留方对这些战俘的军事控制和任何影响完全地、确实地停止；
    丙、保证不对战俘使用武力或武力威胁，但不应把这一项规定解释为削弱中立国遣返委员会的权力；
    丁、保证战俘的所属方面在九十天期限内无拘束地、不受任何干涉地进行解释；
    戊、把在九十天解释期内尚未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题提交按照停战协定第六十款所建议召开的政治会议。
    以上所述就是交战双方的共同协议交给中立国遣返委员会的任务，如果不算全部至少可以说是最基本的任务。如果没有完成这些任务，那就谈不上达到停战协定第五十一款（丑）项和“职权范围”条文的目的，也谈不上结束委员会的工作。大家都知道的一件事情是，这些最基本的任务中没有一件已经完成，这是委员会中一再辩论的题目，并且得到了委员会“临时报告”和“最后报告”的证实。
    我认为没有必要再来详细地一一论述委员会的各项任务。只要把上述几项任务与事实比较一下，就可得出委员会工作情况的一个令人信服的全面概貌：
    甲、大家知道，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在非军事区南部看管营中从未能对战俘执行有效的看管，更未能保证战俘有自由行使被遣返权利的机会。委员会在其“临时报告”中得出了如下的结论，这个结论也在最后报告中得到肯定：
    “这些活动”（即原拘留一方的不断干涉），“加上战俘组织及其‘代表们’的活动是无助于创造使战俘无束缚地行使其遣返权利的条件的。这些活动削弱了本委员会的看管和控制，并使其在任何时候建立战俘有选择的自由的工作异常困难。”
    如果我们考虑到，在南营即使要不受干涉地执行行政职务——任何战俘营看管当局的当然的日常工作——也不可能，那就很明显地可以看出委员会或印度看管部队要对南营战俘执行有效的看管受到多么大的阻碍。例如，“最后报告”说：
    “战俘‘代表们’的态度又一次使得印度看管部队即使是执行通常的行政职务也很困难。”
    关于这一点，我们只能感到遗憾，因为委员会没有接受捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表团自委员会工作一开始就提出的采取有效措施的建议，而这些建议是可以保证对战俘的有效看管的。除了联合国军方面的直接责任外，拒绝接受这些建议的委员会委员们也对非军事区南部战俘营中形成的局面负有责任。
    乙、中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队一切任务的执行，从一开始就遭到了联合国军的反对活动，这些活动是经过事先仔细策划，由联合国军直接进行或通过他们的特务或特务控制的组织来进行的。委员会自从成立以来，曾不止一次地被迫声明联合国军方面粗暴地违反了“职权范围”和停战协定，并在“临时报告”中得出了如下结论：
    “本委员会不能作出判语说，南部营中在其看管下的战俘完全不受前拘留一方，特别是大韩民国当局的影响。它的侵犯使得本委员会不可能得出任何其他的结论。”
    还有：“的确，连本委员会本身也处于大韩民国之威胁与恐吓之下”。
    委员会还确定目的在阻挠委员会执行其任务的一切敌对活动是来自联合国军司令部控制的地区的并由该司令部所属机构指挥的，这些机构通过一整个系统的组织，成了非军事区南部所有五十五个营场的主宰。因此，毫无疑问，对于破坏委员会执行其基本任务的主要责任要由多方面破坏停战协定的联合国军司令部来负。而且，这一点也是不能掩饰的，就是尽管捷克斯洛伐克与波兰代表团在这方面提出了具体建议，委员会中的大多数还是玩忽职守，并没有采取必要的措施来制止这种敌对活动。
    丙、非军事区南部战俘营中的日常活动使委员会在一开始的时候就了解到：营场中的情况并不是像日内瓦公约的条文与精神所规定的那样，而是在李、蒋特务极端残暴与恐怖的控制之下的。卑鄙谋杀的牺牲者——这种谋杀的唯一目的，如委员会所明白地确定的，是要压制遣返的意愿——就是说明这种恐怖统治的有力证据，虽然还不是唯一的证据。我可以说，没有一次委员会会议没有讨论到这种恐怖统治的各种各样的形式与后果。委员会在报告中还不得不用相当大的一部分来说明受这些特务控制的恐怖组织的性质与罪恶目的。为了证明它们的主要办法是违反“职权范围”第三款的规定而使用武力，只要援引“临时报告”中的扼要总结就够了，“临时报告”这样说：
    “战俘营中的情况是肯定地不利于‘职权范围’第三款的实施的。”
    丁、仅就委员会的无可辩驳的最重要的任务——保证自由地、不受拘束地进行解释工作——而言，委员会没有完成任务是十分明显的。在这方面，只要提出一件事就够了，就是由于原拘留方的敌对活动，由于它的特务所不断进行的暴力与恐怖活动，加以——必须补充这一点——印度看管部队司令部与委员会的一些委员不愿采取有效措施，朝鲜人民军司令部与中国人民志愿军司令部只能够进行十天的解释工作，而不是规定的九十天。此外，进行解释工作时的环境使得进行不受拘束的工作成为不可能，并且保持着原拘留方，它的特务与受他们控制的组织的非法影响。所有这些，使得占压倒多数的属于朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军司令部的战俘没有机会听取解释，即使那些听过解释的战俘也不能自由地行使他们的被遣返的权利。委员会在“临时报告”中得出了这样的结论：
    “纵然本委员会竭尽努力来为解释工作的进行创造适当气氛，本委员会却不能作出判语说，甚至在南营中处于其看管下的那些经过了个别解释的战俘是完全免于来自战俘营组织与其领导的，并与战俘营组织与其领导有密切联系的武力或武力威胁。”
    在“最后报告”中，又在这上面加上了以下这一段短短的话：
    “对于该组织的领袖与势力的恐惧……一直到最后还存在着。”
    假如我们同时记住“职权范围”规定九十天的自由的、不受干扰的解释工作，是保障战俘的基本的、不可剥夺的权利——遣返权利的非常基本的、一定要采用的办法的话，我们就能充分认识到委员会没有能够完成这项最基本的任务的严重性了。
    戊、由双方协议授予解释“职权范围”的权利的委员会在它一九五四年一月二十一日的决议中作出了如下的明确的解释：
    “……根据‘职权范围’，未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题应由委员会提交根据停战协定第六十款召开的政治会议，把这个问题提交政治会议是强制性的规定，不能以任何其他程序来代替”。
    因此，根据它自己的解释，委员会有不可逃避的责任要把未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题提交政治会议。委员会迄今也没有履行这一职责。
    三、即使根据对“职权范围”的严格的解释，解散中立国遣返委员会的建议也是站不住脚的。捷克斯洛伐克代表团早在解释“职权范围”第十一款的各项规定时就已证明，“职权范围”的条款形成一个完全的、不可分割的整体，只有了解它们的相互关系才可能作出正确的解释。这一点也完全适用于对于第十一款关于解散委员会的规定的解释。实行委员会的这一个最后的措施，必须预先创造一些不可缺少的条件，即连续采取一系列步骤分明的措施：
    甲、自由地、不受限制地按规定进行九十天的解释工作，
    乙、把未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题提交政治会议，
    丙、政治会议在三十天之内考虑解决这个问题，
    丁、中立国遣返委员会宣布解除尚未行使被遣返权利又未经政治会议协议出任何其他处理办法的战俘的战俘身份、使之成为平民，
    戊、然后——第十一款明白地使用“然后”字样，这就是说，在实现了上述宣布解除战俘身份使之成为平民的一切条件以后——协助愿意前往中立国的战俘前往中立国，
    己、只有在这一工作完成以后，委员会才能宣告解散。
    根据“职权范围”第十一款的条文得出的上述结论是毫无疑问的，而从大家都知道的、无可辩驳的事实看来，宣布解散委员会的必不可少的条件，一个也没有实现。这一点，委员会本身也曾清楚地表明过。它在拒绝瑞典一九五四年一月十二日的提案和通过一九五四年一月二十一日的决议时都作出了这种判语，就是认为解除战俘身份，使之成为平民的必要条件尚未实现。委员会也拒绝宣布解除战俘身份使之成为平民，并宣布任何一方的这种措施是非法的，并将是违反“职权范围”和停战协定的。委员会得出了这个具有约束性的判语，认为由于必要的条件尚未实现，甚至释放战俘成为平民也是不能容许的，因而也就是具有约束性地说过，更进一步的措施，即解散委员会是不能容许的。因此，在目前阶段旨在解散委员会的任何措施都会完全违反委员会自己的决议，并将大大违反“职权范围”与停战协定的条文与精神的。
    所以，我不得不十分强调地说明：捷克斯洛伐克代表团认为在委员会尚未完成其重要任务时解散委员会的建议是没有任何根据，并且是非法的。因此，捷克斯洛伐克代表团不能同意这个建议，并将投票反对它。
