Higher education in the capital is developing rapidly.

With the development of national construction, dozens of new, formal universities and colleges have been rapidly established and grown in the capital. Beijing now has twenty-five institutions of higher learning at the junior college level and above, with a total of more than 38,000 students, more than three times the number of students in Beijing in the early days of liberation. In the four years from 1950 to 1953, the colleges and universities trained a total of about 11,000 cadres of various kinds, of which engineering graduates accounted for 35 percent. These young students have become a new force in the construction of New China.

Before liberation, higher education in Beijing concentratedly reflected the colonial nature of higher education in old China. Before 1949, the eleven universities in Beijing had only about 10,000 students. Most of the schools not only had complex departments and general majors, but also had very weak foundations. The only independent engineering college—Beijing Railway Management College—had only two professional teachers and a dilapidated school building when it was taken over in 1949. Tsinghua University, with a history of forty-three years, had serious colonial industrial affiliations in its original engineering departments. For example, the Department of Mechanical Engineering did not train personnel in mechanical design and manufacturing, but mainly trained personnel in mechanical assembly, operation, and maintenance. This situation has changed rapidly after liberation. In the autumn of 1952, Beijing's universities and colleges carried out adjustments to their departments, professional settings, and teaching reforms. They have been adjusted and expanded into multi-disciplinary industrial universities, comprehensive universities, and new types of specialized colleges for engineering, agriculture, medicine, teachers, finance and economics, politics and law, and art, according to the nature and tasks of the departments. With the help and guidance of Soviet experts, a foundation was laid for further developing specialized colleges, especially engineering colleges, and consolidating and strengthening comprehensive universities. Tsinghua University, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Mining Institute, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Petroleum Institute, and Beijing Railway Institute, which serve heavy industry construction and national defense construction, have established about 50 majors to train various talents, with a total of more than 19,000 students. The new Tsinghua University has been transformed into a multi-disciplinary industrial university that trains industrial construction talents, with seven departments and twenty-two majors. The current Department of Mechanical Manufacturing has established five majors: mechanical manufacturing engineering, metal cutting machine tools and their tools, casting engineering and its machinery, metal pressure processing and its machinery, welding engineering and its equipment. In order to train experts who can work independently and have ideological and highly technical skills, all engineering colleges have gradually adopted the teaching system of Soviet industrial universities. Tsinghua University has changed to a five-year system since last year. These schools have all established teaching plans, which clearly stipulate the training objectives of each major. Students must go through three production internships throughout their learning process so that the theoretical knowledge they have learned can be enriched and developed in actual production. In this way, they will become qualified construction talents after a few years of study.

Beijing University, a comprehensive university that symbolizes the development of national culture and science, has been further consolidated and strengthened. It trains a large number of scientific research talents and teachers for universities and colleges across the country. Mathematics in science is the foundation of industrial education and scientific research. The number of students currently enrolled in the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics at Peking University exceeds the total number of graduates from the department's establishment more than forty years ago by more than 140. In order to develop the people's cultural and artistic life, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and the Central Institute of Physical Education have been established in Beijing. The Central Institute for Nationalities, which includes forty-seven ethnic groups, was also established in 1951. It trains senior and intermediate cadres of various ethnic minorities and some Han cadres engaged in ethnic minority work for the motherland. There are now more than 800 students studying at the school.

Beijing's universities and colleges have implemented the policy of opening their doors to the children of workers and peasants, and the number of children of workers and peasants entering universities is increasing year by year. In order to train more children of workers and peasants to enter universities, worker-peasant rapid middle schools have been attached to Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Railway Institute, and Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College, with a total of 4,000 students. A large number of technical experts from worker and peasant backgrounds will be trained in Beijing's universities and colleges.

The teaching staff in higher education has also been greatly strengthened. There are a total of 7,000 teachers in the city's universities and colleges. In the new school year of 1953 alone, more than 800 new teaching assistants were added. The number of teachers at the Geological Institute has increased by four and a half times. With the help of senior teachers, Lu Qiren, a teaching assistant in the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Tsinghua University, started teaching the pressure processing forging course after half a year, which was very popular among students. On the basis of ideological transformation, senior teachers are actively demanding to learn from the Soviet Union. Most of the teachers in the schools have learned Russian. Ninety percent of the teachers at Tsinghua University and Peking University have learned Russian. Starting from the second semester of 1953, teachers began systematic political theory studies, which greatly improved their political awareness.

In order to train construction talents on a large scale, Beijing's universities and colleges began planned school construction in 1953. A cultural and educational area roughly equal to the area of Beijing's urban area is being built in the western suburbs of the capital. Nearly 900,000 square meters of construction work have now been completed. Many colleges have moved into new school buildings. (Xinhua News Agency)

    首都高等教育正迅速发展
    随着国家建设的发展，首都数十个新型的正规的大学和学院已迅速建立和成长起来。北京市现有专科以上的高等学校二十五所，在校学生共达三万八千多人，超过了北京解放初期在校学生人数的三倍多。从一九五零年到一九五三年的四年中，各院校培养了各种干部共约一万一千人，其中工科毕业生就占百分之三十五。这些青年学生已成为新中国建设事业中一支新的力量。
    解放前的北京高等教育，集中地反映了旧中国高等教育的殖民地性。一九四九年以前在北京的十一所高等学校，学生只有一万人左右，绝大部分学校不但院系庞杂，专业笼统，而且基础十分薄弱。仅有的一所单科性的独立工科学院——北京铁道管理学院，在一九四九年接收之初，只有专业教师两人和一片破校舍。有着四十三年历史的清华大学，原有的工科性的院系存在着严重的殖民地工业的从属性。例如机械系，它不是培养机械设计和制造方面的人材，而主要是训练机械装配、运转和修配的人材。这种情况在解放后已迅速改变了。一九五二年秋，北京各高等学校进行了院系调整、专业设置和教学改革等工作，已按科系性质和任务的不同，分别调整和扩大为多科性的工业大学、综合大学和新型的工、农、医、师范、财经、政法和艺术等专科学院。加以有苏联专家的帮助和指导，为进一步发展专科院校特别是发展工科院校和巩固与加强综合大学打下了基础。为重工业建设和国防建设服务的清华大学、北京航空学院、北京工业学院、北京钢铁工业学院、北京矿业学院、北京地质学院、北京石油工业学院和北京铁道学院等院校设置了培养各种人材的约五十个专业，共拥有学生一万九千多人。新的清华大学已改变为一所培养工业建设人材的多科性的工业大学，设有七个系和二十二个专业。现在的机械制造系已设立了机械制造工程、金属切削机床及其工具、铸造工程及其机械、金属压力加工及其机械、焊接工程及其设备等五个专业。为了培养能独立进行工作并具有思想性和高度技术水平的专家，各工科院校都逐步采用了苏联工业大学的教学制度。清华大学从去年起已改为五年制。这些学校都订立了教学计划，计划中明确规定了各专业的培养目标。学生们在整个学习过程中，必须经过三次生产实习，使他们所学的理论知识，在实际生产中得到充实和发展。这样，他们在几年的学习后，就能成为合格的建设人材了。
    标志着国家文化科学发展的综合大学——北京大学已更加巩固和加强。它为国家培养着大批的科学研究人材和高等学校的师资。理科中的数学是工业教育和科学研究工作的基础，北京大学数学力学系现在在校的学生人数，比该校设立数学系四十多年来的毕业生总数还超过了一百四十多人。为发展人民的文化艺术生活，在北京已先后建立了中央戏剧学院、中央美术学院、中央体育学院。包括四十七个民族的中央民族学院，也在一九五一年成立了。它为祖国培养着各少数民族的高级和中级干部及一部分从事少数民族工作的汉族干部。现在在校学习的学生共八百多人。
    北京各高等学校贯彻了为工农子弟开门的方针，各高等学校中工农子弟入学的人数正逐年增加。为了更多地培养工农子弟升入大学，在中国人民大学、北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学、北京工业学院、北京铁道学院和北京农业机械化学院等院校都附设了工农速成中学，共有学生四千人。大批工农出身的技术专家，将从北京各高等学校中培养出来。
    高等教育中的教师阵容也大大地加强起来。全市高等学校的教师共达七千人。仅一九五三年新学年就增加了八百多个新助教。地质学院的教师增加了四倍半。清华大学机械制造系助教陆其仁在老教师的帮助下，半年后就开讲了压力加工锻工课，很受学生欢迎。老教师在思想改造的基础上，都积极要求学习苏联，大多数学校的教师都已学习了俄文，清华大学、北京大学已有百分之九十的教师学会了俄文。从一九五三年下学期起，教师中开始了系统的政治理论学习，使得他们的政治觉悟有很大提高。
    为了大规模地培养建设人材，北京各高等学校于一九五三年已开始了有计划的学校建设。一个和北京城区面积大体相等的文教区，正在首都西郊建设起来，现在已完成了近九十万平方公尺的建筑工程。许多学院已迁入了新校舍。（新华社）
