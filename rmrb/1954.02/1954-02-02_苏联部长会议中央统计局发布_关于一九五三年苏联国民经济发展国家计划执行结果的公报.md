Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st, TASS dispatch: The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union released a bulletin on January 31st regarding the results of the implementation of the national economic development plan of the Soviet Union in 1953.

The bulletin stated that the total annual industrial output plan of the Soviet Union in 1953 was generally fulfilled by 101 percent. The total industrial output in 1953 increased by 12 percent compared to 1952, and by 45 percent compared to 1950. This means that the task of increasing industrial output stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan is being successfully completed.

As a result of the implementation of the government's resolution aimed at greatly improving the people's living standards, the development of light industry was faster than in 1952 and as originally planned. The output of these industries increased by 10.5 percent in 1952 and by 12 percent in 1953.

Soviet industry has exceeded its plan in many items, including iron ore and manganese ore, petroleum, kerosene, aluminum, electricity, metal-cutting machine tools, high-efficiency steam boilers, diesel engines, blast furnace and steelmaking equipment, trucks and cars, tractor-drawn plows and mowers, grain cleaners, potato harvesting combines, excavators, mineral fertilizers, synthetic rubber, paper, silk fabrics, woolen fabrics and linen fabrics, vegetable oil, margarine, confectionery, tea, wine, beer, tobacco and other food and daily necessities.

Compared with 1952, the increase in the output of important industrial products in 1953 was as follows (percentage of 1953 compared to 1952): pig iron 109, steel 110, rolled metal 110, coal 106, oil 112, electricity 113, steam turbines 140, large hydro turbines 135, electric motors 113, main line steam locomotives 263, trucks 111, cars 130, metallurgical equipment 118, metal cutting machine tools 114, tractors 113, grain harvesting combines 102, mineral fertilizers 109, synthetic rubber 113, prefabricated houses 109, cotton fabrics 105, woolen fabrics 109, silk fabrics 178, leather shoes 104, radio receivers 127, television sets 225, household refrigerators 159, meat 112, butter 103, sugar 112, soap 111.

The output of daily necessities has greatly increased in various heavy industrial enterprises and machinery manufacturing enterprises. The production of high-quality goods with large sales volumes has also greatly expanded.

The industrial production cost in 1953 was more than 5 percent lower than in 1952.

Measures have been taken in various sectors of the national economy to develop and use new machines, and to develop and implement production automation. Soviet machinery manufacturing created approximately seven hundred important new types of machines and equipment, which guaranteed the further development of technology in the national economy, of which more than one hundred types were new and highly efficient equipment for light industry and the food industry.

More than eighty new types of machines and tools have been designed for the further mechanization of agricultural work.

The number of inventions and rationalization proposals of the Soviet working people has increased. In 1953, 850,000 inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals were adopted in industry, construction, and transportation.

The bulletin went on to say that the enterprises of some ministries did not complete the tasks stipulated in the plan for increasing output, using new machines, and adopting new technical methods.

The bulletin also included figures for the development of Soviet agriculture last year. The total sown area in 1953 increased by 1.4 million hectares compared to 1952. The sown area of wheat – the most valuable grain – increased by 2 million hectares.

Despite unfavorable weather conditions in some regions, the total grain harvest was almost the same as in 1952. The harvest of cotton, sugar beet, sunflower seeds, vegetables, and melon crops was greater than in 1952. The harvest of potatoes was about the same as last year.

Agriculture received 139,000 general-purpose tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) and 18,000 row-crop tractors, 41,000 grain harvesting combines, 69,000 trucks, and more than 2 million other agricultural equipment and machines. More than 80 percent of the major field work of collective farms was done by machine tractor stations. The cultivation work of collective farms was almost entirely mechanized.

From October 1, 1952, to October 1, 1953, the number of publicly owned livestock in collective farms increased as follows: dairy cows by 8 percent, sheep by 9 percent, and pigs by 10 percent. During the same period, the number of livestock in the farms under the Soviet State Farm Department increased as follows: dairy cows by 9 percent, sheep by 11 percent, and pigs by 8 percent.

The bulletin of the Central Statistical Bureau also pointed out that the task stipulated in the plan for sowing certain industrial raw material crops and vegetables was not completed. Machine tractor stations did not fully complete the harvesting plan for certain feed crops and other crops.

The bulletin then mentioned the development of railway, waterway, and highway transportation. The annual railway freight transport plan for 1953 was overfulfilled. The freight volume increased by 7 percent compared to last year.

In 1953, the total state basic investment in the national economy was 104 percent of that in 1952. Investment in the ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industry, power stations, machinery manufacturing, fuel, chemical, wood and paper industry, building materials industry, and other sectors of heavy industry increased.

In 1953, the total state basic investment in the construction of light industrial and food industrial enterprises increased by 8 percent compared to last year. Approximately three hundred new state-owned industrial enterprises manufacturing daily necessities have been put into production in 1953.

Last year, Soviet trade continued to expand. The retail trade plan was overfulfilled.

In 1953, the quantity of goods purchased by residents (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 21 percent compared to 1952.

Approximately six thousand new stores were opened.

As in previous years, the Soviet Union continued to expand foreign trade. Last year, the Soviet Union traded with fifty-one countries, of which trade with twenty-five countries was conducted under trade agreements signed for one year or more. Trade agreements signed with India, France, Argentina, Greece and Iceland were the first since the war.

Last year, the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume was 23 billion rubles, while in 1952 it was 20.8 billion rubles, an increase of 11 percent. Calculated at comparable prices, the foreign trade volume in 1953 was nearly four times the pre-war level.

While further expanding trade with democratic countries, trade with several countries in Western Europe and the Near and Middle East has also expanded.

The bulletin continued that the number of Soviet employees has greatly increased, reaching 44.8 million by the end of 1953.

As before, there was no unemployment in the Soviet Union in 1953.

Due to the increase in technical equipment and the improvement of workers' skills, industrial labor productivity in 1953 increased by 6 percent compared to 1952, and construction labor productivity increased by 4 percent compared to 1952.

The material and cultural living standards of workers, peasants, and intellectuals have been further improved.

The national income of the Soviet Union increased by 8 percent compared to 1952. The portion of the national income used by the working people to meet their personal needs has increased, while the portion handled by the state has decreased slightly.

The reduction in state retail prices of consumer goods was greater than in 1952, and the variety of goods with reduced prices was also greater than in 1952. The reduction in prices by state-owned and cooperative trade organizations alone gave residents more than 50 billion rubles of benefits in one year, while in 1952 this number was 24 billion rubles.

Basic investment in housing built by state-owned enterprises increased by 11 percent.

In 1953, a total of 28 million square meters of housing was built in towns and industrial residential areas.

Due to the implementation of several measures to strengthen the economic incentives for collective farms and collective farmers, as well as measures in tax policy, the income of collective farms and collective farmers increased by more than 13 billion rubles in 1953.

In addition, the reduction in state retail prices also brought great benefits to farmers.

The increase in farmers' income is also reflected in the fact that more than 400,000 new houses were built in rural areas in 1953.

In 1953, due to the increase in appropriations for social and cultural undertakings, the reduction in retail prices, and the implementation of other measures to improve the living standards of the working people, the Soviet people received 195 billion rubles of benefits from the state budget, while in 1952, this figure was 147 billion rubles. At the same time, the working people provided the budget with 65 billion rubles in the form of taxes and subscription to public bonds, a decrease of 21 billion rubles compared to last year. Therefore, in 1953, the benefits the Soviet people received from the budget were 130 billion rubles more than they provided to the budget from their personal income, while in 1952, this figure was 61 billion rubles.

In 1953, the total income of workers, staff members, and peasants increased by 13 percent compared to 1952, calculated at comparable prices.

In 1953, there was greater progress in culture. The cultural level of the Soviet people has been further improved.

For example, the number of students in the eighth and tenth grades of secondary schools increased by 1,307,000 compared to 1952.

The number of students in higher education institutions was 1,562,000, an increase of 120,000 compared to 1952; the number of students in technical schools and other secondary specialized schools was 1,644,000, an increase of 166,000 compared to 1952. Last year, more than 500,000 young experts graduated from higher education institutions and secondary specialized schools.

    苏联部长会议中央统计局发布
    关于一九五三年苏联国民经济发展国家计划执行结果的公报
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科一月三十一日电：苏联部长会议中央统计局一月三十一日发布了关于一九五三年苏联国民经济发展国家计划执行结果的公报。
    公报说，一九五三年苏联工业全年总产量计划整个说来完成了百分之一百零一。一九五三年的工业总产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十二，比一九五零年增加了百分之四十五。这就是说，第五个五年计划所规定的增加工业产量的任务正在顺利完成。
    执行政府的旨在大大提高人民生活水平的决议的结果，日用品工业的发展比一九五二年及原来计划规定的都要快。这些工业的产量在一九五二年增加了百分之十点五，在一九五三年增加了百分之十二。
    苏联工业在许多项目上都超过了计划，其中包括铁矿砂和锰矿砂、石油、煤油、铝、电力、金属切削母机、效能强大的蒸汽锅炉、柴油引擎、高炉和炼钢设备、载货汽车和轻便汽车、拖拉机曳引犁和刈草机、清谷机、马铃薯收获联合机、挖掘机、矿质肥料、人造橡胶、纸张、丝织品、毛织品和麻织品、植物油、人造奶油、糖果、茶叶、酒、啤酒、烟草和其他食品和日用品。
    和一九五二年比较，一九五三年重要工业品的产量增加情形如下（一九五三年与一九五二年的百分比）：铣铁一○九，钢一一○，压延金属一一○，煤一○六，石油一一二，电力一一三，蒸气透平一四○，大型水力透平一三五，电动机一一三，干线蒸气机车二六三，载货汽车一一一，轻便汽车一三○，冶金设备一一八，金属切削母机一一四，拖拉机一一三，谷物收割联合机一○二，矿质肥料一○九，人造橡胶一一三，预装配房屋一○九，棉织品一○五，毛织品一○九，丝织品一七八，皮鞋一○四，无线电收音机一二七，电视机二二五，家用冰箱一五九，肉类一一二，牛油一○三，糖类一一二，肥皂一一一。
    各个重工业企业和机器制造业企业的日用品产量大大增加了。销售量很大的、质量很高的物品的生产也大大扩大了。
    一九五三年的工业生产成本比一九五二年低百分之五以上。
    国民经济各部门已经采取措施来发展并使用新机器，来发展并实行生产自动化。苏联机器制造业创造了约七百种重要的新型机器和设备，这些机器和设备保证了国民经济中技术的进一步发展，其中有一百多种是轻工业和食品工业用的效率很高的新型设备。
    为了农业工作的进一步机械化，已经设计了八十多种新型的机器和工具。
    苏维埃劳动人民的发明和合理化建议的数目已有增加。在一九五三年，工业、建筑业和运输业已经采用了八十五万项发明、技术改进和合理化建议。
    公报接着说，某些部的企业并没有完成计划规定的增加产量、使用新机器和采用新的技术方法的任务。
    公报中还包括去年苏联农业发展的数字。一九五三年总播种面积比一九五二年增加了一百四十万公顷。小麦——最宝贵的粮食——的播种面积增加了二百万公顷。
    尽管某些地区气候条件不利，粮食的总收获量还是差不多达到了一九五二年的数字。棉花、甜菜、葵花子、蔬菜和瓜类作物的收获量比一九五二年大。马铃薯的收获量差不多和去年的一样。
    农业得到了十三万九千台一般用拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）和一万八千台中耕用拖拉机、四万一千部谷物收割联合机、六万九千辆载货汽车和二百多万种其他农业设备和机器。集体农庄百分之八十以上的主要田间工作是由机器拖拉机站做的。集体农庄的耕种工作几乎全部都机械化了。
    从一九五二年十月一日到一九五三年十月一日，集体农庄的公有牲畜头数增加如下：乳牛百分之八，绵羊百分之九，猪百分之十。在同时期中，苏联国营农场部所属各农场的牲畜头数增加如下：乳牛百分之九，绵羊百分之十一，猪百分之八。
    中央统计局的公报同时指出，计划规定的播种某些工业原料作物和蔬菜的任务没有完成。机器拖拉机站没有完全完成某些饲料作物和其他作物的收割计划。
    公报接着提到铁路、水路和公路运输的发展。一九五三年的铁路货运全年计划超额完成了。货物载运量比去年增加了百分之七。
    在一九五三年，国民经济中的国家基本投资额为一九五二年的百分之一百零四。黑色和有色金属冶炼业、电力站、机器制造业、燃料、化学、木材和造纸工业、建筑材料工业和重工业其他部门的投资额增加了。
    在一九五三年，轻工业和食品工业企业建设方面的国家基本投资总额比去年增加了百分之八。大约三百个制造日用品的新的国营工业企业已经在一九五三年投入生产。
    去年，苏维埃贸易继续扩大。零售贸易计划超额完成了。
    在一九五三年，居民所购买的商品数量（按比较价格计算）比一九五二年增加了百分之二十一。
    新开设了约六千家商店。
    和往年一样，苏联继续扩大对外贸易。去年，苏联和五十一个国家进行了贸易，其中与二十五个国家的贸易是根据已签订的为期一年或多年的贸易协定进行的。和印度、法国、阿根廷、希腊与冰岛签订的贸易协定在战后还是第一次。
    去年，苏联的对外贸易额是二百三十亿卢布，而一九五二年为二百零八亿卢布，即增加了百分之十一。按比较价格计算，一九五三年的对外贸易额将近增为战前水平的四倍。
    与进一步扩大对民主阵营各国的贸易同时，对西欧和近东中东若干国家的贸易也扩大了。
    公报接着说，苏联职工的数目大大增加了，到一九五三年年底，职工的数目是四千四百八十万人。
    和以前一样，一九五三年苏联没有失业。
    由于技术设备的增加和工人技术的提高，一九五三年工业的劳动生产率比一九五二年提高了百分之六，建筑业的劳动生产率比一九五二年提高了百分之四。
    工人、农民和知识分子的物质和文化水平有了进一步的提高。
    苏联国民收入比一九五二年增加了百分之八。国民收入中劳动人民用来满足他们个人需要的部分增加了，而其余由国家处理的部分则略有减少。
    消费品的国家零售价格的减低的幅度比一九五二年大，减价货物的种类也比一九五二年多。单是国营和合作社营贸易组织的物价的减低，就使居民一年得到了五百多亿卢布的好处，而在一九五二年这个数目是二百四十亿卢布。
    国营企业所建房屋的基本投资增加了百分之十一。
    一九五三年，在城镇和工业住宅区共建筑了建筑面积为二千八百万平方公尺的住宅。
    由于实行了若干加强对集体农庄和集体农民的经济鼓励的措施以及赋税政策方面的措施，一九五三年集体农庄和集体农民的收入增加了一百三十多亿卢布。
    此外，国家零售价格的减低也使农民得到了很大的好处。
    农民收入的增加还表现在下面的事实上：一九五三年，在农村地区兴建了四十多万幢新房屋。
    在一九五三年，由于社会和文化事业拨款的增加、零售价格的减低和提高劳动人民生活水平的其他措施的实行，苏联人民从国家预算中得到了一千九百五十亿卢布的好处，而在一九五二年，这个数字是一千四百七十亿卢布。同时，劳动人民以纳税和认购公债的方式为预算提供了六百五十亿卢布，比去年减少了二百一十亿卢布。因此，在一九五三年，苏联人民从预算得到的好处比他们从个人收入中提供给预算的要多一千三百亿卢布，而在一九五二年，这个数字是六百一十亿卢布。
    一九五三年，工人、职员和农民的总收入，按比较价格计算比一九五二年增加了百分之十三。
    在一九五三年，文化方面有了更大的进展。苏联人民的文化水平进一步提高了。
    例如，中等学校八年级和十年级的学生人数比一九五二年增加了一百三十万零七千名。
    高等学校的学生人数为一百五十六万二千名，比一九五二年增加了十二万名；技术学校和其他中等专科学校的学生人数为一百六十四万四千名，比一九五二年增加了十六万六千名。去年，从高等学校和中等专科学校毕业的青年专家有五十多万名。
