    On the American Economic Crisis
    By E. Varga, Soviet Union
    In early January, President Eisenhower presented his first State of the Union address to Congress.
    No matter how hard Eisenhower's economic advisors try to gloss over it, the situation in the United States today is much worse than it was a year ago. It turns out that Eisenhower's pre-election promises were not fulfilled. He promised to bring prosperity to the United States, but his ministers have failed to prevent the occurrence of the overproduction crisis; they have only guaranteed the maximum profits of the large monopoly capitalists.
    "There is no crisis"
    American "learned" economists, big capitalists and leaders of right-wing unions are no longer able to deny the facts of production decline, increased unemployment, and falling prices. But because they are afraid of exposing the deepest contradictions of the capitalist mode of production, they are very careful about the word "crisis," and replace it with many nicer terms, such as: "slower growth," "normal adaptation to new situations," "sluggishness," "adjustment," "downturn," and so on. American economists arbitrarily say: "There is no crisis." Using terms like "depression" and "crisis" is considered dangerous.
    Marx established the only correct and only scientific theory of economic crises. He proved that under the capitalist system, the periodic cycle of overproduction crises is inevitable. In the past hundred years, there have been no fewer than ten world economic crises that have swept through major or all capitalist countries. However, bourgeois economists have tried their best to portray things as if the occurrence of overproduction crises is not due to objective reasons, but to various subjective reasons. For example, talking about "crisis" is said to undermine confidence and thus cause a crisis!
    Fairless, the manager of the steel trust "United States Steel Corporation," declared at the Detroit Economic Club: "Our own talk about crisis can cause a crisis."
    Capitalists and their economists intentionally or unintentionally confuse cause and effect.
    It is very obvious that after an economic crisis occurs due to objective reasons, people take corresponding actions in the economic field in response to the new situation, thereby deepening the crisis. This is not a "subjective" action, but also an objective necessity. Every capitalist who anticipates a fall in prices, in order to maintain profits, tries to buy as little as possible, sell off old goods as soon as possible, and delay replacing factory equipment. This action accelerates the decline in production and prices. Workers and employees who see an increasing number of layoffs are completely afraid of their future due to objective reasons. They buy as little as possible, especially durable goods such as furniture, clothing, shoes, and radios, in order to have a little money on hand in case of unemployment. Their actions reduce the capacity of the domestic market, exacerbate overproduction, and deepen the crisis. Farmers who have suffered serious damage due to falling prices have reduced their purchases of agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and daily necessities. This also deepens the crisis. But all of this is not the result of "talking about crisis," is not due to subjective reasons, but is due to the existence of an overproduction crisis.
    The decline of American production
    In the United States, after overproduction occurred, the expansion of production continued for a long period of time. Capitalists, in pursuit of maximum profits, further expand production, increase inventories, and sell goods on credit, relying on the future consumption capacity of residents, hoping that the difficulties encountered in sales are temporary. This was exactly the case before each economic crisis in the past.
    In the United States, large amounts of inventory have already accumulated. In September 1953, the inventory of private entrepreneurs in industry, wholesale and retail industries reached 80 billion US dollars. The value of agricultural products stored by the government and agricultural products in the hands of farmers used to secure loans from the government was 6 billion US dollars. The strategic raw materials stored by the government have reached 5 to 6 billion US dollars. The storage value of a large number of various weapons and ammunition (atomic bombs, tanks, artillery, etc.) is no less than 100 billion US dollars. According to official figures, the amount of consumer credit loans in October 1953 was 28.2 billion US dollars. Inventories continued to increase until November 1953, and the amount of consumer credit loans has continued to increase even to this day.
    However, neither production for storage nor relying on the future purchasing power of society to sell goods can stop the overproduction crisis. This can be proved by the following figures:
      Index of American industrial production
      (1934-35 equals 100)
      December 1952 – 235
      March 1953 (highest figure) – 243
      September 1953 – 234
      November 1953 – 228
      December 1953 (our estimate) – 226
    Therefore, even according to official statistics, the decline in American production has reached 7 percent.
    Marx and Lenin taught that the deterioration of the living conditions of the working masses, their low purchasing power, periodically and inevitably limits the attempts of capitalists to expand production endlessly, and the living conditions of the proletarianized masses make overproduction inevitable.
    By studying the official statistics of the United States, we can find concrete proof of this principle of Marxism-Leninism. The industrial sectors that mainly produce for the consumption of the working masses began to reduce production several months earlier than the overall decline in production. For example, the production of cotton textiles and knitted goods began to shrink in early 1953. The output of shoes decreased by 20 percent in the period from March to July.
    The different development of the purchasing power of various strata of residents has a particularly obvious impact on the American automobile market. As early as a year ago, there was already a surplus of old cars purchased by the working masses. Ordinary new cars purchased by the wealthy class of farmers, small and medium-sized bourgeoisie, clerks and officials began to experience sales difficulties last year; while luxury cars purchased by the large bourgeoisie have not yet experienced any sales difficulties!
    Lenin pointed out that the ultimate purpose of production is always to produce consumer goods. The production of means of production is only for the purpose of using it to produce consumer goods. The overproduction of consumer goods that had already appeared in early 1953 inevitably caused overproduction of means of production, causing its production to decline.
    This is exactly what happened in the last two months of 1953. The production of steel, which is the main material for manufacturing production tools, decreased by 22 percent in December compared to the month with the highest output (March). The number of smelting furnaces in production is decreasing day by day. In mid-December 1953, in the metallurgical center, Pittsburgh, only 19 of the 25 smelting furnaces were in production; only 11 of the 14 open-hearth furnaces were in production. The number of workers in machine manufacturing factories has decreased. Therefore, the current crisis is developing according to the "standard" pattern: warehouses are piled up with goods, then the production of consumer goods declines, and finally the crisis in the means of production becomes more and more serious.
    All the materials indicate the inevitability of further decline in American production (but this does not mean that there are no cases of increased production in individual months, such as in August 1953. Production during the crisis never declines all the time). This can be predicted based on the following specific facts:
      (1) At the end of October 1953, the number of unfulfilled orders of American companies decreased by 13 billion US dollars compared to the end of October 1952, that is, a decrease of 18 percent. The number of new orders in October decreased by 2 billion US dollars compared to a year ago. The situation in November and December was even worse than this.
    (2) The sharp decline in steel production means that the production of means of production is shrinking. This can also be proved by the large number of reports in American newspapers about the reduction of production and the dismissal of workers in some enterprise departments.
    (3) In October 1953, the number of newly started residential buildings decreased by 10 percent compared to October 1952.
    (4) At the end of October, the inventory of private entrepreneurs was nearly 80 billion US dollars.
    Only by reducing production, lowering prices, and partially damaging and destroying goods can the backlog of inventory be reduced. Under the capitalist system, only in this way, that is, through crisis, can the normal relationship between production and commodity storage be restored.
    Falling prices are a sign of crisis and a factor in deepening the crisis
    Despite overproduction, the large monopoly capitalists in the United States kept the prices of their commodities higher than the level of 1952 until last autumn. However, the commodity prices of non-monopoly enterprises experienced a serious decline.
    Percentage increase in general commodity prices of monopoly capital
    September 1952   September 1953
    Steel (in US dollars per ton) 66    81  23
    Aluminum (in cents per pound) 20    21.5  7.5
    Copper (in cents per pound) 24.2  29.6  21
    Gasoline (in cents per gallon) 12.9  14.2  10
    Sulfuric acid (in US dollars per ton) 20    22.3  11
    The factory price of new cars has not been reduced, and the price of weapons is of course maintained at a very high level. In many major sectors of heavy industry, the reason why prices can be maintained at such a high level is naturally due to the implementation of the arms race policy.
    However, the commodities that monopoly capitalists try to depress prices have a completely different situation. Since September 1952, the purchase price of cotton has fallen by 16 percent, wheat by 9 percent, beef by 20 percent, and scrap steel by 24 percent.
    By the way, these materials once again confirm how poor the concept provided by the average number is: The total index of American wholesale prices in September 1952 was 107 (with 1948 as 100), and in September 1953 it was 106. It seems that there is no change. But in fact, the monopoly capitalists increased the prices of their commodities by 20 percent during this period, thus obtaining huge excess profits. However, the wholesale prices of agricultural products fell by 10 to 20 percent, and hundreds of thousands of farmers went bankrupt as a result.
    However, starting from October and November 1953, the large monopoly capitalists had to admit the fact of overproduction and lowered prices. Since October, steel monopoly capitalists have borne the railway freight of their commodities, which was previously paid by the buyers. The price of certain special high-grade steel has been reduced by 2 US dollars to 13 US dollars per ton.
      "General Electric Company" reduced the price of air conditioners by 25 percent in early December. Oil trusts have reduced the price of gasoline two or three times in a row. Large speculators in the construction industry have reduced the price of a single-family house in a new building from 24,500 US dollars to 22,500 US dollars, and even so, there are still no buyers.
    All these facts show that the militarization of the national economy has not eliminated the inevitability of economic crises. On the contrary, it has promoted the development of a new and profound economic crisis and created conditions for the arrival of the crisis.
    The growth of unemployment and poverty
    Newspapers are reporting news of mass layoffs of workers in the automobile, aircraft manufacturing, metallurgy and other industrial sectors every day.
    In mid-November last year, the official statistics of the United States admitted for the first time that the number of employed people decreased and the number of unemployed people increased by 300,000 in the past month. In December, it was admitted that the number of unemployed people increased by 422,000. In this way, the problem became more obvious. Usually in December, the number of unemployed people always decreases, because department stores, shops, clothing stores and other shops always hire temporary workers, shop assistants and other personnel for Christmas and New Year's business. In January this year, the speed of the increase in the number of unemployed people did not decrease slightly.
    Official materials only admit that there are 1.85 million unemployed people. In fact, the number of unemployed people is several times more than this. Everyone knows that the statistics of the US government do not count as unemployed even those who work only one hour a week and those who are actually unemployed but retain "job positions" and those who are allowed to obtain work in the next month. The number of people laid off reported in the newspapers is completely inconsistent with the number of unemployed people announced by the authorities. Secondly, it should also be estimated that in the United States, 700,000 young people apply for work every year, but even according to official materials, the number of employed workers is less than last year.
    The method of shortening working hours is widely used. The average working hours of industrial workers decreased from 41.7 hours per week in December 1952 to 39.9 hours per week in December 1953. In addition, intermittent systems and other methods are adopted. Therefore, the average weekly wage of employed workers decreased by 2 US dollars in the period from March to September 1953.
    At the same time, although wholesale prices have fallen, retail prices, especially retail prices of food, have not been reduced.
    It can be concluded that the number of completely unemployed people has increased by at least one million. Within half a year, the weekly wage of employed people decreased by 2 US dollars, but the minimum living expenses increased by 2 percent. Even according to these figures, it is enough to prove that due to the development of crisis symptoms, the American working class has felt a further decline in living standards.
    It goes without saying that the changes in the living conditions of workers will reduce their purchasing power, and first of all, will reduce their demand for industrial products, which is a factor that deepens the crisis.
          ☆☆☆
    At the end of December 1953, the conference of 300 major economists in the United States, forced by the facts, finally had to admit that the "recession" period had begun. The economists declared that the national income in 1954 would be 5 percent less than in 1953, the total value of industrial production would be 20 to 25 billion US dollars less, and the industrial production index would be 10 to 15 percent less. Among the 300 economists (100 of whom are serving in government agencies), only 6 believe that production will begin to increase in 1954. The vast majority of economists have had to admit that even in 1955, production will inevitably continue to decline.
    In the current complicated situation of the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, it is of course difficult to accurately describe the further development of the crisis. But one thing is very clear: the American overproduction crisis is increasingly becoming a truly active factor on a larger scale.

    论美国经济危机
    苏联  埃·瓦尔加
    一月初，艾森豪威尔总统向国会提出了他的第一个国情咨文。
    不论艾森豪威尔的经济顾问们如何竭力地进行粉饰，但今天美国的情况比起一年前来是恶化得多了。事实证明，艾森豪威尔在选举前所许下的诺言并未兑现。他答应使美国繁荣，但是他的部长们却未能阻止生产过剩危机的发生，他们仅仅保证了大垄断资本家的最大利润。
    “危机并不存在”
    美国“博学的”经济学家、大资本家和右翼工会的领袖们已不再能够否认生产衰落、失业增加、物价下跌等事实。但是因为害怕暴露资本主义生产方式的最深刻的矛盾，他们对于“危机”这个字眼讳莫如深，而代之以许多比较好听的名词，例如：“增长速度减缓”、“对新情况的正常适应”、“沉寂”、“调整”、“下降趋势”等等。美国的经济学家武断地说：“危机并不存在”。使用“萧条”、“危机”等名词被认为是危险的。
    马克思建立了唯一正确的和唯一科学的经济危机的理论。他证明了在资本主义制度下，生产过剩危机的周期性的循环是不可避免的。近百年来，曾席卷主要或全部资本主义国家的世界经济危机就不下十次。但是，资产阶级的经济学家却极力把事情描写成这样：似乎生产过剩危机的发生不是由于客观原因，而是由于各种主观原因。例如，对“危机”的谈论，据说就会破坏信任，从而引起危机！
    钢铁托辣斯“美国钢铁公司”的经理费尔勒斯在底特律经济俱乐部上就这样宣称：“我们自己关于危机的谈论，就能引起危机。”
    资本家和他们的经济学家都有意或无意地把原因和结果混为一谈。
    非常明显，由于客观原因而发生的经济危机开始以后，人们针对新的情况在经济方面作出相应的行动，从而又加深了危机。这并不是“主观的”行动，而同样是客观的必然性。每一个预料到物价下跌的资本家，为了保持利润，就尽量地少买，尽快地把陈货脱手，并延迟更换工厂设备。这种行动加速了生产和物价的下降。看到大批解雇事件日益增多的工人和职员们，完全是由于客观原因而对自己的未来感到恐惧。他们尽可能少买一切东西，特别是像家具、衣服、鞋子、收音机一类的耐用品，以备在失业的时候，手头上还可以多少有一点钱。他们的行动缩小了国内市场的容量，加剧了生产过剩，加深了危机。由于物价跌落而遭受严重损害的农民们，减少了对农业机器、肥料和日用品的购买。这也加深了危机。但所有这一切并不是“谈论危机”的结果，不是由于主观原因而发生的，而是由于生产过剩危机的存在而发生的。
    美国生产的下降
    在美国，当生产过剩发生以后，生产的扩大仍然继续了很长的时期。资本家由于追求最大的利润，就更加扩大生产，增加存货，用赊购的办法，即依赖居民未来的消费能力而出卖商品，希望在销售方面遇到的困难是暂时的。过去在每次经济危机发生以前，也正是这样的情况。
    在美国，已经积压着大量的存货。一九五三年九月间，工业、批发和零售业中私人企业主的存货达八百亿美元。政府储存的农产品及农场主手头用来向政府抵押贷款的农产品价值为六十亿美元。政府储存的战略原料已达五十到六十亿美元的数目。大量的各种各样的武器与弹药（原子弹、坦克、大炮等）的储存价值不下一千亿美元。根据官方数字，消费信用贷款的数目，一九五三年十月是二百八十二亿美元。到一九五三年十一月存货一直在增加，消费信用贷款的数目，甚至到目前还一直在增加。
    然而，不论是为储存而生产，或者是依靠社会未来的购买力来推销货物，都不能阻挡生产过剩的危机。这可由下列数字得到证明：
      美国工业生产量指数
      （一九三四—三五年等于一○○）一九五二年十二月——二三五一九五三年三月（最高数字）——二四三 一九五三年九月——二三四一九五三年十一月——二二八一九五三年十二月（我们的估计）——二二六
    因此，即使根据官方的统计，美国生产的下降亦达百分之七。
    马克思和列宁教导说，劳动群众生活状况的恶化，他们的低微的购买力，周期地、不可避免地限制了资本家无止境地扩大生产的企图，无产阶级化的群众的生活状况使生产过剩成为不可避免。
    研究一下美国官方的统计，我们就可以找到马克思列宁主义的这一原理的具体证明。那些主要是为供应劳动群众的消费而进行生产的工业部门，它们的生产的下降比生产的总衰退要早开始几个月。例如，棉织品和针织品的生产在一九五三年年初即已开始缩减。鞋子的产量在三月到七月这一期间内就已减少了百分之二十。
    各阶层居民购买力的不同发展对于美国汽车市场发生的影响特别来得明显。还在一年以前，为劳动群众所购买的旧汽车就已经感到剩余。为农民中的富裕阶层、中小资产阶级、职员和官吏们所购买的普通新汽车，在去年一年中，已开始感到销售困难；而为大资产阶级所购买的华贵汽车，直到现在还没有发生任何销售困难！
    列宁曾经指出，生产的最终目的总是为了生产消费品。生产资料的生产只是为了利用它来生产消费品。在一九五三年初就已经出现的消费品的生产过剩，不可避免地引起生产资料的生产过剩，引起它的生产下降。
    一九五三年最后两个月所发生的情况正是这样。作为制造生产工具主要材料的钢的生产，在十二月份比产量最高的一个月份（三月份）下降了百分之二十二。进行生产的熔铁炉的数目日见减少。一九五三年十二月中旬，在冶金工业中心——匹茨堡区，二十五个熔铁炉中，进行生产的只有十九个；十四个马丁炉中，进行生产的只有十一个。机器制造工厂的工人数目减少了。因此，目前的危机已按照“标准的”型式在发展着：仓库里堆满了商品，然后消费品生产下降，最后在生产资料方面的危机日趋严重。
    所有的材料都说明美国生产进一步下降的不可避免性（但是这并不是说没有个别月份生产增加的情况，例如一九五三年八月间就有过这种情况。危机期间的生产从来也不是一直下降的）。根据下列的具体事实就可以预见到这一点：
      （一）一九五三年十月底美国公司的未履行的订货数额，比一九五二年十月底减少了一百三十亿美元，即减少了百分之十八。十月份新的订货数额比一年前减少了二十亿美元。十一月和十二月份的情况比这还要坏。
    （二）钢产量的剧烈下降意味着生产资料的生产正在减缩。这也可以从美国报纸关于生产减缩和一些企业部门解雇工人的大量报道中得到证明。
    （三）在一九五三年十月间，新开始的住宅建筑比一九五二年十月减少了百分之十。
    （四）在十月底，私人企业主的存货几达八百亿美元。
    只有紧缩生产，降低价格和部分地损坏和毁灭商品，才能减少积压的存货。在资本主义制度下，只有这样，即通过危机，才能恢复生产和商品储存之间的正常关系。
    物价下降是危机的标志和危机加深的因素
    尽管生产过剩，美国的大垄断资本家在去年秋季以前还把他们的商品价格保持在高于一九五二年的水平上。但是非垄断性企业的商品价格则经历了严重的下跌。垄断资本一般商品价格一九五二年九月一九五三年九月增加的百分数钢（每吨以美元计）六六八一二三铝（每磅以分计）二○二一·五七·五铜（每磅以分计）二四·二二九·六二一汽油（每加仑以分计）一二·九一四·二一○硫酸（每吨以美元计）二○二二·三五一一
    新汽车的出厂价格并未降低，武器的价格当然也维持着很高的水平。在许多重工业的主要部门里，价格所以能够维持着这种很高的水平，自然是由于执行军备竞赛政策的缘故。
    但是垄断资本家所力图压低价格的商品却有着完全不同的另一种情况。自一九五二年九月以来，棉花的采购价格已下降了百分之十六，小麦——百分之九，牛肉——百分之二十，废钢——百分之二十四。
    顺便提一下，这些材料再一次证实了平均数字所提供的概念是多么贫乏：一九五二年九月份美国批发价格的总指数为一○七（以一九四八年为一○○），一九五三年九月份为一○六。看来似乎是毫无变化。但事实上，垄断资本家在这一期间内把自己的商品的价格提高了百分之二十，因此获得了巨大的超额利润。而农产品的批发价格却下降了百分之十到百分之二十，数十万农民因而破产。
    不过从一九五三年十月、十一月开始，大垄断资本家不得不承认生产过剩的事实，而把物价降低了。自十月份开始，钢铁垄断资本家就担负了他们的商品的铁路运费，这些费用以前是由买主支付的。某些特种高级钢的价格，每吨减少了二美元到十三美元。
      “通用电气公司”在十二月初将空气调节器的价格降低了百分之二十五。石油托辣斯已连续两三次降低汽油的价格。建筑业的大投机商已经把新建筑的一家所用住宅的价格从二万四千五百美元减少到二万二千五百美元，即使是这样，仍然没有买主。
    所有这些事实说明了国民经济的军事化并没有消除经济危机的不可避免性。相反的，倒是促成了一个新的、深刻的经济危机的发展，为危机的到来创造了条件。
    失业和贫困的增长
    报纸天天都在报道汽车、飞机制造、冶金和其他工业部门大批解雇工人的消息。
    去年十一月中旬，美国官方统计才第一次承认在过去的一个月内就业人数减少，失业人数增加了三十万人。十二月里，又承认失业人数增加了四十二万二千人。这样，问题就更加明显了，通常在十二月份，失业人数总是要减少的，因为百货公司、商店、缝衣店和其他店铺为了圣诞节和新年的营业，总要雇用临时性的工人、店员及其他人员。今年一月，失业人数增长的速度并未稍减。
    官方材料只承认有一百八十五万失业者。实际上失业人数比这要多好几倍。大家都知道，美国政府的统计对于即使每周只有一小时工作的和实际上是失业而保有“工作职位”的以及被允许在下月内获得工作的人，都不算作失业者。报纸上报道的被解雇的人数和官方公布的失业人数完全不符。其次还应该估计到：在美国，每年有七十万青年要求工作，但是即使根据官方的材料，就业的劳动者的数目也要比去年少。
    缩短工作时间的办法被广泛地采用着。产业工人的平均工作时间从一九五二年十二月份的每周四十一点七小时减少到一九五三年十二月份的每周三十九点九小时。此外还采取间歇制度和其他办法。因此，就业工人平均每周的工资在一九五三年三月到九月这一期间内，减少了二美元。
    同时，虽然批发价格下跌，但零售价格特别是食品的零售价格并未降低。
    可以得出结论说：完全失业的人数至少增加了一百万。在半年以内，就业人数每周的工资减少了二美元，最低生活费却增加了百分之二。即使根据这些数字，也足以证明：由于危机征象的发展，美国工人阶级已经感到生活水平进一步降低了。
    不言而喻，工人生活状况的变化，将使他们的购买力降低，首先将使他们对工业品的需求减少，而这正是使危机加深的因素。
          ☆☆☆
    在一九五三年十二月底，美国三百个主要的经济学家的会议，为事实所迫，终于不得不承认“衰退”时期已经开始。经济学家们宣称，一九五四年的国民收入将比一九五三年减少百分之五，工业生产总值将减少二百亿到二百五十亿美元，工业生产指数将减少百分之十到百分之十五。在三百个经济学家（其中有一百个是在政府机关中服务的）中，只有六个人认为在一九五四年生产将开始增加。绝大多数的经济学家们都不得不承认：甚至在一九五五年，生产也将不可避免地继续下降。
    在资本主义总危机日益加深的目前的错综复杂的情况下，当然是很难精确地刻画危机进一步发展的景象的。但是有一点是很明显的：美国的生产过剩危机正越来越在更大的规模上成为真正起作用的因素。
