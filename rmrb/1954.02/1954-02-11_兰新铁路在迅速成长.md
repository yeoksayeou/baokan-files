    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is Rapidly Growing
    Jiao Nian, Hong Liu
   “Beautiful, beautiful, truly beautiful,
    The red sun shines on the grassland,
    The cuckoo's feathers are like green jade;
    Wholeheartedly thanking Chairman Mao,
    He sent the road builders,
    He brought happiness!”
    This is the song of the people of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region in Gansu Province praising the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.

    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway starts from Lanzhou, with the first phase planned to reach Dihua (Ürümqi). In the future, it will extend westward to the border between China and the Soviet Union, with a total length of more than 2,800 kilometers. This is a long and arduous road! It must pass through the Wushaoling Mountain, which rises 3,000 meters above sea level, and the Turpan Basin, which is below sea level. It also has to cross the perilous Yellow River and the Hongshui River, which is about 7.5 kilometers wide, as well as uninhabited grasslands and hundreds of kilometers of waterless Gobi Desert...

    From the day construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway began on National Day in 1952, the road-building heroes, under the slogan of "racing against time," worked day and night. By the end of last November, they had completed the track-laying task of 190 kilometers ahead of schedule. Now, more than 30,000 laborers are fighting on the Wushaoling Mountain, where the climate is cold and the air is thin. This is the largest railway construction project in the history of the country, with a construction line of more than 60 kilometers. In the winding mountain gullies, the railway will pass through seven tunnels with a total length of five li, cross the Qinghe River five times, the Longgou River three times, and the Gulang River twice. It will also fill in the existing Gulang River to make a highway, convert the existing highway into a railway, and open up a new Gulang River from the mountains. If the earth and stone excavated from this 60-kilometer-long mainline subgrade were made into an earth dike one meter high and three meters wide, it could be built from Wushaoling to Beijing. Now, Wushaoling is covered with ice and snow, the climate is around minus 40 degrees Celsius, and the thickness of the frozen soil generally reaches 70 centimeters to more than one meter. The road-building heroes are still persevering in their work. Under the shining light of the general line for the transition period of the country, they have put forward the magnificent slogan: "Drill through Wushaoling, cross the Gobi Desert, build the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, and develop the great treasure house of the Northwest."

    The heroic road-building workers have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and wisdom in the arduous project of Wushaoling. When building the subgrade, in order to break the frozen soil layer and ensure the quality of the project, the workers changed the original one-shift system to a three-shift system, working day and night. In order to avoid soil freezing, they adopted the "soil loosening and covering method," the "center trenching and digging method," and the "trough pit soil extraction method" to ensure the quality of the project. The workers also launched a rationalization proposal movement. In the construction process of small-scale mechanized bulldozing for only one month, 185 rationalization proposals emerged. Zhang Songnian, a model worker from the Fifth Detachment, proposed a bulldozer train; Liang Boqin, a worker from the Twenty-fourth Detachment, created a high-架线 automatic unloading method; and the workers from the Twenty-third Detachment changed the switch of the sliding rail to a herringbone switch. The adoption of these methods increased work efficiency by one to two times. The workers of the earth and stone excavation team created and promoted advanced working methods such as "parallel bulldozing method," "lock-mouth soil extraction method," "double-knife soil delivery method," and "triangular cycle shoveling and filling method," which increased work efficiency by more than one time. Now, the average hourly filling efficiency of each machine has reached 48 cubic meters. By January 10, more than 50% of the total earth and stone works in the Wushaoling area had been completed. A total of eight large and medium-sized bridges and 41 small bridges and culverts have been started in the Wushaoling area. During winter construction, the workers learned the Soviet "soil heat storage method" and "thermos bottle method." When pouring bridge pier concrete, they built warm sheds and connected heating pipes to the warm sheds to bring the concrete to the specified temperature, and heated the sand in pots. When mixing concrete, calcium chloride was added in a certain proportion according to different temperature conditions to lower the freezing point and accelerate concrete coagulation. With these methods, the smooth progress of winter construction was ensured. By January 7, the main works of piers No. 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 and four bridge abutments of Qinghe Bridge No. 5 had been completed, accounting for about 70% of the total project.

    A large number of machines have been used for construction on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. At the east entrance of the Wushaoling Tunnel, dump trucks run on small steel rails, one after another transporting soil out of the tunnel, and transporting the necessary materials into the tunnel with flatbed cars. The double-track slide on the left hillside slides down the materials needed for the project from the hillside, and huge scraper-loaders are booming in the opening of the roadbed. On the dozens of vertical and horizontal motor vehicle roads opened on the tunnel construction site, self-unloading trucks have launched a competition for more hauling and faster running.

    On the construction site of the earth and stone excavation team, dozens of bulldozers are booming. Five or six bulldozers are arranged in a "one" shape and move forward side by side, and five or six blades are shining in the sunlight. Those bulldozer drivers sitting on the seats, facing the biting cold wind, fully open the motors, and five or six blades push up a long strip of five-foot-high loess, filling the depressions. Scraper-loaders shovel and transport high slopes one after another. Comrade Li Wenliang, a bulldozer driver who had just returned from Korea after laying the foundation for the "signing hall," participated in the construction project of opening up a new railway leading to the prosperity of the motherland. The first team of the second detachment he worked for, with a total of six bulldozers and three scraper-loaders, and 27 male and female drivers, completed the digging work of more than 3,000 people in one day in two days. Wang Shufen, a female bulldozer driver, has been studying driving for a year and is now as proficient as her teacher Hu Youmei. Guo Qingfu, a well-known bulldozer driver of the second detachment, created a new record of safe operation for 800 hours.

    The rapid growth of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has brought prosperity to the towns along the line. Daichagou, along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, was a remote mountain village before the opening of the railway. Now, it has become a distribution center for products along the railway line. More than 100 cars and horse-drawn carts gather at Daichagou Station every day. These cars and horse-drawn carts transport fur, medicinal materials, salt, and grain from the towns and villages along the line, and transport various industrial products and building materials from the station. More than a dozen shops, such as cloth shops and department stores, have been newly opened near the station. The newly built railway repair factory will also start production soon. Yongdeng County has recently opened three new brick and tile factories and a lime factory, and a large cement factory is also being planned nearby. The People's Government of the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region has built more than 100 beautiful houses with ethnic characteristics on the An Yuanyi Station line to welcome the passage of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway through here. An Yuanyi Town originally had only more than 20 shops, but now it has increased to more than 80, as well as nearly 100 vendors with tents and five sewing shops. Goods such as Jiangxi porcelain bowls, Shanghai wool yarn, and oranges, which could not be bought in the past, have also appeared on the market. According to statistics from the Autonomous Region Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the cooperative supplied only more than 140 kinds of goods in the first half of last year, but it increased to more than 220 kinds in the second half of the year. Sales of brick tea and cotton have increased a lot. More than 5,000 Jiangxi colored porcelain bowls have been sold in just a few months. These are just the beginning of prosperity, and greater prosperity will continue to spread to the border areas with the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway.

    兰新铁路在迅速成长
    交年  洪流
   “美丽呀美丽呀真美丽，
    红色的太阳照草地，
    布谷的羽毛像绿玉；
    一心感谢毛主席，
    修路人是他派来的，
    幸福是他带来的！”
    这是甘肃省天祝藏族自治区人民赞美兰新铁路的歌声。
    兰新铁路从兰州市起，第一步计划修到迪化，将来再向西修到中苏的边界上，全长有两千八百多公里。这是一条漫长而又艰险的路！它要穿过一座拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭，通过低于海平线的吐鲁番盆地，它还要横跨黄河天险和河面宽约七公里半的红水河，跨过百里无人的草滩和数百里无水源的戈壁滩……。
    从一九五二年国庆节开始修筑兰新路的那一天起，筑路英雄们在“和时间赛跑”的口号下，日夜赶修，到去年十一月底，已提前完成了一百九十公里的铺轨任务。现在，三万多人的劳动大军，正战斗在气候寒冷，空气稀薄的乌鞘岭上。这是全国建筑铁路有史以来最大的工程，施工线路长达六十多公里。在迂回曲折的山沟里，铁路要穿过七座共长五华里的隧道，要五跨青河、三跨龙沟河和两跨古浪河；还要把现有的古浪河填平作公路，把已有的公路改作铁路，另外再从山岭中开辟出一条新的古浪河来。如果把从这段长六十公里的正线路基里所挖出来的土石方，做成一公尺高、三公尺宽的土堤，就可以从乌鞘岭修到北京。现在，乌鞘岭遍地冰雪，气候在零下四十度左右，冻土厚度一般都达到七公寸到一公尺多，筑路英雄们仍坚持着工作，他们在国家过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下，提出了雄壮的口号：“凿穿乌鞘岭，跨过戈壁滩，修通兰新路，开发西北大宝库。”
    英勇的筑路工人们在乌鞘岭的艰巨工程中，发挥了高度的劳动热情和智慧。在修筑路基时，工人们为了打破冻土层，保证工程质量，他们把原来的一班制改为三班制，不分昼夜地施工。为了避免土壤冻结，他们采用了“土壤扒松覆盖法”、“中心拉沟挖土法”和“槽坑取土法”，保证了工程质量。工人们还开展了合理化建议运动，仅仅在小型机械化推土一个月的施工过程中，就出现了一百八十五件合理化建议。五联队劳动模范张松年提出推土机列车的建议；二十四联队工人梁伯琴创造了高架线自动卸土法；二十三联队的工人把滑坡轨道的十字道岔改为人字形道岔，采用了这些方法，使工作效率提高一倍到二倍。土石方工程队的工人们，创造和推行了“并排推土法”、“锁口取土法”、“双刀送土法”、“三角循环铲填土法”等先进工作方法，工作效率提高了一倍多。现在每台机器每小时平均填土工作效率已达到四十八立方。到一月十日，乌鞘岭地区的全部土石方工程已完成了百分之五十以上。乌鞘岭地区先后开工的桥涵工程共有大中桥涵八座，小桥涵四十一座。在冬季施工中，工人们学习了苏联“土壤蓄热法”和“暖瓶法”，在灌注桥墩混凝土时，搭起暖棚，把暖气管子通到暖棚中，使混凝土达到规定的温度，并把砂子放在锅里炒热。在搅拌混凝土时，根据不同气温条件按一定比例掺入氯化钙，降低冰点，加速混凝土凝固。用这些方法，保证了冬季施工顺利进行。到一月七日，青河五号桥已完成一、三、四、七、八号桥墩及四个桥台的主体工程，约占全部工程的百分之七十左右。
    在兰新铁路上已利用大批的机器在进行施工。在乌鞘岭隧道的东峒口，土斗车跑在小钢轨上，一辆跟着一辆从隧道中运出土来，又把必需的材料用平板车送进去。左面山坡上的双轨滑梯从山坡上溜下工程需要的料具，巨大的铲运机轰隆隆地在开辟路堑。在隧道的工地开辟出来的纵横数十条汽车道上，自动卸货汽车展开了多拉快跑的竞赛运动。
    在土石方工程队的工地上，几十部推土机轰隆隆地开动着。五、六部推土机摆成“一”字形并排前进，五、六块刀片在太阳光下闪闪发亮。那些坐在坐台上的推土机手们，迎着刺骨的寒风，开足马达，五、六块刀片推起一长条五尺高的黄土，填平了洼地。铲运机一部接一部地铲运高坡。刚从朝鲜驾驶推土机奠定了“签字大厅”地基回国的推土机手李文亮同志，又参加了开辟走向祖国繁荣的新铁路的建筑工程。他工作的二分队一小队共六部推土机和三部铲运机，二十七个男女驾驶员两天完成了三千多人一天的挖土工作量。女推土机手王淑芬学习了一年驾驶，现在已经和她的老师胡友梅开得一样熟练。二分队有名的推土机手郭庆福，创造了安全运转八百小时的新纪录。
    兰新铁路的迅速成长，给沿线城镇带来了繁荣。兰新铁路沿线的打柴沟，在通车前是一个冷僻的山村，现在已经成了铁路沿线物产的集散地。打柴沟车站上，每天集结着一百多辆汽车、马车。这些汽车和马车从沿线城乡运来皮毛、药材、食盐和粮食，又从车站上运回各种工业品和各种建筑器材。车站附近新开设了布店、百货店等十多家商店。新建的铁路修理工厂也将要开工生产。永登县最近新开了三家砖瓦厂和一家石灰厂，附近还在筹建一座大型水泥厂。天祝藏族自治区人民政府，为了迎接兰新铁路通过这里，在安远驿车站线上新建了一百多间具有民族形式的漂亮房子。安远驿镇原来只有二十多家商店，现在已增加到八十多家，还有近百个搭着帐篷的摊贩和五家缝衣店。过去买不到的江西瓷碗、上海毛线、橘子等货物，也在市场上出现了。据自治区供销合作社统计，去年上半年合作社供应的商品只有一百四十多种，下半年就增加到二百二十多种。砖茶和棉花的销售量增加很多。江西彩花瓷碗几个月来就销售了五千多个。这些，都只是繁荣的开始，更大的繁荣将随着兰新路的修建，继续的向边疆扩展。
