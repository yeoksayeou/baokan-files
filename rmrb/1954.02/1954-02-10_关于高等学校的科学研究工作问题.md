On Scientific Research Work in Institutions of Higher Education
Jian Bozan, Head of the History Department, Peking University

When the nation is engaged in planned economic construction, scientific research should be a task of paramount importance for teachers in all institutions of higher education. Because with the development of economic construction, the country will require cadres of a certain quality to meet the needs of industrial construction and other fields, and in order to effectively guarantee this need of the country, teachers in institutions of higher education must earnestly carry out scientific research work.

Without conducting scientific research, teachers in institutions of higher education cannot make further in-depth studies on the existing foundation of the science they teach, so as to gradually improve their professional level and thereby improve the quality of teaching; at the same time, they cannot further improve their political consciousness and thereby improve their theoretical level. If the professional and theoretical levels of teachers in institutions of higher education cannot continue to improve, they will fall behind the rapidly developing objective situation. Under such circumstances, it is unimaginable to expect institutions of higher education to train an increasing number of cadres of increasingly high quality according to the needs of the ever-changing construction undertakings.

In order to ensure the realization of the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government put forward the task of scientific research work at the National Comprehensive University Conference held last summer. After studying the general line, teachers in institutions of higher education have become more aware of the great significance of scientific research work for ensuring the realization of the ever-developing economic construction and the ensuing cultural construction. The question now is no longer whether to carry out scientific research work, but how to carry out scientific research work.

Based on the current situation, it should be said that there are basically conditions for launching scientific research work in institutions of higher education. Since liberation, teachers in institutions of higher education have experienced a series of great revolutionary movements, and have also undergone several years of ideological remolding and political study. Through these movements and studies, their political understanding has been greatly improved, which is the most important condition. Secondly, after the adjustment of departments and colleges, institutions of higher education have concentrated more or less manpower and equipment to varying degrees, eliminated the past phenomenon of scattered individual efforts, and initially established a collectivist teaching and research organization, which has created favorable conditions for scientific research in institutions of higher education. In addition, some schools have the guidance of Soviet experts, and the conditions are even more favorable. Nevertheless, there are still difficulties, and many kinds of difficulties. Due to different conditions, the difficulties felt by each school, even each department in the same school, and each teaching and research office in the same department are different, but the main difficulties may be common. Now I would like to raise a few major issues for discussion.

The first issue is the contradiction between teaching work and scientific research work. Teaching work and research work should not have contradictions, because teaching must go through research, and research work in schools must be combined with teaching. However, teaching work and research work also have differences, that is, teaching requires a comprehensive description, while research requires key in-depth study, from which contradictions arise. That is to say, in order to complete teaching tasks, teachers in institutions of higher education cannot spare time to conduct scientific research on every issue described in teaching, or even on important issues. It should be noted that if viewed from the perspective of classroom teaching time, the workload of teachers is not very large, but after the reform of teaching, the workload of a teacher cannot be calculated solely from the time spent in classroom teaching, but must include a series of working hours outside the classroom, such as the preparation, discussion, and modification of lecture notes, the preparation and guidance of classroom discussions and assignments, as well as the time spent on tutoring, quizzes, and examinations. Among these tasks, the most time-consuming is the writing of lecture notes and preparation, and some teachers spend almost all the time they can use on this work. Why does the writing of lecture notes take so much time? Because all the current lecture notes are created from scratch, and some of them do not even have Soviet outlines to refer to. Should the writing of lecture notes take so much time? I think it should, because at present, no course has textbooks or even necessary reference books, and lecture notes are the only basis for disseminating knowledge. Writing lecture notes takes time, and conducting scientific research work also takes time. Especially at present, certain scientific research, such as history, requires the systematic compilation of historical materials, which has not been carried out in the past, and there is no organization of archives in schools. A teacher who wants to study a historical issue must take care of the entire series of work from borrowing books from the library to completing the research work, and therefore needs more time. Both writing lecture notes and scientific research require time, but time is limited, from which the problem of insufficient time arises.

To solve this problem, organizing archives is one way, but the most important thing is to unify the two tasks of writing lecture notes and conducting scientific research, that is, to make scientific research closely related to the content of the lecture notes. Without hindering the principle of writing lecture notes, extract key issues from the lecture notes as topics for scientific research; in this way, scientific research will not only not affect the writing of lecture notes, but also help improve the content of the lecture notes. We have experimented with this method in the History Department of Peking University, and we plan to continue to experiment with it in the future. Naturally, this is only a preliminary form of scientific research. In the future development of scientific research, it can and should go beyond the scope of lecture notes.

Secondly, is the contradiction between administrative work and scientific research work. At the beginning of liberation, due to the recovery from various wastes, there were many urgent tasks that needed to be undertaken, so some teachers in institutions of higher education were arranged to work in administrative or other non-teaching and non-scientific research positions, which was completely necessary and reasonable. But today, when the country is engaged in planned economic construction, in order to enable everyone to give full play to their greatest effectiveness, it is necessary to make a more appropriate adjustment to the use of cadres. However, on the other hand, administrative work and other non-teaching and non-scientific research work also need cadres. As industry expands, the division of labor becomes more precise, and organizational structures increase, the number of cadres needed for administrative work and other non-teaching and non-scientific research work will not only not decrease, but will increase. Scientific research work and administrative work both need cadres, from which the contradiction of cadre use arises. Can this contradiction be unified without adjustment? That is, can one person do both administrative work and research work at the same time? I think this possibility is very small under current conditions. Because administrative work, including the administrative work of schools and the administrative work of research institutions, is different from scientific research work. Its main task is to organize and lead scientific research work, rather than directly engage in scientific research. Especially today, everything is developing rapidly, and new situations, problems, and difficulties can be encountered every day. An administrative worker must devote all his energy to his work. If he spends part of his time doing scientific research work, the result is likely to be nothing.

In order to strengthen scientific research work in institutions of higher education, I think it is necessary to make some appropriate personnel adjustments. The so-called appropriate personnel adjustment means that, without hindering the continued progress of administrative work, a part of the teachers engaged in administrative work should be returned to teaching and scientific research positions. If conditions do not permit this, we can also consider adding deputy positions so that teachers engaged in administrative work have part of their time to conduct scientific research work.

The third issue is the relationship between scientific research in institutions of higher education and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. According to the administrative system, institutions of higher education are led by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government, and therefore scientific research work in institutions of higher education is also arranged by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government. In the half year after the Comprehensive University Conference, the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government has conducted key experiments in some schools with relatively good conditions, attempting to make a breakthrough and gain experience, and then promote it to more schools. The Ministry of Higher Education has made great efforts in organizing and promoting scientific research work in institutions of higher education, but if we want to further develop this work, we hope that the Chinese Academy of Sciences will also regard this work as its own task. I remember that in a report shortly after the establishment of the Academy of Sciences, a leading comrade pointed out that the Chinese Academy of Sciences should become the headquarters for directing scientific research work throughout the country. This national scientific research work includes institutions of higher education. For several years, the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has been moving in this direction. Especially after the adjustment of departments and colleges in institutions of higher education, the relationship between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and various institutions of higher education should be closer. Here, I can cite the relationship between the Academy of Sciences and the History Department of Peking University. Zheng Zhenduo, Director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences, Xia Nai, Deputy Director, and experts such as Guo Baojun and Su Bingqi are all teaching archaeology in the History Department of Peking University, and Professor Shao Xunzheng of the History Department of Peking University is also conducting research work in the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Such cooperation is a good start. In order to further tighten the relationship between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and institutions of higher education in scientific research, we require the Chinese Academy of Sciences to play a greater organizational and leadership role. We hope that the Chinese Academy of Sciences will regard the teaching and research offices of various institutions of higher education as its own workstations, and the teaching and research offices of various institutions of higher education will regard the Chinese Academy of Sciences as its own headquarters. Only in this way can we organize the scientific research scattered in various institutions of higher education across the country according to a scientific system to form a national-scale scientific research network centered on the Academy of Sciences. Only by establishing such a research network can we enable the scientific research of various institutions of higher education across the country to carry out division of labor and cooperation on a larger scale, and to a greater extent, play the effect of division of labor and cooperation.

The fourth is to clearly put forward the requirements for scientific research and establish a scientific research system. Until now, scientific research work in institutions of higher education is still being carried out under the general call to conduct key experiments. It has not yet obtained enough experience from key experiments to turn the general call into concrete instructions. Therefore, the general teachers are not very clear about the requirements for scientific research, that is, what counts as scientific research. Also, because there is no established system, scientific research work in institutions of higher education is still a kind of work that can be done or not.

Regarding the requirements for scientific research, in general, everyone knows that the current scientific research resolutely opposes being divorced from reality and rote learning from books, and requires close integration with reality, serving the people, and serving the cause of building a socialist society; it requires research under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, many teachers in institutions of higher education dare not try easily, for fear of making mistakes and being criticized. I think it is right to take a cautious attitude towards scientific research, but if you stop moving forward because of this, it is not cautious but conservative. It is also right to require scientific research to be as correct as possible, but it is impossible to require a word to be worth a thousand gold, and a word to be worth nine tripods. In order to ensure the current needs of the country, we must bravely step onto the scientific research front with the weapons of criticism and self-criticism. I think the country will never put forward unrealistic requirements to teachers in institutions of higher education, but will require teachers in institutions of higher education to conduct scientific research with the existing theoretical level and the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and of course, we also hope that our scientific research will gradually reach the highest level in the world.

However, until now, scientific research work has not been included in the teaching work plan in many institutions of higher education, so that it occupies a certain proportion of time in the teaching work plan, which is one of the main reasons why scientific research work cannot be carried out well in institutions of higher education. In order to better carry out scientific research work, it is necessary to institutionalize scientific research, give it a certain position and time in the teaching work plan, and ensure that this time is not used for other purposes, so that teachers can be required to make specific research plans and ensure the realization of the plans, so that scientific research work in institutions of higher education is not a spare-time job that can be done or not, but a regular job that must be done. Now specialized courses are about to be opened, and in fact, teachers must be given time for research, otherwise specialized courses cannot be opened. I hope the leadership pays special attention to this point.

Finally, and most importantly, is the issue of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The achievements of scientific research in the Soviet Union have now reached the highest level in the world; but the Soviet Union also experienced a pioneering period of new scientific research at the beginning of the revolution, and they accumulated rich experience in carrying out scientific research in institutions of higher education. Therefore, we hope that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government can organize forces to translate the summary documents or works of the Soviet Union on carrying out scientific research in institutions of higher education, which will have great guiding significance for us.

    关于高等学校的科学研究工作问题
    北京大学历史系主任　翦伯赞
    当国家正在进行计划经济建设的时候，科学研究对于全国各高等学校的教师来说，应该是具有头等重要意义的任务。因为跟着经济建设事业的发展，国家将要求一定质量的干部以供应工业建设及其他方面的需要，而为了切实保证国家的这种需要，高等学校的教师就必须认真地进行科学研究工作。
    不进行科学研究工作，就无从使高等学校的教师对于自己讲授的那一门科学在现有的基础之上，作更进一步的深入的研究，以逐渐提高自己的业务水平，从而提高教学的质量；同时也无从使教师进一步提高政治觉悟，并从而提高理论水平。如果高等学校的教师的业务水平和理论水平不能继续提高，他们就会落在迅速发展的客观形势的后面，在这样情形之下而要求高等学校按照日新月异的建设事业的需要，培养出数量越来越大、质量越来越高的干部，那是不可想像的。
    为了保证党在过渡时期的总路线总任务的实现，中央人民政府高等教育部已在去年夏天召开的全国综合大学会议上提出了科学研究工作的任务。在学习了总路线以后，各高等学校的教师也更加明了了科学研究工作对于保证日益发展着的经济建设以及跟着而来的文化建设的实现具有重大的意义。现在的问题已经不是应否开展科学研究工作的问题，而是如何开展科学研究工作的问题。
    依据目前的情况，在高等学校展开科学研究工作，应该说在基本上是有条件的。解放以来，各高等学校的教师，都经历了一连串的伟大的革命运动，也经过了几年的思想改造和政治学习，通过这些运动和学习，政治认识已经大大提高，这是最主要的条件。其次，在院系调整以后，各高等学校都在不同的程度上集中了或多或少的人力和设备，消灭了过去分散的单干的现象，初步地建立了集体主义的教学和研究的组织，而这又替高等学校的科学研究创造了有利的条件。此外有些学校并有苏联专家的指导，条件就更要优越。虽然如此，困难还是有的，而且还是很多的，多种多样的。由于条件的不同，各个学校乃至同一学校的各系，同一系的各教研室所感到的困难都不相同，但主要的困难问题，可能是共同的。现在我想提出几个主要问题，加以讨论。
    第一个问题，是教学工作和科学研究工作之间的矛盾问题。教学工作和研究工作本来不应该有矛盾，因为教学必需经过研究，而在学校中的研究工作，是要结合教学进行的。但教学工作和研究工作也有不同之处，即教学要求全面叙述，而研究则要求重点深入，从这里就发生了矛盾。这就是说高等学校的教师为了完成教学任务，就分不出时间对教学中所叙述的每一个问题，甚至是重要的问题提出来进行科学研究。应该说明，如果从课堂讲授的时间来看，教师的工作量并不很多，但在教学改革以后，一个教师的工作量就不能单从课堂讲授的时间计算，而是要包括课堂讲授以外的一系列的工作时间，如讲稿的编写、讨论、修改、课堂讨论和作业的准备及指导，以及辅导、测验、考试等等所用的时间。在这些工作中，占时间最多的是编写讲稿和备课，有些教师几乎把可以利用的时间，都投在这个工作之中。编写讲稿为什么要这样多的时间呢？因为在目前所有的讲稿，都是从无到有，其中有些还没有苏联的提纲可以参考。编写讲稿是不是应该花费这样多的时间呢？我以为是应该的，因为在目前任何一种课程都没有教科书乃至必要的参考书，而讲稿却是传播知识的唯一根据。编写讲稿需要时间，进行科学研究工作也需要时间，特别在目前，某些科学研究，例如历史，由于史料编纂的工作过去没有有系统的进行，而现在学校中又没有资料室的组织，一个教师要研究一个历史问题，就必须把从图书馆借书，到完成研究工作为止的一系列工作一手包办，因而就需要更多的时间。编写讲稿和科学研究都需要时间，而时间却是有限的，从这里，就发生了时间不够的问题。
    要解决这个问题，组织资料室是办法之一，但最主要的是要把编写讲稿和进行科学研究两个工作统一起来，就是要使科学研究密切联系讲稿的内容，在不妨碍编写讲稿的原则之下，从讲稿中抽出带有关键性的问题，作为科学研究的题目；这样，科学研究就不但不影响讲稿的编写，而且可以帮助讲稿内容的提高。这种办法我们在北京大学历史系曾试验过，今后还准备继续试验。自然这对于科学研究工作来说，只是一种初级的形式，在科学研究的未来发展中，当然可以而且应该超出讲稿的范围。
    其次，是行政工作和科学研究工作之间的矛盾问题。解放之初，由于百废俱兴，有许多紧急的工作，需要有人担任，因而有些高等学校的教师被安排在行政工作或其他非教学和非科学研究工作的岗位上，这是完全必要的，合理的。但在今天国家正在进行计划经济建设的时候，为了使每一个人都能发挥他所能发挥的最大的效用，就有必要对于干部的使用作一次更适当的调整。可是在另一方面，行政工作及其他非教学和非科学研究工作也不是不需要干部，跟着工业日益扩大，工作分工日益精密，组织机构日益增多，行政工作及其他非教学和非科学研究工作需要的干部，不但不能减少，反而要求增加。科学研究工作和行政工作都需要干部，从这里就发生了干部使用的矛盾。这种矛盾可不可以在不调整的情况之下得到统一呢？即一个人是不是可以同时又做行政工作又做研究工作呢？我以为这种可能性在目前条件下是很少的。因为行政工作，包括学校的行政工作和研究机关的行政工作在内，和科学研究工作是有区别的，它的主要任务是组织和领导科学研究工作，而不是直接从事于科学研究。特别在今天，一切都在迅速发展中，每天都可以遇到新的情况、问题和困难，一个行政工作者必须以全力对待自己的工作，如果分出一部分时间来做科学研究工作，其结果很可能是一事无成。
    为了加强高等学校的科学研究工作，我以为进行一些适当的人事调整是必要的。所谓适当的人事调整，即在不妨碍行政工作的继续进行的原则下，使一部分从事行政工作的教师回到教学和科学研究的岗位。如果条件不许可这样做，也可以考虑添设副职，使从事行政工作的教师，有一部分时间进行科学研究工作。
    第三个问题是高等学校的科学研究和中国科学院的关系问题。依照行政系统，高等学校是中央高等教育部领导的，因而高等学校的科学研究工作，也是由中央高等教育部布置的。在综合大学会议以后的半年中，中央高等教育部曾经在某些比较有条件的学校进行重点试验，企图突破一点取得经验，然后向更多的学校推广。高等教育部对于高等学校的科学研究工作的组织和推进，作了很大的努力，但如果要更进一步开展这个工作，我们希望中国科学院也把这个工作当作自己的任务。我记得在科学院成立不久的一次报告中，一位领导同志曾经指出中国科学院应该成为指挥全国科学研究工作的司令部。这全国科学研究工作，是包括高等学校的在内的。几年以来，中国科学院的工作是朝着这个方向走的。特别在高等学校院系调整以后，中国科学院和各高等学校的关系更要密切一些。这里，我可以举出科学院和北京大学历史系的关系。科学院考古研究所郑振铎所长，夏鼐副所长，郭宝钧、苏秉琦等专家，都在北京大学历史系担任考古学方面的教学工作，北京大学历史系的邵循正教授也在中国科学院近代史研究所担任研究工作。像这样的合作，就是一个很好的开始。为了进一步紧密中国科学院和高等学校在科学研究方面的关系，就要求中国科学院发挥更大的组织作用和领导作用，我们希望中国科学院把各高等学校的教研室当作自己的工作站，而各高等学校的教研室也把中国科学院当作自己的司令部。只有这样才能把分散在全国各高等学校的科学研究，按照科学的系统组织起来形成一个以科学院为中心的全国规模的科学研究网，只有建立了这样的研究网，才能使全国各高等学校的科学研究在更大的规模上进行分工合作，在更大的程度上发挥分工合作的效果。
    第四是明确地提出科学研究的要求和建立科学研究制度问题。一直到现在，科学研究工作在高等学校，还是在一般号召之下进行重点试验，还没有从重点试验中取得足够的经验把一般号召变成具体的指示，因而一般教师对科学研究的要求，即怎样才算科学研究也不甚明了。又因没有建立制度，科学研究工作在高等学校还是一种可作可不作的工作。
    关于科学研究的要求，一般地说，大家都知道现在的科学研究是坚决地反对脱离实际，死啃书本，而要求密切结合实际，为人民服务，为建设社会主义社会的事业服务；要求在马克思列宁主义思想的指导下进行研究。因此有不少高等学校的教师就不敢轻于尝试，怕犯错误，受批评。我以为，对科学研究采取慎重的态度是应该的，但因此而裹足不前，那就不是慎重而是保守了。对科学研究要求尽可能地正确也是对的，但要求一字千金，一言九鼎，那是不可能的。为了保证国家当前的需要，我们必须带着批评和自我批评的武器勇敢地走上科学研究的战线，我想国家决不会对高等学校的教师提出超现实的要求，而是要求高等学校的教师用现有的理论水平和实事求是的精神进行科学研究，当然也希望我们的科学研究逐渐达到世界最高的水平。
    但一直到现在，科学研究工作在许多高等学校还没有被列入教学工作计划，使它在教学工作计划中占有一定比例的时间，这是科学研究工作在高等学校不能很好地开展的主要原因之一。为了更好地开展科学研究工作，必须使科学研究制度化，在教学工作计划中给它以一定的地位和时间，并保证这个时间不作别用，才能要求教师作出具体的研究计划，并保证计划的实现，才能使科学研究工作在高等学校不是可做可不做的业余的工作，而是必需要做的正规的工作。现在专门化的课程就要开设，事实上也必须给教师以研究的时间，否则专门化的课程是开不出来的。这一点，希望领导方面特别注意。
    最后而又是最重要的是学习苏联的先进经验问题。苏联的科学研究的成就，现在已经达到了世界最高的水准；但苏联在革命之初，也曾经经历过一个新的科学研究工作的开创时期，他们对开展高等学校的科学研究工作，蓄积了丰富的经验。因此，我们希望中国科学院和中央高等教育部能够组织力量，把苏联对于开展高等学校的科学研究工作的总结性的文件或著作翻译出来，这对于我们将具有重大的指导作用。
