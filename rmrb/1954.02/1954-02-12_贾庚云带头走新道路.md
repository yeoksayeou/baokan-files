    Jia Gengyun Takes the Lead on a New Road
    By Our Correspondent Liu Fan
    "Are you satisfied with your three rooms and two mu of land?" An old woman with a kind face, over fifty years old, was chatting lively with a group of farmers at the entrance of the village. She continued, half-jokingly, to a short farmer who was not yet thirty years old: "Have you seen the shadow play the other day (the film "Happy Life")? How do other people live? Don't you want that? A good man! Don't you look ahead? Do you want to be a hard-boiled egg, with no prospects for growth?" A group of people stayed at the entrance of the village, some puffing on their dry tobacco pipes, some squatting on the stone steps, just smiling and not saying a word. It seemed that this old woman was a respected elder in the village.

    This is Guo Village in Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, and that old woman is Jia Gengyun, a female Communist Party member in the village. When Jia Gengyun is mentioned, no one in the whole village, young or old, says "no". Jia Gengyun is good at labor and production, and everyone respects her. In this grain purchase movement, Aunt Jia used her own personal experience to repeatedly publicize the general line to the villagers, guiding the villagers to sell 50,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, and also made a plan to increase production and save, preparing to set up three agricultural production cooperatives.

    Even at the beginning of the propaganda of the general line, Jia Gengyun sold eight hundred jin of surplus grain to the state in one go. Then she held a family meeting with all the members of her family. The family meeting was very lively. Sixteen-year-old Erbao was studying in the village primary school and wanted to buy some good exercise books. The two little daughters wanted flower-printed cotton clothes. Aunt Jia thought: the children want everything they should buy, but the most important thing has not been mentioned, so she said to the children: "You are all members of the Youth League and Young Pioneers, what should be saved must be saved, only want this, want that, forgot that we still need to engage in production?" The children, who came from poor families, knew how life had become better, and they all felt that what their mother said was right. At the meeting, everyone quickly agreed: use the money from selling the surplus grain to buy seven waterwheel buckets, and buy some fertilizer and feed (soybean cake, distiller's grains), and buy oil, salt, cotton clothes and exercise books for the children to go to school with the rest.

    Jia Gengyun also went through some ideological struggles in the general line propaganda and grain purchase movement. One night, a meeting was held in the village to self-report surplus grain. At the meeting, some people said: "We are a cotton-producing area here, where does the surplus grain come from?" Jia Gengyun also casually said: "The grain I harvested this year, besides what I eat, is just a little wheat seed left." As soon as she said it, she felt that something was wrong. She wanted to change it immediately, but the meeting quickly dispersed, so she had to run home.

    When Jia Gengyun returned home, she didn't say a word and fell on the kang. The children saw that their mother was unhappy, thinking that their mother had argued (quarreled) with others, they did not disturb her, gently covered her with a quilt, and fell asleep beside her.

    Jia Gengyun tossed and turned on the kang and couldn't fall asleep. The past and present all rushed into her mind. She recalled that she had been a poor girl since she was a child. She married a husband who had no house to live in, so she had to build a shack on a graveyard and plant a few mu of sandy land that didn't grow grain. In the spring, it was all sand and soil, and it was hard to find even bitter vegetables. She had given birth to fourteen children, but she couldn't live, so she had to bear to leave her children alone and work as a wet nurse for the landlords in the city. Watching the landlord's children grow up one by one, her own seven children starved to death. Thinking of this, tears fell like rain from the eaves, big drops falling down.

    Now, she has twenty mu of land, and she has a waterwheel, and she has also bought a cow and a donkey. The government has given loans to dig two wells; later, the government repaired the Jin-Gao irrigation canal, and those sandy lands that did not grow grain became fertile fields. The year before last, cotton was planted, and at least 150 jin was harvested per mu; last year, more than 1,600 jin of millet and 2,700 jin of sweet potatoes were harvested, and life is getting better day by day... Some of the children have joined the work, and some have joined the production. They are all Communist Party members and Youth League members, and the three younger ones are studying in the village primary school, and they are also Young Pioneers. Thinking, thinking, she gently stroked the faces of the children beside her, feeling in her heart how happy life is!

    Jia Gengyun deeply knew that the good times now were brought about by the Communist Party, and that we should sell our surplus grain to the country completely, can we forget those who dug the well when we drink the water? She was very sad, feeling that she had told lies last night, and was sorry to Chairman Mao. The next day, as soon as she got up, she ran to the work team and sold 800 jin of surplus grain to the state. However, what is the relationship between selling surplus grain and supporting socialist industrialization? She couldn't connect it for a while.

    In these days, the propaganda of the general line in the village is in full swing. Rooftop radio broadcasts, Soviet collective farm picture exhibitions, and the film "Happy Life" are being shown; this day, she stood under the picture, looking intently at a picture of the Khrushchev collective farm: three young lads managed the "Stalin No. 80" tractor and towed a "five-share plow", and could cultivate 450 mu of land a day, nine inches deep, doing everything from plowing to harrowing; calculating how many animals and how many people it would take to do this in our village in a day; one hundred and fifty pairs of livestock and one hundred and fifty hoes (wooden plows), and one hundred and fifty people, and hoes can only plow three and a half inches deep, not counting harrowing; people and animals are tired all day long, where does the energy to sing come from! Jia Gengyun understood in her heart that people have the conditions to live a happy life, and people use iron oxen (tractors) to cultivate the land, but we don't have them here. We can't expect them to fall from the sky. The work team old Liu said: "Selling surplus grain to the country is to support industrial construction and support the people who make tractors; at the same time, we must also organize agricultural production cooperatives so that we can use tractors in the future...". This point is not bad, and her heart is bright.

    Jia Gengyun reported at the village mass meeting on the process of her ideological change of recognizing the general line and actively selling surplus grain. She said: If we grain growers do not sell grain to the state, workers, farmers in economic crop areas, and farmer brothers who lack grain to eat, the People's Liberation Army, and state staff, if they cannot eat, can they work for us with empty stomachs? Take the worker elders as an example, can they make tractors without eating? If tractors cannot go to the countryside, how can we get to socialism with only two hands and a yellow ox? In the end, isn't selling grain to the state all for ourselves? Besides, there are 248 households in our village, and now there are only seven or eight mutual aid groups, and no agricultural production cooperative. Three mu, two mu, ten mu, eight mu is a piece of land, and it is not enough for such a big guy like a tractor to turn around in the field. How can we use tractors if we don't organize cooperatives?

    In this way, Jia Gengyun educated the peasants to recognize the general line and led the peasants of the whole village to embark on the bright road indicated by the general line. In February last year, three agricultural production cooperatives were established in Guozhuang Village, and Jia Gengyun was the director of one of the agricultural production cooperatives.

    贾庚云带头走新道路
    本报记者　刘凡
    “你能满足你三间房子和二亩地吗？”一个有着一付慈祥面貌的五十多岁的老婆婆，站在庄头上，和一群庄稼人说得挺热闹。她继续半开玩笑地对着一个矮个子的年纪不到三十岁的农民说：“你看看前天那个影子戏（幸福的生活影片），人家是怎样过日子的，你不想吗？好汉子呀！不朝前看看，难道就愿做个煮熟了的鸡蛋，没有涨头了吗？”一群人呆在庄子口，有的吧?吧?地吸着旱烟，有的蹲在石堦上，光笑不吭声。看样子，这个大娘是庄上的一个有威望的长辈。
    这是河北藁城县郭庄村，那个大娘就是村里的女共产党员贾庚云。提起贾庚云，全庄老少没有一个人说个“不”字。贾庚云劳动、生产样样好，人人都尊敬她。在这次购粮运动中，贾大娘用自己的亲身体验，向村里人反复宣传总路线，引导村里农民把五万斤余粮卖给国家，还订了增产节约计划，准备办三个农业生产合作社。
    还在开始宣传总路线的时候，贾庚云就把八百斤余粮一次卖给国家。接着和全家大小开了一个家庭会议。家庭会议开得真热闹。十六岁的二保正在村小学读书，要买几本好的练习本子。两个小女儿要做花布棉衣。贾大娘想：孩子们要的样样都该买，可是最主要的事儿没有提出来，就对孩子们说：“你们都是青年团员、少先队员，该节省的要节省，净要这，要那，忘了还要闹生产吗？”穷家出身的孩子懂得日子是怎样好起来的，他们都觉得妈妈说得对，会上，大家的意见很快统一了：把卖余粮的钱买七个水车斗儿，再买一些肥料和饲料（豆饼、酒糠）剩下的再买油盐、棉衣和孩子上学的练习本子。
    贾庚云在总路线宣传和购粮运动中也曾经过一番思想斗争。一天晚上，村里开余粮自报会议，会上有的人说：“咱们这里是棉产区，那儿来的余粮呢？”贾庚云也随口说了一句：“俺今年打的粮除了吃的，就是留了点麦种子。”话刚出口，她自己觉得不对头，要想马上改一下，可是会很快就散了，她只得跑回家。
    贾庚云回到家，没有说一句话，就倒在炕上，儿女们看到妈妈闷闷不乐，以为妈妈和别人抬杠
  （争吵）了，他们没有吵扰她，轻轻地给她盖上了被子，就在她的身边睡着了。
    贾庚云在炕上翻来覆去不能睡着，前前后后事情一起涌进她的脑际，她回想起自己从小就是个穷丫头，嫁了个丈夫没有房子住，只好在一块坟地上搭起个窝棚，种几亩沙地，不长粮食；到了春天一片沙土，连苦菜也难找到；自己生了十四个孩子，没法活，忍心丢下自己的孩子不管，给城里的地主当奶妈。眼看着把地主的孩子一个个养大了，自己的七个孩子活活地饿死了。她想到这里，眼泪就像屋檐上的雨水，大颗大颗的淌下来。
    现在，她有二十亩地，又有了水车，还买了一头牛，一头驴，政府贷款打了两口井；随后政府又修理了晋藁灌溉渠，那些不长粮食的沙地变成了良田。前年种上棉花，顶少的每亩也收到一百五十斤；去年收了一千六百多斤谷子，两千七百斤山芋，日子一天一天好起来……孩子有的参加了工作，有的参加了生产，他们都是共产党员和青年团员，三个小的在村小学读书，也都是少先队员了。想着，想着，她轻轻地抚摸了身旁孩子的脸蛋，内心里感到日子是多么幸福啊！
    贾庚云深深知道，现在的好光景是共产党带来的，咱们把余粮卖给国家完全是应该的，吃水还能忘了掘井人吗？她很难过，觉得昨晚说了瞎话，是对不起毛主席。她第二天一起床就跑到工作组去，把八百斤余粮卖给国家。然而，卖余粮和支援社会主义工业化有什么关系？她一时还联系不起来。
    这几天，庄子里总路线的宣传是轰轰烈烈的。屋顶广播，苏联集体农庄的图片展览，“幸福的生活”影片放映；这天，她站在图片下面，正入神地看着赫鲁晓夫集体农庄的一幅图片：三个少壮小伙子掌管了“斯大林八十号”的拖拉机拖“五铧犁”，一天能耕四百五十亩地，深到九寸，连耕带耙什么活儿都做好；算算咱们庄上一天耕这么多的地就要一百五十头牲口，一百五十张耠子（木犁），还要一百五十个人，耠子耕地只能深到三寸五，耙地还不算；人和牲口样的一天到晚累得慌，那来的劲去唱歌儿呢！贾庚云心里明白了，原来人家过幸福生活有人家的条件，人家耕地尽是使的铁牛（拖拉机），咱们这里没有。也不能指望从天上掉下来呀。工作组老刘说：“把余粮卖给国家是支援工业建设，支援制造拖拉机的人们；同时还要组织农业生产合作社，以后才能使上拖拉机……。”这一点不差，她心上开朗了。
    贾庚云在村群众大会上报告了她认识总路线积极卖余粮的思想变化过程。她说：咱们种粮食的人不把粮食卖给国家，工人、经济作物区的农民和缺粮吃的农民兄弟、解放军、国家工作人员，他们吃不上，能饿着肚子为咱们工作吗？就拿工人老大哥说吧，他们不吃饭能造拖拉机吗？拖拉机下不了乡，咱们光凭两只手和一条黄牛怎能到社会主义呢？弄半天，把粮食卖给国家还不全为了咱们自己？再说，咱庄上有二百四十八户人家，现在仅有七八个互助组，没有一个农业生产合作社，三亩二亩，十亩八亩就是一块，拖拉机那么大的家伙在地里打转转也占不下。不组织合作社怎能使拖拉机呢？
    贾庚云就这样教育农民认识了总路线，带领全庄农民走上总路线所指示的光明大道。去年二月郭庄村成立了三个农业生产合作社，贾庚云就是其中一个农业生产合作社的社长。
