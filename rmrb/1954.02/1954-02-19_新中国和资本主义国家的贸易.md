    Trade Between New China and Capitalist Countries
    Lei Renmin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade
    New China has always been willing to restore and develop trade relations with all countries—including those in the capitalist world—and their governments and people, based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

    This desire has recently received new confirmation. After June 1953, China signed commercial agreements or trade contracts with the French industrial and commercial trade delegation, the British industrial and commercial trade delegation, the delegation of the Japanese "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade," and the economic delegation dispatched by the Indonesian government, all of whom came to Beijing.

    This means that China has further established trade relations with more countries in the capitalist world, and the trade volume and the variety of goods exchanged have increased.

    However, the development of trade between New China and capitalist countries has not been smooth sailing. In the past few years, it has followed a tortuous path. In 1949 and 1950, trade between China and various capitalist countries was once restored and developed. In 1950, the total trade volume between China and these countries exceeded that of 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War. The development of Sino-British trade was particularly significant.

    But in 1951, this trade declined. This was due to the U.S. imposing a "blockade" and "embargo" on China, and the governments of various countries that followed the U.S. government in implementing "blockade" and "embargo" measures, disregarding the interests of their own people, and obstructing and undermining normal trade with China.

    Taking Sino-Japanese trade as an example. Due to geographical proximity, China and Japan have always had close economic relations. In 1950, Sino-Japanese trade had a certain degree of recovery. Japan's needs, which have always been imported from China, such as cheap and high-quality ore, coking coal, industrial salt, and soybeans, have been supplied in large quantities. The commodities imported by China from Japan also accounted for a considerable proportion of China's total imports that year. However, since 1951, because the Yoshida government implemented the U.S. government's "blockade" and "embargo" measures, Sino-Japanese trade has almost stagnated. In 1951, the trade volume between the two countries was less than 1% of Japan's total foreign trade. Therefore, Japan was forced to import coal, iron ore, and soybeans from the United States at unreasonably high prices.

    This self-serving behavior of the U.S. government has brought serious difficulties in foreign trade to other countries in the capitalist world. Under the guise of "blockade" and "embargo," it is actually carrying out economic expansion into these countries, attempting to monopolize the market of the capitalist world. It uses "U.S. aid" to dump its surplus goods into other countries in the capitalist world, restricts imports with tariff barriers, and undermines the traditional multilateral trade relations between them. In particular, it has tried every means to obstruct them from ceasing normal trade relations with countries in the peaceful and democratic camp. As a result, the capitalist world market finds it more difficult to sell its own products, causing continuous contraction of production, increased unemployment, and deterioration of the national economy of capitalist countries. This situation has naturally aroused increasingly strong protests from many capitalist countries against the U.S. manipulation of international trade. As a result, some far-sighted politicians and business people have begun to realize the need to adopt independent trade policies and develop trade with all countries—regardless of social system.

    It was under these circumstances that China gradually resumed trade with many capitalist countries in 1952. In April 1952, during the Moscow International Economic Conference, the Chinese delegation and industrial and commercial representatives from eleven countries, including Britain, France, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland, signed trade agreements and contracts with a total value of more than 200 million U.S. dollars. Subsequently, the Japanese representatives attending the Moscow International Economic Conference signed a trade agreement with China in Beijing for a total import and export volume of 60 million pounds.

    Although these agreements and contracts failed to be fully implemented smoothly due to the obstruction and sabotage of the U.S. government and the governments of various countries that followed the U.S. government in implementing "blockade" and "embargo" measures, the signing of these trade agreements and contracts demonstrated the common desire of the Chinese government and people, as well as the people of various countries in the capitalist world, to develop normal trade relations.

    After the Moscow International Economic Conference, trade between China and capitalist countries made significant progress. In the second half of 1952, China signed triangular trade agreements with the Soviet Union and Finland. In June 1953, China signed a bilateral trade agreement with Finland, and the trade volume between the two countries increased by 23.5% compared to 1952. The scope of exchanged commodities has also been expanded, and the trade relations between the two countries have been further strengthened.

    During this period, China consolidated the trade relations already established with the Indian government and also established trade relations with the Pakistani government. In addition, China has established commercial relations with business circles in Myanmar, Indonesia, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, as well as Egypt, Chile, and other countries. Our country is still constantly committed to the development of foreign trade.

    China's trade with capitalist countries is carried out in accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit. This is reflected in all aspects: Because trade is conducted on a barter basis, it eliminates the payment difficulties of both parties, especially the unavoidable and serious payment difficulties encountered by capitalist countries in trading with the United States or with each other due to the "dollar shortage." The exchanged commodities are needed by both parties, rather than one party dumping goods on the other. The prices are fair and reasonable, rather than unequal exchange. Therefore, the conduct of such trade is conducive to the economic development of the participating countries and the improvement of people's living standards.

    Trade between China and Ceylon fully illustrates the principle of equality and mutual benefit in China's trade policy. Ceylon's economy is highly dependent on the world market. To supply food, it needs to import 400,000 tons of rice every year and export almost all of its rubber and tea to pay for it. After World War II, U.S. monopolists replaced Britain as the largest buyers of Ceylon rubber. They used this position to lower the price of Ceylon rubber from 73.5 U.S. cents per pound to 24.5 U.S. cents, bringing the Ceylon rubber industry to the brink of bankruptcy. The five-year trade agreement on rubber and rice signed between China and Ceylon at the end of 1952 changed this situation. Because of this agreement, it guaranteed that most of Ceylon's rubber could be sold at fair prices and ensured that 300,000 rubber workers would not lose their jobs. It helped Ceylon solve the serious difficulty of rice shortage. At the same time, China also obtained the rubber it needed.

    It is precisely because China adheres to the trade policy of equality and mutual benefit that more and more people in various capitalist countries have felt from their own experience that it is beneficial to trade with China. Therefore, the demands and calls for establishing and developing trade relations with China have become increasingly strong and high-pitched, and some countries have become mass movements with the participation of people from all walks of life.

    Facts have proven that the government and people of any country can benefit from equal and mutually beneficial trade with China. Moreover, today, China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's population, has begun planned economic construction, which has opened up broad prospects for China's foreign trade. Because, in the process of construction, China needs an increasing number of machinery equipment and raw materials, such as power machinery, mining machinery, transportation equipment, electrical equipment, scientific instruments, ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, etc. At the same time, due to the development of production, the significant increase in the purchasing power of the Chinese people, and the continuous improvement of their material and cultural life needs, it will increase their demand for imported daily necessities.

    Moreover, due to the rapid development of production, China's main industrial and agricultural products have far exceeded the highest historical level and have begun to produce new products. China can not only export more products that some countries traditionally need than in the past, but also export other products, such as meat, sacks, and some industrial products. Therefore, China's ability to pay for imports has increased even more. In fact, since 1950, while expanding its foreign trade volume, China has reversed the trade deficit of the past 70 years.

    China's ongoing socialist industrialization is one of the important factors in expanding foreign trade. If anyone holds the opposite view, it is obviously not understanding the facts. Premier Zhou Enlai made this issue very clear in his conversation with Professor Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the "Japan Peace Committee." He said: "Some Japanese believe that 'China's industrialization means that there is no future for Sino-Japanese trade.' It must be pointed out that this is completely wrong. Only when China is industrialized can it completely change the past imperialist and semi-colonial economic relations of 'industrial Japan, raw materials China.'... As China gradually realizes industrialization, the production and needs of the Chinese state and people will expand even more, and it will need to develop international trade relations even more."

    The huge possibility of China's foreign trade is further proved by the trade agreements signed in Beijing in 1953 with Finland, Ceylon, Britain, France, Japan, Indonesia, and other countries. For example, the appendix to the Sino-Japanese trade agreement stipulates that China will export various ores, coal, salt, soybeans, pig bristles, tung oil, ramie, tussah silk, carpets, and various medicinal materials, spices, and other goods to Japan, and will import various metals, machinery, chemical medicines, household electrical appliances, clocks, and other goods from Japan. This huge possibility is bound to increase with the gradual industrialization of China.

    China is an important member of the new democratic world market led by the Soviet Union. Trade between countries in the peaceful and democratic camp is constantly developing on the basis of complete equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance to seek common economic prosperity. The democratic world market guarantees that China will receive a continuous supply of the latest technology and necessary materials, and also guarantees the sales of China's increasing products. It also protects China from the impact of economic crises in the capitalist market.

    The U.S. "blockade" and "embargo" policy has made China more naturally and rapidly consolidate its ties with various countries in the democratic world market. In 1950, the proportion of China's trade with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries in China's total foreign trade was 26%. In 1951, it rose to 61%. In 1953, it had increased to more than 70%. This is the most reliable and solid foundation of China's foreign trade. With the continuous prosperity of the economies of the countries in the peaceful and democratic camp, trade relations between them will inevitably continue to develop.

    However, we believe that if artificial obstacles are removed, trade with capitalist countries will not be weakened as a result, and still has broad prospects. We not only want to develop trade with the democratic world market, but also are actively developing trade with capitalist countries. This fact can be fully illustrated by the facts mentioned above.

    Like the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, China believes that countries with different social and economic systems can coexist peacefully, exchange what they have for what they don't, and establish and develop normal trade relations. Facts have proven that the development of such trade relations plays a major role in close economic ties between countries, promoting the improvement of people's lives, helping the economic development of participating countries, solving various economic difficulties, increasing understanding between people of various countries, easing the current international tension, and striving for world peace. This is the basis for New China's consistent willingness to establish or further develop trade relations with the governments and people of capitalist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    新中国和资本主义国家的贸易
    中央对外贸易部副部长　雷任民
    新中国一向愿意遵循平等互利的原则与各国——包括资本主义世界里面各国的政府和人民——恢复与发展贸易关系。
    这一愿望近来又获得了新的证明，在一九五三年六月以后，中国和来到北京的法国工商业贸易代表团、英国工商业贸易代表团、日本“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团和印度尼西亚政府所派遣的经济代表团分别签订了商业协议或贸易合同。
    这就是说，中国进一步与资本主义世界中更多的国家建立了贸易关系，它们之间的贸易额和交换的商品品种都增多了。
    但是，新中国和资本主义国家间的贸易的发展并不是一帆风顺的。在过去几年中，它是走着曲折的道路的。一九四九和一九五○两年间，中国与资本主义世界各国间的贸易曾一度恢复和发展。一九五○年中国与这些国家的贸易总额超过了抗日战争以前的一九三六年。特别显著的是中英贸易的发展。
    但是在一九五一年，这种贸易下降了。这是由于美国对中国实行“封锁”“禁运”，和那些跟随着美国政府执行了“封锁”“禁运”措施的各国政府不顾本国人民的利益，阻挠和破坏对中国的正常贸易的缘故。
    现在举中日贸易为例。中日两国由于地理上的接近，一向有着密切的经济关系，一九五○年中日贸易曾有一定程度的恢复。日本所需要的一向由中国输入的价格便宜、品质优良的矿砂，焦煤、工业用盐和大豆等，都曾得到大量供应。而中国从日本输入的商品也占到该年中国输入总额的相当比重。但是从一九五一年起，因为吉田政府执行了美国政府的“封锁”“禁运”措施，中日贸易就几乎陷于停顿，一九五一年两国贸易额尚不及日本对外贸易总额的百分之一。因此，日本被迫以不合理的高价从美国输入它所需要的煤、铁矿石和大豆等。
    美国政府这种损人利己的行为给资本主义世界的其他各国带来了对外贸易上的严重的困难。在
  “封锁”“禁运”的掩护之下，实际上它是在向这些国家进行经济扩张，企图垄断资本主义世界的市场。它利用“美援”向资本主义世界中其他国家倾销其过剩商品，以关税壁垒限制进口，并且破坏他们之间的传统多角贸易关系。特别是，它又多方设法阻挠它们停止与和平民主阵营各国间的正常贸易关系。结果使得资本主义世界市场销售本身产品感到更为困难，造成生产的不断萎缩，失业人数的加多和资本主义的国家国民经济情况的恶化。这种情况自然引起了许多资本主义国家对美国操纵国际贸易的日益强烈的抗议，于是一些有远见的政界人士和工商界人士开始认识到有采取独立贸易政策以及与所有国家——不分社会制度——发展贸易的必要。
    就在这种情况下，中国在一九五二年又逐渐恢复与很多资本主义国家之间的贸易。在一九五二年四月，莫斯科国际经济会议期间，中国代表团和英、法、西德、比、意、瑞士等十一国的工商业代表分别签订了总额达二亿余美元的贸易协议和合同。随后，参加莫斯科国际经济会议的日本代表在北京和中国签订了进出口总额六千万英镑的贸易协议。
      尽管这些协议和合同，由于美国政府和跟随着美国政府执行了“封锁”“禁运”措施的各国政府的阻挠与破坏，未能顺利地全部实现，但这些贸易协议和合同的签订表现了中国政府和人民以及资本主义世界中的各国人民对发展正常贸易关系的共同愿望。
    莫斯科国际经济会议之后，中国与资本主义国家之间的贸易有了显著的进展。一九五二年下半年，中国和苏联、芬兰签订了三角贸易协定。一九五三年六月中国与芬兰签订了双边贸易协定，两国间贸易额比一九五二年增加了百分之二十三点五。交换商品范围也更扩大了，两国之间的贸易关系更进一步密切了。
    在这个时期中，中国巩固了与印度政府之间早已建立了的贸易关系。并和巴基斯坦政府也建立了贸易关系。此外，中国和缅甸、印尼、瑞典、瑞士、英、法、西德、意大利、比利时以及埃及、智利等国的工商界建立了通商关系。我国仍在不断的致力于对外贸易的发展。
    中国与资本主义国家的贸易都是按照平等互利的原则进行的。这表现在各方面：由于贸易是按以货易货的方式来进行，就免除了双方的支付困难，特别是资本主义各国在和美国或他们之间进行贸易时所遭遇的因“美元短少”所引起的不可免的和严重的支付困难。交换的商品都是为双方所需要的，而不是一方面向另一方倾销商品。价格是公平合理的，而非不等价交换。因此，这种贸易的进行就有助于参与贸易国家经济的发展和人民生活状况的改善。
    中国与锡兰的贸易充分地说明了中国贸易政策的平等互利原则。锡兰的经济对世界市场有很大的依赖性，为了供给民食，它每年需要输入四十万吨大米，并输出几乎全部橡胶和茶来偿付。第二次世界大战后，美国垄断资本家代替英国成为锡兰橡胶的最大买主，他们利用这种地位把锡兰橡胶价格从每磅七角三分五美金压低到二角四分五美金，使锡兰橡胶业濒于破产。一九五二年底，中国与锡兰所签订的关于橡胶与大米的五年贸易协定，改变了这种情况。由于这项协定，保证了锡兰大部橡胶可以按公平价格出售，保证了三十万橡胶工人免于失业。帮助锡兰解决了大米缺乏的严重困难，同时，中国也得到了自己所需要的橡胶。
    正是因为中国坚持了平等互利的贸易政策，资本主义世界各国中日益增多的人从切身体验中感到，跟中国进行贸易是有利的，所以与中国建立和发展贸易关系的要求与呼声，日益强烈和高涨，有些国家已成为有各阶层人民参加的群众性的运动。
    事实业已证明，任何国家的政府和人民与中国进行平等互利的贸易，都会得到好处。而且，今天占世界将近四分之一人口的中国已经开始了有计划的经济建设，这又为中国对外贸易开展了广阔的前途。因为，在建设过程中，中国需要日益增多的机器装备和原料，如动力机器、采矿机器、交通器材、电工器材、科学仪器、黑色金属、有色金属、化工原料等。同时，由于生产发展，中国人民购买力的显著提高，和他们物质和文化生活需要的不断提高，将增加他们对于进口日用必需品的要求。
    而且，由于生产迅速发展，中国主要工农业产品已远超过了历史上最高水平，并且开始生产新产品。中国不但能够较过去输出更多为一些国家传统需要的产品，而且还能输出其他的产品，如肉食、麻袋和若干种工业产品等。所以中国偿付进口的能力更为增长了。实际上，从一九五○年起，中国在扩大对外贸易额的同时，扭转了过去七十多年来的贸易逆差。
    中国正在进行着的社会主义工业化是扩大对外贸易的重要因素之一。如果有人持相反的看法，那显然是不了解事实的。周恩来总理在和“日本拥护和平委员会”主席大山郁夫教授的谈话中，就把这一问题说得十分明白，他说：“有些日本人认为：‘中国工业化了，中日贸易就没有前途。’必须指出，这是完全不对的。只有中国工业化，才能彻底改变过去那种‘工业日本、原料中国’的帝国主义和半殖民地的经济关系。……中国逐步实现工业化，中国国家和人民的生产和需要就会愈加扩大，它就愈加需要发展国际间的贸易关系。”
    中国对外贸易的巨大可能性更由一九五三年在北京与芬兰、锡兰、英、法、日本、印尼等国签订的贸易协议所证明。如中日贸易协议附件中规定，中国将向日本输出各种矿砂、煤、盐、大豆、猪鬃、桐油、苎麻、柞蚕丝、地毯和各种药材、香料等，并将从日本输入各种金属、机器、化学药品、家庭用电气器具、钟表等货物。这个巨大的可能性必然随着中国逐步的工业化而增加。
    中国是以苏联为首的新的民主世界市场的重要成员。和平民主阵营内各国间的贸易在完全平等互利和互助合作以求得共同经济高涨的基础上不断地发展着。民主世界市场保证中国源源不绝地得到最新的技术装备及必需物资的供应，也保证中国不断增加的产品的销售。它并使中国免受资本主义市场经济危机的影响。
    美国的“封锁”、“禁运”政策使中国更加自然地和更加迅速地和民主世界市场各国巩固地结合起来。一九五○年中国对苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，在中国对外贸易总额中所占比重为百分之二六，一九五一年，就上升到百分之六一，一九五三年则已增加到百分之七十以上了。这是中国对外贸易最可靠和最巩固的基础。随着和平民主阵营各国经济的不断高涨，彼此间的贸易关系也必将不断发展。
    但是，我们认为如果铲除了人为的障碍的话，对资本主义国家的贸易不但不会因此而削弱，依然有着广阔的前途，我们不只是要发展对民主世界市场的贸易，而且还是在积极地发展与资本主义国家间的贸易，这个事实，从上述一些事实中，可以得到充分的说明。
    正如苏联和人民民主国家一样，中国相信有着不同社会和经济制度的国家是能够和平共处，互通有无，建立和发展正常贸易关系的。事实证明这种贸易关系的发展，对密切各国间的经济联系、促进人民生活的改善、帮助参加贸易各国经济发展、解决各种经济困难，增加各国人民之间的谅解，缓和目前国际紧张局势和争取世界和平是起着重大作用的。这就是新中国始终愿意在平等互利的基础上，与资本主义世界各国政府和人民建立或进一步发展贸易关系的依据。
