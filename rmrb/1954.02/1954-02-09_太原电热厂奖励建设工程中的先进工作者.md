The newly built Taiyuan Power and Heating Plant held a reward conference on January 12th, solemnly awarding 287 advanced workers who had made outstanding achievements in the construction project.

Since the start of construction of the new Taiyuan Power and Heating Plant, a large number of model figures have emerged. During winter construction, they put forward the fighting slogan of "Overcoming Difficulties and Seizing Time," braving the severe cold of minus 15 degrees Celsius, working hard day and night, and trying every means to complete the plan.  Truck driver Zhao Hailong led everyone in launching the "Three Quicks and One Full" competition of "Load Full, Load Fast, Run Fast, and Unload Fast," enabling each truck to load two and a half tons of soil, and greatly shortening loading and unloading times, playing a pioneering role in completing the massive earthwork project ahead of schedule. In order to maintain the temperature of the concrete and strengthen its intensity, the slurry pushing team tried to shorten the handling time, increasing from 56 pushes per day to 150 to 180 pushes.  The Pan Shutang boiler team at the repair site was responsible for the heating project of the main plant building. They not only completed the additional tasks on schedule, but also improved the warm grid return pipe. When oxygen worker Li Guizhen accepted the welding task, he used old iron sheets to weld his own flashlight, solving a big problem. Originally, the concrete mixer discharged water slowly, affecting the increase in the amount of mixing. After the workers thickened the water faucet and modified the wooden box, the efficiency of mixing concrete was more than doubled.  In order to ensure the quality of the project, the workers took the initiative to propose implementing a quality labeling system. When concrete worker Guo Jinsheng found a few pieces of broken wood in the foundation trench, he ignored the north wind in the dead of winter, took off his clothes, and crawled into the foundation trench to pick out the broken wood. His heroic behavior was praised by Soviet experts. Technician Lu Bang'an cooperated with the Railway Bureau to build a temporary railway, finding ways to save 400 million yuan in construction funds. The cooks studied the general line and felt that their work was very glorious. They took the initiative to deliver meals to the workers at night to ensure that the workers could eat their fill and stay warm. Many cooks have become advanced workers.

    太原电热厂奖励建设工程中的先进工作者
    新建太原电热厂于一月十二日召开奖励大会，对建设工程中成绩卓著的二百八十七名先进工作者，隆重授奖。
    新建太原电热厂开工以来，涌现出大批模范人物。在冬季施工中，他们提出了“克服困难，争取时间”的战斗口号，冒着零下十五度的严寒，昼夜不停地进行着艰苦劳动，想尽一切办法完成计划。汽车司机赵海龙，带动大家开展了“装满、装快、跑快、卸快”的“三快一满”竞赛，使每辆卡车装土两吨半，并大大缩短了装卸时间，在提前完成浩大的土方工程中起了先锋作用。推浆组为了保持混凝土的温度，加强混凝土强度，想法缩短搬运时间，由每天推五十六次，提高到一百五十次至一百八十次。修配工地潘书堂锅炉小组担任主厂房暖气工程，他们不仅按期完成了追加任务，还改进了暖栅回水管；氧气工李贵臻接受电焊任务时，用旧铁皮自焊电筒，解决了很大问题。原来混凝土搅拌机出水慢，影响搅拌量的增加，经过工人把水笼头加粗，并改装了木盒，使搅拌混凝土的效率提高了一倍多。为了保证工程质量，工人主动提出执行质量挂牌制。混凝土工人郭金生当发现基槽内有几块碎木片时，不顾数九天的北风，脱下衣服，钻进基槽内把碎木片拣出来。他的英雄行为受到了苏联专家的赞扬。技术员陆邦安配合铁路局修建临时铁路，想办法节省了四亿元的建设资金。炊事员们学习了总路线，感到自己的工作十分光荣，在夜间主动的给工人们送饭，保证工人们能吃饱吃暖。许多炊事员已成了先进工作者。
