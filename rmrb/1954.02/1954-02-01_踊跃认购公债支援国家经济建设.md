Learn from our Soviet worker brothers

Last December 10th, Wang Wenshan, a model worker from Shenyang, was walking home from work, thinking about the news of the issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds in the newspaper.

After dinner, Wang Wenshan started talking to his wife, Li Guixin, about the issuance of the bonds. He said: "To build a socialist society, many Soviet workers complete several years' worth of tasks in one year. Soviet workers not only build socialist society with their own two hands, but also save expenses and buy bonds to accumulate funds for the country."

The children were asleep, and Wang Wenshan and Li Guixin were still calculating how to subscribe to the bonds. They currently have several sets of woolen clothes, bicycles, and blankets made of floral flannel... They don't need to buy any more clothes or bedding for the time being. With their past savings, they can save another 2 million yuan per month, making it no problem to buy 10 million yuan in bonds.

At the sixth session of the third Shenyang Municipal People's Representatives Conference, Wang Wenshan announced the amount of bonds he would subscribe to.

Planning for Long-Term Interests

Liu Guangjin, a model worker in North China and director of the boiler workshop at the Shijingshan Power Plant, played a leading role in promoting the Soviet advanced experience of burning low-value coal in the plant, enabling this advanced experience to be rapidly promoted throughout the plant. Over the past year, he has saved the country 300,000 tons of good coal, which has played a certain role in accelerating the country's socialist industrialization. As a result, he was awarded the title of model worker, and the state also rewarded him. To facilitate national industrial investment, Liu Guangjin deposited some of his bonus in the bank.

When subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, Liu Guangjin carefully calculated his income and expenses and, based on his actual ability, withdrew 5 million yuan from the bank to buy bonds. He said, "Buying bonds is accumulating funds for the country, so that the country can use this money to develop heavy industry."

I Had Planned It Long Ago

Zhang Zhonglan, a worker from the Feng Rugang group in the repair workshop of the Qixin Cement Factory, was hospitalized in a Tianjin hospital for treatment. When he saw the hospital staff enthusiastically subscribing to the bonds, he wanted to buy bonds with the 2 million yuan he had saved at home. However, he was afraid that he would be forgotten when the factory subscribed to the bonds because he was not at home; he was also afraid that his wife might disagree and not want to take out the money. So, he quickly wrote a letter to his group, instructing the workers in the group to discuss with his wife and buy bonds with the money.

After getting off work, group leader Feng Rugang went to Zhang Zhonglan's house. After explaining his intentions, he took out the letter and read it to Zhonglan's wife. Before he finished reading, Zhonglan's wife busily said: "I thought it was something else, it turned out to be mobilizing me to buy bonds. Who wouldn't want to buy bonds, accelerating national industrialization is eternal happiness. Don't worry, I had already planned to buy all 2 million yuan, and I was afraid that he wouldn't agree. I was just about to write to him to discuss it, but I didn't expect that I was behind."

Eighty-Two Silver Dollars

Liu Bingde, a retired old worker from the Chengzi Coal Mine, has been working in the coal mine since he was eighteen and is now sixty-five years old. Before the "July 7th" Incident, he saved money sparingly to "prepare for old age." After many years, he saved 527 bills and 82 silver dollars. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang came, and the bills he had saved for eight years became worthless after buying very little! Liu Bingde kept the 82 silver dollars to "prepare for old age."

After liberation, the state protected elderly workers, and Liu Bingde's life was guaranteed. On October 9th last year, Liu Bingde was asked to retire. He said: "Even if I don't work, the state still pays my salary. The house I live in, the water and electricity I use, are still supplied by the state. In the past, I prepared for old age all my life, and ended up with nothing. This time, with my own country, I can eat and drink without worry in my old age." So, when he heard that the state was issuing economic construction bonds, he said: "Only with a country can there be a home. If the country is built well, we will have everything." He bought economic construction bonds with the 82 silver dollars he had saved for half his life.

To Sit on a Boat and Catch Fish Sooner

The twelve fishing households in the Xiaopingdao Qianjin Fisheries Mutual Aid Group in the suburbs of Lushun City have seen their lives improve a lot in recent years. Last year, the people's government helped them strengthen their mutual aid organization and improve their fishing techniques. They caught more than 150,000 catties of fish throughout the year, an increase of more than 10,000 catties over the original plan. In 1953, each household received an average of over 12 million yuan.

Recently, after studying the general line of the state during the transition period, everyone wanted to further develop fisheries. They said that if the country's industry is developed, we won't have to just wander around the coast. We can also take large motorboats to fish in the deep sea. Therefore, when they heard that the government was issuing national economic construction bonds, the group members tried their best to save money and buy more bonds to support the country's industrial construction. At a mutual aid group meeting, nine households subscribed to 9.5 million yuan in bonds. Now, everyone is working hard to carry out winter fishing, regardless of the cold weather, and strive to double this year's fish production compared to last year.

Buy Less Dowry

Guan Qiuxian, a young female worker from the No. 4 Workshop of the No. 601 Factory in Xi'an, is getting married soon. Her mother specially came to Xi'an from the countryside, seventy miles away, and said to Qiuxian: "We joined the mutual aid group, and the harvest was very good last year. I have prepared 400,000 yuan for you. What do you want to buy?" Qiuxian thought: Now the country is calling on people all over the country to take out their surplus money to subscribe to bonds according to their own situation. Buying bottles and mirrors with this money is useless. Buying some clothes cannot be worn so much. Besides, with the development of industry day by day, the colors and styles will not be popular in a few years. If you buy economic construction bonds, it will benefit both the country and individuals, and it will not be too late to buy things when you need them in the future. She explained to her mother that she only needed a box and a set of teapots and teacups now, and it would be better to buy bonds with the remaining money. She would not only save a sum of money, but also contribute to the country. After her patient persuasion, her mother finally agreed.

At the group meeting, she happily proposed to subscribe to 3 million yuan of economic construction bonds.

Husband and Wife Calculate Household Accounts

Yang Zhensheng and Guo Ting are both workers in the woolen factory of the private Dongya Enterprise Company in Tianjin. Yang Zhensheng is an inspection worker, and Guo Ting has also been working in the coarse spinning workshop for many years. Both of them are production experts, and Guo Ting was honorably admitted to the Communist Party of China last year. Every day, they go to work and get off work together, and study together in the evening school. They live a very good life, and they had a fat baby last year.

When subscribing to economic construction bonds, they wanted to use their labor and their savings to invest in the country's economic construction, and to build a better life for themselves and their children. They took out the bank deposit book and carefully calculated the current family income and expenditure. In addition to all the family expenses, the two still had a surplus of 4 million yuan. Therefore, the couple decided to buy 4 million yuan in bonds.

Make Up a Round Number

In the evening, the old worker Zhang Xinglin and his wife from the Municipal Construction Engineering Company of the Shenyang Municipal Construction Bureau sat on the heated kang, listening to the broadcast of employees subscribing to bonds on the radio while eating. Zhang's wife said to Zhang Xinglin: "Did you hear that, how energetic everyone is! Let's calculate how much to buy!" Zhang Xinglin waved his hand and didn't let her speak. After the broadcast was over, he smiled and said: "Let's calculate it. Apart from what the two of us eat and use, buying 6 million yuan in bonds will be no problem." When Zhang's wife heard this, she said: "That won't work, there's still money for making clothes..." Zhang Xinglin thought she couldn't see the light and said angrily: "Why don't you think about it, it's enough to have so many clothes to wear!" When Zhang's wife heard Zhang Xinglin's words, she hurriedly took out her sewing basket, opened the small cloth bag layer by layer, and took out a pile of new bills, counting exactly 3 million yuan. Zhang's wife handed the money to Zhang Xinglin and complained: "You didn't even listen to what people said, I was saying that these old savings are useless..." Zhang Xinglin was happy when he heard this. He also took out the 1 million yuan he had saved, adding up to exactly 10 million yuan. Zhang's wife repeatedly urged Zhang Xinglin: "Don't forget, tomorrow, you should tell the trade union early in the morning that we want to subscribe to 10 million yuan!"

### 踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设

    踊跃认购公债支援国家经济建设
    向苏联工人兄弟学习
    去年十二月十日，沈阳市劳动模范王文山在下班回家的道上，一边走一边想着报纸上发表的发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的消息。
    到家吃过晚饭，王文山就向他妻子李桂馨讲开了发行公债的事。他说：苏联工人为了建设社会主义社会，有许多人一年完成几年的任务。苏联工人不光用自己两只手建设社会主义社会，还节省开支，购买公债给国家积累资金。
    孩子们都睡了，王文山和李桂馨还在核计怎样认购公债。现在呢子衣服有好几套，有自行车、花达呢的被褥，……暂时不用添置什么穿、盖的，加上过去的积蓄，每月可再节省二十多万元，购买一百万元公债不成问题。
    在沈阳市第三届第六次各界人民代表会议上，王文山报出了自己认购公债的数字。
    为长远利益打算
    华北区劳动模范、石景山发电厂锅炉场主任刘光金，在该厂推广苏联先进经验——燃烧低值煤时，起了带头推动作用，使这个先进经验能较快地在全厂推广。一年多以来，给国家节省了三十万吨好煤，对加速国家社会主义工业化起了一定作用。因此他获得了劳动模范的称号，国家还对他进行了奖励，刘光金为了便于国家工业投资，他把一部分奖金存进了银行。
    这次认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债时，刘光金细算了自己的收支情况，根据自己的实际能力，将存在银行里的款子提出五百万元买了公债。他说：“咱们买了公债就是给国家积累资金，叫国家用这笔钱去发展重工业。”
    我早就打算好了
    启新洋灰工厂修理车间冯汝光小组工人张仲兰，因为有病住在天津某医院疗养。当他看到医院里的职工踊跃认购公债时，他就想把家里存着的二百万元买了公债。可是他怕自己不在家，厂里认购公债时把他忘了；又怕万一爱人不同意，不愿拿出钱来。于是，他连忙给小组写了一封信，嘱托组里的工人跟他爱人去商量，把这笔钱买公债。
    组长冯汝光下了班就到张仲兰家去了，在说明了来意后，拿出信来念给仲兰的爱人听。没等念完，仲兰的爱人忙说：“我当是啥事呢，原来是动员我买公债。说起买公债谁不愿意，加速国家工业化是永远的幸福呵。放心吧，我早就打算把二百万元全买了，还怕他不同意呢，正想写信和他商量，没想到我倒走在后头啦。”
    八十二块银元
    城子煤矿退休养老的老工人刘秉德，从十八岁就在煤矿做工，今年六十五岁了。他在“七七”事变以前，就省吃俭用地攒钱“防老”。过了好多年，才攒了五百二十七块票子，八十二元银元。日本投降了，国民党来了，攒了八年的票子没买什么就全“毛”啦！留下了八十二元银元，刘秉德还留着“防老”。
    解放后，国家保护老年工人，刘秉德的生活有了保障。去年十月九日，又叫刘秉德退休养老。他说：“不上班，国家还是发工资，住的房子，用的水、电，照旧都是国家供给。早先我防了一辈子老，只落得两手空空，这回有了自己的国家，才能够在这老年的时候，吃喝不愁。”所以当他听到国家发行经济建设公债时，就说：“有了国才有家，把国家建设好了，就什么都有了。”他把攒了半辈子的八十二块银元买了经济建设公债。
  为了早日坐上轮船去捕鱼旅大市郊小平岛前进鱼业互助组的十二户渔民，这几年的生活比过去提高了很多。去年人民政府帮助他们加强了互助组织，改进了捕鱼技术，全年捕了十五万多斤鱼，比原计划增产一万多斤。一九五三年平均每户分到一千二百多万元。
    最近，他们学习了国家过渡时期的总路线以后，大家都想进一步发展渔业。他们说，国家工业发达了，我们就不用只在海边转了，也可以坐大汽艇到远海捕鱼去。所以，当他们听到政府发行国家经济建设公债以后，组员们都尽量节约，多买公债，支援国家工业建设。在一次互助组的座谈会上，有九户认购了九十五万元公债。现在，大家都不顾天寒水冷，展开了冬季捕鱼运动，争取今年的鱼产量比去年增加一倍。
    少买些嫁妆
    西安市六○一厂四车间青年女工关秋贤，最近就要结婚了。她的妈妈特意从七十里外的乡下赶到西安市来，对秋贤说：“我们参加了互助组，去年收成可好啦，给你预备了四十万元，你看都买些啥好？”秋贤想：现在国家正号召全国人民，根据自己的情况，拿出余钱来认购公债，把这些钱买成瓶子、镜子的没啥用处，买成一些衣服又穿不了那么多，再说工业一天一天的发展，过几年花色、样色又不时兴了。如果买成经济建设公债，对国家对个人都有好处，将来需用东西时再买也不晚。她就向她妈妈解释：她现在只要一只箱子和一套茶壶茶碗，剩下的钱不如买成公债，自己不但储蓄了一笔钱，而且也为国家出了一份力。经过她耐心地劝说，他妈妈终于同意了。
    在小组会上，她高兴地提出认购三十万元经济建设公债。
    夫妻俩算家务账
    杨振声和郭亭夫妇两人，都是天津私营东亚企业公司毛厂的工人。杨振声是检验工人，郭亭也在粗纺车间做了多年工了。他俩都是生产能手，郭亭去年还光荣地参加了中国共产党。每天，他俩一块上工、下工，一块上业余学校学习，他们生活过的很好，去年又生了个胖娃娃。
    在认购经济建设公债时，他们想用自己的劳动，自己的积蓄来投资到国家经济建设中去，为自己、为孩子们建设更美好的生活。把银行的存款摺拿出来，又把目前的家庭收支情况详细地计算了一遍，除了家里的一切费用外，两人还敷余四百万元，因此，夫妻俩就决定了买四百万元公债。
  凑一个整数目晚上，沈阳市建设局市政建设工程公司老工人张杏林老两口坐在炕头上，一边吃饭一边听着收音机里播送的职工认购公债的广播。张老大娘对张杏林说：“你听着没有，大家的劲头多大呀！咱们核计核计买多少呵！”张杏林摆了摆手不让她说，等到广播完了，他才笑着说：“核计核计吧，除了咱俩吃的用的，买六十万元公债不成问题。”张老大娘一听这话就说：“那可不行，还有做衣服钱呢……”张杏林以为她思想不通，生气地说：“你怎么也不想想，衣服那么多够穿就行呗！”张老大娘一听张杏林这话，忙着把她的针线箥箩拿出来，掀开左一层右一层的小布包，拿出一打子新票，数了数整整三十万元。张老大娘一边把钱交给张杏林一边埋怨说：“你也不听完人家的话，我是说过去留的这些钱一点没用……”张杏林一听这话高兴了。又拿出了自己攒的十万元，凑在一起整整一百万元。张老大娘还再三嘱咐张杏林：“别忘了，明天，你一早就跟工会说，咱们要认购一百万元哪！”
