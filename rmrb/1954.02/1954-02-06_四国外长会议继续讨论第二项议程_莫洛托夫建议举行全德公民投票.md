Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 5th: On February 3rd, the four foreign ministers continued their meeting, chaired by Bidault. The meeting continued to discuss the second item on the agenda.

    Molotov spoke first. He pointed out that West Germany could no longer freely handle its internal and foreign affairs because of the signing of the Bonn Treaty. Some say that the obligations stipulated in the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty are valid until the conclusion of a peace treaty, then why are the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty valid for fifty years? Does this mean that the Western countries' promises to expedite the conclusion of a peace treaty are not worth taking seriously, because in fact some people think that Germany has to wait decades to get a peace treaty.
    Molotov cited facts to refute Eden and Bidault's claim that, according to the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, a unified Germany could freely decide whether to join the "European Defense Community." After citing the contents of Article 7, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Bonn Treaty, Molotov pointed out that, according to these provisions, the Bonn government would be obliged not to agree to any unified Germany plan that did not stipulate participation in the "European Defense Community" after Germany's reunification. It can be seen from this that the purpose of the Bonn Treaty is to guarantee in advance that a unified Germany will be dragged into the "European Defense Community." This means that the drafters of the Bonn Treaty did not want a unified Germany. At the same time, this also means that the obligations undertaken by West Germany under the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty are incompatible with holding free all-German elections and with recognizing that a unified Germany has true freedom.
    Molotov then spoke about the statement issued by the United States, Britain, and France on May 27, 1952, regarding the signing of the Paris Treaty. That statement specifically mentioned the positions of the United States and Britain. They did not want to send their own troops to participate in the "European Army," but on the other hand, they believed that any attempt to withdraw from the "European Defense Community" was a "threat to their security." Molotov pointed out that this was tantamount to announcing in advance that West Germany could not withdraw from the group in the future after joining it. The same statement of the three countries talked about the fact that if anyone doubted the necessity of maintaining the "European Defense Community," the United States and Britain decided to keep troops in Europe and keep these troops in a state of appropriate preparation. It can be seen from this that if West Germany attempts to withdraw from the group, the three countries will do everything possible to prevent it, even threatening it with armed force. From the statement of the three countries, it is not difficult to see that Germany does not even have a trace of true freedom.
    Molotov refuted Dulles' distortion of Soviet-German relations in 1939 at the meeting on the 2nd. He pointed out that throughout the autumn of 1939, the Soviet government had negotiated with the British and French governments, striving to reach an agreement to prevent war and prevent Hitler's aggression. However, Chamberlain and his French colleagues did not want to reach any agreement with the Soviet Union that would bind Hitler's hands and feet. In this way, they helped Hitler accelerate his attack on Poland, and thus bear part of the responsibility for instigating the 1939 war.
    Molotov said that Dulles tried to prove that the West German authorities were authoritative, but he did not recognize the authority of the East German authorities. In fact, everyone knows that the West German authorities support the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, but are not in a hurry for a peace treaty. The government of the German Democratic Republic advocates the early conclusion of a peace treaty and resolutely opposes the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty. Why not suggest holding a poll, holding an all-German referendum, to see whether the German people support the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty, or support a peace treaty? Then we will get a clear answer: Who is really expressing the wishes of the German people today.
    After Molotov spoke, Dulles spoke. He admitted that the time had come to eliminate Germany's current division, and the division could no longer be allowed to exist, because this situation was a serious threat to other countries. He once again insisted that Germany should become a member of the "European Defense Community," while stubbornly claiming that he also favored allowing a unified Germany to freely choose whether to join the group. He said that if the relevant clauses in Eden's plan did not clearly emphasize this point, the necessary textual changes could be made.
    Bidault then spoke. He himself emphasized that there would be nothing new in his words. This is indeed the case. Bidault reiterated that the validity of the Bonn Treaty extends until the signing of a peace treaty. He stubbornly claimed that once a peace treaty is signed, the Bonn Treaty will become invalid. Bidault continued to believe that a unified Germany would not be bound by the Paris Treaty and would be able to act according to its own opinions.
    Bidault also talked about Article 7 of the Bonn Treaty. Because he dared not refute the obvious meaning of this article, Bidault could only guarantee verbally that this article only binds West Germany and does not impose any obligations on the government of a unified Germany.
    Bidault finally talked about the question raised by Molotov in his speech: Why not suggest holding a poll, holding an all-German referendum in order to find out the German people's opinions. Bidault believed that doing so would encounter some difficulties, that is to say, he did not dare to hand over the question of whether the Bonn Treaty and the Paris Treaty conform to the interests of the German people to the German people themselves to judge.
    Eden then spoke. He agreed with Dulles and Bidault's statements, and he expressed his disagreement with holding a referendum. Eden said that he believed that the discussion should focus on the five-stage plan he proposed to restore German unification.
    Molotov spoke again. He pointed out that Dulles, Bidault, and Eden avoided mentioning the facts and documents he cited in their speeches. Molotov further emphasized that the completion of the Paris Treaty on the establishment of the "European Army" would make German unification impossible.
    After Molotov spoke, Dulles said that in order to accommodate the opinions of the Soviet delegation, he would propose an amendment to Article 4 of the Eden Plan. The original article was: "The all-German government will have the right to assume the international rights and obligations of the Federal Republic and the Soviet Zone of Germany, and will have the right to conclude other such international agreements as it may wish." Dulles suggested adding the words "or refuse" after the words "will have the right to assume."
    Molotov asked Dulles whether his amendment to the Eden Plan would postpone the completion of the Paris Treaty, which stipulates a validity period of fifty years.
    Dulles avoided answering this question. He said that the validity of the peace treaty was not important.
    Bidault suggested postponing the answer to the question raised by Molotov until the next day.
    After Eden expressed his agreement with Dulles's amendment to Article 4 of the British plan, Molotov once again emphasized that the Soviet delegation believed that the Paris Treaty on the establishment of the "European Army" was a treaty establishing a military group of six Western countries to deal with other European countries.
    The meeting adjourned at this point.

### 四国外长会议继续讨论第二项议程  莫洛托夫建议举行全德公民投票

    四国外长会议继续讨论第二项议程
    莫洛托夫建议举行全德公民投票
     【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社柏林四日讯：二月三日，四国外长会议继续开会，由皮杜尔任主席。会议继续讨论议程第二项。
    莫洛托夫首先发言。他指出，由于签订了波恩条约，西德已不能自由处理自己的内政和外交事务了。有人说，波恩条约和巴黎条约所规定的义务的有效期限至缔结和约时为止，那么为什么波恩条约和巴黎条约要为期五十年呢？这是不是说，西方国家关于加速缔结和约的诺言不值得重视呢，因为事实上有人认为德国必须等几十年才能得到和约。
    莫洛托夫列举事实来驳斥艾登和皮杜尔所谓根据波恩条约和巴黎条约，统一的德国可以自由决定是否参加“欧洲防务集团”的说法。莫洛托夫在援引波恩条约第七条第二款和第三款的内容后指出：根据这些规定，波恩政府将有义务不得同意任何没有规定在德国统一后参加“欧洲防务集团”的统一德国方案。由此可见，波恩条约的目的就是，事先保证把统一的德国拖进“欧洲防务集团”。这就意味着，波恩条约的草拟者不希望统一德国。同时，这也意味着，西德根据波恩条约和巴黎条约所承担的义务是与举行全德自由选举不相容的，是与承认一个统一的德国有真正的自由一事不相容的。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到美、英、法三国在一九五二年五月二十七日就签订巴黎条约事发表的声明。那篇声明中特别提到了美国和英国的立场。它们不希望拿自己的军队去参加“欧洲军”，另一方面却认为任何企图退出“欧洲防务集团”的行动是对它们的“安全的威胁”。莫洛托夫指出，这就等于事先宣布：西德参加这个集团，将来就不能退出。三国的同一声明谈到，如果有人怀疑保持“欧洲防务集团”的必要性，美国和英国决定在欧洲保留军队，并使这些军队处于适当的准备状态。由此可见，如果西德企图退出这个集团，三国将尽一切可能来阻止它，甚至以武装力量相威胁。由三国的这篇声明看来，不难看出，德国连一点真正自由的痕迹也没有了。
    莫洛托夫驳斥杜勒斯在二日会议上对一九三九年苏德关系的歪曲。他指出：在一九三九年整个秋天，苏联政府曾和英、法政府进行谈判，力求取得协议以防止战争和防止希特勒侵略。然而，张伯伦和他的法国同僚们不想跟苏联达成任何束缚希特勒手足的协定。这样，他们就帮助了希特勒加速对波兰进攻，从而在挑起一九三九年战争的罪行中有一分责任。
    莫洛托夫说：杜勒斯力图证明，西德当局是有权威的，但他却不承认东德当局的权威性。事实上，谁都知道，西德当局支持波恩条约和巴黎条约，而对和约却不着急。德意志民主共和国政府则主张尽早缔结和约，而断然反对波恩条约和巴黎条约。为什么不建议举行一次民意测验，举行全德公民投票，看看德国人民究竟是拥护波恩条约和巴黎条约呢，还是拥护和约呢？那时我们就会得到一个明确的答复：今天究竟是谁真正表达了德国人民的愿望。
    莫洛托夫发言之后，杜勒斯发言。他承认，消除德国目前分裂局面的时候已经到来了，不能再让分裂局面存在下去，因为这种局面对别的国家是严重的威胁。他再一次坚持德国应该成为“欧洲防务集团”的一员，同时却硬说，他又赞成让统一的德国自由选择是否参加这个集团。他说，如果艾登计划中的有关条文没有十分明确地强调这一点，可以作必要的文字修改。
    皮杜尔接着发言。他自己着重指出，他的话里面不会有什么新东西。事实的确如此。皮杜尔重复说，波恩条约的有效期至签订和约时为止。他硬说，和约一签订以后，波恩条约就会失效。皮杜尔继续认为，统一的德国将不受巴黎条约的约束，将能根据自己的意见办事。
    皮杜尔还谈到了波恩条约第七条。由于不敢驳斥这一条的明显含意，皮杜尔只能空口保证说，这一条只对西德有约束力，对于统一的德国政府并没有强加任何义务。
    皮杜尔最后谈到莫洛托夫在发言中所提出的问题：为什么不建议举行一次民意测验，举行全德公民投票以便弄清德国人的主张。皮杜尔认为，这样做会遭到一些困难，这就是说，他不敢把波恩条约和巴黎条约是否符合德国人民的利益这一问题交给德国人民自己来判断。
    艾登接着发言。他同意杜勒斯和皮杜尔的说法，他并表示不同意举行公民投票。艾登说，他认为应该集中讨论他所提出的分五阶段恢复德国统一的计划。
     莫洛托夫再次发言。他指出，杜勒斯、皮杜尔和艾登在发言中避而不谈他所举出的事实和文件。莫洛托夫进一步着重指出，关于成立“欧洲军”的巴黎条约的完成会使德国的统一成为不可能。
    莫洛托夫发言后，杜勒斯说：为了迁就苏联代表团的意见，他将提出对艾登计划中第四条的修正。原条文是：“全德政府将有权承担联邦共和国和德国苏占区的国际权利和义务，并有权如它可能希望的缔结其他这种国际协定”。杜勒斯建议在“将有权承担”几个字后面加上“或拒绝”三个字。
    莫洛托夫问杜勒斯是不是由于他对艾登计划的修正就会推迟规定有效期为五十年的巴黎条约的完成。
    杜勒斯避不答复这个问题。他说，和约的有效期并不重要。
    皮杜尔建议对莫洛托夫所提出的问题延至第二天答复。
    在艾登表示同意杜勒斯对英国计划第四条的修正后，莫洛托夫再次着重指出：苏联代表团认为关于成立“欧洲军”的巴黎条约是一个成立六个西方国家的军事集团来对付其他欧洲国家的条约。
    会议至此休会。
