Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 25th: The Japan Peace Liaison Council held a Standing Committee meeting in Tokyo on February 11th and adopted resolutions on striving for peace and strengthening international peace ties.

    The Standing Committee also discussed the Yoshida government's recent preparations to revise the "Passport Law." Participants unanimously pointed out that this was a conspiracy by the Yoshida government to sever the ties between the Japanese people and the peace-loving people of the world, especially the people of countries in the peace and democratic camp, and unanimously expressed their opposition. The Standing Committee resolved to launch a struggle against revising the "Passport Law" and to fight for freedom of travel abroad.

    In addition, the Standing Committee also decided to support the Japan Journalists League in sending representatives to the International Journalists Congress to be held in Prague in the first half of this year, to send representatives to the international conference suggested by the World Peace Council to discuss the easing of international tensions, to promote the invitation of a Chinese Red Cross delegation to visit Japan, to promote the convening of a five-power conference and a Korean political conference, and to oppose the Yoshida government's rearmament and the drafting of a bill prohibiting teachers from engaging in political activities.
