    Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau recently held a special meeting to review the study and propaganda of the general line. Participants included the propaganda chiefs of the Mengsui Sub-bureau and the provincial and municipal Party committees, as well as some propaganda cadres from prefectural, county, and factory/mine Party committees. The North China Bureau attached great importance to this meeting. Before the meeting, the Standing Committee of the North China Bureau had discussed the "Outline for the Study and Propaganda of the Party's General Line for the Transition Period" issued by the Propaganda Department of the CCP Central Committee, in conjunction with the situation in the region, to make good preparations for the meeting.

    After listening to reports from various regions, the meeting believed that over the past four months, North China had vigorously carried out the study and propaganda of the general line, achieving great results. Under the guidance of the general line, the vast number of cadres and the masses clarified the direction of their struggle, criticized the erroneous ideological tendencies of the bourgeoisie, greatly enhanced their class consciousness, and inspired enthusiasm for socialist construction. This has played a significant role in improving various tasks, and more importantly, it has improved the leadership level of Party committees and leading organs at all levels. During the meeting's discussions, everyone further recognized that the study and propaganda of the general line is the ideological construction work of the Party during the transition period, and the most fundamental ideological mobilization for large-scale, planned construction. Only by understanding the general line can people understand why to build, what to build, what to rely on to build, how to build, and what we should do for construction, and a series of other fundamental issues.

    The meeting summarized the characteristics of the study and propaganda of the general line in this stage:

    First, this study and propaganda, conducted in close connection with actual work such as increasing production and practicing economy, grain procurement, and mutual aid and cooperation, showed that this is a complex and arduous struggle. On the one hand, the study and propaganda of the general line encouraged cadres and the masses and promoted various tasks, while the practice of various tasks improved cadres and the masses. On the other hand, when implementing the general line through the execution of specific policies, many complex ideological struggles were revealed. The vast majority of cadres and basic masses have initially demarcated the boundaries between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, and between the ideologies of the bourgeoisie and the working class. From the propaganda and implementation of the general line, people further understood that socialist construction and socialist transformation must go through serious struggles. Second, this study and propaganda of the general line was uniformly led by the Party committees, with responsible comrades taking the lead and organizing key personnel to carry it out in an all-round way. The North China Bureau, Party committees at all levels, and responsible cadres of various departments not only studied conscientiously themselves in connection with their work, but also personally supervised the study of their subordinate cadres and repeatedly gave them reports. The North China Bureau and local Party committees also sent a large number of cadres to factories and rural areas to conduct propaganda, and trained a large number of grassroots propaganda backbones, relying on this force to promote the movement in an all-round way. In Hebei Province, more than 1.7 million people were trained as backbones, in Shanxi Province, about 1 million people were trained, and in the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, a total of 30,000 people were trained.

    The meeting believed that the more important gain of the general line propaganda in this period was that Party committees at all levels and leading departments of various systems linked the general line with the implementation of specific policies, and used the spirit of the general line to solve problems in various practical tasks. In reviewing and summarizing the work of 1953 or compiling and reviewing the 1954 national economic plan, and in handling various daily tasks, they were all implemented in accordance with the general line, the highest criterion, from all aspects, which greatly overcame blindness in work, overcame the views of discussing matters in isolation, implementing policies in isolation, and purely focusing on tasks, so that various tasks could be uniformly and appropriately arranged under the general requirement of strengthening socialist forces. Because Party committees at all levels comprehensively implemented the general line in actual work, they also played the most effective role in promoting the education and propaganda of the general line.

    After review, the meeting pointed out that the main problems existing in the study and propaganda of the general line in this stage were: many places did not pay comprehensive attention to the content of propaganda and study, some only studied and propagated the part related to their own work. Generally speaking, insufficient emphasis was placed on national socialist industrialization, the worker-peasant alliance, and the leading role of the Party. There was little propaganda on the socialist transformation of handicrafts, and poor propaganda on the spirit of hard struggle necessary for building socialism. In terms of methods, some cadres in organs did not link well with reality in their studies, and some failed to elaborate well from the theoretical and policy aspects in their actual work propaganda. Some cadres also lacked a correct attitude towards studying and propagating the general line. Some regarded the study and propaganda of the general line as general theoretical study and current affairs propaganda, and some even opposed it to current work. The meeting analyzed and criticized these problems.

    Regarding how to further strengthen the study and propaganda of the general line in the future, the meeting determined: Within this year, major cadres are required to further systematically and deeply understand the spirit of the general line from the theoretical, policy and practical work aspects, and senior leading cadres are required to make up their minds to seriously read several books. All cadres participating in the study are required to systematically study the "Outline for the Study and Propaganda of the Party's General Line for the Transition Period" before the end of April, and link it with the inspection of work. From May to the end of the year, continue to link with daily work and further study chapters 9 to 12 of the "A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" in depth. For the broad masses, the general line should be frequently publicized in connection with actual work to encourage them to complete this year's production and work tasks in accordance with the national plan and requirements.

    The meeting pointed out several issues that should be paid attention to in the future propaganda and study of the general line: First, it is necessary to mobilize all cadres, especially leading cadres, to understand the importance of comprehensively and systematically studying and propagating the general line, so that they can consciously and conscientiously continue to study the general line well, and regularly and continuously continue to propagate it to the masses. Second, it is necessary to make cadres study in greater depth, and an important method is to link with reality. In this regard, some of the good experiences already available in various places should be promoted. For example, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is currently systematically and deeply studying the general line in connection with the preparations for the municipal Party congress. Their method is to further review the work since the first Party congress in 1952 based on the systematic study of the general line propaganda outline and other relevant documents. First, members of the municipal Party committee make relevant reports to key Party member cadres, and discuss them in connection with the general line documents, and then submit the results of the discussion to the Party congress for resolution. Zunhua County, Hebei Province, first organized the county Party committee of the Communist Party of China to collectively study and discuss the learning materials in connection with its work, formulate a report outline, and then each member went to each district learning station to report on the work situation and the thinking of cadres, and organized discussions. The county had been using this method to persist in regular study for more than a year before studying the general line, and believed that it could both improve work in learning and persist in learning regularly. Third, attention should be paid to training propaganda backbones, rectifying propaganda organizations, and supplying learning and propaganda materials. In terms of cadre education: in the future, various important meetings should still be an important method for educating cadres on the general line. The North China Economic Construction Research Class should continue to be held. Sub-bureaus and provincial and municipal Party committees may also consider holding short-term training courses specializing in the study of the general line. Party schools and various training courses at all levels should include the general line as one of the main courses. For administrative responsible cadres and theoretical instructors in active service, training can be carried out in the form of night schools and research societies. In terms of mass propaganda: short-term training courses, propaganda member representative meetings, etc. can be used to train worker political instructors, rural people's school teachers, and propaganda activist. Grassroots cadres should be trained through mutual aid and cooperation meetings and labor model meetings. The propaganda network should be appropriately adjusted and developed during the propaganda process. In terms of education and propaganda materials: in addition to the rural branch textbooks that have been issued by the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau and the workers' political textbooks and worker-peasant alliance learning materials that are being compiled, various localities should also compile some popular materials according to their local conditions and publish them in Party journals, newspapers, and magazines.

    The meeting finally pointed out that Party committees at all levels should continue to strengthen their leadership over the study and propaganda of the general line. Party committees at all levels should instruct the propaganda department to be responsible for supervising and inspecting the work of studying and propagating the general line, and report regularly to the Party committee at the same level and the propaganda department of the higher Party committee.

    中共中央华北局召开专门会议
    进一步部署总路线的学习和宣传
    【新华社二十六日讯】中共中央华北局不久以前召开专门会议，对学习和宣传总路线的情况进行了检查。参加这次会议的有蒙绥分局和各省、市委宣传部长，以及部分地委、县委和厂矿党委宣传干部。华北局十分重视这次会议的召开，会前，华北局常委会就曾对中共中央宣传部所发的关于党在过渡时期总路线的学习和宣传提纲并结合本区情况作了讨论，为会议的召开做了很好的准备。
    会议听取了各地的汇报后，认为四个月来，华北各地大张旗鼓地进行了总路线的学习和宣传，取得了很大成绩。广大干部和群众在总路线的照耀下，明确了奋斗的方向，批判了资产阶级的错误思想倾向，大大提高了阶级觉悟，鼓舞了社会主义建设的热情，对各项工作的改进，起了显著的作用，更重要的是提高了各级党委和各系统领导机关的领导水平。大家在会议讨论中更进一步认识到总路线的学习和宣传，乃是党在过渡时期的思想建设工作，是大规模的有计划的建设的最根本的思想动员。只有懂得了总路线，人们才能懂得为什么要建设？建设什么？靠什么来建设？如何进行建设？为了建设我们应该做些什么事等一系列的根本性的问题。
    会议总结了这一阶段学习和宣传总路线的特点：
    首先，这一学习和宣传在密切结合增产节约、粮食收购、互助合作等各项实际工作进行中，显示出这是一场复杂而艰巨的斗争。一方面，经过总路线的学习和宣传，鼓舞了干部和群众，推进了各项工作，在各项工作的实践中又提高了干部和群众；但另方面在通过执行具体政策来贯彻总路线时，表现出许多复杂的思想斗争。绝大多数干部和基本群众初步划清了资本主义和社会主义两条道路的界限，划清了资产阶级和工人阶级的思想界限。从总路线的宣传和贯彻中，人们进一步理解到社会主义的建设和社会主义改造，是必须经过严重斗争的。其次，这次总路线的学习和宣传，是由党委统一领导，负责同志亲自带头，并组织骨干全面开展起来的。华北局、各级党委和各部门负责干部，不仅自己结合工作认真学习。并亲自督促所属干部学习，反复给他们作报告。华北局和各地党委还派了大批干部到工厂、农村去宣传，并大量训练了基层的宣传骨干，依靠这批力量把运动推向全面。这种骨干在河北省训练了一百七十多万人，在山西省训练了约一百万人，在内蒙古自治区东部地区共训练了三万人。
    会议认为这一时期总路线宣传的更重要的收获是各级党委和各系统领导部门把总路线和执行具体政策联系起来，根据总路线的精神来解决各项实际工作中的问题。在检查和总结一九五三年工作或编订审查一九五四年国民经济计划中，在处理日常各项工作中，都根据总路线这一最高准则，从各方面予以贯彻，这样就大大地克服了工作中的盲目性，克服了就事论事、孤立执行政策和单纯任务观点，使各种工作都能在为壮大社会主义力量这一总的要求下统一地适当地安排起来。由于各级党委在实际工作中全面地贯彻总路线，所以对总路线的教育和宣传，也起了最有效的推动作用。
    会议经过检查后指出，这一阶段总路线的学习和宣传中存在的主要问题是：许多地方对宣传学习内容注意得不全面，有些是干那行只学习和宣传那一部分，一般说来，对国家社会主义工业化、工农联盟、党的领导作用等问题强调得不够，对于手工业社会主义改造宣传很少，对建设社会主义必须艰苦奋斗的精神宣传得差。在方法上，有些机关干部在学习中没有很好地联系实际，有些在实际工作的宣传中又未能很好地从理论和政策方面加以阐发。有些干部还缺乏学习和宣传总路线的正确态度。有的把总路线的学习和宣传，当成一般的理论学习和时事宣传，有的甚至把它和当前工作对立起来。会议对这些问题都进行了分析和批判。
    关于今后如何进一步加强总路线的学习和宣传的问题，会议确定：今年一年内，要求主要干部从理论上、政策上和实际工作上进一步有系统地、深刻地领会总路线的精神，要求高级领导干部下决心认真地读几本书。要求所有参加学习的干部在四月底以前有系统地学习党在过渡时期总路线的学习和宣传提纲，并联系检查工作。五月到年底，继续联系日常工作，结合“联共（布）党史简明教程”第九章至十二章再深入学习。对广大群众，要结合实际工作经常进行总路线的宣传，鼓舞他们按照国家计划和要求，完成今年的生产和工作任务。
    会议指出在今后宣传和学习总路线中应注意的几个问题：首先是必须动员所有干部特别是领导干部，懂得全面系统地学习和宣传总路线的重要，使其自觉地认真地继续把总路线学好，并经常地不断地继续向群众进行宣传。其次要使干部学习深入一步，重要的方法是联系实际。在这方面应推广各地已有的一些好的经验。如中共天津市委，目前正结合市党代表大会的准备工作，有系统地深入地学习总路线。他们的办法是在系统地学习总路线宣传提纲和其他有关文件的基础上，进一步根据总路线检查一九五二年第一次党代表大会以后的工作。先由市委委员在主要党员干部中作有关报告，结合总路线的文件进行讨论，然后将讨论结果提交党代表大会作出决议。河北省遵化县首先由中共县委就学习材料结合工作集体研究讨论，制定报告提纲，然后各委员到各区学习站，结合当地工作情况和干部思想作报告，并组织座谈讨论。该县在学习总路线以前已经用这种方法坚持经常学习一年多之久，认为既能在学习中改进工作，又能经常坚持学习。再次要注意训练宣传骨干，整顿宣传组织，供应学习和宣传的材料。在干部教育方面：今后各种重要会议仍应成为对干部进行总路线教育的重要方法。华北经济建设问题研究班要继续举办。分局和省、市委也可考虑举办专门学习总路线的短期训练班。各级党校和各种训练班，都应把总路线作为主要课程之一。对于在职的行政负责干部和理论教员，可用夜校、研究会等形式进行训练。在群众宣传方面：可用短期训练班、宣传员代表会等形式，训练工人政治教员、农村民校教员、宣传员积极分子。要通过互助合作会议、劳动模范会议来训练基层干部。在宣传过程中对宣传网要加以适当调整和发展。在教育和宣传材料方面：除华北局宣传部已发农村支部教材和正在编写工人政治教材、工农联盟学习材料外，各地亦应根据本地情况编写一些通俗材料，在党刊、报纸、杂志上发表。
    会议最后指出各级党委应继续加强对总路线学习和宣传的领导。各级党委应责成宣传部负责督促检查关于总路线的学习和宣传工作，并定期向同级党委和上级党委宣传部作报告。
