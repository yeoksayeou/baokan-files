Wuxi County Local State-Owned Silk Factory workers, despite the factory's very outdated machinery and equipment, produced Grade 4A high-quality silk using sitting reeling machines, setting a new national record.

Sitting reeling machines are a relatively backward type of machinery in silk factories, and most of the factory's sitting reeling machines are thirty to forty years old, with significant wear and tear. However, thanks to the workers' continuous technical research and improvement, they had already set a new national record for producing Grade 3A high-quality silk using sitting reeling machines in December 1950. After the launch of the General Line study, all factory workers further recognized the importance of leveraging the potential of existing equipment to accelerate China's socialist industrialization, thus boosting their production enthusiasm. Recently, they received a batch of substandard "Silk Shop Unified Standard" raw materials for production. Because the workers studied the production situation from various aspects, strengthened pre-production sampling, closely coordinated between various work types, focused on technical research, and vigorously promoted advanced operating procedures, they successfully completed this task. According to the inspection of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, not only did this batch of products meet specifications, but the average grade of the silk was also 10.43% higher than the national standard, and there were five pieces of Grade 4A high-quality silk. In terms of raw material consumption, the amount of cocoons used per hundred catties of silk was also three catties lower than the national plan. This new achievement has further encouraged and educated the majority of workers. In the past, some workers often blamed the machines for being too old and the raw materials for being bad. Now, this view has generally changed, and they have reflected: "As long as we workers continuously improve production, old machines can also produce good products for the country."

    无锡丝厂职工用旧机器生产出了高级丝
    地方国营无锡县丝厂职工在该厂机械设备十分陈旧的情况下，以坐缫车生产出四爱级高品质丝来，创造了全国新纪录。
    坐缫车是目前丝厂当中一种比较落后的机器，而且该厂的坐缫车又多数具有三、四十年的历史，磨损消耗很大。但是由于该厂职工能不断地从技术上加以研究改进，在一九五○年十二月间曾创造了坐缫车出三爱级高品质丝的全国新纪录。总路线学习展开后，全厂职工更进一步认识到发挥旧有设备潜力对加速我国社会主义工业化有重要意义，因此生产积极性更加提高。最近，他们接收了一批次等的“丝庄统号”原料进行生产，由于职工们从多方面研究了生产情况，加强了生产前的试样工作；密切了各个工种之间的配合；并抓紧了技术研究工作；大力推广了先进操作规程，结果，胜利地完成了这批任务。经中央对外贸易部上海商品检验局检验，该厂这批产品不但合乎规格，而且丝的平均等级比国家规定还提高了百分之十点四三，并有五件四爱级高品质丝。在原料消耗方面，每百斤丝的用茧量也较国家计划降低三斤。这一新的成绩，更加鼓舞和教育了广大职工。过去部分职工还时常怪机器太旧，怪原料不好，现在已普遍转变了这种看法，纷纷反映：“只要我们工人不断的改进生产，旧机器也能给国家生产出好产品来。”
