    The grassroots election work in Qidaoquanzi Village, Second District, Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, was carried out on the basis of vigorously publicizing the General Line and completing the grain purchase work. The party members, Youth League members, cadres, and the broad masses in the whole village received education on the General Line and patriotic grain sales, and their socialist ideological consciousness was generally improved. The whole village sold 200,000 jin of grain, and many good cadres, good representatives, and new activists who were active in their work, ideologically progressive, and able to serve the people emerged, effectively testing the grassroots cadres and creating favorable conditions for the grassroots election work. At the same time, through the general election, selecting good cadres and activists into the government provides a very important guarantee for implementing the General Line in the countryside, further promoting mutual aid and cooperation, and doing a good job in production.

    After being educated on the General Line, the masses of Qidaoquanzi Village attached even greater importance to the general election work, actively demanding to elect good representatives, strengthen their own government, and lead everyone to take the socialist road. When nominating representative candidates, whether they could lead everyone to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation has become the main criterion for voters to choose representatives. When someone in the Fifth Electoral District nominated a certain person as a representative candidate, everyone disagreed, reflecting that this person was muddle-headed and could not lead everyone into socialism. Village Chief Shi Wanzhong, Youth League members Meng Xiangshun, Yang Zhanyuan, and others not only publicized the General Line, but also took the lead in implementing the General Line, selling surplus grain to the state, and using their own exemplary actions to influence others, which was warmly supported by the masses. At a voters' group meeting discussing the nomination of Cheng Xiufeng as a representative candidate, everyone said: He used to be a representative, and he never bowed his head to difficulties in doing anything, and he can lead us to take the road of getting organized and becoming prosperous!

    The masses' awareness has been raised, knowing that the Communist Party is the leader who leads them to socialism, and they are ideologically closer to the Party. Therefore, the method of joint nomination is more satisfactory to the voters. The whole village jointly proposed twenty-nine representative candidates, and only three were replaced after discussion by the voters. The three representatives who were replaced were indeed stronger than the three who were replaced, and the voters elected people who could lead everyone to take the socialist road as representatives. At this time, the general election working group continued to educate the village cadres on the General Line, and helped the cadres examine their ideological style and summarize the government's work, while praising good people and good deeds. This not only satisfied the masses, but also improved the cadres. Village Chief Shi Wanzhong reviewed and said: "After this education on the General Line, the idea that I only care about personal interests has been dispelled. My biggest shortcoming in the past was that I did not lead the mutual aid group well, and I am determined to do a good job in the future." Other village cadres also criticized their capitalist ideology and shortcomings in their work. Because the grassroots cadres solved the problems ideologically, deeply examined their work according to the General Line, and expressed their determination to lead everyone to take the socialist road, among the past thirteen members of the village people's government, except for two who were ideologically backward, worked passively, and were dissatisfied by the masses and were not elected, the remaining eleven members of the village people's government were re-elected as members of the village people's government at the People's Congress.

    While implementing the General Line and conducting the general election, the general election working group also educated the masses on increasing production and practicing economy, educating the peasants to invest the money earned from selling grain into production or deposit it in the credit cooperative. Therefore, 71% of the village's grain sales income has been invested in production, and most of the rest has been used to repay agricultural loans or build houses, basically achieving proper use. According to preliminary statistics, the whole village bought sixteen donkeys, six mules, horses, and cattle, one rubber-wheeled cart, forty pigs, and also plans to buy 40,000 jin of ammonium sulfate.

    The general election has also powerfully promoted the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The foundation of mutual aid and cooperation in Qidaoquanzi Village in the past was very weak, with only about 10% of the peasants organized. Of the five permanent mutual aid groups in the village, four had collapsed due to poor leadership, lack of a work evaluation and scoring system, and failure to solve some problems in a timely manner; the five temporary mutual aid groups also became formalistic. Based on this situation, the general election working group focused on training the party members, Youth League members, village cadres, and mutual aid group leaders, so that they ideologically improved their enthusiasm for participating in and leading mutual aid and cooperation. At the People's Congress, mutual aid and cooperation became the central topic. The representatives unanimously resolved to do a good job in the five permanent mutual aid groups, to evaluate work, record work, do work together, and find prices on time, and to help the mutual aid groups make simple production plans. The focus was on leading the Dong Wanchang group, planning to build a cooperative by the end of 1954. In order to set an example and expand influence, the production achievements of the Dong Wanchang group in 1953 and the production plan for 1954 were also introduced at the meeting, further illustrating the superiority of getting organized through the actual example of the Dong Wanchang group organizing to produce more grain and improving the lives of its members. The representatives were all energized and guaranteed to participate in and lead the mutual aid groups.

    热河省朝阳七道泉子村
    结合宣传贯彻总路线完成基层选举
    普选工作有力地推动了互助合作运动
    热河省朝阳县二区七道泉子村的基层选举工作，是在大张旗鼓地宣传总路线和完成购粮工作的基础上进行的。全村党员、团员、干部和广大群众受到了总路线和爱国售粮的宣传教育，普遍提高了社会主义的思想觉悟。全村售粮二十万斤，并涌现出不少工作积极、思想进步、能为人民办事的好干部、好代表和新的积极分子，有效地考验了基层干部，给基层选举工作创造了有利的条件。同时，通过普选，把好干部和积极分子选到政权中来，对于在农村中贯彻总路线、进一步促进互助合作、搞好生产，也有了极重要的保证。
    七道泉子村的群众受到总路线的教育后，更进一步重视了普选工作，积极要求选好代表，加强自己的政权，领导大家走社会主义的路。在提代表候选人时，能否领导大家走互助合作的道路，已成为选民选择代表的主要标准。第五选区有人提某人为代表候选人，大家都不同意，反映说：这个人办事糊涂，不能领导大家进入社会主义。村长时万钟、青年团员孟祥顺、杨占元等不但宣传总路线，还带头执行总路线，把余粮卖给国家，用自己的模范行动来影响别人，就得到群众的热烈拥护。在一次选民小组会上讨论提程秀峰当代表候选人时，大家都说：他过去就是代表，办啥事都没向困难低过头，能领导我们走组织起来大家富裕的道路！
    群众的觉悟提高了，知道共产党是领导他们奔社会主义的带路人，从思想上和党更加靠近了。因此联合提名的方式更为选民所满意。全村联合提出二十九名代表候选人，经过选民讨论，只更换了三名。换上来的三名代表的确比换下去的那三名强，选民都选举了能够领导大家走社会主义路的人当代表。这时，普选工作组继续对村干部进行了总路线教育，并帮助干部检查思想作风，总结政府工作，同时表扬了好人好事。这样做不仅群众满意，而且使干部也有所提高。村长时万钟检讨说：“经过这次总路线的教育，我光顾个人利益的思想算打消了。我过去最大的缺点就是没领导好互助组，今后要下决心搞好。”其他村干部也批判了自己的资本主义思想和工作上的缺点。由于基层干部从思想上解决了问题，根据总路线深刻地检查了自己的工作，并表示决心领导大家走社会主义的路，所以过去的十三名村人民政府委员中，除两名思想落后、工作消极、为群众不满而落选外，其余十一名村人民政府委员都在人民代表大会上继续当选为村人民政府委员。
    在贯彻总路线和进行普选的同时，普选工作组并对群众进行了增产节约的教育，教育农民把卖粮所得的款投入生产或存到信贷部去。因此，全村百分之七十一的卖粮款已投入生产，其余的大部都归还了农贷或盖房用了，基本上做到了正当使用。据初步统计，全村买了驴十六头，骡、马、牛共六头，胶轮大车一辆，猪四十口，还计划买硫铵四万斤。
    普选也有力地推动了互助合作运动。七道泉子村过去的互助合作基础很薄弱，仅有百分之十左右的农民组织起来。全村五个常年互助组，有的因领导差，没有评工记分制度，有些问题未及时解决，已垮了四个；五个临时互助组也流于形式主义。普选工作组根据这一情况，就集中地对党员、团员、村干部、互助组长进行一次互助合作的训练，使他们从思想上提高了参加和领导互助合作的积极性。在人民代表大会上，互助合作成为中心议题。代表们一致决议要把五个常年互助组搞好，作到按时评工、记工、齐工、找价，并帮助互助组做出简单的生产计划。重点领导董万昌组，计划在一九五四年底建社。为了树立榜样，扩大影响，还在会上介绍了董万昌组一九五三年的生产成绩和一九五四年的生产计划，通过董万昌组组织起来多打粮食、组员生活上升的实际例子，进一步说明了组织起来的优越性。代表们都鼓足劲保证参加和领导互助组。
