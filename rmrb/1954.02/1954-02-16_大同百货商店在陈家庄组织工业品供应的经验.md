The Experience of Datong Department Store in Organizing Industrial Product Supply in Chenjiazhuang
    Liang Ziru

According to reports from various places: the money farmers receive after selling grain is primarily used for: first, purchasing means of production such as livestock, farm tools, and fertilizer to prepare for expanded reproduction; second, saving a portion in credit cooperatives or banks; and third, purchasing some daily necessities (mainly coarse cloth and cotton, followed by non-staple foods, kerosene, and cigarettes, with the least spent on general merchandise). In order to understand the actual needs of farmers and further support grain procurement and the supply of industrial products to rural areas, the state-owned Datong Department Store, under the leadership of the CPC Yanbei Prefectural Committee and the Prefectural Finance Committee, decided to organize industrial product exhibitions and sales in the countryside. Chenjiazhuang, an advanced village in Yanbei Prefecture with remarkable achievements in agricultural production cooperation, was chosen as the first pilot site.

Chenjiazhuang is sixty *li* away from Datong City and has 147 households, of which 145 have joined agricultural production cooperatives. On December 24th, the Datong Department Store sent five cadres, and the Shanxi Provincial Department Store also sent five people, carrying 270 kinds of general merchandise that the cooperative had not previously handled. They assisted the Datong City Supply and Marketing Cooperative in conducting exhibitions and sales at the Chenjiazhuang grassroots cooperative. In two and a half days, sales reached over 7.61 million yuan, accounting for more than 8.4% of the village's total grain purchase and supply value, exceeding the grassroots cooperative's total monthly merchandise sales in November by 379%. These "pilot" projects were very fruitful and yielded some valuable experience.

Main Achievements

1.  Enlightened the socialist consciousness of farmers and further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance. The farmers of Chenjiazhuang, after two years of production cooperation, have a relatively high level of political awareness. They have just studied the General Line, and the industrial products coming to the countryside served as a vivid and practical education for them. As soon as the goods were displayed, they were warmly welcomed by the majority of farmers. Wang Shiheng excitedly said, "Seeing so many industrial products makes my steps feel firmer. We must do a good job in production to support the country's industrial construction." Wang Longyuan's mother happily said, "I have lived for so many years and have never seen so many goods. We are not even in a socialist society yet, and Chenjiazhuang is about to become a little Datong!" They felt extremely satisfied that the state provided them with a wide variety of industrial products to meet their needs. Many farmers recognized the importance of mutual support and mutual development between industry and agriculture, workers and peasants.

2.  Greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of farmers, especially women. Many women in Chenjiazhuang participated in production cooperatives, were paid according to their work, and received a lot of grain. The best young female laborers received over nine *shi* of grain. Because it was too far to go to the city, more than 70% of the women had never been to the city, and the supply and marketing cooperative had very few merchandise. They wanted to wear some printed cloth and buy some cosmetics, but there was nowhere to buy them. They could not freely use the fruits of their labor. This time, the industrial products were brought to the countryside, and they were first welcomed by the young women, who rushed to the supply and marketing cooperative to select various printed cloths and daily necessities. Flower flannel, flower serge, flower twill, and even Veil cream and Butterfly cream, which the supply and marketing cooperative cadres previously thought they could not sell, became fast-selling items. Many women happily said, "As long as we have money, we can buy satisfactory goods. We must work hard in production in the future!"

3.  Expanded political influence. The farmers of Chenjiazhuang generally reflected: we live in remote rural areas, crossing ditches and rivers, and transportation is inconvenient. In the old society, we couldn't even buy homespun cloth. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, industrial products from the city are transported by car, and we can get whatever we want. The government cares too much about the farmers! They also actively promoted this to relatives and friends in the surrounding villages. Farmers and women from villages ten or twenty *li* away from Chenjiazhuang came to the Chenjiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative to buy goods. Seeing the farmers of Chenjiazhuang buying fancy clothes, fancy quilts, thermos bottles, and cosmetics, they felt the superiority of production cooperation and expressed great envy for collective production and increased income. They said, "Let's join the agricultural production cooperative next year and improve our lives too." They also pooled money to buy goods, which rapidly expanded the sales of the Chenjiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative.

4.  Strengthened the relationship between state-owned trade and cooperatives. In the past, grassroots cooperatives generally had to go through the county cooperative to purchase goods from state-owned stores. This time, the Datong County Cooperative and the department store jointly organized the promotion of industrial products in the countryside and sent personnel to participate, guiding the business of the Chenjiazhuang grassroots cooperative. This enabled the grassroots cooperative to purchase goods directly from state-owned stores, not only receiving preferential treatment and wholesale-retail price differences, accumulating funds, but also expanding their own business. After farmers bought printed cloth, they also sold out the long-stocked fine checkered cloth as lining. The actual vivid examples inspired the enthusiasm of the comrades in the supply and marketing cooperative, and also reversed their "brand name" thinking of only operating a few fast-selling popular products, their fear of trouble with the "too busy with more operating varieties" thought, and the conservative thought that "farmers have little purchasing power, and too many goods will not be sold and will cause overstocking." They began to expand their varieties and purchase large quantities of goods from state-owned department stores. They purchased more than 9 million yuan worth of goods from the Datong City Department Store in one instance and planned to continue purchasing.

Several Experiences

1.  Only when commodities meet the farmers can rural supply work be done well. Because the Chenjiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not understand the farmers' growing purchasing power and their desire to improve their lives, they believed that the masses needed few merchandise and that operating more merchandise was too troublesome. Therefore, they only operated more than 20 kinds of merchandise, with daily sales averaging only 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. However, the Datong City Department Store had expanded to more than 2,800 kinds of merchandise. Because the Datong Department Store took the initiative to contact and help the cooperative, the cooperative purchased very few goods from state-owned stores, resulting in a large backlog of industrial products in the Datong City Department Store, while rural farmers could not buy things. This time, the department store selected 270 kinds of merchandise that the cooperative had never operated and exhibited and promoted them at the Chenjiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative. In two and a half days, sales exceeded the cooperative's total monthly sales in November by 379%. This is enough to illustrate that bringing industrial products to the countryside and meeting the masses is the best way to do a good job in supplying industrial products and meeting the needs of farmers. It also confirmed that it is wrong to stockpile merchandise in the city and prevent it from meeting the farmers, so that farmers cannot buy it even if they want to, and to shout in vain that farmers need fewer merchandise.

2.  It must be valued and supported by the Party and government. This time, the promotion of industrial products in the countryside was first supported by the CPC Yanbei Prefectural Committee and the Prefectural Finance Committee. During the promotion, Director Li of the Yanbei Prefectural Commissioner's Office, the Secretary of the Datong Second District Party Committee, and the District Head personally participated and provided specific leadership. The head of the production cooperative convened meetings of Party and League members to ensure the smooth progress of the work.

3.  Good publicity and mobilization work must be done. In organizing the supply of industrial products, the Second District had transferred the opera troupe from Lizhuang to expand publicity. The salesmen were not only kind and patient in introducing the specifications, quality, and uses of the commodities, but also quickly grasped the farmers' rule of "everything looks good" and "not knowing how to spend money", and paid attention to guidance. For example, seeing adult women, they would say: "The New Year is coming soon! Buy some kelp, peppercorns, window decorations, and plum red paper!" Seeing young women, they would call them to buy printed cloth and daily necessities.

4.  The price must be appropriate. The Datong Department Store previously had a relatively large grasp of regional price differences. The goods brought to the countryside this time were re-examined and adjusted on the basis of price adjustments, so that farmers who had bought goods in the city felt that the prices of the goods in the countryside were fair and reasonable and were willing to buy goods at the supply and marketing cooperative.

Shortcomings and Problems

This time, the organization of the supply of industrial products in the countryside also exposed many shortcomings of state-owned trade:

1.  Too few goods were brought, and many commodities were sold out. For example, bagged sugar was sold out in the morning; only three samples of rock sugar weighing one catty and twelve taels were brought, and three customers bought them all. But many people still reflected: you are late, you did not come at the beginning of the purchase, and we have spent a lot of money.

2.  The understanding of farmers' needs is not enough, and the variety of operations is incomplete, and there are many shortages. There was no supply of men's and women's hats, wooden combs, fine-toothed combs, velvet hair ties, thimbles, scissors, etc., which were urgently needed by the farmers of Chenjiazhuang, but a large number of shoe polish and chemical combs used in the city were brought, and no one wanted to buy them.

    大同百货商店在陈家庄组织工业品供应的经验
    梁子儒
    根据各地反映：农民卖粮后拿到的货币，第一是购买牲畜、农具、肥料等生产资料，准备扩大再生产；第二是向信用合作社或银行储蓄一部分；第三是购买一部分生活资料（以粗布、棉花为主，副食品、煤油、纸烟等次之，百货最少）。为了摸清农民实际需要，进一步支持粮食收购，供应农村工业品，国营大同百货商店在中共雁北地委和专署财委会领导下，确定组织工业品下乡展览、推销，并先选择了雁北专区实行农业生产合作卓有成绩的先进村陈家庄为第一试点。
    陈家庄距大同市六十里，有一百四十七户人家，其中就有一百四十五户参加了农业生产合作社。十二月二十四日，由大同市百货商店派出干部五人、山西省百货公司也派五人参加，携带了合作社向不经营的百货二百七十种，帮助大同市供销社到陈家庄基层社展览、推销，两天半内销货七百六十一万多元，占该村整个购粮投放总值的百分之八点四以上，超过该基层社十一月全月百货卖钱额的百分之三百七十九。这些“试点”的收获是很大的，并取得了一些经验。
    主要收获
    一、启发了农民的社会主义觉悟，进一步巩固了工农联盟。陈家庄农民，经过两年来的生产合作，政治觉悟较高。他们刚刚学习了总路线，此次工业品的下乡，对他们是一个生动的现实教育。货物一经摆出，便得到广大农民的热烈欢迎，王世恒兴奋地说：“我看见这许多工业品，脚跟子也好像硬多了，一定要搞好生产，支援国家工业建设。”王隆元的母亲高兴地说：“我活了这么大的年纪，没有见过这样多的货，还没有到社会主义社会哩，陈家庄就要变成小大同啦！”他们对国家拿上多种多样的工业品，来供应他们的需要，感到异常满意。许多农民认识到工业与农业、工人与农民相互支援相互发展的重要意义。
    二、大大刺激了农民特别是妇女们的生产积极性。陈家庄许多妇女，参加了生产合作社，按工计酬，得到好多粮食。最好的青年劳动妇女，有分到九石多粮食的。因为进城太远，因而百分之七十以上的妇女没进过城，供销社的百货很少，想穿些花布、买些化妆品，无处可买。不能随心使用他们的劳动果实。此次工业品的下乡，首先得到青年妇女们的欢迎，纷纷到供销社选购各种各样的花布及日常用品。供销社干部以往认为卖不了的花哔叽、花线呢、花斜纹布甚至维尔肤、蝶霜等化妆品都成了快货。许多妇女愉快地说：“只要有钱就能买到满意的货物，今后可得好好生产呀！”
    三、扩大了政治影响。陈家庄的农民们普遍反映：我们住在离城很远的乡村里，翻沟过河，交通不便，在旧社会里连土布也买不到。在共产党毛主席领导下，城里的工业品都用汽车运来啦，要啥有啥，政府对农民太关心啦！他们还主动地向四外村庄的亲戚朋友们宣传。离陈家庄十里二十里的农民和妇女们，都纷纷来陈家庄供销社买货。他们看见陈家庄农民们买花衣服、花被子、热水瓶、化妆品，感到生产合作的优越性，对集体生产、收入增加表示十分羡慕。他们一面表示：咱们明年也参加农业生产合作社吧，把自己的生活也好好地改善一下。一面也凑钱买货，使陈家庄供销社卖钱额迅速扩大。
    四、密切了国营贸易和合作社的关系。过去基层社向国营商店进货，一般是要通过县社的介绍。此次大同县社和百货商店会同组织工业品下乡推销，并派员参加，指导陈家庄基层社的业务，使基层社能够放手直接向国营商店进货，不仅得到了优待和批零差价，积累了资金，而且扩大了他们自己的业务。农民购买花布后，把积压很久的细格布也当里子布卖光了。实际生动的事例，启发了供销社同志们经营的积极性，也扭转了他们只经营少数顺销的大路货的“名牌”思想、“经营的品种多了忙不过来”的怕麻烦思想，和“农民购买力不大，货多了卖不出去会造成积压”的保守思想。他们开始扩大品种，向国营百货商店大量进货。一次就向大同市百货商店买货九百多万元，还准备继续购进。
    几点经验
    一、只有商品和农民见面，才能做好农村供应工作。由于陈家庄供销社对农民购买力不断增长及改进自己生活的要求了解得不够，认为群众需要百货少，而且经营百货多了太麻烦，因而只经营了二十多种百货，每日卖钱额平均不过五万至六万元。而大同市百货商店的百货，已扩大到二千八百多种，由于大同百货商店主动联系帮助合作社差，合作社向国营商店进货很少，造成大同市百货商店工业品大量积压，乡村农民却买不到东西的现象。此次百货商店挑选了合作社从来不经营的二百七十种百货，到陈家庄供销社展览、推销，两天半卖钱额竟超过该社十一月份全月销货百分之三百七十九，足以说明工业品下乡和群众见面，是做好工业品供应与满足农民需要的最好方法；也证实了把百货积压在城市里和农民见不了面，农民想买也买不到，凭空喊叫农民需要百货少是错误的。
    二、必须得到党政的重视和支持。此次工业品下乡推销，首先得到中共雁北地委和专署财委会的支持。在推销中，雁北专署李科长、大同二区区委书记和区长都一直亲自参加、具体领导，生产合作社长召集党、团员开会，使工作能顺利地进行。
    三、要作好宣传鼓动工作。在组织工业品供应工作中，二区曾调来李庄上的剧团，扩大宣传。销货员们不但态度和霭，能耐心介绍商品的规格、质量、用途，而且很快掌握了农民“看见啥也好”“拿上钱不会花”的规律，注意指导。如看见成年妇女便说：“快过年啦！买些海带、花椒、窗花、梅红纸吧！”看见青年妇女们便招呼她们购买花布和日用品。
    四、价格要适当。大同百货商店以往对地区差价掌握偏大。此次下乡的商品是在调价基础上，重行作了审查调整，使进城买过货的农民感到下乡的商品价格公道合理，愿在供销社买货。
    缺点与问题
    此次下乡组织工业品供应工作中，也暴露了国营贸易的许多缺点：
    一、带货较少，脱销的商品很多。如袋糖一早晨就卖光；冰糖只带了一斤十二两重的三块样品，三个主顾就买完了。但许多群众仍反映：你们来迟了，开始收购你们不来，我们把许多钱花了。
    二、平时对农民需要了解不够，经营品种不全，缺货很多。对陈家庄农民迫切需要的男女帽子、木梳、篦梳、绒头绳、顶针、剪子等没有供应，而带去了大批皮鞋油，城市用的化学梳子，结果没有人要买。
