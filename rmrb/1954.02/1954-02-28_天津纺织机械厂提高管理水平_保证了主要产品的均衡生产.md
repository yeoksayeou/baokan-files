Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory Improves Management, Ensures Balanced Production of Main Products

The state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory has gradually improved its production management level. Its main product, the roving frame, has achieved balanced production, with one unit produced every six hours.

The roving frame has over eight hundred and sixty types of parts, requiring more than two thousand processes to manufacture. When the factory initially began producing roving frames, the assembly was often affected by the untimely or incomplete supply of a small number of parts, resulting in a fluctuating production pace. To ensure balanced production in 1954, the factory began preparing assembly standard plans in the preparatory work this year, stipulating that one machine should be assembled every six hours. Each group in the workshop created their work plans based on the standard plan. The resulting work plans improved the connection between groups and within each group's various processes, essentially organizing the entire workshop's production in the form of an assembly line. Moreover, with the standard plan in place, there were specific requirements for workshops supplying semi-finished products, making it easier to detect shortages in parts supply.

When the assembly workshop began organizing production according to the standard plan in January, the workshop's trade union organization and all the workers in the workshop studied and discussed it. The workers pledged to implement the standard plan through competition. Problems encountered during the execution of the standard plan were promptly resolved through production meetings. For example, the painting group's procedures were disorganized and not closely linked to the assembly group's procedures. The production meeting studied and changed the procedures according to the assembly sequence, painting the parts to be assembled first, which ensured the supply.

Since January 20th, production according to the standard plan has been fully on track, with each group able to complete its plan on time, producing one roving frame every six hours.

    天津纺织机械厂提高管理水平
    保证了主要产品的均衡生产
    国营天津纺织机械厂生产管理水平逐步提高，主要产品粗纱机已能做到均衡生产，每六小时可生产一台。
    粗纱机有八百六十余种零件，需要经过二千余道工序才能制成。该厂在开始生产粗纱机时，经常因为少数零件供应不及时、不成套而影响装配，以致形成生产中的前松后紧现象。为了保证在一九五四年度做好均衡生产，该厂在今年生产准备工作中，即着手编制装配车间的装配标准计划，规定每六小时装出一台机器。车间内各小组都以标准计划为依据，来编制作业计划。这样编制出的作业计划，使小组与小组之间的生产更加衔接，小组内部各工序也相互衔接，这样便把全车间的生产基本上按流水作业线的形式组织起来了。而且在有了标准计划之后，对供应半成品的车间也就有了具体的要求，配件供应不足的现象立即可以发现。
    今年一月份开始按标准计划组织装配车间生产时，车间工会组织及全车间工人都进行了学习与讨论，工人们都保证通过竞赛来切实贯彻标准计划。在执行标准计划时所发生的问题，也及时通过生产会议予以解决。例如油漆小组的工序比较混乱，而且与装车小组的工序不能紧密衔接，在生产会议上便研究根据装车程序改变了工序，先装车的零件先油漆，便保证了供应。
    从一月二十日开始，按标准计划生产已完全走上了正轨，各小组都能按时完成计划，每六小时可以生产一台粗纱机。
