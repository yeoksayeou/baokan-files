Zhang Wentian, our country's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, who is now in Beijing, was also invited to attend the reception.

Military attachés of various countries' embassies in China were also invited to attend the reception.

At the reception, Colonel Fomin delivered a speech. He said: The great Chinese people, the people of the countries in the democratic and socialist camp, and the people of Europe and Asia who have experienced the fear and pain of the last war are celebrating this historically significant day with heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union, to the liberator - the Soviet Army. All progressive mankind regards the Soviet state and its army as a powerful bastion of peace, freedom, and independence for all peoples. The Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union, which are unswervingly fighting for world peace, consider it their sacred duty to do their best to consolidate and strengthen the defense of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people and their armed forces are always prepared to repulse any aggressor who attempts to hinder our victorious advance along the road to communism.

Vice Chairman Zhu De first extended warm congratulations to the heroic Soviet Army on behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong. He said: "The heroic Soviet Army is the protector of the peaceful and happy life of the Soviet people, and also the maintainer of the peaceful and free life of the people of all countries. The powerful and invincible Soviet Army, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union, has given hope and strength to all peace-loving and independent people in the world.

The Soviet Army is a powerful pillar of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies. The Soviet government has consistently implemented the peaceful policies of Lenin and Stalin, and has steadfastly striven to consolidate world peace and international cooperation.

At the recent Berlin Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet government made another major effort to seek solutions to some pressing international issues through consultations among major powers, in order to further ease international tensions. Thanks to this effort by the Soviet government, the Berlin Conference finally reached an agreement on convening the Geneva Conference to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina. The Chinese people express their full support for this agreement and are willing to unite more closely with the Soviet people, the Korean people, the Vietnamese people, and all peace-loving people in Asia and around the world, to strive for the success of the Geneva Conference and seek solutions to the urgent international problems in the Far East!

The Soviet Army is a glorious example and close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will forever stand with the Soviet Army, gloriously and valiantly fulfilling the sacred mission of defending peace in the Far East and the world.

Under the wise call of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is learning with great enthusiasm the patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet Army, learning the advanced military science and advanced military experience of the Soviet Union, and learning the high degree of discipline and revolutionary vigilance of the Soviet Army, to ensure further strengthening of our country's military strength, accelerating the modernization of our national defense capabilities, and consolidating the national defense security of our great motherland. All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army regard ensuring the success of this study as the most important task at present."

The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. During the reception, the hosts and guests frequently toasted the friendship between the peoples and armies of China and the Soviet Union, the health of the great leader of the Chinese people, the creator and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the health of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Malenkov.

    应邀出席酒会的还有各国驻华使馆的武官。
    会上，富敏科上校致词。他说：伟大的中国人民、民主与社会主义阵营的各国人民以及饱经上次大战恐惧与痛苦的欧洲和亚洲的各国人民，都怀着对苏联、对解放者——苏联军队的衷心感激的心情，来庆祝这一有历史意义的日子。一切进步的人类，都把苏维埃国家及其军队看作是各国人民和平、自由与独立的强大堡垒。不屈不挠地为争取世界和平而斗争的苏联共产党和苏联政府，把尽力巩固和加强苏联国防认为是自己神圣的天职。苏联人民及其武装力量，时刻在准备给予企图阻碍我们沿着共产主义道路胜利前进的任何侵略者以反击。
      朱德副主席在致词中首先代表中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席向英勇的苏联军队表示热烈的祝贺。他说：“英勇的苏联军队是苏联人民和平幸福生活的保卫者，也是各国人民和平自由生活的维护者。在苏联共产党和苏联政府的英明领导下的强大无敌的苏联军队，使全世界爱好和平和自由独立的人民获得了希望和力量。

    在最近召开的柏林四国外长会议上，苏联政府又作了重大的努力，来争取经过大国协商谋求一些迫切的国际问题的解决，以便进一步缓和国际紧张局势。由于苏联政府的这一努力，柏林会议终于取得了关于召开日内瓦会议、讨论和平解决朝鲜问题和恢复印度支那和平问题的协议。中国人民对于这一协议表示完全的支持，并愿与苏联人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民、以及亚洲和全世界所有爱好和平的人民，更加紧密地团结一致，为争取开好日内瓦会议、谋求远东迫切的国际问题的解决而奋斗！
    苏联军队是中国人民解放军的光辉榜样和亲密战友。中国人民解放军将永远与苏联军队站在一道，光荣地英勇地执行着保卫远东和世界和平的神圣使命。
    在毛泽东主席的英明号召之下，中国人民解放军正以高度的热情，认真地学习苏联军队的爱国主义和国际主义精神，学习苏联的先进军事科学和先进军事经验，学习苏联军队的高度的纪律性和革命警惕性，来保证更进一步加强我国的军事力量，加速我国国防力量的现代化，巩固我们伟大祖国的国防安全。中国人民解放军全军将士都把保证这个学习的成功认作是当前最重大的任务。”
    酒会在热烈友好的空气中进行。席间，宾主频频为中苏两国人民和两国军队的友谊，为中国人民的伟大领袖、中国人民解放军的创造者和领导者毛泽东主席的健康，为苏联部长会议主席马林科夫的健康而干杯。
