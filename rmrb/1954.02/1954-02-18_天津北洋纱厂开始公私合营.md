The brilliance of the General Line illuminates the private Tianjin Beiyang Textile Factory. This capitalist enterprise, possessing over 30,000 spindles and with a history of more than thirty years, officially implemented joint public-private operation on February 11th. From now on, under the direct leadership of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Local State-Operated Industry Bureau, this old enterprise will not only be reborn through further socialist transformation, but its production will also be directly incorporated into the national economic plan, allowing its existing land, factory buildings, equipment, and manpower to fully exert their effectiveness. It will gradually meet the yarn demands of the developing state-owned and private knitting industries in Tianjin, from quantity to quality, and from increasing variety to reducing costs. It is expected that in two years, its scale will reach approximately twice its current size through gradual reconstruction and expansion on the basis of the old enterprise. In 1954, a series of technical measures will be adopted to change working conditions and increase the output of existing equipment by about 7%.

At the announcement of the implementation of joint public-private operation, the state appointed Li Xianyuan, the first deputy director, to participate in leadership and management, and appointed the original factory director (capitalist representative) Zhu Mengsu as the director. The original two deputy directors (both capitalist representatives) remained in their original positions. All existing staff at all levels, with the exception of leadership positions held by a few controlled elements which will be adjusted, will remain in the factory and be used according to their abilities, with most remaining in their original positions. The state has only dispatched a small number of cadres to participate in various management tasks.

The news of the implementation of joint public-private operation brought great excitement and encouragement to the workers of the Beiyang Textile Factory. As early as during the preparation for joint operation, the workers frequently inquired about the date of the official joint operation and put forward the slogan "Do a good job in the increase production and practice economy campaign to welcome the joint public-private operation," which added new impetus to the increase production and practice economy movement in the fourth quarter of last year. More than fifty workers who are currently installing the 8,800 new spindles invested by the state are even more excited. They enthusiastically and conscientiously formulated an installation plan. Despite difficulties such as a lack of technical proficiency, a shortage of experienced technicians, and an insufficient supply of tools, they are working hard to overcome these difficulties and are increasing the installation speed day by day. For example, the fine spinning machine installation team used more than 100 work hours per machine when installing the first two machines, but thanks to their careful study and the unity of masters and apprentices, they now only use more than 60 work hours per machine, ensuring the completion of the plan.

The factory underwent more than four months of preparatory work before the implementation of joint public-private operation. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Local State-Operated Industry Bureau and the Beiyang Textile Factory jointly formed a preparatory committee for joint public-private operation (hereinafter referred to as the Preparatory Committee) and signed a temporary joint operation agreement. Under the leadership of the Preparatory Committee, the inventory and valuation of both parties' assets have been basically completed in the past four months, the factory's production and equipment situation has been studied, the operating principles after joint operation and the reconstruction and expansion plans have been drafted, and a technical measures plan for improving production in 1954 has been formulated. In addition, in order to put the state's equipment into production as soon as possible, the Preparatory Committee also approved an agreement to start installing 8,800 spindles in advance from December of last year before the official joint public-private operation, and the installation work will be basically completed by the end of March.

In order to carry out the above preparatory work, specialized groups were established under the Preparatory Committee. The inventory and valuation work and the planning work were respectively led by the original two deputy directors of the Beiyang Textile Factory, with personnel dispatched by the Local Industry Bureau participating in the assistance. In various preparatory work, the staff of both the public and private parties were able to fully consult and jointly study. Each task was first drafted into a plan and then implemented after being approved by the Preparatory Committee. Therefore, the rights and interests of both parties were mutually respected, the preparatory work was able to proceed smoothly, and a good foundation was laid for the coordination of the relationship between the public and private parties after the joint operation. The original director and deputy directors of the Beiyang Textile Factory expressed deep satisfaction with the joint operation preparation work. They expressed "sincere pleasure" when accepting the state's appointment, and proposed to conscientiously accept the leadership of the socialist economy, work hard to learn, and strive to accelerate their own transformation.

The private Beiyang Textile Factory was established in 1920 by the Northern Warlords and private merchants with a joint investment, totaling more than 25,000 spindles. In 1936, the property rights were sold to the Chengfu Company shareholders, Jin Cheng Bank and Zhongnan Bank, and Zhu Mengsu was the capitalist representative in charge of the factory. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders controlled cotton yarn, and the factory only operated more than 3,000 spindles. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Kuomintang sent a large number of special agents into the factory and organized a puppet trade union. The workers were subjected to brutal rule, and production was extremely chaotic. In the early days of liberation, after the establishment of a trade union, the removal of special agents, and the development of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League organizations, the workers' awareness gradually increased, and production gradually improved. In March 1950, the factory established a processing relationship with the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. Since then, after various social and political movements, labor-capital consultation meetings were established in the factory, and production gradually increased year by year, and business gradually turned from loss to profit. However, the old and dilapidated equipment, the lack of planning and scientific management systems, and the low labor productivity are still serious problems in the factory's development. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Local State-Operated Industry Bureau invests and dispatches cadres to participate in management and jointly operate with it, which will fundamentally change the face of this ancient factory.

### 天津北洋纱厂开始公私合营

    天津北洋纱厂开始公私合营
    总路线的光芒照亮了私营天津北洋纱厂。这个拥有三万多纱锭、已有三十多年历史的资本主义企业，在二月十一日正式实行公私合营了。今后，在天津市人民政府地方国营工业局直接领导下，这个老旧的企业不仅将因进一步接受社会主义改造获得新生，而且，它的生产将直接纳入国家经济计划之内，使现有的厂地、厂房、设备和人力充分地发挥它的效用；它将从数量到质量，从品种增加到成本的降低各方面，逐步满足正在发展中的天津市国营和私营针织业用纱的需求。预期两年之后，它的规模在旧企业的基础上经过逐步的改建和扩建，约可达到今天的两倍。一九五四年将采取一系列的技术措施，改变劳动条件，使原有设备增加产量百分之七左右。
    在宣布实行公私合营时，国家委派了第一副厂长李先元参加领导管理工作，并委任原厂长（资方代理人）朱梦苏为正厂长，原有两副厂长（均为资方代理人）仍留任原职。原有各级职员，除个别的被管制分子的领导职务将有所调动外，一律留厂工作，量材使用，大部分仍留任原职。国家只派了少数干部参加各种管理工作。
    实行公私合营的消息，给北洋纱厂职工带来了极大的兴奋和鼓舞。早在筹备合营期间，工人们就频频打听正式合营的时日，并且提出了“搞好增产节约竞赛，迎接公私合营”的口号，使去年第四季度的增产节约运动增加了新的动力，现在正在安装国家投资的八千八百新锭子的五十余个工人更是兴高采烈。他们热情又认真地制订了安装计划。在技术不熟练、老技术工人很缺乏，又兼工具供应不足的困难情况下，他们正在努力克服困难，逐日地提高安装速度。例如安装细纱机小组，在开始安装第一二台时，每台用一百多个工，但由于他们悉心学习，师徒团结，现在每台只用六十多个工，保证了计划的完成。
    该厂在实行公私合营以前，经过了四个多月的筹备工作。天津市人民政府地方国营工业局和北洋纱厂双方共同组成了公私合营筹备委员会（以下简称筹委会），并签定了合营临时协议书。在筹委会领导下，四个多月来已基本上结束了双方财产的清点估价，研究了该厂生产及设备情况，拟定了合营后的经营方针，改建及扩建计划，同时又制订了一九五四年改进生产的技术措施计划。此外，为了使国家的设备早日投入生产，筹委会又通过了在正式公私合营之前从去年十二月开始先行安装八千八百纱锭的协议，并将在三月底基本完成安装工作。
    为了进行上述各项筹备工作，在筹委会下设立了专门的小组。清估工作及计划工作分别由原北洋纱厂两个副厂长负责领导进行，由地方工业局派员参加协助。在各项筹备工作中，公私双方工作人员均能充分协商、共同研究、每件工作都是先拟出方案，经筹委会批准后执行，因而双方权益都获得互相尊重，筹备工作得以顺利进行，并为合营后公私双方关系的协调，打下了良好的基础。原北洋纱厂的正副厂长对合营筹备工作，深表满意。他们在接受国家委任时表示：“衷心愉快”，并提出要认真接受社会主义经济领导，努力学习，争取加快地改造自己。
    私营北洋纱厂于一九二○年由北洋军阀与私商合资建立，共二万五千余纱锭。一九三六年产权转卖给诚孚公司股东金城银行、中南银行，由朱梦苏为资方代理人管理工厂。抗日战争时期，日寇统制棉纱，该厂只开纱锭三千余。日寇投降后，国民党派大批特务分子入厂并组织伪工会，工人遭到残暴统治，生产异常混乱。解放初期，经过建立工会，清除特务分子，发展中国共产党及青年团组织，工人觉悟逐渐提高，生产才渐有起色。一九五○年三月，该厂和中国花纱布公司建立了加工关系，此后，经过了各种社会、政治运动，厂内建立了劳资协商会议，生产乃逐年上升，经营也渐由亏累转为有利。但，设备老旧失修，管理缺乏计划及科学制度，劳动生产率低，仍是该厂发展中的严重问题。天津市人民政府地方国营工业局投资并派干部参加管理，与之合营，将从根本上改变这个古老工厂的面貌。（汪溪）（附图片）
