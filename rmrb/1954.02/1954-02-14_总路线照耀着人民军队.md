    The General Line Illuminates the People's Army
    "For Socialism"
    After our company studied the general line, everyone saw the future more clearly. I often close my eyes and think, and it's as if I see countless factories smoking, the tractors of collective farms rumbling, and golden grains of rice piled up like mountains.... Whenever I think of this, I am full of energy and feel even more glorious and important in my responsibility.

    Recently, our company built a new drill ground. Everyone's energy was so great, it seemed like they could move mountains. Regardless of wind or rain, regardless of how many blisters formed on their hands, they persisted in their work. Comrade Wen Bao'yi of the communications platoon had a swollen shoulder and several blisters on his hands. The squad leader told him to rest, but he said, "Look, how can I rest? This is for socialism!"

    The mood of the cooks also improved with the study of the general line. No one said that being a cook had no future anymore. They all realized that doing a good job of cooking and ensuring the health of the comrades, and practicing their skills well, was adding a point of strength to socialist construction. (Wu Liangfang)

    "It is Our Glory and Our Responsibility"

    The subscription for public bonds began, and the emotions of all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain place immediately boiled over. As soon as the news of the start of registration was announced by the accelerated middle school of a certain unit, the four registration tables were surrounded, and everyone wanted to write their names at the very front. In less than two hours, one hundred and eighty-six people had subscribed for 38.74 million yuan. A certain unit immediately convened a mobilization meeting of cadres above the platoon level. At the meeting, comrades signed up for subscriptions on the spot, and the subscription figure exceeded the predetermined number by 68.8 percent.

    Yao Mingchun, a platoon leader of the Second Company of a certain unit, subscribed for 2 million yuan all at once. Others advised him to buy less, but he said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I have this much money in the bank, so I should buy it all. If the country has one more yuan, it can do more things for the people!" Comrade Wu Yunfeng also used all 3 million yuan he had accumulated over more than two years to buy public bonds. When Comrade Chen Chumei joined the army, his father gave him a gold ring as a souvenir. He usually treated it like a treasure, but this time he took it out to buy public bonds. Some comrades said: The motherland is transitioning to socialism, and if we buy one more yuan's worth of public bonds, we can add one more brick and tile to socialist construction. This is our glory and our responsibility!

    Mobilizing the Whole Village to Sell Surplus Grain to the State

    A few days ago, Jing Zhang, a comrade from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, took leave to go home. At that time, the village was purchasing surplus grain, but many people still had concerns and were unwilling to sell all their surplus grain to the state. Jing Zhang immediately felt the responsibility of a revolutionary fighter, so he first mobilized his own family to sell grain. His family originally had 150 jin of surplus grain that could be sold to the state, but his mother was afraid that if it was sold, they would starve if they encountered a disaster, and she was unwilling to sell. So, Jing Zhang patiently explained the state's grain policy to his mother. His mother was already overjoyed to see her son growing up white and strong; now she saw that her son had learned skills and that the reasoning he spoke was correct, she was even happier, and immediately sold the 150 jin of surplus grain to the state. The next day, Jing Zhang also mobilized his sister to sell 200 jin of surplus grain.

    Day and night, Jing Zhang helped the township government cadres to publicize to the masses, telling the story of the volunteer army's battles, the victorious situation in Korea, the industrial construction in various places, and the general line of the country in the transition period, especially vividly telling the benefits of national industrialization for farmers. The masses quickly understood that selling surplus grain to the state was supporting the construction of the country, and it was also for their own happy life; at the same time, they saw that Jing Zhang's mother and sister had already sold surplus grain, and their concerns were gradually dispelled. As a result, in less than three days, 500 households in the whole village sold 30,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    At the meeting in the village celebrating the completion of the surplus grain purchase plan, the Party's township branch secretary, on behalf of the villagers, hung a big red flower on Jing Zhang's chest, thanking him for his help. (Geng Zhanxiong, Cao Jiguang, Lu Ping)

    Changed Mom's "Old Brain"

    After studying the general line, the soldiers wrote letters home, which not only enabled their families to sell surplus grain to the state and promoted the government's grain purchase work, but also enabled their family members to receive socialist education and improve their awareness. The mother of Ning Zhaoqing, a soldier from the Fourth Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in a certain place, used to write letters saying that the family was in difficulty and asking Ning Zhaoqing to ask for leave to go home. At that time, Ning Zhaoqing was only dissatisfied with his mother's backwardness in his heart, but he did not have sufficient reasons to persuade his mother. After studying the general line, Ning Zhaoqing wrote a very long letter to his mother, explaining to her in detail the general line of the country and the prospect of a happy socialist life. Recently, Ning Zhaoqing received a letter from his mother like this: "Zhaoqing, my son: I received your letter. Just like you said, the cadres in our township are also busy publicizing the general line. A few days ago, the township government also led us to visit the county farm's tractor farming. I had never seen that thing before! Smoke was coming out of the back, and it was rumbling and running on the ground. Before I could spin a handful of cotton, a large piece of land was plowed. The people watching were really surprised and happy! After the visit, the township cadres also said a lot, saying that the Soviet Union is already using 'iron cattle' to cultivate the land, and their lives are very happy! If we want to live a good life, we must follow the Soviet path. I was really happy from the bottom of my heart! Now I received your letter, which completely turned my 'old brain' around. So I immediately signed up to join the cooperative. I hope you study hard, practice your skills well, and protect the construction of our country well." Ning Zhaoqing was very moved after reading the letter and said to himself, "Mom, I will definitely do what you said." (Xi Wen)

    总路线照耀着人民军队
    “为了社会主义”
    我们这个连学习了总路线以后，大家都更清楚地看到了明天。我常常闭上眼睛一寻思，就好像看见了无数的工厂在冒烟、集体农庄的拖拉机在轰隆隆的转动、金黄的稻粒堆得像山一样……。一想到这儿，浑身是劲，越觉得自己责任的光荣和重大了。
    最近，我们连新建操场，大家那股劲真是大，看去连山也能搬动，不管刮风下雨，也不管手上磨出多少血泡，都在坚持着干。通讯排的文保义同志肩膊压肿了，手上打了几个泡，班长让他休息，他说：“你看，那能休息呢？这是为了社会主义啊！”
    炊事班同志们的情绪也跟着总路线的学习而提高了，谁也不说干炊事员没前途的话了，都认识到做好饭菜，保证同志们的健康，练好本领，就是给社会主义建设增加了一分力量。（吴良芳）
    “是我们的光荣，也是我们的责任”
    认购公债开始了，驻在某地的人民解放军全体指战员的情绪立刻沸腾起来。某部速成中学刚一宣布开始登记的消息，四个登记桌子就被包围起来，大家都想把自己的名字写在最前面。不到两小时，一百八十六人，就认购了三千八百七十四万元。某部马上召开了排以上干部的动员大会，会上，同志们都当场报名认购，认购数字超过了预定数的百分之六十八点八。
    姚明春，是某部二连的一个排长，一下子就认购了二百万元。别人劝他少购一点，他说：“我是共产党员，在银行里就存了这么多钱，应该全部购买。国家多一分钱，就能给人民多办一点事！”吴云峰同志也把两年多积累下来的三百万元全部购买了公债。陈楚美同志在参军的时候，他爹送给他一枚金戒子做纪念，平时他把它像宝贝一样地看待，这次也拿出来买公债了。有些同志说：祖国正向社会主义过渡，我们多买一个钱的公债，就能为社会主义建设多添一砖一瓦。这是我们的光荣，也是我们的责任！
    动员全村把余粮卖给国家
    前些天，人民解放军某部荆章同志请假回家了。当时村里正在收购余粮，但有不少群众，还有顾虑，不肯把余粮全部卖给国家，荆章马上感到一个革命战士的责任，于是他就首先动员自己家中卖粮。他家本来有一百五十斤余粮可以卖给国家，就是他母亲怕卖掉了以后，再遇到灾荒就要挨饿，不愿意卖。于是，荆章就耐心地向母亲解释国家的粮食政策。母亲本来看到儿子长得又白又壮，已经满心欢喜了；现在又看儿子长了本领，讲的道理挺对，更加高兴了，马上把一百五十斤余粮卖给了国家。第二天，荆章又动员他姐姐也卖了二百斤余粮。
    荆章白天黑夜帮助乡政府干部向群众宣传，讲志愿军的战斗故事，讲朝鲜的胜利局面，讲各地的工业建设，讲国家在过渡时期的总路线，特别生动地讲了国家工业化对农民的好处。群众很快都明白了把余粮卖给国家就是支援国家的建设，也就是为了自己的幸福生活；同时，他们又看到了荆章的母亲和姐姐已经卖了余粮，他们存在的顾虑就逐渐被打消了。结果，不出三天，全村就有五百户人家，把三万斤余粮卖给了国家。
    在村里庆祝收购余粮计划完成的大会上，党的乡支部书记代表乡亲们，把一朵大红花挂在荆章的胸前，感谢他的帮助。（耿占雄、曹继光、陆平）
    改变了妈妈的“老脑筋”
    战士们在学习了总路线以后给家里写信，不仅使家里把余粮卖给了国家，推动了政府的购粮工作，而且使自己的家属受到了社会主义教育，提高了觉悟。驻守某地的人民解放军某团四连战士宁兆清的母亲，过去常写信说家里困难，要宁兆清请假回家。那时，宁兆清只从心里不满意母亲的落后，但也没有充足的理由来说服母亲。学习了总路线以后，宁兆清给母亲写了一封很长很长的信，他详细地向母亲说明了国家的总路线，说明了社会主义幸福生活的远景。最近宁兆清接到了母亲一封这样的信：“兆清儿：你来的信，妈收到了，跟你说的一样，咱乡里干部们也忙着宣传总路线哩，前些日子乡政府还领着我们参观了县农场的拖拉机耕地，妈从前可没见过那物件啊！屁股后头冒着烟，唿隆唿隆地在地上跑，才有妈纺个穗子的功夫，一大块地就耕完了，看的人真是又惊又喜啊！参观过后，乡干部们还讲了好多话，说是苏联已经全用‘铁牛’耕
  地了，他们的生活可幸福哩！咱们要过好日子，也得照着苏联的道走。妈听了真是从心里往外乐呀！这回又接到你来的信，使妈的‘老脑筋’完全转过来了。所以我就立时报名参加了合作社。望儿好好学习，练好本领，好好保卫咱们国家的建设。”宁兆清看了信非常感动地自言自语地说：“妈妈，我一定按着你说的做。”（西文）
