The herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province are actively developing animal husbandry to support industrial and agricultural production with large quantities of livestock, hides, and other animal products. As of last November, the pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia had supplied industrial production with more than 5.62 million catties of cashmere and wool, and more than 550,000 pieces of cattle and sheep hides. Last year, the pastoral areas of Suiyuan Province also supplied 880,000 catties of wool to wool textile industries such as the Suiyuan Woolen Mill and the Qinghe Woolen Mill through supply and marketing cooperatives. Particularly when the cold winter arrived, the pastoral areas of Suiyuan Province provided more than 20,000 sheepskins to make cold-proof leather clothing for workers in the province's mining areas, enabling them to engage in industrial production and construction with full enthusiasm. In terms of supporting agricultural production, the herdsmen in various places have also made great contributions. Taking the eastern region of Inner Mongolia as an example, the pastoral areas supplied the rural areas with 3,841 horses, 4,400 cattle, and 30,000 ewes (including a small number of breeding sheep) through the cooperative system alone. Thanks to the strong support of animal husbandry for agriculture, the areas that lacked livestock in the past have increased their draught animals. For example, farmers in the second district of Baochang County had less than one draught animal for every five households on average in 1949, but by last November, two households had a pair of oxen. The increase in draught animals directly helped farmers carry out intensive cultivation and improve grain yields. In 1949, farmers in the third district of Duolun County rarely harrowed, rolled, or carried out autumn plowing due to a lack of draught animals, but by the spring of 1952, harrowing and rolling accounted for 80 percent of the cultivated area, and autumn plowing accounted for 85 percent. As a result, the yield increased from 2 dou per mu in 1950 to 3 dou and 2 sheng per mu in 1952.

	The development of animal husbandry in the Mongolian and Suiyuan regions is closely related to the support and assistance of industrial and agricultural products. For example, last year the eastern region of Inner Mongolia supplied more than 48,000 pieces of soybean cake (50 catties per piece) to four pastoral banners such as Chen Barag Banner of Hulunbuir League as livestock feed to help herdsmen protect their livestock through the winter. It also supplied the pastoral areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas with 220 hay cutters and rakes, 50 waterwheels, and a large number of daily necessities. For example, Taibus Banner in Chahar League imports more than 500,000 catties of grain from agricultural areas every year, so that the situation of slaughtering 3,700 livestock every year before liberation has changed to only eating 600 heads last year. Due to the reduction in livestock consumption, the number of livestock in the banner has increased from more than 10,000 in 1949 to more than 32,000 last year.

    蒙绥牧民积极发展畜牧业支持工农业生产
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省各地牧民积极发展畜牧业，以大量的牲畜、皮毛等畜产品支援工农业生产。截至去年十一月为止，内蒙古各地牧区供给工业生产上需要的羊绒羊毛五百六十二万多斤，牛羊等各种畜皮五十五万多张。去年一年，绥远省各地牧区也通过供销合作社供给绥远毛织厂、清河制呢厂等毛织工业生产部门八十八万多斤羊毛。特别是当寒冬到来的时候，绥远省各地牧区又拿出二万来张羊皮供应省内矿区职工制做防寒皮衣，使工人们情绪饱满地从事工业生产建设。在支援农业生产方面，各地牧民也献出了很大力量。如以内蒙古东部地区为例，牧区仅由合作社系统供应给农村的耕畜即有马三千八百四十一匹、牛四千四百头，另外还有三万只母羊（包括少数种羊）。由于牧业对农业的大力支援，过去缺乏牲畜的地方已增加了耕畜。如宝昌县二区农民在一九四九年平均五户还不到一头耕畜，到去年十一月间两户就有了一付牛犋。耕畜的增加，就直接帮助了农民进行精耕细作，提高了粮食产量。多伦县三区在一九四九年，由于缺乏耕畜农民很少耙地、耱地和进行秋翻地，但到一九五二年春季耙耱地已占耕地面积的百分之八十，秋翻地已占百分之八十五。因此，从一九五零年每亩产二斗粮，提高到一九五二年每亩产三斗二升粮。
    蒙绥地区畜牧业能够发展，和工农业产品的支持、帮助有很大关系。如去年内蒙古东部区曾以四万八千多块豆饼（每块五十斤）供应给呼纳盟陈巴尔虎等四个牧业旗充作牲畜饲料，帮助牧民保畜过冬。又以二百二十台打草机、搂草机，五十台水车，以及大量生活必需品供应了牧区和半农半牧区。又如察哈尔盟太仆寺左旗每年从农业区输入五十多万斤粮食，使解放前每年宰食三千七百多头牲畜的情况，到去年已变为仅吃六百头。因为牲畜消耗的减少，该旗牲畜的数目，已从一九四九年的一万多头发展到去年的三万二千多头。
