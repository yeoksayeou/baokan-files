Workers building the Hanshui Railway Bridge are striving to accelerate the project's progress, aiming to complete the underwater foundation work before the flood season. They persisted in working during the Spring Festival and achieved new victories.

    On the eve of the Spring Festival, the workers of Liu Deqing's team, on the freezing river surface, amidst the sounds of firecrackers celebrating the Spring Festival by the surrounding masses, worked from night until dawn, completing the driving of the forty-ninth vertical pile for the No. 5 pier. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the Spring Festival, the workers of Chen Yunsheng's team completed the fiftieth vertical pile driving. Following this, they began the driving of the inclined piles for the No. 5 pier.

    The workers of Kuang Yongfu's team victoriously completed the pile driving for the No. 4 pier on New Year's Eve. On the evening of the second day of the Spring Festival, they began blasting the remaining underwater pipe piles and will soon proceed with the cofferdam sealing work to begin underwater construction. The No. 6 pier also successfully commenced construction during the Spring Festival. The No. 3 pier has also completed all preparations during the Spring Festival and is about to begin pile driving.

    The workers of the carpentry work area completed one hundred and thirty cofferdam extension columns during the Spring Festival, and also completed the reinforcement of the iron barge and the erection of the first section of the model panel for the Hankou shore abutment. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the seven workers of Zhang Qinghua's team created the highest record since the commencement of the wooden caisson, with a figure of 5.115 square meters. The rebar team saved manpower and improved work efficiency during the Spring Festival by having three people do the work of five. The workers in the concrete work area are pouring the foundation of the No. 1 pier. On New Year's Eve, they launched a labor competition and completed the pouring of 102 cubic meters of concrete two hours ahead of schedule according to plan.

    During the Spring Festival, the Wuhan city's people's concern and support for the Hanshui Railway Bridge construction site greatly encouraged the confidence of the workers. The Wuhan city leaders, headed by Wang Renzhong, the First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Wuhan City Labor Model Delegation, representing the people of the city, visited the construction site on the day before New Year's Eve. The Wuhan Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee sent a letter to express greetings to all the workers at the construction site during the Spring Festival. From New Year's Eve to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, various units, workers, peasants, students, and various literary and art troupes in Wuhan city went to the construction site to perform consolation performances and celebrate with the workers. Liu Zuo, a carpenter who is building the Hanshui Railway Bridge, said: "This year was more enjoyable than any other year. The construction site staged plays for seven days, and I went to every performance. I ate, had fun, and did my job. How could I not be happy!" Now, all the workers at the construction site have launched a more intense labor competition to thank the Wuhan people for their care and concern.
