Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary and other countries achieved great success in all aspects of the national economy in 1953.

According to the communiques recently published by these countries on the results of the implementation of the 1953 national economic plan, Poland's total industrial output plan was completed by 103.9%, and the total output of socialist industry increased by 17.5% compared with 1952; Czechoslovakia's total industrial output increased by 10% compared with 1952, of which the Slovak region increased by 14%; Bulgaria's total industrial output plan was completed by 100.6%, and the output increased by 12% compared with 1952; Hungary's revised total industrial output plan was completed by 101.3%, and the output increased by 11.8% compared with 1952. The heavy industry sectors of these countries, especially the machinery manufacturing industry, have been further developed. For example, in 1953, the Bulgarian machinery manufacturing and electrical machinery manufacturing industries mastered the manufacturing methods of 371 new machines. Poland's machinery manufacturing industry started large-scale production of about 100 new machines and equipment last year. These countries also achieved great success in capital construction last year. Czechoslovakia put into production two open-hearth furnaces, four electric furnaces and many other industrial equipment last year. In Poland, two huge blast furnaces and an open-hearth furnace, two modern coal mines and many other enterprises began production last year. In 1953, the labor productivity in Czechoslovakia's industry as a whole increased by 7% compared with 1952. According to preliminary statistics, the labor productivity in Poland's industry last year increased by 10.6% compared with 1952, and the production cost was reduced by about 5.5%.

All countries also made remarkable achievements in developing agriculture in 1953. The socialist part of agriculture has been further developed. The number of agricultural production cooperatives in Poland has increased from 4,900 in 1952 to more than 8,000 by the end of 1953. The grain harvest of the cooperatives was 15% to 20% more than that of individual farmers. The socialist part of the grain obtained by Czechoslovakia has increased from 30% in 1952 to 51% in 1953. The degree of mechanization of agricultural production has also been greatly improved. In 1953, Poland established 76 new machine tractor stations, and the number of tractors owned by machine tractor stations increased by 19% compared with 1952. Bulgarian agriculture received 2,137 new tractors (each calculated as 15 horsepower) and 200 combine harvesters last year. Czechoslovak agriculture received 2,203 tractors, 450 grain combine harvesters, and a large number of other agricultural machines last year. The total amount of work done by Czechoslovakia's machine tractor stations last year increased by 55% compared with 1952. Hungarian agriculture received 1,216 combine harvesters and thousands of tractors last year, and the work done by machine tractor stations last year increased by 30% compared with 1952. Thanks to the development of the cooperative movement and the improvement of the degree of mechanization, the level of agricultural production has been further improved. Bulgaria's grain production increased by 24% compared with 1952. Czechoslovakia's beet harvest increased by 17% compared with 1952, flax and hemp increased by 32%, and grain harvest also increased.

With the development of the national economy, especially after the governments of various countries implemented new measures to improve the people's welfare, the people's material and cultural living standards have been further improved. According to preliminary statistics, Bulgaria's national income last year increased by 16% compared with 1952, Hungary increased by 12%, Poland increased by 10%, and Czechoslovakia increased by 5%. Most of the national income is used to meet the material and cultural needs of the people. Last year, the various measures implemented by the governments of various countries achieved results. Poland's investment in social and cultural undertakings in 1953 increased by about 53% compared with 1952, and investment in housing construction increased by about 24%. 135,000 houses were built last year. More than 6,000 new retail stores and more than 11,000 new retail trade stations were opened last year. Compared with 1952, the Polish people got 17% more meat and meat products, about 20% more bicycles, and about 27% more radios last year. The reduction in the prices of some food and industrial products implemented in November last year enabled the working people to obtain 4.5 billion zlotys (Polish currency) in benefits in one year. Some measures taken by Czechoslovakia after the currency reform implemented on June 1 last year, such as increasing the state's purchase price of agricultural products and reducing the state's retail prices, have increased the people's purchasing power by about 7 billion crowns (Czech currency) in one year. In terms of culture, education and health, Czechoslovakia published 51.5 million books in 1953, the number of students in specialized schools increased by 17% compared with 1952, the number of university students increased by 11%, and the infant mortality rate decreased by 20%.

    波、捷、保、匈等国发表国民经济计划公报
    去年工农业生产都获得巨大成就
    【新华社十四日讯】波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、匈牙利等国一九五三年在国民经济各方面获得了巨大成就。
    根据这些国家最近发表的关于一九五三年国民经济计划执行结果的公报，波兰的工业总产量计划完成了百分之一百零三点九，社会主义工业的总产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十七点五；捷克斯洛伐克的工业总产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十，其中斯洛伐克地区增加了百分之十四；保加利亚的工业总产量计划完成了百分之一百点六，产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十二；匈牙利修正后的工业总产量计划完成了百分之一百零一点三，产量比一九五二年增加了百分之十一点八。这些国家的重工业部门，特别是机器制造业有了进一步的发展。例如，保加利亚机器制造业和电气机器制造业在一九五三年就掌握了三百七十一种新机器的制造方法，波兰机器制造业去年开始大规模生产的新机器和设备约有一百种，这些国家去年在基本建设方面也取得巨大的成就。捷克斯洛伐克去年投入生产的有两座平炉、四座电炉和许多其他工业设备。波兰去年有两座巨大的鼓风炉和一座平炉、两个现代化的煤矿和许多其他企业开始生产。一九五三年，捷克斯洛伐克工业中的劳动生产率整个说来比一九五二年提高了百分之七。根据初步统计，去年波兰工业中的劳动生产率比一九五二年提高了百分之十点六，生产成本减低了百分之五点五左右。
    各国一九五三年在发展农业方面也取得了显著成绩。农业中的社会主义部分有了进一步的发展。波兰的农业生产合作社已从一九五二年的四千九百个发展到一九五三年底的八千多个。合作社的谷物收获量比个体农民多百分之十五到二十。捷克斯洛伐克国家所得到的谷物中，社会主义部分已从一九五二年的百分之三十增加到一九五三年的百分之五十一。农业生产的机械化程度也大大提高了。一九五三年波兰设立了七十六个新的机器拖拉机站，机器拖拉机站拥有的拖拉机数目比一九五二年增加了百分之十九。保加利亚农业在去年得到二千一百三十七台新拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）和两百台联合机。捷克斯洛伐克农业去年得到的拖拉机有二千二百零三台，谷物联合机有四百五十台，并有大批其他的农业机器。捷克斯洛伐克机器拖拉机站去年所做的工作总量比一九五二年增加了百分之五十五。匈牙利农业去年得到一千二百一十六台联合机和数以千计的拖拉机，机器拖拉机站去年所做的工作比一九五二年增加了百分之三十。由于合作运动的发展和机械化程度的提高，农业生产水平进一步提高了。保加利亚的谷物生产量比一九五二年增加了百分之二十四。捷克斯洛伐克的甜菜收获量比一九五二年增加了百分之十七，亚麻和大麻增加了百分之三十二，谷物收获量也增加了。
    随着国民经济的发展，特别是各国政府执行新的提高人民福利的措施后，人民的物质和文化生活水平进一步提高了。根据初步统计，保加利亚去年的国民收入比一九五二年增加了百分之十六，匈牙利增加了百分之十二，波兰增加了百分之十，捷克斯洛伐克增加了百分之五。国民收入中，大部分用来满足人民物质和文化的需要。去年，各国政府执行的各种措施都获得了成效。波兰一九五三年在社会和文化事业方面的投资比一九五二年约增加了百分之五十三，在住宅建筑方面的投资约增加了百分之二十四。去年建成的住宅有十三万五千间。去年新开的零售商店有六千多个，新开的零售贸易站有一万一千多个。和一九五二年相比，波兰人民去年多得到百分之十七的肉和肉制品，约百分之二十的自行车，约百分之二十七的收音机。去年十一月间实行的减低一部分食品和工业品的价格，就使劳动人民在一年中能得到四十五亿兹罗提（波币）的好处。捷克斯洛伐克去年六月一日实行币制改革以后所采取的一些措施如提高国家收购农产品价格、减低国家零售价格等，就使人民的购买力一年中提高七十亿克朗（捷币）左右。在文教卫生方面，一九五三年，捷克斯洛伐克出版的书籍有五千一百五十万册，专科学校学生人数比一九五二年增加了百分之十七，大学学生增加了百分之十一，婴儿死亡率降低了百分之二十。
