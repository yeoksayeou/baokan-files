    These days, whether it's the people of Wuhan or travelers on the north-south railways, the Yangtze River, and the Han River, everyone is eagerly spreading an exciting piece of news: The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is about to be built! People know that this will be the first magnificent modern structure on the majestic Yangtze River; China's north-south railways and highways will be connected here; and the three towns of Wuhan, historically separated by the Yangtze and Han Rivers, will also be linked together as one.

    For decades, how eagerly have people longed for such a bridge! Old people passed their wishes to their descendants, professors to their students, and people crossing the river repeatedly inquired about news of the bridge from the boatmen. But from 1913 to the many years before liberation, the Northern Warlords clamored about building a bridge, and the Kuomintang reactionaries repeatedly hung up the signboard of bridge construction. Ill-intentioned German experts and American consultants even personally surveyed the Yangtze and Han Rivers several times. And the result? From Hankou to Hanyang, people still relied on crowded and backward sampans for crossing, and passengers and goods transferring from the Beijing-Hankou Railway to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway still had to rely on the slow ferries on the Yangtze River. The bridge gradually became something like a legend and a myth in people's minds.

    Only in the era of Mao Zedong could the people's wishes be realized.

    The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a great joy for the economic life of the Chinese people. The significance of this bridge to the national economy can be seen from its geographical location. The eastern part of our country is naturally divided into north and south by the Yangtze River. The vast area south of the river to the South China Sea is rich in subtropical products such as rice, sugarcane, and bananas, while the vast area north of the river to Heilongjiang in the northeast is rich in temperate and frigid zone products such as soybeans, sorghum, and cotton. The south has world-renowned non-ferrous metal mineral resources, while the north has endless ferrous metal mineral resources and coalfields. The south needs the north's oily and temperature-resistant wood for making railway sleepers, while the north needs the south's straight fir wood for building houses. With the progress of national economic construction, the northern industrial bases will transport thousands of tons of steel and machinery, and the construction in the south needs to import these things. North-south material exchange and mutual support in national construction require a corresponding, modern, and reliable transportation line. However, trains running south from Manchuria in the northeast on several railways stop at Hankou Station on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and trains on the north-bound railway from the south are crowded into the bottleneck of Wuchang Station on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Passengers and goods traveling north and south have only the slow ferries on the Yangtze River as the only available means of transportation. If they encounter days of heavy fog on the river or strong winds and waves, people can only sigh at the river and wait for the suspension of navigation.

    People are looking forward to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. After the successful completion of this bridge project, the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which is 1,220 kilometers long, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which is 1,102 kilometers long, can be connected from north to south. Relying on this regular, fast and reliable connection, trains and automobiles traveling north and south can pass smoothly. With the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, railways in southern and northern China can be linked. Wuhan, known as the "thoroughfare of nine provinces," will then truly become the general hub of north-south railway and highway transportation in our country. The imbalance in population and economic development of the three towns of Wuhan, caused by traffic conditions in history, will be changed, and the ancient Hanyang will no longer be a city without electric lights and running water. Every day, tens of thousands of pedestrians in the city will be able to safely and freely pass unimpeded on the Yangtze and Han Rivers.

    The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will also be built as a modern urban bridge in New China. It must not only be worthy of the majesty of the Yangtze River, but also become a leading building in Wuhan with a style that inherits the past and opens up the future.

    The scale of this bridge project and the complexity of its construction technology are unprecedented in the history of Chinese bridge building. Compared with the Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, built fifty-three years ago, and the Qiantang River Bridge, which was once widely discussed nineteen years ago, both of these bridges are inevitably inferior. Moreover, the Yellow River Bridge was contracted by French and Belgian merchants, and the Qiantang River Bridge was not entirely built by our country, but was contracted by the Danish Kang Yiyang Bank, the British Dorman Long Bridge Company, the German Siemens Bank and several capitalist foreign banks. Now, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project will be undertaken and completed by our country's bridge engineering personnel and workers themselves with the selfless economic and technical assistance of the Soviet Union, and the entire bridge structure will also be manufactured with "No. 3 structural steel" produced by our country itself. This is also the first time in the history of bridge building in our country. People have full confidence in undertaking such a glorious and arduous task. The people of the whole country will give great support to this bridge project. The large-scale steel rolling mill in Anshan will supply the best bridge steel plates, the Huaxin Cement Company in Central South China will supply a large amount of cement for pouring bridge piers, many machinery factories in East China will soon send new types of machines to the construction site, and railway bridge factories across the country will undertake all the steel beam processing and machine configuration work. The great Soviet Union will also send bridge experts and supply the latest machinery to help solve the most complex technical problems. China's famous bridge experts and engineering personnel, university professors and students, excellent bridge workers and experienced cadres will be concentrated here to engage in construction. People regard the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project as the best bridge university, and they will write a new page in the history of Chinese bridge building in this school, laying a solid foundation for China's future bridge cause.

    中国桥梁建筑史上新的一页
    ——介绍武汉长江大桥工程
    新华社记者　程晓侯　姚昌淦
    这些日子，无论是武汉的老百姓，无论是往来于南北铁路上、长江和汉水上的旅客，都在争相传告着一个激动人心的消息：武汉长江大桥要兴工建筑了。人们知道，这将是壮丽的长江上第一座雄伟的现代建筑物；我国南北铁路和公路线，将在这里贯通起来；历来被长江、汉水分隔开的武汉三镇，也将因此被联成一片。
    几十年来，人们是多么殷切地想望着这样一座大桥啊！老年人把他们的想望传给子孙，教授传给学生，往来渡江的人们一再从船夫那里打听大桥的音信。可是从一九一三年到解放前的那么多年中，北洋军阀吵嚷过要修桥，国民党反动派也曾两次三番地挂过修桥招牌，不怀好意的德国专家和美国顾问甚至亲自到长江、汉水走过几遭。而结果呢，从汉口到汉阳依然是靠那拥挤落后的扁舟划渡，从京汉铁路转粤汉铁路的旅客和货物，依然要靠那长江上的缓慢的轮渡。大桥，在人们的心目中渐渐变成像传说和神话似的东西了。
    只有在毛泽东时代，人民的愿望才得以实现。
    武汉长江大桥的修建，是我国人民经济生活中的一个大喜讯。这座大桥对于国民经济的意义，从它所处的地理位置就可以看出。我国东部是以长江为天然的南北分界线的。大江以南直到南海边沿的广大地区，有丰富的稻米、甘蔗、香蕉等亚热带的主要物产，而大江以北直到东北黑龙江的广大地区，则盛产北温带和寒带的大豆、高粱和棉花；南方有驰名世界的有色金属矿产，北方则有无尽的黑色金属矿产和煤田；南方需要北方多油耐温的木材供制枕木，北方则需要南方劲直的杉木建筑房屋。随着国家经济建设的进展，北方的工业基地将运出成千上万吨的钢铁和机器，而南方的建设正需要运进这许多东西。南北物资交流和国家建设中的相互支援，都要求有一条相适应的、现代化的和灵通可靠的交通运输线。可是，从东北满洲里起，在若干条铁路上奔驰南下的列车到京汉铁路的汉口车站停住了，从南方北去的铁路线上的列车，也在粤汉铁路武昌车站的葫芦眼里拥挤住了。南来北去的旅客和货物到了这里，唯一可以利用的交通工具是长江上缓慢的轮渡。要是遇到大雾弥江或者狂风卷浪的日子，人们更只有望江兴叹，停航等渡。
    人们期待着武汉长江大桥。这个大桥工程修建成功以后，全长一千二百二十公里的京汉铁路和全长一千一百零二公里的粤汉铁路就可以南北接轨。依靠这个经常、迅速而可靠的联系，南来北去的列车、汽车将可以畅快通行，有了武汉长江大桥，我国南方和北方铁路就可以进行联运。被人们称作“九省通衢”的武汉，此后将名副其实地成为我国南北铁路和公路交通的总枢纽。历史上由于交通条件而造成的武汉三镇人口和经济发展不平衡的状况将由此改观，古老的汉阳将不再是没有电灯和自来水的城市。每天，市内成千上万的行人也将可以安全自在地在长江和汉水上通行无阻了。
    武汉长江大桥同时将作为新中国的一座都市桥来建筑，它既要不愧于长江的雄伟，又要成为武汉市承旧启新、极有风格的主导建筑物。
    这座大桥工程的规模和施工技术上的复杂性，在我国桥梁建筑史上是空前的。如果拿五十三年前建造的京汉路黄河大铁桥、曾经在十九年前盛传一时的钱塘江大桥来和它相比，这两座桥都不免为之逊色。而且，黄河大桥是法国和比利时的包商承建的，钱塘江大桥也不完全是我国自建，而是由丹麦康益洋行、英国道门郎桥梁公司、德国西门子洋行和好几个资本主义外国洋行承包修建的。而现在，武汉长江大桥工程则将在苏联经济上和技术上的无私的帮助下，由我国的桥梁工程人员和工人自己来担负和完成，全部大桥结构也将由我国自己出产的“三号构造钢”钢材来制造。这在我国桥梁建筑史上也还是第一次。人们对于担负这样一个光荣而艰巨的任务是具有充分信心的。全国人民都将给这座大桥工程以重大的支援。鞍山的大型轧钢厂将供给最好的桥梁钢板，中南的华新水泥公司将供给大量浇灌桥墩的水泥，华东的许多机械工厂即将为工地送来新型的机具，全国的铁路桥梁工厂将担负起全部的钢梁加工和机具配置工作。伟大的苏联还将派来桥梁专家和供给最新式的机具，帮助解决最复杂的技术问题。我国著名的桥梁专家和工程人员、大学教授和学生、优秀的桥梁工人和久经锻炼的干部，都将集中到这里从事建筑。人们把武汉长江大桥工程看作是一所最好的桥梁大学，他们将在这个学校里为中国桥梁建筑史写下新的一页，为我国今后的桥梁事业打下坚固的基础。
