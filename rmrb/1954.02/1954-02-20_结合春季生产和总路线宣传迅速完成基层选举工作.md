Combining Spring Production and General Line Propaganda to Quickly Complete Basic-Level Elections

The basic-level election work, which is being carried out enthusiastically across the country, has been completed in over 52,000 basic-level units with a population of 140 million as of the end of January this year. Another 26,000-plus basic-level units with a population of approximately 80 million are actively in progress. According to the decision of the 28th meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, all units in the country that have not yet completed basic-level elections should accelerate their completion. This work is now unfolding more universally across the country.

Thanks to the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, the basic-level election work that began in the summer of last year has achieved remarkable results. The completed areas have basically met the requirements of the Central Election Committee for basic-level election work: population surveys and voter registration have been properly carried out, the number of people participating in the election has reached 80% to 90% or even 100% of the total number of voters, and upright, fair, competent, and closely connected with the masses, and beloved by the masses, have been selected and appointed to various work posts in basic-level organizations. At the same time, all basic-level cadres have received a profound education under the scrutiny of the masses, achieving the goals of uniting the masses, educating cadres, strengthening the ties between the people and the People's Government, and further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

Since November of last year, with the widespread and in-depth publicity of the general line for the transition period, the people and basic-level cadres have been encouraged and inspired by the great socialist future, and have united even more closely around the Communist Party of China, which is striving tirelessly to realize socialism. At the same time, they have paid more attention to the people's political power, demanding that it more effectively lead and guarantee the smooth progress of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Some of the basic-level cadres and Communist Party members who had previously mistakenly believed that the revolution had been successful, and therefore relaxed their work, neglected political power work, and held "relaxation" and "change of shift" ideas, have now rejuvenated themselves and corrected their erroneous ideas and improved their work during the election campaign. The further improvement of the socialist consciousness of the broad masses and cadres has created more favorable conditions for doing a good job in basic-level elections in the future. The general public, because they support socialism, have also added new requirements when selecting representatives, selecting activists who can take the lead in implementing mutual aid and cooperation and actively take the socialist road. Therefore, not only those who violate laws and regulations and commit serious commandism errors are abandoned by the masses, but even those who hoard and speculate and refuse to sell surplus grain to the state, and those who only care about personal enrichment and disregard national interests, are criticized by the masses. This means that basic-level elections not only generally make the political power more democratic, make the relationship between the People's Government and the people closer, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, but also enhance the leadership strength of basic-level and the guarantee of basic-level political power for the gradual transition to a socialist society. This new favorable condition should be fully recognized and utilized by basic-level election workers and Party and government leading organs. In the current basic-level election work, the basic-level election work should be closely combined with the work of implementing the general line, and more conscious and planned active propaganda should be carried out to expand the influence of the general line, calling on the people to participate in the election more actively and select representatives more carefully, and elect advanced figures with higher socialist consciousness and the most active production to the work posts of basic-level political power, so that the completion of basic-level election work will be more conducive to the in-depth implementation of the general line, and more conducive to the development of mutual aid and cooperation and various socialist transformation and socialist construction undertakings.

Basic-level election work is now being carried out during the tense spring production season, and must be completed before this season. Therefore, rural basic-level elections should revolve around the current central spring production work in rural areas. Make full use of the gaps in production work to carry out election work, so that election work not only does not delay production, but also promotes production. In this regard, various regions have gained a lot of experience during the trial period of basic-level elections, and this experience must be promoted. Various election activities should strive to simplify procedures and save time, and avoid cumbersome extravagance as much as possible. If too much work is required to be combined at the same time as the election work, it will not only dilute the election and prolong the time, but it will also be difficult to grasp and prone to deviations. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to understanding the people's demands in terms of production throughout the entire basic-level election process, collect their opinions on the government's leadership in production, and study and solve the problems at any time, in order to promote production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and guide the people to select figures who can truly represent the interests of the people from the production movement and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and elect them to the basic-level people's congresses or government organs, so that the victory of the basic-level election itself becomes a driving force for a new upsurge in the production movement.

In short, the requirement for basic-level election work in various regions now should be to do it well and do it quickly. To do it well means to mobilize the people to participate in the election enthusiastically and ensure that the number of people participating in the election accounts for a very high proportion of the total number of voters; to ensure that the people whom the masses love and who are connected to the masses are elected. To do it quickly means to strive to complete the election on schedule within the time stipulated by the Central People's Government. At present, various regions already have many favorable conditions for doing a good job in basic-level elections. First of all, various regions now have experience in doing a good job in basic-level elections; secondly, after the publicity of the general line, the political enthusiasm of the broad masses has been greatly improved. Under these favorable conditions, it is entirely possible to strive to complete the basic-level election work quickly and victoriously.

Time is running out and the task is still arduous. Therefore, the Party and government leading organs and all election workers should conscientiously pay attention to the leadership of the election work in order to strive for the rapid and victorious completion of the basic-level elections throughout the country, and lay a solid foundation for the continued elections of county and city people's congresses, provincial people's congresses, and the National People's Congress.

### 结合春季生产和总路线宣传迅速完成基层选举工作

    结合春季生产和总路线宣传迅速完成基层选举工作
    在全国热烈进行的基层选举工作，截至今年一月底止，已经在一亿四千万人口的五万二千多个基层单位中完成，另有约八千万人口的二万六千多个基层单位，正在积极进行。根据中央人民政府委员会第二十八次会议的决定，全国尚未完成基层选举的单位，都应加速完成。现在这一工作已经在全国范围内更加普遍地展开起来了。
    由于广大人民群众的热烈拥护，从去年夏季开始的基层选举工作取得了显著的成绩。已经完成的地区，基本上都达到了中央选举委员会对基层选举工作的要求：作好了人口调查和选民登记，参加选举的人数达到了全体选民数的百分之八、九十以上以至百分之百，在基层组织的各种工作岗位上选任了为人正派、办事公道、有一定工作能力和密切联系群众而又为群众所爱戴的分子，同时使所有基层干部都在群众的鉴别之下受了一次深刻的教育，达到了团结群众，教育干部，加强人民群众和人民政府的联系和进一步巩固人民民主专政的目的。
    去年十一月份以来，随着国家过渡时期总路线的普遍而深入的宣传，人民群众和基层干部受到了伟大的社会主义前途的鼓舞和激发，更加紧密地团结在为实现社会主义而奋斗不息的中国共产党周围，同时对人民政权也更加重视起来，要求它能更切实更有效地领导和保障社会主义的建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。基层干部和共产党员中原来有一部分误认为革命已经成功，因而工作松懈，忽视政权工作，抱有“松劲”和“换班”思想的，现在也重新振作起来，并在选举运动中改正了自己的错误思想，改进了工作。广大群众和广大干部的社会主义觉悟的进一步提高，给今后做好基层选举工作创造了更为有利的条件，一般人民群众因为拥护社会主义，在挑选代表时也增加了新的要求，挑选那些能够带头实行互助合作、积极走社会主义道路的积极分子。所以不仅是那些违法乱纪分子和犯有严重命令主义等错误的分子被群众所抛弃，而且连那些囤积居奇不肯把余粮卖给国家的，那些光顾个人发财、不顾国家利益的，也受到了群众的批判。这就意味着，基层选举不仅是一般地使政权更加民主化，使人民政府和人民群众的关系更加密切，使人民民主专政更加巩固，而且为逐步过渡到社会主义社会增强了基层领导力量和基层政权的保障。这种新的有利条件，应该为基层选举工作人员和党政领导机关所充分认识，充分利用；在目前的基层选举工作中，应该把基层选举工作和贯彻实行总路线的工作密切结合起来，更加有意识有计划地进行积极的宣传来扩展总路线的影响，号召人民群众更积极地参加选举，更认真地挑选代表，把社会主义觉悟较高的生产最积极的先进人物选到基层政权的工作岗位上去，使基层选举工作的完成更有利于总路线的深入贯彻，更有利于发展互助合作和各种社会主义改造与社会主义建设事业。
    基层选举工作现在正在紧张的春季生产时期进行着，而且必须争取在这一季节前完成，因而农村的基层选举，应该环绕到当前农村最中心的春季生产工作去进行。尽量利用生产工作的空隙时间来进行选举工作，使选举工作不但不耽误生产而且更能推动生产，在这一方面，各地在基层普选试办期间已取得了许多经验，这些经验必须加以推广。选举的各项活动，应该力求简化手续和节省时间，尽量避免繁琐铺张。如果在选举工作的同时要求结合进行的工作过多，则不但冲淡了选举，拖长了时间，而且难以掌握，易出偏差。同时必须在整个基层选举的过程中，随时注意了解群众在生产方面的要求，搜集他们对政府领导生产方面的意见，并随时研究解决的办法，以推动生产和互助合作运动，并引导人民从生产运动和互助合作运动中去挑选确能代表群众利益的人物，把他们选到基层人民代表大会或政府机关中去，使基层选举本身的胜利成为生产运动新高涨的推动力量。
    总之，现在各地对基层选举工作的要求，应该是既做得好而又要做得快。做得好，这就是要动员人民热烈地参加选举，保证参加选举的人数占全体选民的很高比例；要保证把群众所爱戴的联系群众的人选出来。做得快，这就是要争取在中央人民政府规定的时间内如期完成选举。现在各地已有迅速地做好基层选举工作的许多有利条件，首先各地现在都已有了办好基层选举工作的经验；其次，经过总路线宣传后，广大群众的政治热情，已有很大的提高，在这些有利条件下争取迅速地胜利地完成基层选举工作，是完全可能的。
    时间已经不多，任务还很繁重，因此党、政领导机关和全体选举工作人员都应切实注意对于选举工作的领导，以争取基层选举在全国范围内迅速地胜利地完成，为继续进行县市人民代表大会、省人民代表大会和全国人民代表大会的选举打下坚实的基础。
