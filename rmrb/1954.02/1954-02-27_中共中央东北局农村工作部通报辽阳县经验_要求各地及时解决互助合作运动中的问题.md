Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 26th. The Rural Work Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently circulated the experience of Liaoning Province's Liaoyang County in promptly addressing problems arising in mutual aid and cooperation. It requires Party organizations in all localities to also promptly identify and resolve problems, ensuring the healthy development of the movement.

After the peasants of Liaoyang County received education on the general line and participated in the patriotic grain sales campaign, their enthusiasm for participating in the mutual aid and cooperation movement soared. The establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the county is progressing smoothly, and mutual aid teams have also developed significantly. However, because cadres, while publicizing the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives, did not also publicize the superiority of mutual aid teams over individual peasant production; and in publicizing the establishment of cooperatives, did not, in areas where conditions for establishing cooperatives were not yet met, promote that there should be no rush to establish cooperatives, and conditions should be actively prepared for development in the direction of agricultural producers' cooperatives, this led some peasants to mistakenly believe: that establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives was seen as more prestigious and less "troublesome" than engaging in mutual aid teams. Under this mindset, many "spontaneous" but unqualified agricultural producers' cooperatives emerged. In this situation, some rural work cadres did not effectively persuade the peasants through education, simply believing: "Let them do it, a few more won't hurt!" This further affected the steady development of the movement. Contrary to the above bias, some cadres failed to actively guide the peasants' enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation, but instead passively restricted it, saying that establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives was troublesome, and they should do it next year! Furthermore, some cadres, regarding the "hard-bound" groups (i.e., those with carts and horses organized together) organized by some middle peasants, failed to educate the middle peasants appropriately, adhering to the principle of unity between poor and middle peasants to develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, thus hindering the broader development of the movement.

After discovering the above two biases, the Liaoyang County Committee of the CPC immediately instructed all districts to correct them. First, it required that while publicizing the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives, the benefits of mutual aid teams should also be promoted, explaining the principle that mutual aid teams are better than individual farming, agricultural producers' cooperatives are stronger than mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams are generally the foundation for establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives, through concrete local examples, criticizing the views of Party members and cadres who belittled mutual aid teams. Second, it required each district to summarize the experiences of one or two better mutual aid teams, pointing out that the future of mutual aid teams is agricultural producers' cooperatives, and that in areas where conditions for establishing cooperatives are not yet met, as long as the mutual aid teams are well-managed, they can develop into agricultural producers' cooperatives in the future. Regarding the "hard-bound" mutual aid teams of some middle peasants and the practice of raising the prices of cattle, after explaining the benefits of mutual solidarity and mutual assistance in jointly taking the socialist road, they were made to consciously change. In addition, all district committees were required to conscientiously study the CPC Central Committee's resolution on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives and correctly implement the policy of "active leadership and steady progress." The "spontaneous cooperatives" that had already emerged and were not yet finalized were to be patiently persuaded to first run mutual aid teams well, creating conditions for agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    中共中央东北局农村工作部通报辽阳县经验
    要求各地及时解决互助合作运动中的问题
    【新华社沈阳二十六日电】中共中央东北局农村工作部最近通报了辽东省辽阳县及时注意互助合作中发生的问题的经验，要求各地党的组织也及时发现问题，解决问题，保证运动的健康发展。
    辽阳县农民经过总路线教育和爱国售粮运动之后，参加互助合作运动的积极性空前高涨，全县农业生产合作社的建社工作正在顺利进行，互助组也有很大的发展。但由于干部没有在宣传农业生产合作社优越性的同时，也宣传互助组比个体农民生产的优越性；在宣传办社的同时，对办社还不具备条件的地方，没有宣传不应急于办社，应积极准备条件，向农业生产合作社的方向发展，因而使部分农民错误地认为：办农业生产合作社区上高看，比搞互助组还省“麻烦”。农民们在这种想法下，出现了许多“自发”的但是不够条件的农业生产合作社。在这种情况下，有些农村工作干部又没有很好地对农民进行说服教育，只是认为：“干就干吧，多几个也不要紧！”更影响了运动的稳步发展。和上述偏向相反的缺点，是有的干部对农民的互助合作热情不能积极地进行引导，而是消极地加以限制，说搞农业生产合作社麻烦，你们明年再搞吧！再是有的干部对部分中农组织“硬卡硬”组（即有车马户组织在一起）的情况，不能本着贫农和中农团结发展互助合作运动的原则，对中农进行适当的教育，使运动更广泛发展。
    中共辽阳县委员会发现上述两种偏向后，立即指示各区进行纠正。第一、要求在宣传农业生产合作社优越性的同时，结合宣传互助组的好处，通过当地的具体事例，讲清互助组比单干好，农业生产合作社比互助组强，互助组一般的是建立农业生产合作社的基础的道理，批判党员和干部中轻视互助组的观点。第二、要求各区总结出一两个较好的互助组的经验，指出互助组的前途就是农业生产合作社，现在建社不够条件的地方，只要把互助组搞好，将来就能向农业生产合作社发展。对部分中农的“硬卡硬”互助组和抬高牛犋价的作法，说明互相团结、互相帮助共同走社会主义道路的好处后，使其自觉地转变。此外，要求各区委员会认真学习中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议，正确执行“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针。对已出现和尚未定型的“自发社”，耐心说服农民先办好互助组，为农业生产合作社创造条件。
