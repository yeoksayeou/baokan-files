The Source of Happiness for Rural Women and Children
    ——A Record of the Production Achievements of Female Members of the Xuzhangcheng Agricultural Cooperative in the Suburbs of Fuzhou
    Zhou Guiyuan, Ouyang Ying

    "An Agricultural Production Cooperative of Women"
    The Xuzhangcheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fenghu Township, Fuzhou Suburbs, Fujian Province, was organized before the spring plowing last year. Because it is located in the suburbs of the city, most of the men are workers or have gone to work in other places. Almost all those who are left to participate in agricultural labor are women. Among the 42 full laborers in the cooperative, only the director, Xu Zhangcheng, and two others are male laborers, and among the 16 semi-laborers, only six are male. Therefore, some people say that this is a women's agricultural production cooperative.

    The Wealth They Created
    Before the autumn harvest last year, the Xuzhangcheng Agricultural Production Cooperative was not noticed by anyone; however, since the autumn harvest achieved a large-scale bumper harvest, it has caused a sensation in the surrounding rural areas of Fuzhou. Last autumn, the cooperative averaged 1,064.5 jin of rice per mu, an increase of 33% compared to 1952. The cooperative harvested a total of more than 93,600 jin of rice. The pigs raised by the sideline group produced more than 3,500 jin of net pork and raised more than 7,000 jin of freshwater fish. In addition, the sugarcane and water chestnuts planted by the cooperative also had good harvests.

    In 1953, the production of 49 women in the Xuzhangcheng Cooperative was equivalent to 129,404 jin of rice, enough for 215 people to eat for a year. Xu Jinmei, a member with a normal income, had a total income of more than 4,300 jin of grain from agriculture and sideline occupations last year, which was more than double the income of Chen Shengming, a strong labor mutual aid group member in the township. As for individual farmers, they could not compare with her. There were many families like Xu Jinmei in the cooperative. The director, Xu Zhangcheng, said that because all 36 households in the cooperative had participated in mutual aid groups in the past and in the agricultural production cooperative last year, their income had increased year by year. Fourteen poor peasant households have reached the level of middle peasants, and seven other poor peasant households are close to becoming middle peasants. The lives of the original 15 middle peasant households have also improved compared to the past. After the autumn harvest last year, the cooperative had already bought more than 8 million yuan worth of cloth, cotton, and daily necessities. The girls all picked out satisfactory floral fabrics from the supply and marketing cooperative, and some even bought toothpaste that they had never used before. The women's labor has been duly rewarded.

    Mothers and Children are Happy
    Women's participation in production has created wealth for the country and brought happiness to their families. However, women are not like men. They have many special problems that need to be solved when participating in agricultural production. For example, they cannot be immersed in cold water during menstruation, they cannot do heavy work during pregnancy, and they are also burdened by housework and children. If these problems are not taken care of and they are forced to work, it will affect their health, affect family harmony, and even endanger their lives. This situation is a contradiction that individual peasant women have not been able to solve for many years. Many women in Fenghu Township are familiar with the following two events: The wife of Wang Yide, an individual farmer in Xihong Town, was four months pregnant when she caught up with last year's drought. Seeing that the crops were about to die from drought, she had to go to draw water with her mother-in-law. As a result, she fainted from exhaustion and had a miscarriage. She has not recovered her health for more than a year. Huang Yindi's mother, an individual farmer, went to the fields without rest after giving birth. As a result, she suffered from a production-related illness and suffered all her life.

    However, these things did not happen to the women who participated in the Xuzhangcheng Agricultural Production Cooperative. When cooperative member Lin Meige became ill while pregnant last year, the cooperative lent her money and sent her to the hospital for treatment. After she recovered from her illness, she gave birth to a child during the early rice harvest in June. The cooperative allowed her to rest and assigned her to do light work for a long period of time. As a result, both the mother and the child were well taken care of, and she worked even harder. She often said gratefully to people: "If it weren't for the cooperative, I wouldn't be like this today. This method thought of by Chairman Mao is really good. It has turned women over again!" Last year, Lin Youdi, Lin Meiying, Chen Meiying, Zhang Shuilian, and Zeng Shuilian in the cooperative all gave birth to children, and their mothers and children were safe, grew up fat, and their income not only did not decrease due to childbirth, but also increased. The director, Xu Zhangcheng, said that last year, except for Lin Meige who had been ill before giving birth, the other women in the cooperative rarely got sick. He also said that the female members of the cooperative did more work in the cooperative than the individual women, but because the labor force was rationally allocated, they worked when they should work and rested when they needed to rest, so it was not easy to affect their health.

    In the past, when the women of the Xuzhangcheng Cooperative had not joined the cooperative, their income was low and their labor force was insufficient. Many children of school age were left at home to help with the work. Only five children from 36 households were in school. Last year, when the cooperative was established, the labor force was unified and allocated, and eight more children were drawn out to go to school. Not only that, but during the busy farming season, the cooperative also had a busy farming season nursery, so that the children at home were also carefully taken care of. When studying the general line, the women compared their current lives with the past, and they all said that after being organized, mothers were happy and children were happy.

    Husbands and Sons are Glorious
    An agricultural production cooperative with a majority of women has done such a good job in production, and the income of its members has increased so much, which has made the nearby farmers envious. Now twelve new members have joined the cooperative, and many other farmers are asking to join. The farmers of Wufeng Township sent three representatives, including Zhang Tian?, to ask the Xuzhangcheng Cooperative to send people to help them build a cooperative. Family members working outside the cooperative knew that the agricultural production cooperative at home was doing well and wrote letters home to congratulate them. Xu Wenhua, who works in the East China Illiteracy Elimination Committee in Shanghai, is the husband of Yang Shuzhen, a member of the cooperative. When he saw the photo of the Xuzhangcheng Cooperative selling grain to the country published in the Liberation Daily, he wrote a letter to his wife saying: "I was so happy when I saw the photo of you selling grain in the newspaper that I couldn't sleep at night. You have organized to increase grain production and sell it to the country. This path is really glorious. You must work harder in the future!" Chen Xianqin, the son of cooperative member Lu Lidi, who is a railway worker in Nanchang, Jiangxi, also wrote a letter to his mother congratulating her, saying: "You are following Chairman Mao's path, and you are doing really well. I, as a son, also feel glorious." At the conference held by the cooperative to celebrate the bumper harvest and welcome the new members, these mothers and wives took out the congratulatory letters written by their husbands and children and read them to everyone, and everyone cheered happily. They discussed together and wrote a reply to their loved ones, saying: "...You should work hard in factories and organs. We will work hard in the fields to produce more grain and go to socialism with you!"

    农村妇女和孩子们幸福的源泉
    ——记福州市郊许章成农业合作社女社员们的生产成绩
    周桂媛　欧阳英
    “一个妇女农业生产合作社”
    福建省福州市郊凤湖乡许章成农业生产合作社是去年春耕以前组织起来的。这个社因为是在市郊，男人们大多数都是工人，或去到别的地方工作去了，剩下参加农业劳动的，几乎全是妇女。全社四十二个全劳动力中，只有社长许章成和另外两个人是男劳动力，十六个半劳动力中，也只有六个是男的。因此有人说，这是一个妇女农业生产合作社。
    她们创造的财富
    许章成农业生产合作社，在去年秋收以前还不为人所注意；可是，自从秋收得到大面积的丰产后，就轰动福州市的远近农村了。去年秋收，社里一亩田平均打了一千零六十四斤半谷子，比一九五二年增产三成三，全社总共打了九万三千六百多斤谷子。副业组喂的猪，生产了三千五百多斤净猪肉，并养了七千多斤淡水鱼，此外，社里种的甘蔗和荸荠，收成也都很好。
    一九五三年，许章成社四十九个妇女生产所得，折谷子十二万九千四百零四斤，够二百一十五个人吃一年。一个收入平常的社员许金妹，去年农副业收入共四千三百多斤谷子，比乡里劳力强的互助组员陈圣铭的收入还多了一倍。至于单干农民那就更不能和她比了。全社像许金妹这样的还有好多家。社长许章成说：全社三十六户，因为过去参加互助组和去年参加农业生产合作社，收入年年增加，十四户贫农已达到中农的水平，还有七户贫农已经接近于中农，原来的十五户中农生活也比过去提高了。去年秋收以后，全社已经买了八百多万元的布匹、棉花和日用品。姑娘们都从供销社挑选了称心的花布，有的还买来了过去从来没有用过的牙膏。妇女们的劳动，得到了应得的报偿。
    母亲孩子们都幸福
    妇女参加生产，为国家创造了财富，为家庭带来了幸福。但是妇女不比男人，她们在参加农业生产时，有许多特殊问题需要解决。比方说，月经来了浸不得冷水，怀孕期间不能干重活，另外还有家事和孩子的拖累等等，要是不管这些问题，勉强去干活，就要影响身体健康，影响家庭和睦，甚至危害生命。而这种情况，乃是单干的农民妇女多少年来不能解决的矛盾。凤湖乡很多妇女都熟悉以下两个事件：西洪镇单干农民王依德的妻子，怀孕四个月时，正赶上了去年的大旱，眼看庄稼要旱死了，她只好和婆婆一起去车水，结果累得昏倒血崩，一年多还没有恢复健康；单干农民黄银俤的母亲生了孩子，没有休息就下地，结果害了生产病，一生都受折磨。
    可是参加了许章成农业生产合作社的妇女，就没有这些事情发生了。社员林妹哥去年怀孩子时得了病，社里就借钱给她，送她到医院看病；病好了，六月割早稻时生了孩子，社里又让她休息，并在很长一个时期分配她干轻活。结果母亲和孩子护养得都很好，干活也更有劲了。她常常感激地对人说：“要是没有社，我今天那能这样，毛主席想出的这个办法真好，叫妇女又翻了一个身！”去年，社里林幼俤、林美英、陈美英、张水莲、曾水莲都生了孩子，也都是母子安全，长得胖胖的，收入不但没有因生孩子减少，而且都增加了。社长许章成说，去年社里的妇女除林妹哥产前得过病外，其他都很少得病。他又说，女社员在社里比单干的妇女干活还多，可是因为合理调配了劳力，该干的时候就干，需要休息的时候就休息，所以就不容易影响身体健康了。
    许章成社的妇女，在过去没有入社时，收入少，劳力不足，把很多适龄儿童都留在家里帮着干活，三十六户只有五个孩子读书。去年办了社，社里劳力统一调配，才又抽出八个孩子去读书了。不但这样，在农忙时，社里还有农忙托儿所，使在家里的孩子也都有人小心看护。学习总路线时，妇女们把现在的生活和过去作了比较，都说，组织起来以后，母亲们幸福，孩子们也幸福了。
    丈夫和儿子都光荣
    一个妇女占绝大多数的农业生产合作社，生产搞得这样好，社员收入增加这样多，使附近农民称羡不已。现在已经有十二户新社员入社，另外还有不少农民在要求加入。五凤乡的农民就派了张天?等三个代表来，要求许章成社派人帮助他们建社。社员在外边工作的家属，知道家里的农业生产合作社搞得好，都写信回家祝贺。在上海华东扫除文盲委员会工作的许文华，是社员杨淑贞的丈夫，当他看到解放日报登出了许章成社卖粮给国家的照片后，写了一封信寄给他妻子说：“我看了报上登载的你们卖粮的照片，高兴得晚上连觉都睡不着，你们组织起来增产粮食，卖给国家，这条路子走得真光荣，今后更要好好干啊！”社员卢梨俤的儿子陈贤秦在江西南昌当铁路工人，也写信向母亲祝贺说：“你照毛主席的路走，走得实在好，我做儿子的也觉得光荣。”在社里庆祝丰收和欢迎新社员的大会上，这些母亲们、妻子们拿出了她们丈夫、孩子写来的祝贺信念给大家听，大家都高兴得欢呼起来。她们共同商量着回了一封信给自己的亲人们说：“……你们在工厂里、机关里好好生产好好工作吧，我们要在田野里好好生产，多打粮食，和你们一同走到社会主义！”
