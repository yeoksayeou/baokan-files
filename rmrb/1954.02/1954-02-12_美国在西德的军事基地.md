American Military Bases in West Germany
Soviet Union A·Salkov

    It began two years ago. A constant stream of military vehicles rumbled along the roads within the Palatinate (originally Pfalz), passing the famous Moselle vineyards and the ancient castles on the banks of the Rhine. The Palatinate was part of the French occupation zone, and as the French troops withdrew, American troops moved in.

    Then, on all the highways and byways, signs appeared: "Restricted Area," "Keep Out." Many of them were written in English, French, and German: "Special Zone, No Entry, No Loitering." American engineering corps spread throughout the towns and villages, bulldozers and power rollers ravaging the picturesque vineyards. The roar of jet planes constantly echoed in the sky.

    German newspapers also began to refer to the Palatinate as the "strategic triangle." Soon, the truth became clear as to why the United States wanted to replace France: the Palatinate was being transformed into one of the largest American military bases in Germany. Forty thousand Germans, under the supervision of American engineers, constructed fortifications, airfields, tank bases, firing ranges, and training grounds. This "construction boom" cost West German taxpayers one billion marks. According to German newspapers, the Palatinate's defenses are even more formidable than Hitler's "West Wall." This refers not only to the scale of construction but also to the strategic objectives. People remember that Hitler tirelessly emphasized that his fortifications were for "defense." But from the first day of the war, this lie was shattered. It was clear that behind the bastions of the West Wall, the Nazis were mobilizing their shock troops to wedge into France, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

    Today, American generals are emphasizing the "defensive" purpose of the Palatinate triangle. But West German newspaper strategists have already measured the distances from the center of this triangle to the borders of France, Belgium, and Luxembourg. These distances are very short: from Kaiserslautern, Landstuhl, and Ramstein to the French border is thirty to thirty-five kilometers; from Bitburg to the Belgian border is thirty kilometers, and to the Luxembourg border, only twenty kilometers.

    The significance of these figures becomes even more apparent when the United States stationed a battalion of atomic cannons in Kaiserslautern and announced that the range of these cannons was thirty-five kilometers. It was precisely because of this statement and certain other considerations that the "Cologne Review" wrote: "Once war breaks out, atomic shells will primarily fall on French soil."

    A major reason why this West German newspaper made such a sharp comment is that the Palatinate triangle is not only an American bridgehead but also a base for the reviving revanchist Bundeswehr of Adenauer. Last November, a reporter for the "Western Mail and South Wales Echo" reported from Frankfurt that "American equipment for the West German army has been stockpiled in the armories and airfields of the Kaiserslautern area," enough to supply twelve German divisions. According to German newspapers, this equipment includes more than three thousand five hundred American tanks given to the West German army.

    These are the reports from the Palatinate. This peaceful and tranquil corner of Germany has now become a "strategic triangle" of Washington and Bonn's aggressive forces, threatening the security and peace of European countries.

    However, the Palatinate is not the only or largest American military base in West Germany. Last February, "U.S. News & World Report" published a map of the world, meaningfully marked: "Throughout the Globe... Over 350 U.S. Bases." The map had black dots marking American bases, and the density of black dots was particularly high in the West German section.

    German newspapers recently published a very telling map depicting the locations of military bases in the western region. It is noteworthy that the black dots of bases are particularly numerous in the Rhine-Palatinate region, Bavaria, and Lower Saxony, regions bordering France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic.

    Although the Four Powers had an agreement on the elimination of all military airfields in Germany, 251 airfields were retained in West Germany, and 18 new ones were built. Among them, two airfields near Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg have specially long runways for American heavy bombers. Furthermore, more airfields are under construction: the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council" plans to build more than thirty airfields this year. In addition, more than 700,000 hectares of farmland and forests have been requisitioned for military use.

    German newspapers say that the construction of military bases is currently being accelerated; according to the German News Agency, the Bonn government has prepared to allocate another 1.2 billion marks for this expenditure.

    The network of military bases is expanding to meet the needs of the new Bundeswehr. Last November, the "Nuremberg Eight O'Clock Paper" reported that Major General Joseph M. Plitt, of the U.S. High Commissioner's office in the American occupation zone, representing the U.S. Forces in Germany Command, and the military advisor to the Bonn government, Nazi General Heusinger, held a meeting. They discussed the construction of training grounds and barracks for the future German army, among other things. According to other newspaper reports, American barracks in the Baden-Württemberg region and other parts of West Germany are being transferred to the Blank Agency (the de facto Ministry of Defense of the Bonn government).

    At almost the same time, another meeting was held on the American destroyer "Haude," attended by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Oleum and former Nazi Admiral, now a member of the West German Parliament and possible candidate for Bonn's naval commander, Heisky. According to German newspaper reports, they reached a decision that the future Bonn navy would be based in Wilhelmshaven. According to the French "Nation Forum," the current American base in Bremen will also be used by Bonn.

    American air force bases are also being used to train technical personnel for the future West German air force, not only mechanics and radio operators. Regular "get-togethers" between American and Nazi pilots have also become part of the training program.

    One such "get-together" was held at the Landstuhl American Airfield in the Palatinate last April. Members of Göring's Richthofen Squadron, who had barbarously bombed Rotterdam and Warsaw, were entertained by Major General Landon, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe. Shortly thereafter, the "Hamburg Courier" declared that the first squadrons of the future German air force would be equipped with American aircraft.

    These and many other facts undeniably confirm the close relationship between the policy of establishing American air force bases in West Germany and reviving the deadly enemy of the European people, German militarism.

    The emergence of an American war base network in western Germany is a threat to the reunification of Germany and a grave danger to European security.

    The undeniable fact is that these bases are primarily directed against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. As early as the spring of 1950, the American magazine "Newsweek" published a map with two arrows indicating the direction of two strategic attacks originating from West Germany. These two arrows pointed towards Warsaw and Szczecin. But the example of the aforementioned "Palatinate Triangle" and the fact that Bonn's revanchists are using other American bases demonstrate that these bases are also a serious threat to the security of Western Europe. The "New York Herald Tribune" correspondent in Bonn, referring to the military preparations near the French and Belgian borders, recalled, "Bismarck and Wilhelm II and Hitler advanced westward through here." This is not without significance.

    American bases have brought more hardship to the people of West Germany. The land requisitioned for building airfields and training grounds is enough to feed 70,000 farmers, and the huge sums spent on these bases are enough to build thousands of homes and schools that West Germany urgently needs.

    The presence of American military bases in West Germany is a major obstacle to German reunification. One of the reasons why American aggressive forces, especially military personnel, are desperately opposed to the reunification of Germany is that they do not want to lose such a valuable and advantageous location as West Germany. The Vienna "Evening News" quoted U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Roger Keyes' remarks to a group of senior American officers during an inspection of West German bases last fall. Keyes said that the military plans drafted by American military leaders not only require maintaining American forces in West Germany but also increasing their strength. Keyes also said that his Defense Department therefore believes that German unification and the subsequent withdrawal of American troops are clearly detrimental to the United States.

    Peace-loving people who aspire to a peaceful resolution of all international disputes and the easing of international tensions cannot turn a blind eye to the existence and expansion of the American base network in Bonn, Germany. The Soviet Union, adhering to its peaceful policy, has repeatedly raised the issue of removing these bases and all other military bases on foreign territories. In its note to the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States on November 3rd last year, the Soviet government once again emphasized: "To solve the German question in accordance with the interests of European security, it is imperative to resolve the issue of eliminating the aforementioned military bases."

    Correctly resolving this issue is crucial for easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace.

    Last November, the Berlin "Neues Deutschland" published this map, titled: "The Result of Adenauer's Policy. American Bases are All Over West Germany." Each black dot on the map represents a newly built or rebuilt military base.

    美国在西德的军事基地
    苏联　阿·萨尔科夫
    事情开始于两年以前。辚辚不息的军车沿着巴拉丁纳特（原名普法尔茨）境内的道路行驶，经过著名的摩索耳葡萄园和莱茵河岸上的古堡。巴拉丁纳特是法国占领区的一部分，法国军队从这儿开拔走，美国军队在开进来。
    接着，在所有的公路与小路上出现了“禁区”“不得乱跑”的告示。其中有许多是用英文、法文和德文写的“特别禁区，不得擅入，不准逗留”。美国工兵部队遍驻在各个城镇和乡村里，开路机及动力压路机蹂躏着美丽如画的葡萄园。天空中不时响着喷气式飞机的嘶叫。
    德国报纸也开始把巴拉丁纳特称为“战略三角地带”。很快便真相大白了，美国为什么要取代法国的地位：巴拉丁纳特被变成为美国在德国的一个最大的军事基地。四万个德国人在美国工兵监督下修建工事、飞机场、坦克基地、打靶场和操练场。这些“建筑热潮”化费了西德的纳税人十亿马克。据德国报纸说，巴拉丁纳特的防御工事比之希特勒的“西方壁垒”更为巨大。这不仅是指建造的规模而言，也是指战略目的而言。人们记得，希特勒曾不厌其烦地强调他的工事是为了“防御”的。但是从战争的第一天起，这个谎言就被粉碎了。当时情形很清楚，在西方壁垒的棱堡的后面，纳粹调动着他们的冲锋队楔入法国、卢森堡、比利时及荷兰。
    今天美国的将军们正在强调巴拉丁纳特三角地带的“防御”目的。但是西德报纸的战略家们却早已在测量着从这个三角地带的中心到法国、比利时和卢森堡的边境的距离了。这些距离是非常短的：从凯撒劳登、兰特斯透及罗姆斯汀到法国边境是三十到三十五公里；从比特堡到比利时边境是三十公里，到卢森堡边境只有二十公里。
    当美国在凯撒劳登地方驻扎了一个原子炮营并宣布这种大炮的射程有三十五公里远的时候，这些数字的意义就更明显了。正可能是由于这一个声明和某些其他的考虑，使得“科隆评论报”这样写道：“战争一旦爆发，原子炮弹主要将落在法国的土地上。”
    这家西德报纸所以作出这样尖锐评论的一个重大原因是，巴拉丁纳特三角地带不仅是美国的一个桥头堡，而且还是一个正在复活的阿登纳的复仇主义国防军的基地。去年十一月“西方邮报与南威尔斯新闻报”的记者自法兰克福报道说，“西德军队的美国装备已堆积在凯撒劳登地区的军火库及飞机场中了”，这些装备足够供应十二个师的德国军队。又据德国报纸消息，在这些装备中有给予西德军队的美国坦克三千五百多辆。
    这就是来自巴拉丁纳特的报道。这个安宁而恬静的德国的一角，现在已变成威胁着欧洲各国的安全与和平的华盛顿和波恩侵略势力的“战略三角地带”。
    然而，巴拉丁纳特并不是美国在西德的唯一的最大的军事基地。去年二月“美国新闻与世界报道”曾刊载了一幅全世界的地图，图上意味深长地标着：“遍及全球……有三百五十多处美国基地。”地图上有标志着美国基地的黑点，而在西德部分黑点则特别稠密。
    德国报纸最近也发表了一幅很有意义的地图，描画出在西部地区的军事基地的位置。值得注意的是，在莱茵—巴拉丁纳特地区，巴伐利亚及下萨克森等毗邻法国、比利时、捷克斯洛伐克及德意志民主共和国的地区，基地的黑点特别多。
    虽然四大国有过关于取消德国境内所有军用机场的协议，在西德却仍然保留了二百五十一个空军机场，并且又新建了十八个，其中在靠近美因河畔的法兰克福及汉堡地方的两个机场还修有供美国重型轰炸机用的特别长的跑道。此外还有更多的机场正在建造中：“北大西洋公约组织理事会”的计划规定，在今年将要建造三十个以上的机场。另外已有七十多万公顷的耕地和森林被征作军用。
    德国报纸说，军事基地的修建工程目前正在加速进行；据德意志通讯社的消息，波恩政府并已准备再拨款十二亿马克供此项开支。
    军事基地网正在扩展，以应新的国防军的需要。去年十一月，“纽伦堡八点钟报”曾报道称，在美国占领区的盟军高级专员公署约瑟夫·布莱德雷少将代表驻德美军司令部和波恩政府的军事顾问、纳粹将领许辛格举行了一次会议。他们讨论了为未来的德国军队建造操练场和兵营等等问题。又据其他的报纸消息，在巴登—符腾堡区及西德其他地区的美军兵营正在移交给布兰克部（波恩政府的实际的国防部）。
    差不多与此同时，在美国驱逐舰“豪德尔”号上举行了另一个会议，出席会议的是美国海军少将奥列姆和前纳粹海军上将、现任西德国会议员、波恩海军司令的可能候选人海休。根据德国报纸的报道，他们达成了一项决议，未来的波恩海军以威廉港为基地。据法国“民族论坛报”说，现在的美国基地不来梅亦将由波恩使用。
    美国的空军基地也正被用来训练西德未来空军的技术人员，所训练的不仅是机械士和无线电通讯员。美国和纳粹的飞行员之间的定期“碰头”也成了训练计划的一部分。
    去年四月在巴拉丁纳特的兰特斯透美国机场曾举行过一次这样的“碰头”。曾野蛮地轰炸过鹿特丹和华沙的戈林的雷秋芬中队队员们受到了美国驻欧洲空军参谋长兰登少将的款待。此后不久，“汉堡信使报”宣称，未来德国空军的首批航空队将用美国飞机装备起来。
    这些和许多其它的事实，无容置辩地证实了在西德建立美国空军基地和复活欧洲人民的死敌德国军国主义的政策之间的密切关系。
    一个美国战争基地网在德国西部的出现，是对德国的统一的危害，也是对欧洲安全的重大危险。
    掩盖不了的事实是，这些基地主要地是针对苏联和人民民主国家的。早在一九五○年春天，美国的“新闻周刊”就刊登了一幅地图，图上有两个箭头显示从西德发出的两个战略性攻击的方向。这两个箭头指向华沙和斯捷辛。但是上面所说的“巴拉丁纳特三角地带”的例子和波恩复仇主义者使用其他美国基地的事实说明了，这些基地也是对西欧安全的严重威胁。“纽约先驱论坛报”驻波恩记者谈到在法国、比利时边界附近的军事准备时追溯说，“俾斯麦和威廉第二和希特勒就是通过这儿向西挺进的。”这并不是无所谓的。
    美国基地给西德人民带来了更多的困苦。征用来修建飞机场和操练场的土地足够养活七万户农民，而用在这些基地上的巨款足够盖造成千上万的西德最急迫需要的住宅和学校。
    美国军事基地在西德的存在是德国重新统一的重大障碍。美国侵略势力，首先是军方人士之所以死命反对德国的重新统一的理由之一，就是他们不愿失掉一个像西德这样有价值的有利的地点。维也纳“晚报”引证了美国国防部副部长罗杰·凯斯在去年秋天视察西德基地时对一群美国高级军官的谈话。凯斯说，由美国军事首长草拟的军事计划，不仅要求保持美国在西德的兵力，并且还要把兵力增强。凯斯又说，因此他的国防部认为德国的统一和随之而来的美军的撤退，对美国显然是不利的。
    渴望和平解决一切国际争端和缓和国际紧张局势的爱好和平的人民，对于在波恩德国的美国基地网的存在和扩充是不能熟视无睹的。苏联信守其和平政策，曾经再三提出关于撤除这些基地和所有其它在外国领土上的军事基地的问题。在去年十一月三日致英、法、美三国政府的照会中，苏联政府再次强调指出：“要想按照欧洲安全的利益来解决德国问题，就一定要解决取消上述军事基地的问题。”
    正确的解决这一问题对缓和国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平是十分重要的。

    去年十一月，柏林“新德意志报”刊登了这幅地图，地图的标题是：“阿登纳的政策的结果。美国基地遍布西德。”图上的每一个黑点表示新建或重建的军事基地。
