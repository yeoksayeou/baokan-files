    Northeast Workers Study Wang Chonglun's Work Spirit
    Launching a Mass Production Innovation Upsurge

    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The broad masses of workers in various parts of the Northeast region, learning from Wang Chonglun's work spirit, have launched an upsurge in improving technology and striving to complete the national plan ahead of schedule.
    Wang Chonglun is a planer in the tool workshop of the Machine General Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. From December 1951 to May 1953, he successively improved tools eight times, greatly increasing production efficiency. In the first quarter of 1953, when the workshop was manufacturing rock drill parts, the production capacity of the slotting machine was insufficient, which did not match the work of other processes. It was only able to complete 80% of the monthly production plan, and many products were secondary products. With the support of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the workshop, and with the help of technicians and workers, Wang Chonglun, after painstaking research, created the "universal tool fixture," which replaced the work of the slotting machine with a planer, maximized equipment utilization, overcame the difficulties of equipment imbalance, and increased labor productivity, enabling the workshop to complete more than 200% of the monthly production plan with all products being first-class. After the increase production and practice economy campaign was launched last September, Wang Chonglun inspected his past work, found untapped potential, and set a advanced plan to complete three years of work in 1953. Then he improved the tool bar, increased the number of planer strokes, and replaced hand loosening with a crank-shaped hook to shorten auxiliary production time. On November 18 last year, he completed three years of work ahead of schedule. By December 8 last year, he had completed three and a half years of work. On this basis, Wang Chonglun further formulated a plan to complete four years of work in one year. This revised advanced plan was completed ahead of schedule on December 25 last year. By the end of the year, according to the quota for 1953, Wang Chonglun completed a total of 9,429 shift-hours of work in 2,277 shift-hours of time, that is, he completed four years, one month, and seventeen days of work in one year, increasing production and saving more than 637 million yuan for the country.
    Wang Chonglun fully demonstrated the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, constantly improving technology, overcoming weak links in production, and overfulfilling production plans. His advanced deeds have had a great impact in various parts of the Northeast region. Anshan, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Fushun, Benxi, Changchun, Qiqihar and other cities, as well as Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Liaoxi provinces, have successively held meetings or issued notices to promote Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation and specific experience. Workers in various factories of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have launched an innovation movement to improve tools and expand the efficiency of machine tool utilization. Under the influence of Wang Chonglun, almost everyone in the tool workshop of the Ansteel Machinery General Plant had creations and improvements, large and small, in production. The production efficiency of all machine tools in the workshop has doubled compared with the past. On December 23 last year, they completed two years of work according to last year's quota standards, and completed two years and seventeen days of work throughout the year, with the quality meeting national standards. Inspired by Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, the broad masses of young workers in Qiqihar City launched an upsurge of finding tricks and tapping potential. By the end of last year, more than 200 young workers in the city had made creations. More than 20 young workers in the Qiqihar No. 1 Machine Tool Plant found dozens of tricks of all sizes. Communist Youth League member Guan Changjiang created a wear-resistant cast iron sleeve reaming fixture, which increased production efficiency by 800% and achieved 100% quality. Inspired by Wang Chonglun's spirit of innovation, more than 80 young workers in the Qiqihar Railway Vehicle Plant improved tools and fixtures, shortened auxiliary working hours, and increased production efficiency within half a month. The Han Shuwen team of the Foundry Workshop of Shenyang Water Pump Plant actively engaged in production innovation, completing one year and seven months of the quota in one year. Technical personnel of the Design Section of Shenyang Fan Factory carried out work innovation, and the design tasks of 38 new products can be completed more than five months ahead of schedule. Wang Jingman, deputy director of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, worked with workers to create a vertical grinding fixture, changing manual operation. It is expected that the annual production plan for the worktable process this year can be completed in 51 days. As a result of the production innovation carried out by the workers of the Hong Zuocheng team of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, the team's first quarter plan has the potential to increase by 200% compared with the fourth quarter plan of last year, and it can also be completed ahead of schedule. Workers in textile, paper, rubber and other light industrial factories in various parts of Northeast China actively learned Wang Chonglun's spirit of production innovation, and have also made many improvements in production.
    Wang Chonglun's work attitude and spirit of production innovation have educated the broad masses of workers. Many workers have taken Wang Chonglun as an example and conducted inspections in connection with their own work and thinking. Zhou Guangyi, a worker at Dalian Mining Vehicle Plant, encountered difficulties when studying the Kolesov tool method. But when he thought of Wang Chonglun's spirit of overcoming difficulties in creating universal tool fixtures, he thought: "People can overcome such great difficulties, can't we overcome these difficulties?" So he patiently consulted labor model Zhao Shijian, and finally improved the tool and increased labor efficiency by one time. Cao Shanguo, a plumber at the Shenyang 502 construction site, compared himself with Wang Chonglun and said: "In response to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, I created a tool for pressing asbestos tiles, which doubled the efficiency. If I improve it again, the efficiency can be improved even more, but I was complacent and thought it was enough. Thinking about it, I am really ashamed!" All one hundred and eighty-nine workers in the third workshop of Qiqihar Machine Tool Plant checked their slack labor discipline, failure to cherish machines, or the erroneous idea of working just to earn money, compared to Wang Chonglun. Li Jingyang said: "Wang Chonglun has not had a machine accident in two years, and I have had three accidents in one year. This is not only sorry for the country, but also sorry for such a good machine." All the workers of the Cui Guoshan Rapid Tunneling Brigade of Jixi Mining Bureau believe that they are far behind Wang Chonglun in terms of labor attitude, and unanimously expressed that they will always maintain the spirit of continuous progress and strive to complete this year's task earlier than last year. Many workers in Dalian, Jilin and other places developed the working spirit of bold creation and hard research after checking their shortcomings. Many workers in various places wrote letters to Wang Chonglun, congratulating him and expressing their determination to learn. Wang Chonglun was loved by the broad masses of workers in various places and cared for and supported by the leadership. His confidence in progress has increased a hundredfold. He wrote to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, expressing that he would continue to work hard with all the workers to continue to create higher production achievements, and strive to complete the production plan ahead of schedule and accelerate the country's socialist industrialization.

    东北职工学习王崇伦工作精神
    掀起群众性生产革新热潮
    【本报讯】东北区各地广大职工学习王崇伦的工作精神，掀起了改进技术、为提前全面完成国家计划而斗争的热潮。
    王崇伦是鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂工具车间的刨工，从一九五一年十二月到一九五三年五月，他曾先后改进了八次工具，大大地提高了生产效率。一九五三年第一季度，该车间制造凿岩机零件时，由于插床生产能力不足，配合不上其他工序的工作，每月只能完成产量计划的百分之八十，很多产品是二级品。王崇伦在车间党、行政、工会和青年团的支持下，在技术人员和工人们的帮助下，经过苦心钻研，创造成了“万能工具胎”，以刨床代替插床的工作，发挥了设备利用率，克服了设备不平衡的困难，提高了劳动生产率，使车间每月能完成生产计划百分之二百以上，产品都是一级品。去年九月增产节约竞赛展开以后，王崇伦检查了过去的工作，找到了可挖掘的潜力，订出了一九五三年内完成三年工作量的先进计划。接着他又改进了刀杆，提高了刨床的冲程次数，以拐形钩具代替手松活，缩短生产辅助时间，在去年十一月十八日就提前完成了三年的工作量。到去年十二月八日他就完成了三年半的工作量。在这个基础上，王崇伦又进一步制订了一年完成四年工作量的计划。这个修订了的先进计划，在去年十二月二十五日又提前完成了。到年底，按一九五三年的定额计算，王崇伦总共用二千二百七十七个台时的时间，完成了九千四百二十九个台时的工作量，即一年完成了四年一个月零十七天的工作量，为国家增产节约了六亿三千七百余万元。
    王崇伦充分发挥了工人阶级的积极性和创造性，不断地改进技术，克服生产中的薄弱环节，超额完成生产计划的先进事迹，在东北区各地发生了很大的影响。鞍山、沈阳、旅大、哈尔滨、抚顺、本溪、长春、齐齐哈尔等市和吉林、黑龙江、松江、辽西等省，先后召开会议或发出通知，推广王崇伦的生产革新精神和具体经验。鞍山钢铁公司各厂职工开展了改进工具、扩大机床运用效能的革新运动。鞍钢机械总厂工具车间工人在王崇伦的影响下，几乎每个人在生产上都有大大小小的创造和改进。车间全部机床的生产效率比以前提高了一倍，并在去年十二月二十三日按去年定额标准，完成了两年的工作量，全年完成了两年零十七天的工作量，质量符合国家标准。齐齐哈尔市广大青年工人在王崇伦革新精神的鼓舞下，掀起了找窍门、挖潜力的热潮。到去年年底止，全市已有二百多名青年工人有了创造。齐齐哈尔第一机床厂有二十多名青年工人找出了大小各种窍门数十件。青年团员关长江创造了耐磨铸铁套绞孔胎具，生产效率提高百分之八百，质量达到百分之百。齐齐哈尔机车车辆厂在王崇伦革新精神鼓舞下，半个月内就有八十多名青年工人改进了工、卡具，缩短了辅助工时，提高了生产效率。沈阳水泵厂铸造车间韩述文小组，积极从事生产革新，以一年的时间完成了一年零七个月的定额。沈阳扇风机厂设计科技术人员进行工作革新，三十八种新产品的图纸设计任务，可提前五个多月完成。沈阳第二机床厂副厂长王景满，与职工一道，创造立磨胎具，改变了手工的操作，预计工作台工序今年全年的生产计划，五十一天就可完成。沈阳风动工具厂洪作成小组工人进行生产革新的结果，小组第一季度的计划有条件比去年第四季度计划增加百分之二百，而且还可提前完成。东北区各地纺织、造纸、橡胶等轻工业工厂工人积极学习王崇伦生产革新精神，在生产上也都有了不少的改进。
    王崇伦的劳动态度和生产革新精神，教育了广大的工人。许多工人都以王崇伦为榜样，联系自己的工作和思想，进行了检查。大连工矿车辆厂工人周广义在学习科列索夫车刀法时碰到了困难，但当他想起了王崇伦创造万能工具胎克服困难的精神时，他就想：“人家那么大的困难都能克服，咱这点困难都不能克服吗？”于是他耐心地请教劳动模范赵世俭，终于改进了刀具，提高劳动效率一倍。沈阳五○二工地水暖工曹善果，对照王崇伦检查自己说：“我响应增产节约号召，创造了一个压石绵瓦的工具，效率提高了一倍，假若再改进一下，效率还可提高，可是我就自满啦，认为能凑合就算了，想起来真惭愧！”齐齐哈尔机床一厂三车间有一百八十九个工人都对照王崇伦，检查了自己劳动纪律松懈，不爱护机器，或干活就是为了挣钱等错误思想。李景阳说：“王崇伦两年未出过一次机器事故，我一年就出了三次事故，这不但对不起国家，也对不起这么好的机器。”鸡西矿务局崔国山快速掘进大队全体工人，都认为在劳动态度上比起王崇伦来差得很远，一致表示要永远保持不断前进的精神，争取今年的任务比去年完成得更早。旅大、吉林等地许多工人检查自己的缺点之后，都发扬了大胆创造、刻苦钻研的工作精神。各地许多职工纷纷写信给王崇伦，向他祝贺，向他表示学习的决心。王崇伦受到各地广大职工的爱戴和领导方面的关怀与支持，前进的信心百倍地增加。他曾写信给毛主席和青年团中央委员会，表示要再接再厉和全体职工一道，继续创造更高的生产成绩，为提前全面完成生产计划，加速国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗。
