Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 16th: A rally was held in Milan to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Italian Communist Party newspaper "Unità." Participants included leaders of the Italian Communist Party, Vittorio Vidali, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste, and representatives of public organizations. The Teatro Lirico, where the conference was held, was filled to capacity, and those who could not enter gathered in the square to listen to the proceedings through loudspeakers.

The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, emphasized in his speech that "Unità" has been fighting against fascism and the forces of war for 30 years since its inception, while the newspapers of the big bourgeoisie have sold themselves to fascism and have now become the mouthpieces of American imperialism.

Speaking about the domestic political situation, Togliatti said that public opinion is deeply aware of the need to change the current situation, and even reactionary parties have to admit this.

Referring to the Communist Party's attitude towards the new government, Togliatti said: This government cannot gain the trust of the Communists, because it is a reactionary government, and the politician who leads this government, when he was Minister of the Interior, ordered the shooting of striking workers and peasants.

    陶里亚蒂发表演说论意大利国内政治形势
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社罗马十六日讯：米兰举行大会，庆祝意大利共产党报纸“团结报”创刊三十周年，参加大会的有意大利共产党的领导人、的里雅斯特自由区共产党总书记维多里奥·维达里以及公共团体的代表。大会会场里立克剧院中座无虚席，进不去的人聚集在广场上，从扩音器中听会议的进展情况。
    意大利共产党总书记帕尔米罗·陶里亚蒂在会上发言时着重指出，“团结报”创刊三十年来，一直在与法西斯和战争力量作斗争，而大资产阶级的报纸卖身投靠了法西斯主义，目前成了美帝国主义的喉舌。
    陶里亚蒂谈到国内政治形势说，舆论十分深刻地意识到必须改变目前的形势，连反动党派也不得不承认这一点。
    谈到共产党对新政府的态度时，陶里亚蒂说：这个政府不能得到共产党人的信任，因为这是一个反动政府，领导这个政府的政客在做内政部长的时候，曾下令枪杀罢工的工人和农民。
