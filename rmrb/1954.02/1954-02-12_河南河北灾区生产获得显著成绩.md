    Henan and Hebei Disaster Areas Achieve Remarkable Production Results
    In Henan and Hebei provinces, some disaster-stricken areas have vigorously carried out winter production. Many places have overcome the disaster and are actively preparing for spring plowing.

    Hebei Province planted more than 35.5 million mu of wheat last winter, exceeding the original plan by 7.5 percent, laying a favorable foundation for alleviating the disaster and striving for increased grain production. In the disaster-stricken areas of the province, there are more than 80 kinds of sideline production, and 60 percent of the disaster-stricken villages have achieved "no idle people in the village." The income from sideline production has reached more than 160 billion yuan. Many disaster victims have not only solved their living difficulties but also accumulated some funds to invest in spring plowing production. Before the new year, 36 percent of the disaster-stricken people in Anyang Prefecture, Henan Province, had eliminated the disaster, and the remaining disaster victims were striving to eliminate the disaster before spring plowing. Through transportation and various handicraft sideline production, the disaster victims in Ye County have earned more than 6.1 billion yuan in cash, which can buy more than 8 million jin of coarse grains, equivalent to 99.6 percent of the county's grain shortage. In the self-salvation production movement in Shilipu Village, the county, 66 disaster-stricken households organized 11 mutual aid teams, reasonably divided labor, and specifically arranged agricultural and sideline activities. In addition to completing winter plowing, their sideline income in the past two months has reached more than 36 million yuan, which can buy more than 50,000 jin of coarse grains (the village's grain shortage is more than 33,000 jin). They have currently bought four head of draft animals and built seven new houses. In terms of spring plowing production preparations: Henan Province has plowed more than 90 percent of the autumn fallow land once. Advanced mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives in Anyang and Puyang prefectures have also implemented the double plowing method, deep plowing to a depth of six to eight inches. The 64 agricultural production cooperatives in Anyang Prefecture have accumulated more than 36,000 cartloads of fertilizer. In Zhengyang County, 67 villages in the seventh district have dug more than 3.6 million cartloads of pit mud. Various farmland water conservancy projects built in various places can expand the irrigation area by more than 250,000 mu. Tongxian and Shijiazhuang prefectures in Hebei Province have found more than one million mu of locust eggs, have put up markers, and are preparing to carry out timely control and treatment. Other winter plowing and fertilizer accumulation work are also being carried out in some areas.

    The party and government organs and economic departments in various disaster-stricken areas generally attach great importance to the leadership and support of the disaster victims' self-salvation production work. In winter, Hebei Province allocated a total of more than 93 billion yuan for relief and work relief, and distributed a large number of cotton clothes, quilts, and other materials, which played a great role in solving the difficulties of the disaster victims and boosting production enthusiasm. After the second district of Dongguang County distributed more than 13 million yuan in emergency relief to 207 disaster-stricken households, more than 160 households started sideline production. Anping County, through mutual assistance among the masses and government assistance, repaired more than 700 houses, completely solving the housing problems of the disaster victims. In order to restore and develop production, Hebei Province also held 71 water conservancy and transportation work relief projects, allowing the disaster victims to earn more than 28 billion yuan in wages. The disaster-stricken counties in Henan Province have successively held disaster victim representative meetings or cadre meetings to summarize, exchange experiences, and clarify guiding principles and policies. There are also full-time cadres in various places leading the work of production and disaster relief. According to statistics from more than ten counties such as Shangshui, there are approximately 600 full-time cadres living in the disaster areas. All districts in Xiuwu County held meetings for households with difficulties. Through on-site investigations, cadres in En Village in the fourth district found that 124 households had difficulties in winter plowing, so they held meetings with households with labor and livestock, mobilized and organized 28 yokes of livestock to help households with difficulties plow the fields, plowing more than 120 mu of land in one day. Banks, trade companies, cooperatives, and other departments in various places also systematically support the production of disaster victims.

    However, some places have not done well in leading the production work in disaster areas, especially cadres in lightly disaster-stricken areas have complacency; a few cadres have bureaucratic and conservative ideas, and relief grain and funds are not issued when they should be or are issued slowly; some use sideline loans to support commercial production. The leaders in Hebei Province have corrected these problems and pointed out that with the arrival of spring, production will change with the seasons, and cadres should lead the disaster victims to change the content of production in a timely manner to prevent the aggravation of the spring famine due to idle labor and outflow. Areas that were too busy with self-salvation production in the past and have left white land uncultivated should find ways to remedy them. After the emergency disaster relief meeting was held in Henan Province, all localities paid more attention to the leadership of production and disaster relief. In addition to continuing to lead the disaster victims to work hard in production, emergency relief grain and funds have been issued to individual disaster-stricken households with special difficulties in a timely manner.

    河南河北灾区生产获得显著成绩
    河南、河北两省部分受灾地区大力开展冬季生产，很多地方已战胜了灾荒，积极准备春耕。
    河北省去冬共种麦三千五百多万亩，超过原计划百分之七点五，给减轻灾情，争取粮食增产打下了有利基础。该省受灾地区的副业生产共有八十多种，百分之六十的灾村达到“村无闲人”，副业收入已有一千六百多亿元。很多灾民不但解决了生活困难，还积蓄了一些资金，准备投入春耕生产。河南省安阳专区受灾群众在年前即有百分之三十六消灭了灾荒，其余灾民也都争取在春耕前把灾荒消灭。邺县通过运输和各种手工业副业生产，灾民已收入现款六十一亿多元，可买粗粮八百多万斤，相当于全县缺粮数百分之九十九点六。该县十里铺村在生产自救运动中，有六十六户灾民组织了十一个互助组，合理分工，具体安排了农业和副业活动。他们除完成冬耕外，两个月来的副业收入已达三千六百多万元，可买粗粮五万多斤（全村缺粮三万三千多斤），目前已买了四头耕畜，新盖了七间房子。在春耕生产准备工作方面：河南省已把百分之九十以上的秋歇地耕过一遍，安阳、濮阳专区的先进互助组和农业生产合作社还实行了套犁法，深耕六寸到八寸。安阳专区的六十四个农业生产合作社已积肥三万六千多车。正阳县七区六十七个村挖坑泥三百六十多万车。各地兴修各种农田水利工程共可扩大灌溉面积二十五万多亩。河北省通县、石家庄等专区查出蝗卵一百多万亩，已插好标志，准备进行适时除治。其他冬耕、积肥等工作也都在部分地区展开。
    各受灾地区的党政机关和经济部门，一般都很重视对灾民生产自救工作的领导和支持。河北省在冬季共拨出救济、工赈款九百三十多亿元，并发放了大批棉衣、棉被等物资，对解决灾民困难、鼓舞生产情绪起了很大作用。东光县二区发放一千三百多万元急救二百零七户灾民后，使一百六十多户搞起了副业生产。安平县通过群众互助和政府帮助，修好房屋七百多间，全部解决了灾民住房问题。为了恢复和发展生产，河北省还举办了七十一项水利、交通工赈工程，使灾民获得工资二百八十多亿元。河南省受灾各县都先后召开过灾民代表会或干部会，总结、交流经验，明确方针政策。各地并有专职领导生产救灾工作的干部。据商水等十余县统计，住灾区的专职干部共约六百余人。修武县各区都召开了困难户会议，四区恩村干部通过实地调查，发现一百二十四户冬耕有困难，便分别召开有劳力畜力户会议，动员组织了二十八犋牲口帮助困难户耕田，一天即犁地一百二十多亩。各地银行、贸易公司、合作社等部门也都有计划地支持灾民生产。
    但是，也有些地方对领导灾区生产工作还作得不好，尤其是轻灾区干部有麻痹思想；少数干部有官僚主义和保守思想，救济粮款当发不发或发放迟缓；有的把副业贷款用去支持商业性的生产。河北省领导上对这些问题已作纠正，并指出春季到来，生产将随着季节发生变化，干部要适时领导灾民转变生产内容，防止因劳力闲歇、外流而加重春荒。过去忙于生产自救尚遗留有白地未耕的地方要设法补救。河南省在召开紧急救灾会议以后，各地对生产救灾的领导更加重视，目前除继续领导灾民努力生产外，对个别有特殊困难的灾户已及时发放了急救粮款。　　　　　（徐力之　马维新）
