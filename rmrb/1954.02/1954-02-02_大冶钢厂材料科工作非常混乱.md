    The Materials Section of Daye Steel Plant is Very Chaotic

    A worker from Daye Steel Plant wrote: The work in the materials section of Daye Steel Plant is very chaotic, and the waste and losses caused by this are incalculable.

    The accounts and materials here have been inconsistent for a long time. On the one hand, a large number of materials are stockpiled, and on the other hand, the materials section is still urging the purchasing department to procure them. For example, on December 7th of last year, 31 tons of ferromanganese arrived, but the materials section forgot to record them. On December 10th, they urged the purchasing department again to procure them. Another example is that the materials section routinely copies the plan to purchase a certain type of expensive belt every quarter and every month, but the workshop's inventory of belts is enough for two years.

    The materials section does not base its material plans on actual needs at all. For example, in this year's first-quarter plan, the coke budget is more than 50% higher than the actual need; scrap steel is 60% more; lumber is 70% more; and magnesite, which is not needed in the first quarter at all, is also requested for 500 tons. After a preliminary inspection, of the 263 items in the auxiliary materials plan, 188 should be completely rejected (i.e., not needed at all). According to the plan, the purchase fund is over 100 billion yuan; in reality, only 66 billion yuan is needed.

    The irresponsible management of materials is also serious. When workshops come to collect materials, the materials section often issues more than needed. This not only encourages the "supply system" mentality in the workshops, causing waste, but also causes other workshops that truly need these materials to suffer losses from work stoppages. For example, at the end of November last year, 10,000 pieces of magnesite bricks arrived. The materials section didn't care whether the open-hearth furnace workshop could use them or not, and issued them all at once. When the forging workshop needed them, the materials section issued chrome-magnesite bricks ordered from abroad (which are five or six times more expensive than magnesite bricks). Mistakes in issuing materials also occur constantly. For example, once oxalic acid was issued to the workshop as sulfuric acid, causing an accident. Some materials are lost because they are not stored in the warehouse in a timely manner. For example, a flame cutting machine purchased in 1951 was not found to be unsuitable until October last year and was all sent to the dead stock warehouse.

    The materials section has three section chiefs and a large number of cadres. The chaotic situation in the work is mainly caused by the bureaucracy of the leadership and the irresponsibility of some cadres. It is hoped that they will quickly face up to these shortcomings, correct their mistakes, and improve their work.

### 大冶钢厂材料科工作非常混乱

    大冶钢厂材料科工作非常混乱
    大冶钢厂一个工人来信：大冶钢厂材料科工作非常混乱，因此造成的浪费和损失真是无法计算。
    这里的账料长期不符，一方面大批材料积压着，另一方面材料科还向采购部门催要。例如去年十二月七日到了三十一吨锰铁，材料科忘了上账，到十二月十日又向采购部门催要。又如材料科每季每月照例都抄造计划购进某号贵重皮带，而车间的库存皮带足够两年之用。
    材料科在制订材料计划时完全不根据实际需要。如今年第一季度计划中，焦炭预算较实际需要多出百分之五十以上；废钢多了百分之六十；木料一项多了百分之七十；镁砂根本不需要在第一季度进货，也要了五百吨。经初步检查，辅助材料计划的二百六十三项中应全部推翻的（即根本不需要）就有一百八十八项。按照计划，购料资金为一千亿元以上；实际上只需要六百六十亿元就够了。
    材料管理上不负责任的情况也是严重的。各车间来领料时，材料科往往随便多发。这不但助长了车间的“供给制”思想，造成浪费；并且又使其它真正需要这些材料的车间受到停工待料的损失。如去年十一月底来了镁砖一万块，材料科不管平炉车间是否用得了，一下子就发下去了；等到锻造车间要用时，材料科就发给国外订货的铬镁砖（较镁砖贵五、六倍）。发错材料的事情也不断发生，如有一次把草酸当硫酸发给车间，造成了事故。有些材料因不及时收库而受到损失，如一九五一年购入的火焰切机，到去年十月才发现不合用，全部送入了呆料库。
    材料科共有三个科长，干部也并不少。工作中的混乱情况，主要是领导方面的官僚主义和某些干部的不负责任所造成的。希望他们迅速正视这些缺点，纠正错误，改进工作。
