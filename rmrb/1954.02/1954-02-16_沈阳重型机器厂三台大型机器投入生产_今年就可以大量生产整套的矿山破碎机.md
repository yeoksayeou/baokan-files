Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang Electric Dispatch:

    The production capacity of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, currently our country's largest heavy machinery plant, has been greatly enhanced by the installation of three large machines. These three machines are a 2,000-ton hydraulic press, a 5-meter vertical lathe, and a 5-meter spiral milling machine. These three machines have been officially put into production one after another. The difficulties the plant had in processing large parts have been resolved with these three large machines. The 2,000-ton hydraulic press can be used to press steel ingots weighing up to thirty tons into large shafts, main shafts, crankshafts, and other shapes. The 5-meter vertical lathe can process various circular workpieces up to eight meters in diameter. The 5-meter spiral milling machine can process various forms of giant gears up to five meters in diameter. These parts can be used to assemble a wide variety of mining machines, enabling our country to produce a large number of complete sets of mining machines to meet the needs of the national mining industry. With these three machines, the complete set of mining crushers successfully trial-produced by the plant last year can be mass-produced this year. At the same time, the plant now has the conditions to trial-produce mining sintering machines and other heavy machinery this year. The parts processed by these three machines can also be used to assemble generators, train axles, ship propellers, and so on. This year, the plant has planned to use the remaining production capacity of these three machines to forge and process large parts for other machine plants, assisting other machine plants in production.

    沈阳重型机器厂三台大型机器投入生产
    今年就可以大量生产整套的矿山破碎机
    【新华社沈阳电】目前我国最大的重型机器厂——沈阳重型机器厂的生产能力已因安装了三台大型机器而大大提高一步。这三台机器是——两千吨水压机、五公尺立式车床和五公尺螺旋铣床。这三台机器已先后正式投入生产。有了这三台大型机器，该厂加工大型部件的困难就得到了解决。两千吨水压机可用来把重达三十吨的钢锭压成各种形状的大轴、主轴、曲轴等；五公尺立式车床可以加工各种直径达八公尺长的圆形工作物；五公尺螺旋铣床则可加工直径达五公尺长的各种形式的巨型齿轮。这些部件，可以用来装配各式各样的矿山机器，使我国生产出大量成套的矿山机器来，满足国家采矿工业的需要。有了这三台机器，该厂去年试制成功的整套矿山破碎机，今年就可以大量生产了，同时该厂今年试制矿山用烧结机和其他重型机器，也有了条件。这三台机器加工的部件，还可以用来装配发电机、火车轮轴、轮船推进器等。今年该厂已计划用这三台机器的剩余生产能力，为其他机器厂锻造和加工大部件，协助其他机器厂生产。
