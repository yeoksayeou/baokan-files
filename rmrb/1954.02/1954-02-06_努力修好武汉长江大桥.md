The State Council of the Central People's Government has passed a decision on the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which the Chinese people have longed for, is about to begin construction. This is a major event in the process of China's socialist industrialization, and the people of the whole country will congratulate and support this great construction project with unparalleled enthusiasm.

The Yangtze River is the largest river in China and one of the largest rivers in the world. However, this huge river lacks a modern bridge connecting the north and south of the motherland. The mainland of the motherland is separated by the rolling river, and north-south traffic is blocked here. Wuhan, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has the Jinghan Railway with a total length of 1,220 kilometers connecting it to the capital of China, and the Yuehan Railway with a total length of 1,102 kilometers connecting it to Guangzhou, the largest city in southern China, as well as highways leading to Hunan, Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, making it the center of China's central highway network. However, due to the lack of a bridge spanning the two banks of the Yangtze River, the north-south transportation lines cannot form a whole. All materials going north and south have to be transferred by ferry and wooden boats, which is not only weak in carrying capacity and cannot meet the needs of the country, but also takes a lot of time and increases transportation costs. Moreover, there are several days of strong winds and waves and heavy fog on the Yangtze River every month, and ships and wooden boats have to be forced to stop. The more than one million residents of Wuhan rely on ferries and wooden boats to travel an average of 115,000 times a day, which is very inconvenient, and accidents on the water are often heard. The Chinese people's ardent desire to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge and connect north-south transportation is obvious.

The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was discussed as early as the period of the Northern Warlord Government. In 1913, Chinese engineers conducted the first survey of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. During the Kuomintang rule, there were several clamors to build the bridge, and Chinese engineers conducted three more surveys. However, for forty years, the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has always been a lie of successive reactionary governments, and the people's wishes and the efforts of engineering personnel have been in vain. Only after the founding of the People's Republic of China did the people's wishes have the possibility of realization, and the efforts of engineering personnel have a home. The Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, while establishing a ferry project in Wuhan to maintain north-south transportation, studied the existing four survey data. In 1950, according to the instructions of the Central People's Government, a large number of engineering personnel were organized to start the survey and design work of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, after two years and nine months of drilling, four comparison lines were made, and three design meetings were held with domestic bridge experts, professors, and relevant units to complete the preliminary design of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and the Soviet government was asked to help us appraise these designs. The Soviet government accepted the request of our government and appointed 25 famous experts to participate in the appraisal of the preliminary design of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Now, a component of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge—the Hanshui Railway Bridge—has officially started construction, and the main bridge project is also actively preparing.

The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is of great significance to China's economic construction. The construction policy of my country's first five-year plan is to concentrate efforts on building heavy industry, but at the same time, transportation must be developed accordingly to complete the transportation tasks of increasingly growing production and commodity circulation and ensure the country's socialist industrial construction and national defense construction. At present, my country is starting to build new iron and steel enterprises in the Central and South China region. Soon, new tractor factories and automobile manufacturing plants will be built in the Central and South China region, and some non-ferrous metal mines will be expanded. An unprecedented transportation task has been placed on the Yangtze River ferry. If a bridge spanning the Yangtze River is not built, if ferries and wooden boats continue to be used to connect north-south transportation, and if the winds and waves and fog of the Yangtze River continue to interrupt navigation, it will not be able to meet the ever-increasing transportation requirements, and the construction of these new industries will encounter many difficulties, and the normal production after the future construction will also encounter great difficulties. Therefore, the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is very timely, and the existing Xianggui Railway, Zhegan Railway, and the railways to be newly built in the south that run through Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, and through Jiangxi and Fujian, can all be directly or indirectly connected to the northern railway trunk lines through the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, which will greatly shorten the transportation distance on our country's vast land, which will further promote the exchange of materials throughout the country. At the same time, the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will also connect the three towns of Wuhan into one.

The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has opened up a new history in China's bridge construction industry. Chinese engineering personnel have made many efforts and achieved many results in bridge construction projects over the past few decades. The Qiantang River Railway Bridge was designed by Chinese engineering personnel themselves. However, because the reactionary government of old China has always put the country's construction undertakings behind it, the efforts of Chinese engineering personnel have not only failed to receive support, but have been restricted everywhere. Therefore, we have never built a large-scale railway bridge entirely with our own strength. The Yellow River Railway Bridge 50 years ago was contracted by Belgium, and the main structural parts of the subsequent Qiantang River Railway Bridge were also contracted by three "foreign firms" in Germany, Britain, and Denmark. This makes it impossible for us to systematically accumulate our own bridge construction experience, and we have not been able to form our own bridge construction team, so China's bridge construction industry has been stagnant for a long time. The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will change the face of China's bridge construction industry. In the past three years, the engineering personnel and geological personnel who have presided over the survey and design work of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge have received strong support from the state in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and have also received the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. They have overcome many difficulties and painstakingly explored the geological conditions of the rock strata at the bottom of the Yangtze River. After repeated research and comparison, from the overall interests of the national economy, both the most economical construction of the bridge and the requirements of navigation and other relevant departments for the use of the Yangtze River were considered, and the most reasonable route and bridge type were selected, and the preliminary design of this great project was completed. This fully demonstrates the improvement of the political and ideological level and scientific and technological level of our engineering personnel. At the same time, the entire project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge will also be built with our own materials and by our own manpower. Therefore, this project will also be the best bridge construction school in our country, which will train a group of bridge construction talents for our country and begin to accumulate bridge construction experience, laying the foundation for the development of China's bridge construction industry.

The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is one of the great construction projects in China's socialist industrial construction. Its engineering is extremely difficult and its technology is extremely complex. Such a difficult and complex project is rare in the history of bridge engineering in the world. The decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is only the beginning of this huge construction project. To turn it into reality is by no means an easy task, and it still requires arduous struggle. The Central Ministry of Railways and other ministries responsible for this arduous project must be cautious and strive to complete this project task with good quality, so as not to fail the expectations of the people of the whole country. The Central Ministry of Railways should complete the technical design of the main bridge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge on schedule with a hundredfold effort, complete the task of opening the Hanshui Railway Bridge to traffic, and carry out the preparation work for the project. The Central Ministry of Geology should use excellent engineering geological experts to assist the Central Ministry of Railways in geological exploration and data appraisal during technical design and construction, and be responsible for making conclusions on geological issues. The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry should supply rolled steel with a quality that meets the standards without error. The Central Ministry of Transportation should vigorously supply the ships needed for bridge construction, and cooperate with relevant shipping aspects during construction. The Central Ministry of Forestry should be responsible for supplying the timber needed for bridge construction. The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry should ensure that there is sufficient power supply for bridge construction. The Central Ministry of Water Resources should ensure the supply of hydrological data required for bridge design. The Party, government, and mass organizations in Wuhan should be responsible for doing a good job in the political work during the entire project and help solve various difficulties in the bridge construction. Domestic bridge and construction engineering experts and scientists and professors should care about the construction of this bridge and actively provide various opinions on the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

The Mao Zedong era is an era of turning the ideals of thousands of people into reality, and an era of creating miracles by thousands of people. Even if there are thousands of difficulties in the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, our people will surely be able to overcome them. Soviet experts will also help us solve various technical difficulties. We believe that the history of north-south traffic being separated by the Yangtze River will soon come to an end, and the Yangtze River Bridge erected on the three towns of Wuhan will once again announce to the world: the wisdom and strength of the Chinese people are infinite.

### 努力修好武汉长江大桥

    努力修好武汉长江大桥
    中央人民政府政务院通过了关于修建武汉长江大桥的决定。中国人民渴望已久的武汉长江大桥即将开始修建。这是我国社会主义工业化进程中的一件大事，全国人民都将以无比的热情来祝贺和支援这个伟大的建设工程。
    长江是我国第一条大河，也是世界上最大的河流之一。但是在这一巨大的河流上，却缺乏一座近代化的连接祖国南北方的桥梁，祖国的大陆被滚滚的江水隔断，南北交通在这里受到阻挡。屹立在长江中游的武汉市，虽有全长一千二百二十公里的京汉铁路联接着我国的首都，有全长一千一百零二公里的粤汉铁路和我国南方最大的城市广州相通，有通达湖南、四川、河南、陕西、安徽、江西各省的公路，成为我国中部公路网的中心，但由于缺少一座横跨长江两岸的大桥，南北交通线路不能组成一个整体。所有北上南下的物资都要经过轮渡和木船转运，这不仅运载力量薄弱，不能适应国家要求，而且辗转费时，增大运输成本，每月长江又有几天大风大浪，浓雾弥天，轮船、木船不得不被迫停航。一百余万人口的武汉市，每日依靠轮渡、木划来往的市民平均达十一万五千人次，来往很不方便，水上失事常有所闻。中国人民对修建武汉长江大桥，沟通南北运输的热切愿望是显而易见的。
    武汉长江大桥的修建远在北洋军阀政府时即有此议；一九一三年，中国工程人员就第一次进行了武汉长江大桥的测量工作。到了国民党统治时，也曾几次喧嚷着要修桥，中国工程人员又复进行了三次测量工作。可是，四十年来，修建武汉长江大桥永远是历代反动政府的一派谎言，人民的愿望，工程界人士的努力都付之东流。只有中华人民共和国成立后，人民的愿望才有了实现的可能，工程人员的努力也才有了依归。中央人民政府铁道部一面在武汉建立轮渡工程，维持南北运输，一面即研究了旧有的四次测量资料。一九五零年根据中央人民政府的指示，又组织了大批工程人员开始进行武汉长江大桥的勘测设计工作，在苏联专家的指导下，经过两年零九个月的钻探，作了四个比较线，召开了三次有国内桥梁专家、教授和有关单位参加的设计会议，才完成了武汉长江大桥的初步设计，并请苏联政府帮助我们对这些设计加以鉴定，苏联政府接受我国政府的请求，委派了二十五位著名的专家参加了武汉长江大桥初步设计的鉴定工作。现在，武汉长江大桥的一个组成部分——汉水铁桥已经正式开工了，正桥工程也正积极进行准备。
    修建武汉长江大桥，对我国的经济建设有着重要的意义。我国第一个五年计划建设的方针，是集中力量建设重工业，但同时也必须相应地发展交通运输事业，以完成日益增长的生产和商品流通的运输任务，保证国家的社会主义工业建设和国防建设。目前，我国正着手在中南地区建设新的钢铁企业，不久还将在中南地区建设新的拖拉机工厂、汽车制造厂，扩建一些有色金属矿，一个空前未有的运输任务已经摆在长江渡口上，如果不修建一座横跨长江的大桥，如果继续用轮渡和木划来衔接南北运输，如果继续让长江的风浪和迷雾打断航行，就不能适应日益增长的运输要求，这些新的工业的建设就会遇到不少困难，将来建设成功后的正常生产也会遭到很大困难。因此，修建武汉长江大桥是十分适时的，而且现有的湘桂路、浙赣路和将来要在南方新建的贯串湖南、贵州、四川与贯串江西、福建的铁路，都可直接或间接通过武汉长江大桥和北方各铁路干线连结起来，使我们祖国辽阔广大的土地在运输上大大缩短了距离，这就会进一步促进全国范围内的物资交流。同时，武汉长江大桥的修建，也使武汉三镇将连结为一。
    武汉长江大桥的兴建，开辟了我国桥梁建设事业的新历史。中国工程人员数十年来在桥梁建设工程中作过许多努力，有过很多成绩，钱塘江铁桥就是中国工程人员自己设计的。可是，由于旧中国的反动政府一向把国家建设事业置诸脑后，中国工程人员的努力不但得不到支持，反而处处受到限制，因此我们从来没有完全用自己的力量建设过一座规模巨大的铁路桥梁。五十年前的黄河铁桥是由比利时包工的，其后的钱塘江铁桥的主要结构部分也是由德国、英国、丹麦三个“洋行”分别承包的。这就不可能使我们系统地积累自己的桥梁建设经验，没有能组成自己的桥梁建设队伍，中国的桥梁建设事业也就长期停滞不前。武汉长江大桥的修建将改变我国桥梁建设事业的面貌。三年来，主持武汉长江大桥勘测设计工作的工程人员和地质人员在人力、物力、财力上得到国家的大力支持，又得到苏联专家的无私援助，克服了重重困难，艰苦地探寻了长江水底的岩层地质情况，经过反复的研究比较，从国民经济的整体利益出发，既考虑了最经济地建设桥梁，又考虑了航运等有关部门对利用长江的要求，选择了最合理的线路和桥式，完成了这个伟大工程的初步设计。这充分表示了我国工程人员政治思想水平和科学技术水平的提高。同时武汉长江大桥的全部工程还将用自己的材料由我国自己的人力来建设。因此，这个工程也将是我国一座最好的桥梁建设学校，将为我国培养出一批桥梁建设人才，开始积累起桥梁建设经验，为我国桥梁建设事业的发展奠定基础。
    武汉长江大桥是我国社会主义工业建设中伟大的建设工程之一，它的工程是极其艰巨的，技术也是极为复杂的。这样艰巨复杂的工程，即在世界各国桥梁工程历史上也是少有的。中央人民政府政务院修建武汉长江大桥的决议，只是这个巨大建设工程的开端，要把它变成事实，决不是一件轻而易举的事，还需要经过艰苦的斗争。担任这一艰巨工程的中央铁道部及其他各部必须谨慎从事，努力以赴，保证质量良好地完成这一工程任务，才不会辜负全国人民的期望。中央铁道部应该以百倍的努力按期完成武汉长江大桥正桥的技术设计，完成汉水铁桥通车的任务，并进行工程的准备工作。中央地质部应该以优秀的工程地质专家，协助中央铁道部进行技术设计及施工中的地质勘探和资料鉴定工作，并负责对地质问题作出结论。中央重工业部应该无误地供应质量合乎规定标准的压延钢材。中央交通部应该大力供应建桥中所需要的船舶，在施工中并就有关航运方面予以配合，中央林业部应该负责供应建桥所需的木材，中央燃料工业部应该保证大桥施工有足够的电源，中央水利部应该保证供给大桥设计所需的水文资料。武汉市的党、政府、群众团体应该负责做好全部工程进行中的政治工作，并帮助解决大桥施工中的各种困难。国内的桥梁和建筑工程专家、科学家教授要关怀这座大桥的修建，积极提供建设武汉长江大桥的各种意见。
    毛泽东时代是一个把千万人的理想变成现实的时代，是一个千万人民创造奇迹的时代。武汉长江大桥的工程即使有万种困难，我们的人民也一定能够战胜它。苏联专家更会帮助我们解决各种技术上的困难。我们相信：南北交通被长江隔断的历史很快就要结束，架设在武汉三镇上的长江大桥将再一次向全世界宣布：中国人民的智慧和力量是无穷无尽的。
