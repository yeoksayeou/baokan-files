More Than Two Thousand Private Commercial Households in Guangzhou
　　Gradually Embark on the Path of State Capitalism

Since liberation, more than 2,300 private commercial households in Guangzhou have successively embarked on the path of state capitalism and have begun to improve their business management.

As of the end of January this year, private commercial businesses that have fully or partially embarked on the path of state capitalism include 18 industries such as wheeled transport, automobile transport, hardware, telecommunications equipment, new medicines, chemicals, dyes, pigments, oils and sugar, groceries, rice and grain, mountain goods, fuel, cigarettes, and wine. The forms adopted include joint public-private ownership, wholesale purchasing, consignment purchasing, and specialized commission sales.

There are a total of seven joint public-private commercial enterprises (mainly import and export and transportation). After joint public-private ownership, the superiority of the state capitalist economy is generally demonstrated. For example, Guangzhou's private bamboo merchants, before cooperating with the state-owned economy, mostly lost money and had chaotic operations. Since 1951, when they cooperated with the state-owned economy to establish the joint public-private South China Bamboo Industry Company, their business has continuously developed. In addition to exporting bamboo, they have also opened up the domestic market and begun to invest in industrial production. The turnover in 1953 increased more than twofold compared to 1951, labor-management relations and business management have improved, and profits have continuously increased.

More than 1,300 private commercial households have adopted the form of purchasing goods wholesale and selling them at prices stipulated by the state. In the fourth quarter of last year, due to the expansion of processing, ordering, and exclusive sales of industrial products by state-owned commercial enterprises, and the control of sources of goods such as hardware, telecommunications equipment, new medicines, chemicals, dyes, and pigments, private retailers engaged in these commodities established relatively normal purchase and sale relationships with state-owned commercial departments. Due to the establishment of the wholesale purchase system, private retailers have a grasp on their sources of goods and have obtained reasonable profits, avoiding losses caused by free competition and blind operation in the market. Therefore, the business of many merchants has improved compared to the past, and sales have increased. For example, Lin Shun'an Hardware Store used to have stagnant business due to poor management and lack of access to goods. Since November of last year, after purchasing wholesale from the state-owned Guangzhou Hardware Company, more than 70 percent of the goods in the store have been supplied according to plan by state-owned commercial departments, which has led to a gradual improvement in business.

In addition, in the third and fourth quarters of last year, some private commercial industries in Guangzhou also adopted forms such as consignment purchasing and specialized commission sales. Since the third quarter of last year, various procurement and supply stations of state-owned commercial enterprises in Guangzhou have generally signed agreements with private import and export merchants to purchase imported goods according to the agreements. In addition, in November of last year, the state-owned Guangzhou Grain Company entrusted Guangzhou's rice and grain retailers to sell rice and grain on commission. At the beginning of January this year, the state-owned Guangzhou Oils and Fats Company organized more than 80 private merchants to sell edible oil in order to appropriately expand the edible oil supply network.

### 广州市二千多私营商业户  逐步走上国家资本主义轨道

    广州市二千多私营商业户
    逐步走上国家资本主义轨道
    解放以来，广州市已有二千三百多家私营商业户先后走上国家资本主义轨道，并开始改善经营管理。
    至今年一月底止，全部或是部分走上国家资本主义轨道的私营商业有轮运、汽车承运、五金、电讯器材、新药、化工、染料、颜料、油糖、杂货、米粮、山货、燃料、卷烟、酒等十八个行业。所采取的形式有公私合营、批购、代购、专业代销等。
    公私合营商业共有七家（主要是进出口和交通运输）。在公私合营后，一般地显示出国家资本主义经济的优越性。如广州市私营篱竹商，和国营经济合作以前，蚀多赚少，业务混乱，自从一九五一年和国营经济合作，成立公私合营的华南竹业公司后，业务获得不断的发展，除了经营篱竹出口外，还开辟了国内市场，并开始向工业生产投资。一九五三年营业额比一九五一年增加了两倍以上，劳资关系和经营管理都有所改善，盈利也不断增加。
    采取批购商品并按照国家规定价格出售的形式的私营商业有一千三百多户。去年第四季度由于国营商业扩大了工业品的加工、订货、包销，掌握了五金、电讯器材、新药、化工、染料、颜料等货源后，经营这类商品的私营零售商和国营商业部门建立一定的比较正常的购销关系。由于批购形式的建立，私营零售商货源有了把握，并取得了合理的利润，避免了在市场上因自由竞争、盲目经营而招致的损失，因而，不少商户的营业比前好转，销货额增加。如五金业的林顺安号，过去由于经营不善，货源无把握，使业务停滞，从去年十一月份起向国营广州市五金公司进行批购后，店内百分之七十以上商品均由国营商业部门按计划供应，使营业逐月好转。
    此外，在去年第三、第四季度，广州市部分私营商业行业还采用了代购、专业代销等形式，从去年第三季度起，广州市国营商业各采购供应站普遍与私营进出口商订立协议书，按协议书收购进口货。另外，在去年十一月国营广州市粮食公司委托广州市米粮零售商代销米粮。今年一月初国营广州市油脂公司为了适当扩大食油供应网，组织了八十余家私商销售食油。
