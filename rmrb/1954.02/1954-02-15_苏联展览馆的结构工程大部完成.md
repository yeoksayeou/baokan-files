    Structural Engineering of the Soviet Exhibition Hall Largely Completed
    (Xinhua News Agency, February 14th) After intensive winter construction, more than 85% of the reinforced concrete structure of the Soviet Exhibition Hall project has been completed. The structures of the Agriculture Pavilion, Culture Pavilion, Restaurant, and Cinema have been completed, and the formwork is being removed and bricklaying is starting. The structures of the Central Hall and the Industry Pavilion are progressing rapidly.
    Since the beginning of January, the weather has been severe, the buildings have been continuously rising, and the structures such as beams, columns, and arches have become more complex. However, under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, the construction workers still overfulfilled the January construction plan by 9%. Soviet experts frequently participate in on-site production meetings and sometimes visit the construction site late at night to check the progress and quality of the project, promptly helping to solve various difficult problems. The workers feel honored to participate in this construction project, which symbolizes Sino-Soviet friendship, and strive to learn from the advanced Soviet experience in winter construction. The workers mixing concrete, following the suggestions of Soviet experts, have done a good job in keeping warm, reducing the moisture content of the concrete, and implementing a one-time feeding method. As a result, not only has efficiency improved, but the quality is also good; even the concrete mixed on winter nights at -12 degrees Celsius has not cracked due to freezing. The workers pouring concrete often take off their cotton clothes and go into the concrete pouring troughs in the cold open air to tamp it down. The brick-cutting team of Guan Shuangquan originally planned to cut 200 bricks per person per day. Feeling that the efficiency was not high, they actively learned the assembly line method, and now the highest output can reach 360 bricks. The carpentry teams of Dai Arong, Feng Linquan, Wang Di, and others frequently exceed the plan by about 30%, with the highest exceeding 60%. In order to complete the construction task ahead of schedule, more than 700 construction workers refused to leave the construction site during the Spring Festival holiday. Carpenter Chen Baoquan originally planned to get married, but he wrote home saying, "I will come back to get married after I complete this project with international significance."
    The construction workers' achievements in the first month of the new year have been congratulated by Peng Zhen, the Mayor of Beijing, Song Yuhe, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering of the Central People's Government, and Ji Chao Ding, the Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.

### 苏联展览馆的结构工程大部完成

    苏联展览馆的结构工程大部完成
    【新华社十四日讯】经过紧张的冬季施工，苏联展览馆工程的钢筋混凝土结构已经做好了百分之八十五以上。其中农业馆、文化馆、餐厅和电影馆的结构已经完成，正在拆除模板并开始砌砖；中央大厅和工业馆的结构正在迅速进行。
    进入一月份以来，气候严寒，建筑物不断在增高，梁、柱、圆拱等结构更加复杂多了。但是建馆职工们在苏联专家的具体指导下，仍是超额百分之九完成了一月份的施工计划。苏联专家经常参加工地的生产会议，有时在深夜还到工地检查工程的进度和质量，及时帮助解决各种疑难问题。职工们都以参加这个标志中苏友谊的建馆工程而感到光荣，并努力学习苏联先进的冬季施工经验。搅拌混凝土的工人根据苏联专家建议，做好保暖工作，减少混凝土的水分，并实行一次进料的方法，因此不但效率提高，而且质量也好，即使在摄氏零下十二度的冬夜搅拌的混凝土，也都没有发生冻裂现象。浇灌混凝土的工人经常在寒冷的露天里，脱掉棉衣到浇灌混凝土的槽子里去捣固。砍砖工人关双泉小组原来计划每人每天砍二百块砖，他们感到效率不高，就积极学习流水作业法，现在最高可以达到三百六十块砖。木工戴阿荣、封林泉、王弟等小组经常超过计划百分之三十左右，最多的超额百分之六十以上。为了提前完成建馆任务，有七百多个建筑工人到了春节假期也不肯离开工地。木工陈宝泉本来要结婚，但他写信回家说：“等我完成这项富有国际意义的工程以后，我再回来结婚。”
    建馆职工们由于新年第一个月中所获得的成就，曾得到北京市人民政府市长彭真、中央人民政府建筑工程部副部长宋裕和、国际贸易促进委员会秘书长冀朝鼎等的来信祝贺。
