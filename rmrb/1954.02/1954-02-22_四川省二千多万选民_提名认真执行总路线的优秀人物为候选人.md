    Over Twenty Million Voters in Sichuan Province
    Nominate Outstanding Individuals Who Conscientiously Implement the General Line as Candidates
    In the grassroots election campaign in Sichuan Province, over twenty million voters, with a common aspiration, enthusiastically nominated those outstanding individuals who conscientiously implement the General Line and lead the masses on the road of mutual aid and cooperation as their representative candidates.
    This round of the general election in Sichuan Province is being carried out in over seven thousand two hundred grassroots electoral units. Currently, the lists of representative candidates have been put forward in most areas of the province. Some areas with faster progress have already convened election meetings and formally elected people's representatives. In the process of nominating representative candidates, all localities have paid attention to educating voters on the General Line and the general election using real people and real events from their local areas. Voters in the Eighth Village of Wan'an Township, Luojiang County, recalled the fact that under the leadership of village head Zhang Siquan, the village organized eleven mutual aid teams, which led to increased rice production last year. They realized that only by electing such outstanding individuals to the grassroots political power can the implementation of the General Line be guaranteed. The slogan "Elect a good leader to lead everyone to socialism" has become the common aspiration of millions of voters. In many areas, voters automatically take "supporting the General Line and actively leading mutual aid and cooperation" as the main condition for identifying representative candidates. Ren Shangyu, the group representative of the Second Village of Liangshan Township, Jiange County, has consistently been active and responsible in his work. The voters nominated him as a representative candidate, but the voters of the second electoral group did not understand him and expressed opposition. After other voter groups took the initiative to introduce the situation to them, and they themselves conducted investigations and visits, and learned that Ren Shangyu had worked actively in publicizing the General Line and purchasing grain, they agreed to nominate Ren Shangyu as a representative candidate.
    Currently, a large number of outstanding individuals who actively lead the masses on the road of mutual aid and cooperation have been nominated by voters as representative candidates. Among them, outstanding Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, agricultural producers' cooperative chairmen, and mutual aid team leaders are most loved by the voters. According to statistics from fourteen townships in Nanchong, Luojiang, Guangyuan and other counties, among the seven hundred and twenty representative candidates, three hundred and thirty-four are outstanding Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and agricultural producers' cooperative chairmen and mutual aid team leaders. Wang Zicheng, a farmer from Gongping Township, Wenjiang County, is a model worker in the county. The mutual aid team he leads has always been very solid. In the process of publicizing the General Line, he also united other mutual aid teams to form a joint group of forty-two households, actively creating conditions to prepare for the establishment of an agricultural producers' cooperative. In the process of discussing representative candidates, the voters in the village unanimously mentioned his name. The voters said: Who else should we elect if we don't elect someone who actively leads us on the road to socialism?

    四川省二千多万选民
    提名认真执行总路线的优秀人物为候选人
    在四川省的基层选举运动中，二千多万选民怀着共同的心愿，热烈提名那些认真执行总路线、领导群众走互助合作道路的优秀人物作为自己的代表候选人。
    四川省这期普选工作是在七千二百多个基层选举单位展开的。目前，全省绝大部分地区已提出了代表候选人的名单。部分工作进展较快的地区已召开了选举大会，正式选出了人民代表。在代表候选人提名过程中，各地都注意用当地的真人真事向选民进行总路线和普选的教育。罗江县万安乡八村的选民回忆了该村在村长张思全领导下，组织起十一个互助组，使去年水稻得到增产的事实，认识到只有把这样的优秀人物选到基层政权中来，才能保证总路线的贯彻执行。“选好带路人，领导大家走到社会主义”的口号，已成为千百万选民的共同心愿。许多地区的选民自动把“拥护总路线，积极领导互助合作”作为鉴别代表候选人的主要条件。剑阁县凉山乡二村小组代表任尚玉，工作一贯积极负责，选民们提他为代表候选人，但第二选民小组的选民不了解他，表示反对。经过其他选民小组主动向他们介绍情况，他们自己又进行了调查访问，了解到任尚玉在宣传总路线和购粮中积极工作的情况后，他们才同意提任尚玉为代表候选人。
    目前，大批积极领导群众走互助合作道路的优秀人物已被选民们提名为代表候选人。其中优秀的共产党员、青年团员、农业生产合作社社长和互助组组长等最受选民爱戴。据南充、罗江、广元等县十四个乡的统计，在七百二十多名代表候选人中，有三百三十四人是优秀的共产党员、青年团员以及农业生产合作社社长和互助组组长。温江县公平乡农民王子成是该县的劳动模范，他领导的互助组一直很巩固，在宣传总路线的过程中，又联合其他互助组成立了一个四十二户的联组，积极创造条件准备建立农业生产合作社。在讨论代表候选人过程中，该村选民一致提到他的名字。选民们说：这样积极领导我们走社会主义道路的人，不选他选谁？
