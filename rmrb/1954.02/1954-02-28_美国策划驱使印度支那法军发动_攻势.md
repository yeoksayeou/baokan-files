Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The United States government is plotting to increase "aid" to drive the French aggressor troops in Indochina, who are in a passive and beaten position, to launch an "offensive." According to the Associated Press, in order to enable the French army to "increase the mobile reserves that can quickly transfer from one dangerous stronghold to another," "the (US) Department of Defense is actively considering providing more transport aircraft, including large C-119 aircraft, for the Indochina War."
　　The matter of the French army launching an offensive was decided by the director of the U.S. Foreign Operations Administration, Stassen, during a meeting with French Minister of Defense Pleven in Da Lat on the 21st. According to the Associated Press, the purpose is to "adjust the French army's positions and seize the initiative of the battle from the Communists." In order to finalize the French army's "next campaign plan," the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, has invited the French Chief of Staff, Ely, to go to Washington recently to discuss the amount of U.S. military supplies and financial aid needed for the "next campaign."

    美国策划驱使印度支那法军发动“攻势”
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国政府正在策划增加“援助”以驱使处于被动挨打地位的印度支那的法国侵略军发动“攻势”。据合众社透露，为了使法军“可以增加能够从一个危险据点迅速转移到另一个据点去的机动后备队”，“（美国）国防部正在积极考虑为印度支那战争提供更多的运输机，包括大型的C一一九型飞机在内”。
    关于法军发动攻势的事情，是美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生二十一日在大叻与法国国防部长普利文举行会谈时决定的，据合众社说，目的在于“使法军的阵地得到调整并把战斗的主动权从共军手里夺过来”。为了最后确定法军的“下一次战役计划”美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福已邀请法国总参谋长埃利在最近到华盛顿去，商谈“下次战役”中所需要的美国军事物资和财政援助的数目等问题。
