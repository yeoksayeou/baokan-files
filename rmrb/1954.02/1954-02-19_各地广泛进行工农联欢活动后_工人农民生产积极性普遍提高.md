Following extensive worker-peasant get-togethers across the country, the production enthusiasm of workers and peasants has universally increased, powerfully promoting production.

After visiting, holding discussions, and participating in get-togethers, workers in various regions have increasingly recognized the role of their production in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and promoting national industrialization. Chen Kezhang, a worker in the large rolling mill section of Anshan Iron and Steel Works, said after listening to the report of farmer representatives who visited the factory: "We must manufacture a large number of tractor wheel belts and build tens of thousands of tractors to support our farmer brothers and sisters, relieving them of the heavy labor of plowing and hoeing." In order to manufacture high-quality ammonium sulfate for farmers, workers in the ammonium sulfate workshop of Anshan Chemical Plant are actively studying and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, changing the past operation methods, and implementing continuous acid addition, reducing the free acid from 10 percent to 0.5 percent. After visiting farmers in Nanguanling, Dalian, employees of Dalian Chemical Plant have further realized the importance of the chemical plant's production in developing agricultural production and realizing the country's socialist transformation of agriculture. Workers in the ammonium sulfide workshop rarely made rationalization proposals in the past. Recently, they put forward a total of sixty-eight proposals, of which eighteen have been approved for adoption. The production analysis work of the ammonium sulfide workshop originally stipulated an analysis every five minutes. In the past, the analyst analyzed every ten minutes in order to make himself comfortable. As a result, the acidity was unstable, affecting the quality. Now he has changed. In order to supply farmers with high-quality ammonium sulfide and other chemical fertilizers, he analyzes every three minutes. After worker-peasant alliance education, employees of various factories in Shenyang are trying to find ways to improve production. Li Shudong, an old riveter at the Shenyang Fan Factory, improved the fixed die of the cutting machine, which can save two processes. Employees of Workshop 514 of Shenyang Chemical Plant discussed further improving the quality of insecticides. Technician Wu Xirui proposed to ensure the trial run of the acid-resistant distillation tank for automatic discharging by the end of February; workers said they would solve the nine key problems existing in the workshop's production and prepare for the discussion of the national plan. In order to enable the farmers in Erling District, Danyang, to draw water for irrigation in time for the spring plowing, the employees of Shanghai Machine Factory are rushing to manufacture seventy-seven water pumps. During the discussion of the plan, all the workers in the foundry tried to shorten working hours, reducing the working hours for casting each water pump from 22 hours and 30 minutes to 17 hours and 5 and a half minutes. Engineer Gui Lin put forward a rationalization proposal to improve the design of the water pump, trying to use the original power to irrigate more than 29,000 mu of land with seventy-seven water pumps, which is equivalent to increasing fourteen water pumps, saving the country more than ten billion yuan in funds. Workers at the Shaoyang Bone Meal Factory in Hunan are launching a campaign to increase production and save money and are actively manufacturing bone meal to support farmers' spring plowing production. They plan to produce 100,000 to 150,000 jin of bone meal by the end of February to supply to farmers. Luo Changchun, a worker at the Xishui Weaving Factory in Hubei, used to consistently violate labor discipline and was not united with his comrades. After visiting the farmers, he not only did not absent himself from work, but also actively organized workers to launch a production increase competition. At the get-together, the workers of the Northwest Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory deeply felt the importance of their responsibilities when they heard the farmers' earnest hopes for the workers and the farmers' collective sale of grain. Lei Zhiming of the welding workshop humbly reviewed his past impatient attitude towards farmers who came to the factory to repair agricultural tools, and signed a mutual teaching and learning contract with technician Zhang Shusen. They wrote in the contract: "We will produce more new agricultural tools to help farmers improve production and move towards socialism." Some workers at the Chengdu Yuhua Textile Factory did not care about product quality in the past. After the farmers' visit, they consciously conducted inspections. According to statistics, the factory's substandard cloth rate has decreased by 20.8 percent compared to the past.

After visiting factories, farmers in various regions have also further realized the great significance of workers and peasants jointly building socialism, and have increased their enthusiasm for taking the road of cooperativization and supporting national industrial construction. The farmers of Nanguanling, Dalian, had sold more than 30,000 jin of grain before the workers' visit, completing the grain sales plan. After the get-together, they found ways to sell more than 10,000 jin of grain to the state. After the farmers in the town discussed with the workers, they realized that only by taking the road of cooperativization can they produce more grain and strongly support industrial construction. Therefore, they are currently rectifying mutual aid and cooperation organizations. More than 40 farmers have now requested to join the Lu Maojia Production Cooperative. The two better mutual aid groups in the town, Lu Zhengyang and Li Shiming, are preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives. Farmer Jiang Jufu received a great education during the workers' visit. He said, "The workers are helping us to take the road to common prosperity. I will never work alone again." Now he has organized a mutual aid group with five other households to prepare to increase production. Dong Dianyuan, a farmer from Minhe Township, Gulang County, Gansu, said after visiting the project in the Wushaoling area of the Lanxin Railway: "People often say 'a single tree does not make a forest'. We must learn the collective spirit of the workers, organize ourselves, and cooperate with each other. If we keep working alone, the tractors made by the workers will not be used." Recently, more than 20 mutual aid groups in Erling District, Danyang, Jiangsu have requested to organize and establish agricultural production cooperatives. The farmers in the district have pledged to increase wheat production by 20 percent and yuan wheat production by 20 to 30 percent compared to last year. The Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hebei Province has actively formulated this year's production plan after worker-peasant alliance education. The cooperative plans to produce 1.5 million jin of grain this year, and the yield per mu will be 50 percent higher than last year. In addition, they also plan to drill ten eye wells and drill a machine well to turn 400 mu of dry land into paddy fields. They proposed to continuously improve management and improve cultivation techniques, strive for a bumper harvest this year, and support national industrial construction.

    各地广泛进行工农联欢活动后
    工人农民生产积极性普遍提高
    全国各地工人和农民，自广泛开展工农联欢的活动后，生产积极性普遍提高，有力地推动了生产。
    各地职工经过访问、座谈、联欢，都更加认识到自己的生产对巩固工农联盟的作用，以及促进国家工业化的意义。鞍钢大型轧钢厂轧钢工段工人陈克章听了来厂参观的农民代表的报告后说：“我们要制造大量的拖拉机轮带，造出上万辆拖拉机支援农民弟兄，解除农民用笨犁、锄头耕种的沉重劳动。”鞍钢化工总厂硫铵车间工人为了给农民制造质量好的硫铵，正积极研究贯彻苏联专家的建议，改变过去的操作方法，实行连续加酸，使游离酸由百分之十降低到百分之零点五。大连化学厂职工到南关岭访问了农民以后，都进一步认识到化学厂的生产对发展农业生产，实现国家对农业的社会主义改造的重要性。硫錏车间的工人过去很少提合理化建议，最近他们共提出了六十八件，其中已批准采纳的有十八件。硫錏车间的生产分析工作，原规定每五分钟分析一次，分析员过去为了图自己松快，每十分钟才分析一次。因此酸度不平稳，影响质量。现在他改变了，为了供给农民质量优良的硫錏等化学肥料，他每隔三分钟分析一次。沈阳各厂职工经过工农联盟教育，都纷纷找窍门，提高生产。沈阳扇风机厂老铆工李树东改进了切断机的固定胎具，可节省两道工序。沈阳化工厂五一四车间职工讨论要进一步提高杀虫剂的质量。技术员吴锡瑞提出保证在二月底实行耐酸蒸馏罐自动放料试车；工人表示要解决车间生产中存在的九个关键问题，做好讨论国家计划的准备工作。上海机器厂职工为了使丹阳珥陵区的农民在春耕时能及时引水灌田，正赶制七十七部水泵。在讨论计划时，铸工场全体工人都想办法缩短工时，将浇铸每部水泵的工时从二十二工零三十分钟减低到十七工零五个半小时，工程师归霖提出改进水泵设计的合理化建议，尽量利用原动力，使七十七部水泵可以多灌两万九千多亩田，等于增加了十四部水泵，替国家节约了十几亿元的资金。湖南邵阳骨粉厂的工人，为了支援农民春耕生产，正开展增产节约运动，积极制造骨粉。他们计划在二月底制出十万斤到十五万斤的骨粉，供应农民。湖北浠水织布厂工人罗长春，以往一贯不遵守劳动纪律，和同志们闹不团结，访问农民后，不但不缺勤，还积极组织工人开展增产竞赛。西北农业机械制造厂的工人在联欢会上，听到农民对工人的殷切希望，以及农民集体售粮的情况时，深深感到自己责任的重大。电焊车间的雷志明虚心检讨了过去对到厂修补农具的农民的不耐烦情绪，并和技术员张树森订立互教互学合同。他们在合同上写道：“我们要生产更多的新式农具，帮助农民提高生产，走向社会主义。”成都裕华纺织厂部分工人，过去不关心产品质量，农民访问后，都自觉地进行检查。据统计，该厂的次布率比过去降低了百分之二十点八。
    各地农民到工厂参观后，也都进一步认识到工人农民共同建设社会主义的重大意义，提高了走合作化道路的热情和支援国家工业建设的积极性。大连南关岭的农民在工人访问前已卖出三万多斤粮食，完成了售粮计划，联欢后，又想法多卖了一万多斤粮食给国家。该镇农民和工人座谈后，认识到只有走合作化的道路，才能打更多的粮食，才能有力地支援工业建设。因此目前都在整顿互助合作组织。现已有四十多户农民要求参加卢茂家生产合作社。镇里较好的卢正阳、李世明两个互助组，正准备建立农业生产合作社。农民姜聚富在工人访问中，受到了很大的教育，他说：“工人这样帮助咱们走大家富裕的道路，我再也不单干了。”现在他已和另外五户组织了互助组，准备增加生产。甘肃古浪县民和乡农民董殿元参观了兰新铁路乌鞘岭地区的工程后说：“人常说‘独木不成林’，我们要学习工人的集体精神，组织起来，互助合作，要是老单干着，工人造的拖拉机就使不上了。”江苏丹阳珥陵区里最近有二十多个互助组要求组织起来，建立农业生产合作社。全区农民提出保证，要使小麦比去年增产两成，元麦比去年增产两成到三成。河北省耿长锁农业生产合作社。经过工农联盟教育，已积极制订出今年的生产计划。全社今年计划生产一百五十万斤粮食，每亩地产量要比去年提高百分之五十。另外他们还打算锥十眼井，打一眼机器井，把四百亩旱田变成水田。他们提出要不断地改进经营管理，提高耕作技术，争取今年农业大丰收，支援国家建设工业。
