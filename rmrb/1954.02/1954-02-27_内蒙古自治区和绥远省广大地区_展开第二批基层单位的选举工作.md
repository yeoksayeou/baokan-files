    Extensive areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province
    Launch the second phase of elections at the grassroots level
    The second phase of elections at the grassroots level has been comprehensively launched in extensive areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province.
    The first phase of elections at the grassroots level in the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan regions was basically completed in December 1953, completing a total of 1,464 grassroots units, accounting for approximately 38 percent of the total number of grassroots electoral units, of which the pastoral areas and urban and forestry areas have been basically completed. A total of more than 2.26 million people completed the election, accounting for about 37 percent of the total population.
    The second phase is being carried out on the basis of the experience gained in the first phase and after vigorously publicizing the general line of the state during the transition period, enhancing the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses. Approximately 2,660 grassroots units will conduct the general election. According to the current situation, the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan Election Committee decided that the second phase of grassroots election work must be completed before mid-March. Therefore, at the beginning of January, the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan Election Committee instructed all localities to rapidly carry out the second phase of grassroots election work on the premise of continuing to publicize the general line of the state during the transition period and closely combining it with production to promote production. The Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan Branch Bureau of the CPC Central Committee also instructed Party committees at all levels to strengthen the leadership of the second phase of election work and vigorously carry it out in conjunction with spring plowing. At the same time, in view of the fact that the focus of the second phase of election work is in the west, the scope of work is wide, and the scale is large, it was decided to invest more than 1,000 cadres from the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan level organs who were sent to various banners and counties to participate in grain purchase work into the general election work to strengthen the general election work force.
    After the above series of deployments, various localities have successively transferred cadres to start work in the first and middle ten days of February. Each banner and county in Zhaowuda League started in the first and middle ten days of January. Keshiketeng Banner on January 5th, Balin Right Banner on January 12th, and Linxi County on January 15th were all fully launched and are now nearing completion.
    In order to further strengthen the guidance of the second phase of election work, the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan Election Committee held a joint meeting with the Political and Legal Committee on February 19th. At the meeting, in addition to reviewing the past work and arranging the current work, it was decided to promptly dispatch three inspection groups to inspect the second phase of grassroots election work: one to the Jining area, led by Zhou Beifeng and Li Wenjing of the Election Committee as the head and deputy head of the group; one to the Houtao area, led by Wang Jiangong and Zhou Jiaqing of the Election Committee as the head and deputy head of the group; in addition, the Eastern District Guidance Office was instructed to organize a group to be responsible for inspecting the work in the eastern area.

    内蒙古自治区和绥远省广大地区
    展开第二批基层单位的选举工作
    内蒙古自治区和绥远省广大地区第二批基层单位的选举工作已全面展开。
    蒙绥地区第一批基层单位的选举工作，已于一九五三年十二月基本结束，计完成了一千四百六十四个基层单位，约占基层选举单位数的百分之三十八，其中牧业区和城市、林区已基本上完成。总计完成选举的人口为二百二十六万多，约占总人口数的百分之三十七。
    第二批是在第一批取得经验，并经过大力宣传国家过渡时期总路线，提高干部和人民群众社会主义觉悟的基础上进行的。进行普选的约二千六百六十个基层单位。蒙绥选举委员会根据当前情况，决定第二批基层选举工作必须在三月中旬以前完成。因此，蒙绥选举委员会在一月初即指示各地，要求对第二批基层选举工作在继续宣传国家过渡时期总路线和紧密结合生产、推动生产的前提下迅速开展。中共中央蒙绥分局也指示各级党委，要求加强对第二批选举工作的领导，结合备耕，大力进行。同时鉴于第二批选举工作的重点在西部，开展面宽，规模很大，决定将蒙绥一级机关派赴各旗、县参加购粮工作的一千多名干部投入普选工作中去，以加强普选工作的力量。
    经过上述一系列的部署，各地多在二月上、中旬相继抽调干部展开了工作。昭乌达盟各旗、县一月上、中旬即已开始，克什克腾旗一月五日、巴林右翼旗一月十二日、林西县一月十五日均全面铺开，现已接近完成。
    蒙绥选举委员会为了进一步加强对第二批选举工作的指导，于二月十九日会同政法委员会召开了联席会议，在会议上除检查了过去的工作和布置了当前工作外，并决定及时派出三个检查团，检查第二批基层选举工作：一个赴集宁地区，由选举委员会周北峰、李文精等任正副团长率领前往；一个赴后套地区，由选举委员会王建功、周嘉庆任正副团长率领前往；此外责成东部区指导处组织一个团，负责检查东部地区的工作。
