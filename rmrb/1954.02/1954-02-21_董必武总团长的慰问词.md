Comrade Zhu De, beloved Commander-in-Chief, beloved comrades of the People's Liberation Army:

Today, we, the People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army, are holding this conference in the capital of our great motherland—Beijing, to comfort the Chinese People's Liberation Army which, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has fought heroically and sacrificed blood for the Chinese people for twenty-six years, and has established great achievements in winning the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and defending the independence and security of the People's Republic of China. We feel extremely honored and excited. Please allow me, on behalf of the people of the whole country, to extend my condolences to the People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army, to you—beloved Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and, through you, to extend our highest respect to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army.

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Without a people's army, the people have nothing." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction has become a creed in the daily lives of every person. When people drink water, they think of its source and often remember Chairman Mao's instruction. Therefore, the people especially love the People's Liberation Army, especially care about the People's Liberation Army, and call the People's Liberation Army their own sons and brothers. Children also call them "Uncle PLA," and fraternal nationalities regard the People's Liberation Army as envoys of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The people of the whole country have been liberated and are living a free and happy life today because of the heroic struggle of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party.

As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army—the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—carried out unyielding struggles against imperialism, feudalism, and their representative, the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and implemented land reform in the countryside, establishing workers' and peasants' democratic political power. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army—the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army—persisted in eight years of resistance behind enemy lines, and finally, together with the Soviet Red Army, defeated Japanese imperialism and won the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the eight million reactionary troops of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, armed by US imperialism, and, together with the people of the whole country, overthrew the Kuomintang reactionary regime, ended the rule of imperialism in China, and won the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution.

Four years have passed since the founding of the People's Republic of China. During these four years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has also made great contributions to the motherland. The People's Liberation Army liberated the mainland of the country and eliminated the Kuomintang remnant troops on the mainland. It wiped out bandits and laid the foundation for national unity and social stability. Through the Hengyang-Baoqing, Guangdong-Guangxi, Southwest, Southern Yunnan, Hainan Island, and Zhoushan Island campaigns, as well as the advance into Xinjiang and the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the People's Liberation Army liberated all the national territory except Taiwan, Jinmen, and a few islands, and eliminated 2.25 million bandits and secret agents. At the same time, in the newly liberated areas, the People's Liberation Army also dispatched large numbers of troops to do mass work, and sent a large number of cadres to participate in urban management and rural work, stabilized social order, and assisted party and government organs in establishing people's political power and mass organizations at all levels; mobilized and united people of all ethnic groups, carried out the great land reform movement of eliminating bandits, opposing bullies, reducing rent, and reducing interest in vast areas, and organized urban and rural people to restore industrial and agricultural production, and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship. In recent years, many troops have been dispatched to participate in the country's economic construction, reclamation, road construction, river repair, forest development, and factory construction.

This is the great achievement of the People's Liberation Army in performing the tasks of a fighting force on the one hand and the tasks of a working force on the other. This has completely liberated the Chinese people from the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. And once the people are liberated, after their political consciousness is raised, they in turn strengthen the People's Liberation Army, so that the People's Liberation Army receives a continuous stream of support, and the strength of the People's Liberation Army obtains an endless source.

The people of the whole country all know that the People's Liberation Army bears an extremely important responsibility. "The People's Liberation Army is always a fighting force. Even after the national victory, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated at home and the imperialist system exists in the world, our army is still a fighting force. There should be no misunderstanding or wavering on this point." (See the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party) Precisely because of this, after the People's Liberation Army eliminated the enemies of imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits on the mainland, in addition to continuing to strengthen border defense and coastal defense, it has devoted itself to the great construction of a modern and regular national defense force, in order to realize Chairman Mao's request for "not only a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." The people of the whole country are confident that the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will surely be built into the world's finest modern revolutionary army.

After several years of efforts in training, learning advanced Soviet military science and technology, and learning from the experience of the Chinese People's Volunteers in fighting US imperialism in Korea, the People's Liberation Army has grown into a powerful armed force with modern equipment such as aircraft, tanks, and artillery.

This armed force of the Chinese people was nurtured and raised by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It has experienced the glorious road of a long revolutionary war, and its flag radiates forever indelible brilliance. It is this armed force that is today the reliable force for safeguarding the security of our motherland and ensuring the smooth progress of the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland. If any imperialist dares to invade our motherland, he will be smashed to pieces in the face of this force!

Every time we people think of these things, we feel that our happy life is guaranteed, our peaceful labor is guaranteed, and our socialist cause is guaranteed. How can our people not thank the People's Liberation Army? As a saying that has long been circulating among the people says: "The People's Liberation Army is the benefactor of our people!"

In this year—1954—when our country is entering the second year of the Five-Year Plan, and is carrying out planned socialist construction and systematic socialist transformation in accordance with the Party's general line for the transition period, we cannot help but think of the People's Liberation Army, especially those People's Liberation Army soldiers guarding the border and coastal defenses. Like the Chinese People's Volunteers, they are very hard-working, facing the enemy and guarding the security of the motherland day and night. We think of the troops guarding the coastal areas and coastal islands of Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shandong, who have to brave the blows of sea winds and waves, and constantly guard against enemy invasions. We also think of the troops on the Kangzang Plateau, who are far from the hinterland of the motherland, and who are helping the Tibetan people develop their economy and culture, and in order to connect the hinterland of the motherland with Tibet, they are rushing to build the Kangzang Highway, and are active on the snowy mountains all year round, some working on mountains as high as 6,000 meters, but they have no complaints, and are all striving to realize their hope of completing the highway to Lhasa as soon as possible. We also think of the troops in Yunnan and Xinjiang, who are also stationed on the border of the motherland, some of whom live in places where even the map cannot find their names, but they still happily carry out their tasks, building their own barracks, growing their own land, building their own factories, and also helping the fraternal nationalities build a happy life and raise their socialist awareness, uniting them in the big family of all nationalities of the motherland. We also think of those public security forces scattered in groups to protect the motherland, who are serving the interests of the motherland in every small corner of the motherland, with vigilant eyes, monitoring every open or hidden sabotage activity of the enemy.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the Chinese People's Volunteers, is also the most beloved people. It is precisely because they are guarding our happy life vigilantly everywhere in the motherland, every day and night, that US imperialism and the Kuomintang remnant bandits dare not disturb our border and coastal defenses at will. If there is any disturbance, our heroic and resourceful People's Liberation Army will give them a head-on blow, just like they did to the enemy on Dongshan Island not long ago. Because our people have the protection of the People's Liberation Army, they are happy in their work every day and sleep soundly every night.

Thinking of these things, how can the people not thank our most beloved People's Liberation Army? The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Expanded Joint Meeting of the Standing Committee of the China People's Committee to Resist America and Aid Korea decided to organize a National People's Delegation to Comfort the People's Liberation Army, including all democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, fraternal nationalities, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, to conduct condolences in the garrisons of the People's Liberation Army across the country, precisely to express this deep meaning of gratitude.

The General Delegation and the General Sub-Delegations in various parts of the country have all been organized and have set off. Among them, the Deputy Chief of the Central General Delegation, representatives, and the cultural and art troupe have all been sent to East China, North China (and Inner Mongolia), Northeast China, Northwest China, Central South China, Southwest China, and the central military organs and troops in the capital to conduct in-depth condolences. They will express to the People's Liberation Army the concern and love of the people of the whole country, and will report to the People's Liberation Army the great achievements that the people of the whole country have achieved in all aspects in implementing the general line and general task of the country during the transition period. In our delegation, there is also our most beloved people—the delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, who will also specifically extend fraternal respect to the People's Liberation Army and report on their joint operations with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army in Korea. Entrusted by the people of the motherland, we comfort you, not only to express the gratitude of the people of the motherland, but also to further strengthen the unity between the army and the people of the whole country, encourage the People's Liberation Army to continue to maintain glory, carry forward glory, raise vigilance, consolidate national defense, and improve the level of modernization and regularization, in order to protect the security of the motherland and ensure the smooth progress of the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland.

The people of the whole country will not just send a delegation to offer condolences and consider it over. The people of the whole country will definitely support the People's Liberation Army in building a modern and regular national defense force with practical actions. The first thing is to continue to support the People's Liberation Army in improving its equipment. One of the tasks of our country's socialist industrialization is to lay a solid foundation for national defense, and to establish a national defense industry that can guarantee the modern technical equipment of the People's Liberation Army. We firmly believe, and also guarantee to you—Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all comrades of the People's Liberation Army—that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the vigorous efforts of the working class and peasants, and with the unity of the people of the whole country, we will definitely be able to smoothly realize the task of national socialist industrialization, so as to ensure that your equipment will continue to be improved.

Dear comrades, we must never forget that our country is still surrounded by imperialism, and our enemy—US imperialism—is constantly trying to sabotage our cause and attempting to create a counter-revolutionary restoration in our country. This attempt has not even been weakened because they were defeated on the Korean battlefield. They are still continuing to create and maintain international tension, and are still continuing to support the militarist forces of West Germany and Japan; they recently forcibly detained the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and sent them to the Li Chengwan and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs as cannon fodder, and at the same time they are still continuing to obstruct the convening of political conferences and refusing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue; they are still continuing to occupy our country's Taiwan, instigating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to harass our coast, and plotting and organizing special agents and spies to infiltrate our country and carry out sabotage activities. All of this shows that US imperialism wants to be an eternal enemy of the Chinese people who have stood up.

Therefore, we must always maintain the highest vigilance, we must accelerate the socialist industrialization of our country, we must strengthen our national defense, and we must strictly guard against any provocation by the enemy. Let us always remember the teachings of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao: "During the historical period when classes have not been eliminated at home and the imperialist system exists in the world, our army is still a fighting force." Dear comrades, I believe that you will never have any wavering on this point, as in the past.

Dear Commander-in-Chief Zhu, dear comrades of the People's Liberation Army: In the past twenty-six years, you have established immortal achievements for the motherland and the people of the world, but you have also endured hardships. Many of you have shed the last drop of blood for the liberation of the Chinese people. The people of the whole country will always remember you, and your children and grandchildren will not forget you. Under the inspiration and influence of your great patriotism, internationalism, and revolutionary heroism, we will advance on the road of socialist industrialization and strive to realize the general line for the transition period!

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the defender of the Chinese people!

Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the leader and commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao, the creator, organizer, and leader of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Eternal glory to the glorious martyrs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

### 董必武总团长的慰问词

专栏：

    董必武总团长的慰问词亲爱的朱总司令、亲爱的人民解放军全体同志们：
    今天，我们中国人民慰问人民解放军代表团在我们伟大祖国的首都——北京，举行这个慰问大会，慰问在中国共产党和毛主席领导下二十六年来为中国人民英勇奋斗，流血牺牲，在争取中国人民革命的伟大胜利和保卫中华人民共和国的独立和安全中建立了伟大功勋的中国人民解放军，我们感到十分的光荣和兴奋。请允许我代表全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团向你——亲爱的朱总司令，并通过你向全体人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员同志们致以崇高的敬礼。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”。毛主席的这个英明指示，已经成为每一个人民日常生活中的信条。人民饮水思源，常常想起毛主席的这个指示。因此，人民特别热爱人民解放军，特别关怀人民解放军，把人民解放军称为他们自己的子弟兵，孩子们也叫“解放军叔叔”，兄弟民族也把人民解放军当成是中国共产党和毛主席的使者。全国人民都是因为有了共产党和共产党领导的人民解放军的英勇奋斗，才得到解放而过今天的自由幸福的生活。
    远在第二次国内革命战争时期，人民解放军的前身——中国工农红军，就和帝国主义、封建主义及其代表国民党蒋介石匪帮进行了不屈不挠的斗争，并在农村中实行了土地改革，建立了工农民主政权。在抗日战争时期，人民解放军的前身——八路军、新四军坚持敌后八年抗战，最后和苏联红军
  一起打败了日本帝国主义，争取了抗日战争的胜利。在第三次国内革命战争中，人民解放军又把美帝国主义武装起来的蒋介石匪帮的八百万反动军队全部消灭，并和全国人民一起，推翻了国民党反动政权，结束了帝国主义在中国的统治，取得了中国人民革命的伟大胜利。
    中华人民共和国成立至今已经四年了。四年中，中国人民解放军对祖国的贡献也是很伟大的。人民解放军解放了全国大陆，消灭了大陆上的国民党残余部队。肃清了土匪，奠定了全国统一和社会安定的局面。人民解放军经过衡（阳）宝（庆）、两广、西南、滇南、海南岛、舟山等战役，以及向新疆进军，和平解放西藏，解放了台湾、金门及少数岛屿以外的全部国土，消灭了土匪特务二百二十五万人。同时在新解放区，人民解放军部队又大量分散下去作群众工作，并派出大批干部参加城市管理及农村工作，安定了社会秩序，协助了党政机关建立了各级人民政权和群众团体；发动并团结了各族人民，在广大地区开展了清匪、反霸、减租、减息和伟大的土地改革运动，组织了城乡群众恢复工农业生产，巩固了人民民主专政，近年来，又派出很多部队去参加国家的经济建设，屯垦、修路、修河、开发森林、修建工厂。
    这就是人民解放军一方面执行战斗队的任务，一方面又执行工作队的任务所获得的伟大的成果。这就使得中国人民从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治下完全解放出来。而人民一经解放，政治觉悟提高之后，反过来又壮大了人民解放军，使人民解放军得到源源不断的支援，使人民解放军的力量获得无穷无尽的源泉。
    全国人民都知道，人民解放军身上担负着无比重大的责任。“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队。就是在全国胜利以后，在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队。对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇”。（见中国共产党二中全会决议）正因为这样，人民解放军在大陆上肃清帝国主义和国民党匪帮拿枪的敌人以后，除继续加强边防、海防外，就把自己投入现代化、正规化国防军的伟大建设中，以实现毛主席所要求的“不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军”，全国人民确信人民解放军在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下必能建设成为世界上优良的现代化的革命军队。
    经过这几年的努力锻炼，学习苏联的先进军事科学和技术，学习志愿军在朝鲜对美帝国主义作战的经验，人民解放军已经成长壮大为拥有飞机、坦克、大炮等现代装备的诸兵种联合的强大的武装了。　
    这支中国人民的武装部队，是由中国共产党和毛主席教养成长起来的。他经历了长期的革命战争的光荣道路，他的旗帜上放射着永远不可磨灭的光辉。正是这支武装部队，是今天保卫我们祖国的安全、保卫祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业顺利进行的可靠力量。任何帝国主义敢于侵犯我们的祖国，他都会在这个力量面前碰得头破血流！
    我们人民每一想起这些，我们就觉得我们的幸福生活有了保障，我们的和平劳动有了保障，我们的社会主义事业有了保障。我们人民怎能不感谢解放军呢？诚如久已在人民中流传的一句话：“解放军是咱人民的恩人呀”！
    在今年——一九五四年，当我们国家正进入五年建设计划的第二年度，根据党在过渡时期的总路线而进行有计划的社会主义建设和有系统的社会主义改造的时候，我们更不能不想起人民解放军，特别是想到那些守卫在边防、海防的人民解放军。他们和中国人民志愿军一样，是十分辛苦的，他们面对着敌人而日夜警卫着祖国的安全。我们想起守卫在福建、浙江、广东、山东沿海地区和沿海岛屿的部队，他们要冒着海风海浪的打击，时时刻刻防备着敌人的侵袭。我们也想到那些在康藏高原上的部队，他们远离祖国的腹地，要帮助藏族人民发展经济和文化，而为了沟通祖国腹地和西藏的交通，他们正在赶筑康藏公路，一年四季都是在雪山上活动，有的在高达六千公尺的山上工作，但他们毫无怨言，都在努力实现自己的希望，想提早把公路修通到拉萨。我们也想到那些在云南和新疆的部队，他们也驻守在祖国的边疆，他们有的住的地方，连地图上都找不到名字，但是他们还是很愉快的执行着任务，自己修建营房，自己种地，自己建设工厂，还帮助兄弟民族建设幸福生活，提高他们社会主义的觉悟，把他们团结在祖国各民族的大家庭里。我们更想到那些分散得一个组一个组地保卫着祖国的公安部队，他们在祖国的每一个小角落都在为祖国的利益服务，睁着警觉的眼睛，监视着敌人每一个公开的或隐蔽的破坏活动。
    中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军一样，也是我们最可爱的人。正因为有他们在祖国到处警惕地守卫着我们幸福生活的每一个白天和黑夜，美帝国主义和国民党残余匪帮才不敢在我边防海防随便滋扰，一有风吹草动，我们英勇机智的人民解放军就给他一个迎头痛击，像不久以前在东山岛痛击敌人一样。我们的人民因为有了人民解放军的保护，每天的劳动都很愉快，每一夜晚的睡眠都很安稳。
    想到这些，人民怎能不感谢我们最亲爱的人民解放军呢？这次中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会、中国人民抗美援朝总会常务委员会扩大联席会议决定组织这样一个包括全国各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、各兄弟民族和中国人民志愿军的全国人民慰问人民解放军代表团到全国各地人民解放军驻地去进行慰问，正就是为了致这个感谢的深意。
    慰问总团和全国各地的总分团已经全部组织起来了，并且出发了，其中中央总团的副总团长、代表、文工团，都已分往华东、华北（及内蒙古）、东北、西北、中南、西南，以及首都的中央各军事机关和部队进行深入的慰问，他们将向人民解放军表达全国人民对他们的关怀和爱戴，将向人民解放军报告全国人民在执行国家过渡时期总路线、总任务中在各方面所获得的伟大成就。在我们团里，还有我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军的代表团，他们还要专门向人民解放军致兄弟般的敬意，并报告他们在朝鲜和朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军一起并肩作战的情形。我们受着祖国人民的委托，慰问你们，不仅要表达祖国人民的感谢，而且要进一步加强全国的军民团结，鼓舞人民解放军继续保持光荣，发扬光荣，提高警惕，巩固国防，提高现代化、正规化的水平，以保卫祖国的安全，保卫祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。
    全国人民不只是派代表团慰问一下就算完了，全国人民必将以实际行动来支援人民解放军进行现代化正规化国防军的建设，这首先就是要继续支援人民解放军改善装备。我们国家的社会主义工业化的任务之一就是要为国防奠定巩固的基础，要建立能够保证人民解放军的现代化技术装备的国防工业。我们深信，也是向你——朱总司令和全体人民解放军同志保证，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在工人阶级和农民奋发努力和全国人民团结一致下，我们一定能够顺利地实现国家社会主义工业化的任务，以保证你们的装备源源不断地得到改善。
    亲爱的同志们：我们决不能够忘记，我们的国家还受着帝国主义包围，我们的敌人——美帝国主义无时无刻不在企图破坏我们的事业，企图在我国制造反革命的复辟，这种企图甚至没有因为他们在朝鲜战场上打了败仗而有所减弱。他们还在继续制造和保持国际的紧张局势，还在继续扶持西德和日本的军国主义势力；他们最近还强迫扣留了朝中战俘送给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮当炮灰，同时还在继续阻挠政治会议的召开，拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题；他们还继续占领着我国的台湾，唆使蒋介石匪帮向我沿海进行骚扰，并策动和组织特务间谍潜入我国进行破坏活动。这一切说明美帝国主义是要与站起来的中国人民永远为敌的。
    因此，我们不能不时刻保持最高警惕，不能不加速我们国家社会主义的工业化，不能不加强我们的国防，严防敌人的任何挑衅。让我们永远记住中国共产党和毛主席的教导：“在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队”。亲爱的同志们，我相信，你们对于这一点像过去一样是永远不会有任何动摇的。
    亲爱的朱总司令，亲爱的人民解放军全体同志们：二十六年来你们为祖国，为世界人民建立下了不朽的功勋，但你们也备尝了辛苦，其中很多人为中国人民的解放流尽了最后一滴血。全国人民将永远记着你们，子子孙孙也不会忘记你们，将在你们伟大的爱国主义、国际主义、革命英雄主义的精神感召和影响下向社会主义工业化的道路前进，为实现国家过渡时期的总路线而奋斗！
    中国人民的保卫者——中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民解放军的领导者、指挥者——朱总司令万岁！
    中国人民解放军的创造者、组织者、领导者——我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国人民解放军的光荣的烈士们永垂不朽！
