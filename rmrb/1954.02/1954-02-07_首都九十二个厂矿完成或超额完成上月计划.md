Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: According to incomplete statistics, ninety-two state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories and mines in the capital have completed or exceeded their production plans for January. All major factories and mines in the city have completed their production plans, and generally have reached or exceeded the actual production level of December last year. Many state-owned factories and mines, such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the Jingxi Mining Bureau, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and the Beijing No. 1 and No. 2 Machine Tool Plants, have completed their plans ahead of schedule. Statistics from sixty-one locally state-owned factories also show that they exceeded their January production plan by 2.89 percent.

Due to thorough production preparation, factories and mines were able to start production smoothly this year. At the same time, in order to reverse the past situation of being slack in the beginning and then rushing towards the end, and failing to complete the task in January, the Industrial Department of the Municipal Party Committee and the District Committees strengthened the supervision and inspection of the plan completion of each factory and mine, conducted inspections on a ten-day and daily basis. The leaders of each factory and mine also paid close attention to the implementation of the plan, mobilized employees to check the plan progress on a ten-day, weekly, and daily basis, and took effective measures in a timely manner to strengthen the weak links in production. Therefore, most factories and mines were able to complete the plan in a balanced manner. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant completed the plan extremely evenly in the first, middle, and last ten days of the month. In order to ensure uninterrupted production of the blast furnace, the plant strengthened equipment maintenance and repair work, and completed major equipment repairs ahead of schedule in January. Workers in each workshop of the Fengtai Bridge Factory started competitions at the beginning of the month. The ironworkers group of the steel beam workshop ensured that the layout group had sufficient materials, the layout group ensured that the materials marked out could supply the drilling group, and the drilling group ensured that they could supply the riveting. This mutual guarantee resulted in close links between processes, enabling production to proceed in a balanced manner. The balance rate of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant in assembling universal milling machines and the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory in assembling walking plows also reached 100%. At the same time, due to the study of the general line of the state during the transition period by the broad masses of workers, their political consciousness and work enthusiasm have been improved, and the attendance rate of each factory and mine in January generally exceeded 90%.

While striving to complete the January plan, the factories and mines also prepared for production in February. Before the end of January, most factories and mines mobilized employees to discuss the February production plan, and the employees of each factory and mine put forward various guarantees, especially guaranteeing normal attendance around the Spring Festival, and striving to achieve greater results in February.

    首都九十二个厂矿完成或超额完成上月计划
    【新华社六日讯】据不完全统计，首都有九十二个国营、地方国营、公私合营厂矿完成或超额完成了一月份生产计划。全市主要厂矿都完成了生产计划，而且一般都达到或超过去年十二月份实际生产水平。不少国营厂矿，如石景山钢铁厂、琉璃河水泥厂、长辛店机车车辆修理工厂、京西矿务局、华北农业机械总厂、北京第一、二机床厂等都提前完成计划。地方国营六十一个厂的统计，也超额百分之二点八九完成了一月份生产计划。
    由于生产准备工作做得充分，今年各厂矿一开始就能顺利生产。同时，为了扭转历年前松后紧、一月份完不成任务的情况，中共市委工业部和各区委都加强了对各厂矿完成计划情况的监督、检查工作，按旬、按日进行检查，各厂矿领导方面也十分注意计划执行情况，发动职工按旬、按周、按日检查计划进度，并及时采取有效措施加强生产中的薄弱环节。因此，大部厂矿都能做到均衡地完成计划。如石景山钢铁厂上、中、下旬完成计划情况极为均衡，为了保证高炉不间断生产，该厂加强了设备维护检修工作，一月份中重大设备检修都提前完成任务。丰台桥梁厂各车间工人月初就开始了竞赛，钢梁车间铁工组保证使放样组有足够的用料，放样组保证号出来的料供得上打眼组使用，打眼组保证供得上拼铆，这样互相保证的结果就使工序之间紧密衔接，生产得以均衡进行。第一机床厂装配万能铣床、华北农业机械总厂装配步犁的均衡率也都达到了百分之百。同时，由于广大职工学习了国家过渡时期总路线后，政治觉悟与劳动热情提高，各厂矿一月份出勤率普遍都在百分之九十以上。
    各厂矿在努力完成一月份计划的同时还给二月份的生产进行了准备。一月底前，大部分厂矿发动职工讨论了二月份的生产计划，各厂矿职工并提出了各种保证，特别是保证春节前后出勤正常，争取在二月份做出更大的成绩。
