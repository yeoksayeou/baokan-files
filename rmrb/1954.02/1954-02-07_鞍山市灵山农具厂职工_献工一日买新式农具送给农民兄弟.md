    Anshan City Lingshan Farm Implement Factory Workers
    Donate a Day's Labor to Buy New Farm Implements for Peasant Brothers
    After hearing the news that Anshan City was organizing a worker delegation to visit the countryside, the workers of the Lingshan Farm Implement Factory in Anshan City voluntarily donated a day's labor on January 15th, and used the wages from that day to buy three "Worker-Peasant Alliance" harvesters and six large double-wheeled double-铧 plows, to be given to the peasant brothers in the name of all the workers in Anshan.
    On the day of the labor donation, the workers worked with extra vigor. The workers in Liu Yulin's sand casting team in the casting workshop completed the workload of a whole day in one morning. When Zhao Chun's team in the plow-making workshop made plowshares, they overfulfilled the task by 35.5 percent, and improved the card saw, improving product quality. On this day, no one in the entire factory was absent.
    The gifts for the peasant brothers—three "Worker-Peasant Alliance" harvesters—have been presented by the Anshan worker delegation to the "May 1st" Collective Farm in Rehe, the Wang Ximing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Minji Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang, and the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe County, Jilin Province. These three "Worker-Peasant Alliance" harvesters, calculated at the minimum, can harvest 170-180 mu of wheat per day, which is equivalent to one peasant working for two months.

    鞍山市灵山农具厂职工
    献工一日买新式农具送给农民兄弟
    鞍山市灵山农具厂职工听到该市组织工人代表团去访问农村的消息后，在一月十五日自动献工一日，并用这天工资买了三台“工农联盟号”收割机和六台大型双轮双铧犁，以鞍山全体职工名义赠给农民弟兄。
    在献工那天，职工们干活格外起劲。铸造车间刘玉林翻砂小组工人，在一个上午时间就完成了往日一整天的工作量。制犁车间赵纯家小组做铧板时，超额完成任务百分之三十五点五，并改进了卡锯，提高了产品质量。这一天，全厂所有的人员，没有一个人缺勤。
    送给农民弟兄的礼物——三台“工农联盟号”收割机，已由鞍山工人代表团分别赠送给热河“五一”集体农庄、黑龙江绥化县民吉村王喜明农业生产合作社、吉林省蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社。这三台“工农联盟号”收割机，按最低限度来算，每天可收割一百七、八十亩麦子，顶一个农民干两个月。
