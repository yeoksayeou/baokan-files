People's Army Loves and Cares for the Masses

Comrades Saved My Entire Family

On the afternoon of November 9th last year, as the motorcade of the first platoon of the first company of a certain regiment was traveling on a highway near Anxi, Gansu, a strong wind rose, the yellow sand blotted out the sky, and the temperature dropped rapidly.

The vehicles were driving slowly. The road ahead was blocked by shifting sands, and the drivers jumped out of the cars, using their hands to dig away the sand and search for the lost road. Suddenly, a woman's cry came from afar, followed by a figure appearing in the sandstorm. The woman cried and shouted, "Oh no, my child has been blown away by the wind..." When she saw several revolutionary soldiers, she rushed towards them, recounting her ordeal: she was sending public grain to Anxi, and when the strong wind came, the child was lying on the ground with a donkey to take shelter from the wind, but when she turned around, she could not find the child and the donkey. ... Deputy Platoon Leader Qian said warmly to the woman: "Don't be sad, get in the car, we will help you find him!" So everyone dug away the sand and continued to move forward in the vehicles. Deputy Platoon Leader Qian, who was walking in the front, saw a dark shadow in the distance, and he accelerated to catch up. He saw a donkey carrying grain walking along the road. He stopped the car and searched nearby, but found nothing. The mother said sadly, "The child must have been buried in the quicksand or eaten by wolves." Deputy Platoon Leader Qian comforted her: "If we can find the donkey, we can find the child." The instructor led everyone to look for him. At this time, it was dark and cold. After a while, Comrade Hou Shaobao heard a "puffing" sound. He ran over and saw a sheepskin, under which lay a child of about seven or eight years old. He was curled up in a ball, shivering on the ground. Comrade Hou quickly took him in his arms and shouted happily, "Found him, found him!" The comrades all came to see the child, and trainee Jie Zhaoxiang gave the child some biscuits to eat. The child's mother was so moved by the scene that she could not speak.

At this time, it was late at night and the weather was very cold, so they had to continue moving forward, but people could ride in the car, and the grain could also be loaded in the car, but there was no way to deal with the donkey. Trainee Li Guoshi scrambled to ask to drive the donkey. When the motorcade arrived at Anxi Station, they met a fellow villager who was driving a large cart, and he was from the same village as the mother. The instructor and Deputy Platoon Leader Qian asked the fellow villager to send the mother and son back. When leaving, the mother said to all the comrades: "Comrades! You saved my whole family!" With gratitude, she stared at the gradually receding motorcade. (Kou Lifu)

Rescue

At dawn on December 25, 1953, the weather was clear, with a slight sea breeze, and the fishing boats set sail for the sea.

At this time, a naval unit suddenly received news of an approaching gale. Naval patrol boats and production guidance ships immediately increased their speed and sailed to the fishing grounds, urgently sounding their horns, sending flag signals to warn, and broadcasting to the fishermen at sea: "After 8:00 a.m. today, the wind force will increase to level six or seven, all fishing boats please return to port immediately!"

However, the storm descended rapidly. The fishing boats nervously and frantically returned to port against the wind. The surging waves crashed over the fishing boats one after another, and the fishing boats were tossed about like gourds by the raging waves. Some of the masts of the boats had already been broken by the storm. The boat masters, in the face of the emergency, hung their clothes on the broken masts as a sign to request rescue.

Seeing this situation, the naval patrol boats and production guidance ships immediately headed for the fishing boats and dropped steel cables: one, three, five, seven, determined to rescue the fishing boats from danger.

The wind and waves struck the fishing boats even more fiercely, and the waves approaching from afar were like high walls collapsing from the sky. One patrol boat rushed to the crest of a wave, and several small boats towed by the stern fell into the abyss of the waves. One steel cable after another was broken. After being reconnected, another large wave crashed onto the ship's hull. The huge waves rose into the air and then poured down from the bridge onto the deck like heavy rain. The boat struggled forward, dragging the fishing boats, pitching and rolling.

The fishing port was gradually approaching, and the rescued fishermen showed joy on their faces. But there were still many fishing boats in danger. At this time, the patrol boats rushed forward again, braving the big waves. They went back and forth in the turbulent ocean, constantly rescuing distressed fishing boats. All the boats went and returned time and time again. The heroic Ninth Detachment of a certain detachment of the People's Navy, under the personal leadership of the commander, rescued 31 large and small fishing boats and 137 fishermen. The heroic aquatic workers Zhao Yizhong, Zhou Mingqi, and others personally led the production guidance ships and rescued 22 fishing boats and 124 people.

These heroes who risked their lives to rescue fishing boats were thanked and respected by the fishermen. (Jia Zhongxue)

"You are Chairman Mao's good troops!"

A new cluster of thatched houses has appeared on the banks of the Mengmeng River in Yunnan Province. These are newly built residences for the Lahu ethnic group.

One afternoon, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed nearby discovered black smoke rising from above the new houses. Red flames were already extending from the roof, and the houses were burning. Platoon Leader Zhao Shugen shouted loudly: "Go put out the fire! The Lahu compatriots' village is on fire!" Everyone immediately picked up basins and iron picks and ran towards the village. At this time, two houses had already been destroyed, and a third house was also on fire. The soldiers quickly climbed onto the houses, some scooping soil, some carrying water, and engaged in a fierce battle with the raging fire.

An old woman was lying at the door of the burning house, with several burns on her body, and her lips were still trembling. When several soldiers helped her up, she suddenly rushed towards the fire again. Squad Leader Li Yan understood what the old woman meant: there must still be something in the house that had not been rescued. So he fearlessly crawled into the burning house. The thick smoke blinded him, and he felt around the house for a circle, but found nothing. Seeing that the fire was about to burn into the house, he was about to crawl out when he suddenly heard a wailing cry from the inner room. His mind immediately lit up: "A child!" So, disregarding everything, he turned back to the burning inner room and found the child. At this time, the room was full of thick smoke, and nothing could be seen. Comrade Li Yan raised his head and looked around, and finally found the direction of the door, broke through the fire and rescued the child. After handing the child to others, he ran back into the fire, shouting: "Comrades! There are still things in the house, go and rescue them!" Several soldiers then rushed in. Embers fell from their heads in pieces, their clothes were burned, and their faces were blackened, but they did not care about these things.

When the Lahu compatriots returned from the fields, the fire had already been extinguished, and the soldiers were surrounding the old woman, watching the medics bandage and treat the mother and child. The old woman regained consciousness, gently stroked the child lying beside her, looked at the child's face, and then looked up at the surrounding soldiers. Tears flashed in her eyes, and her lips trembled for a long time before she could speak: "You are Mao Zedong's da ma ya (good troops)!" (Ke Yi, Su Tong)

    爱护群众、关心群众的人民军队
    同志们救了我全家
    去年十一月九日下午，某团第一连第一排的汽车队在甘肃安西附近的公路上行进时，刮起了大风，黄沙蔽天，气温迅速降低。
    汽车缓慢地驶着。前面的道路被流沙堵塞了，驾驶员们都跳下车，用手扒开沙子，寻找失去的道路。突然，从远处传来了女人的哭喊声，紧跟着一个人影子在沙幕中显现出来。女人边哭边喊：“哎呀，我的孩子被风刮走了……”她一见到几个革命军人时，便扑向他们，诉说自己的遭遇：她是到安西送公粮的，当大风刮来时，孩子牵着毛驴躺在地下避风，可是一回头，就找不到孩子和毛驴了。……钱副排长亲热地对那妇人说：“别难过，你坐上汽车吧，我们帮助你找！”于是大家扒开沙子，开着车子继续前进。走在前面的钱副排长，看见在很远的地方有个黑影，他便加足马力赶向前去，他看见一头驮着粮食的毛驴沿公路走着。他停下车，在附近搜寻了一下，什么也没找到。母亲伤心地说：“孩子不是被流沙埋了，就是被饿狼吃了。”钱副排长便安慰她：“能找到驴子就能找到孩子。”指导员就领着大家去找。这时，天色又黑，气候又冷。好一会，侯绍宝同志发现“噗噗”的声音，他撒开腿跑过去，一看原来是一张羊皮，下面躺着一个年约七、八岁的小孩。他缩成一团，在地上直打颤。侯同志连忙把他抱在怀里，高兴地大喊：“找到了，找到了！”同志们都赶来探望孩子，练习员解兆祥拿了一些饼干送给孩子吃。孩子的母亲看到这种情景，感动得说不出话来。
    这时夜已深，天气又很冷，必须继续前进，但人可以坐车，粮食也可以装在车里，毛驴没法对付。练习员李国诗便抢着要求赶毛驴。车队到了安西车站，碰上一位赶大车的老乡，他和这位母亲是同乡。指导员、钱副排长便托老乡把母子俩送回去。离开时，母亲向全体同志说：“同志们啊！你们救了我全家啦！”她怀着感激的心情，凝望着渐渐远去的车队。　（寇立富）
    抢救
    一九五三年十二月二十五日黎明，天气晴朗，微有海风，渔船扬帆出港了。
    这时海军某部忽然接到了将有大风的消息。海军护洋艇和生产指导船立即加快了航速，驶向渔场，急急地鸣汽笛、发旗语报警，又向海上渔民广播：“今天上午八点钟以后，风力要增强到六级、七级，所有渔船请立即返港！”
    但是，风暴迅速降临了。渔船紧张而忙乱地纷纷逆风返港。汹涌的波涛，一个连着一个向渔船压过来，渔船就像瓢一样被狂怒的海浪抛来抛去，有的船桅已经被暴风吹断了。船老大们因情况危急，将衣裳挂在断了的桅杆上做记号，请求援救。
    海军护洋艇和生产指导船看见这般情景，立即开向渔船，抛下钢缆：一支、三支、五支、七支，决心要把渔船从危险中救出来。
    风浪更加凶险地撞击着渔船，由远渐近的浪涛有如从空中倒塌下来的高墙。有一只护洋艇窜到浪巅上，艇尾拖着的几支小船跌落到波涛的深渊里，一支支的钢缆挣断了，接好后，跟着又有一股大浪冲到船梆上。巨大的浪头腾空扬起，霎时又如倾盆大雨一般从驾驶台泼落到甲板上。艇身颠簸摇摆地拖着渔船挣扎前进。
    渔港渐渐近了，已经得救的渔民面带喜色。但是还有许多渔船在危险中。这时护洋艇又冒着大浪迅速前进了。它们在波浪滔天的海洋上，不停地抢救着遇险的渔船。所有艇只一趟趟地去了又回来。英勇的人民海军某支队九分队在指挥员的亲自率领下，抢救了大、小渔船三十一条，渔民一百三十七人。英勇的水产工作者赵以忠、周鸣岐等亲自率领着生产指导船，抢救了二十二条渔船，一百二十四人。
    这些冒险抢救渔船的英雄，受到了渔民的感激和尊敬。　（贾忠学）
    “你们是毛主席的好队伍！”
    云南省勐勐河畔出现了一片新建的草房，这是拉祜族同胞新盖的住所。
    一天下午，驻守在附近的解放军某部，发现新房的上空冒起了黑烟，通红的火舌已伸出屋顶，房屋在燃烧着。排长赵戍根大声喊着：“快救火去！拉祜同胞的村子失火啦！”大家马上拿起了面盆、铁镐，跑向村子去。这时，已经有两间房子被烧毁了，第三间房子也着了火。战士们用迅速的动作爬上房，有的撮土，有的端水，和烈火展开了激斗。
    在燃烧着的房子门口躺着一个老大妈，身上有好几处被烧伤了，嘴唇还在颤动着。几个战士把她扶起来时，她又猛向火里扑去。班长李彦同志，领会了老大妈的意思：屋内一定还有什么东西没救出来。于是他就奋不顾身地钻进正在燃烧着的屋子。浓烟迷得他眼都睁不开，他在屋内四周摸了一圈，什么也没有发现。眼看着烈火就要烧到屋里来了，他正想钻出去，忽然听到从里间传出了哇哇的哭声。他脑子里一下亮开了：“孩子，”于是，他不顾一切地折回正在燃烧的里屋，把孩子找到了。这时，满屋是浓烟，什么也看不到，李彦同志抬起头，向四周打量了一下，终于找到了门的方向，突破火围救出了孩子。他把孩子交给别人后，又往火网里跑去，一面喊着：“同志们！房子里还有东西，快去抢救！”紧接着几个战士也冲了进去。火烬从他们头上一块块地掉下来，衣服烧着了，脸薰黑了，但他们毫不顾及这些。
    当拉祜族同胞们从田野里赶回来时，大火已经扑灭，战士们正团团地围着老大妈，看卫生员替母子俩包扎和治疗。老大妈清醒过来了，她轻轻地抚摸着躺在她身边的孩子，望着孩子的脸，又抬头看看周围的战士们，眼里闪着泪光，嘴唇颤动了半天才说出话来：“你们是毛主席的哒吗呀（好队伍）！”（克义、苏桐）
