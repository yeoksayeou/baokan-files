    Our Country's Self-Made Giant Propeller Windmill Successfully Trial-Produced
    Our country's first self-made giant propeller windmill has been successfully trial-produced and installed in the state-owned Panjin Reed Farm in Northeast China. The windmill's wheel wing diameter is 16.8 meters, and the windmill support frame is 14 meters high. The windmill can start operating at a wind speed of two meters per second. At a wind speed of four meters per second, it can drive a six-inch diameter centrifugal pump with a pumping capacity of 230 cubic meters per hour. At a wind speed of seven meters per second, it can simultaneously drive an eight-inch and a six-inch centrifugal pump. At a wind speed of eight meters per second, the main shaft power can reach 37.6 horsepower.
    The propeller windmill is the most modern and efficient of all types of windmills. In the Soviet Union, in addition to being used as rural power, it is also widely used for wind power generation. The technical personnel of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, who were responsible for the design of this windmill, carefully studied Soviet windmill books for ten months, and consulted with professors and Soviet experts from Harbin Institute of Technology, Beijing University of Aeronautics, Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture, and the Central Ministry of Water Resources, repeatedly discussing and mastering the latest Soviet windmill design theory. After more than a month of various types of wind wing model tests, it was finally successfully trial-produced. The efficiency of this giant windmill reaches 40 percent, close to the Soviet design standards. According to the local wind speed of five to eight meters per second every day, this windmill can increase the irrigation area of ​​the Panjin Reed Farm by 476,000 square meters of raw reeds (raw materials for papermaking), and it is estimated that it can increase the production of raw reeds by 238 tons per year, which can increase the country's wealth by nearly 100 million yuan.

    我国自制的巨型螺旋桨式风车试制成功
    我国自制的第一台巨型螺旋桨式风车试制成功，并在东北国营盘锦苇场安装起来。这台风车的轮翼直径十六点八公尺，风车支架高十四公尺。在每秒二公尺的风速时，这台风车即可开始运转。在每秒四公尺风速时，能带动一部每小时抽水二三○立方公尺的六吋口径的离心式抽水机，到每秒七公尺风速时就能同时带动一部八吋与一部六吋的离心式抽水机，在每秒八公尺的风速下，主轴功率可达三十七点六马力。
    螺旋桨式风车是各种风车类型中最新式与效率最高的一种，在苏联除用作农村动力外，还普遍用来作风力发电。担任这台风车设计任务的中央轻工业部技术人员，参考苏联风车书籍，苦心钻研了十个月，并向哈尔滨工业大学、北京航空学院、吉林省农业厅及中央水利部等单位的教授和苏联专家们请教，反复研讨，掌握了苏联最新的风车设计理论。以后又经过一个多月各种不同类型的风翼模型试验，终于试制成功。这台巨型风车的效率达百分之四十，接近苏联设计标准。根据当地每天每秒五公尺到八公尺的风速来计算，这台风车就可以给盘锦苇场增加原苇（造纸原料）灌溉面积四十七万六千平方公尺，估计每年能增产原苇二百三十八吨，可为国家增加近一亿元财富。
