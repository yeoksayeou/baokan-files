Volume II of "The Complete Works of Stalin" mainly includes Stalin's writings from 1907 to 1913. These works relate to one of the most difficult periods in the history of the Bolshevik Party, the dark years of the Stolypin reaction following the defeat of the first Russian Revolution in 1905. During this period, the worker and peasant masses suffered brutal persecution from the Tsar, landlords, and capitalists, and the Social Democratic Labor Party was severely hit. During this period, wavering elements in the revolutionary ranks showed pessimism, vacillation, retreat, and betrayal, while the Mensheviks moved further away from the revolution, engaging in the despicable activities of liquidating the revolution and liquidating the proletarian revolutionary party. During this period, the national question also became particularly acute, and in the various minority nationalities of Russia, who were subjected to the tyrannical oppression of the Tsarist government, the ebb of the revolutionary movement stirred up a counter-current of nationalism.

This was a period of crisis for the Party. During this period, the major tasks facing the Party were: to defend and consolidate the proletarian revolutionary party, to adopt tactics appropriate to the circumstances of the time, to persist in the revolutionary struggle, and to have a clear program on the national question to combine the workers' revolutionary struggle with the liberation struggles of the oppressed nationalities. The main focus of Volume II of "The Complete Works of Stalin" is on treatises concerning these fundamental issues.

Defending the Party meant defending the Bolshevik line of the Party on fundamental issues such as ideology, theory, organization, and tactics. In the preface to the Georgian edition of Karl Kautsky's "The Driving Forces and Prospects of the Russian Revolution," Stalin attacked the opportunist Menshevik line, defended the revolutionary Bolshevik line, and summarized the correct Bolshevik views: the proletariat's leadership in the revolution, the peasantry as the ally of the revolution, the establishment of a worker-peasant dictatorship after the victory of the revolution, and the necessity for the Social Democratic Labor Party to participate in the provisional revolutionary government in order to guide the revolution onto the road to socialism.

In "The Election in Petersburg and the Mensheviks," "Constitutional Democratic Dictatorship or People's Dictatorship," "The Proletariat Struggles, the Bourgeoisie Makes Alliances with the Government," "The Advanced Proletariat and the Fifth Party Congress," "A Complete Mess..." and other articles, Stalin continued to defend the ideological and tactical foundations of the Bolsheviks, denouncing the Mensheviks for tailing the bourgeois Constitutional Democrats in the election.

The Fifth Party Congress, held in London in 1907, was a victory for Bolshevism over Menshevism. Stalin's "The London Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (A Delegate's Notes)" vividly recounts the proceedings of this congress, exposes the Mensheviks' opportunist compromise position on matters of principle, and powerfully defends the Bolshevik position. Based on concrete figures on the composition of the delegates, Stalin pointed out that Menshevism was the class essence of petty-bourgeois political ideology.

In 1908, the Fifth Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in Paris, at Lenin's suggestion, condemned the Mensheviks who attempted to abolish the secret Social Democratic Labor Party. During this period, some Bolsheviks violated Marxist principles and demanded the recall of workers' representatives from the Duma, separating the Party from the masses. These people were called "Recallists," and Lenin exposed them as "liquidators in disguise."

In articles such as "Party Life" and "Letters from the Caucasus," Stalin attacked the views of the Liquidators and Recallists, and, using the Tiflis Mensheviks as an example, exposed the Liquidators' treacherous propositions on program and tactics.

The Bolsheviks, under conditions of rampant reactionary forces and a deep internal crisis within the Party, were not intimidated by the growing difficulties, but overcame the difficulties and consolidated their ranks. In his article "The Crisis in the Party and Our Tasks," Stalin put forward ways to eradicate the Party's ailments: first, to do a good job of contacting the masses; second, to unite the isolated local organizations; and to run a national newspaper that would not only become a tool for ideologically uniting the Party, but also a tool for organizationally uniting the various local organizations into a unified and centralized party. "Only with these conditions can the Party shoulder the great mission of being a truly vanguard of the heroic Russian proletariat." Stalin's proposals are more specifically expressed in "Resolution of the Baku Committee of January 22, 1910."

At the end of 1910, in a "Letter to the Central Committee of the Party from Exile in Solvychegodsk," Stalin expressed his support for Lenin and Plekhanov's alliance against the Liquidators and Trotskyists, emphasizing that "the Bolsheviks must have their own factional organization."

Stalin's outstanding views were completely in line with Lenin's views at the time. The Sixth Party Congress held in Prague in 1912 adopted these views, removing the Menshevik Liquidators from the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, thus laying the foundation for the final formation of the Bolsheviks as an independent party. The Congress decided to establish a practical center to lead the Russian revolutionary work—the Russian Bureau of the Central Committee, headed by Stalin—and passed a resolution to establish "Pravda."

Stalin's inaugural address for "Pravda," "Our Aims," and the leaflet "Support the Party!" signaled the formation of a new type of Bolshevik party united around Lenin's leadership core. The consolidation and unification of the Party's ranks was of decisive significance for the subsequent successful seizure of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Another part of Volume II of "The Complete Works of Stalin" is a discussion of the Party's tactical issues. After the failure of the First Revolution, during the Stolypin reaction, and under the persecution of the Tsarist government and the terror of the Black Hundreds, the Bolshevik Party skillfully used open and secret methods to strengthen its ties with the masses, persist in the struggle, and prepare its forces to meet the new revolution.

In terms of open activities, the main focus was on utilizing the State Duma. In his "Mandate to the Social Democratic Deputies to the Third State Duma," Stalin pointed out: "Our parliamentary group should use the Duma platform to explain to the people of the whole country the whole truth about the current revolution, and should loudly tell the people that it is impossible to achieve the liberation of the people in Russia by peaceful means. The only way to freedom is for all the people to rise up against the Tsarist regime." The "Mandate of the Petersburg Workers to Their Worker Deputies" more specifically pointed out how to utilize the Duma platform. Lenin attached great importance to this document of Stalin's, and when he sent it to the "Social Democrat" newspaper for publication, he wrote on the original manuscript: "Must be returned! Do not soil it. It is extremely important to preserve this document."

The establishment of the open national newspaper "Pravda" played a significant role in propaganda and education, and cultivated an entire generation of revolutionary fighters, ensuring the victory of the October Revolution of 1917.

Stalin's articles written during his revolutionary activities in Baku and Petersburg, such as "Should We Boycott the Consultative Conference!", "Once More on the Guaranteed Consultative Conference," "A Change in the Tactics of the Oil Owners," "Economic Terror and the Labour Movement," "The Oil Owners' View of Economic Terror," "How They are Preparing for the Elections," "The Will of the Primary Electors," "On the Results of the Elections to the Petersburg Workers' Electoral College," and "The Petersburg Elections," excellently demonstrate the Bolshevik revolutionary struggle's theory and tactics, and the dialectical and flexible combination of open and secret, strikes and consultation, local strikes and alliance strikes, and other forms of struggle. These articles illustrate how to use diversified legal groups, such as trade unions, public cultural entertainment centers, consumer cooperatives, clubs, insurance companies, lectures, theatrical performances, and temperance societies, in coordination with secret revolutionary organizations, to carry out revolutionary struggles.

The third main content of Volume II of "The Complete Works of Stalin" consists of two articles on the national question, of which "Marxism and the National Question" is an outstanding work. Lenin attached great importance to this treatise, saying: "In the theoretical literature of Marxism, the principles of this actual situation and the Social Democratic national program have recently been discussed in detail (Stalin's thesis is the most prominent in this respect)."

Stalin's brilliant work developed the Bolshevik theory and program on the national question and was the most important statement on the national question made by Bolshevism on the international stage on the eve of the First World War. In this work, Stalin explained that the national question is part of the overall question of the revolution, part of the liberation struggles of workers and oppressed nationalities in all countries, and he powerfully refuted the erroneous theory of opportunist theorists in Western European social democracy who separated the nation from the proletariat's class struggle.

Stalin's solution to the national question was in line with the vital interests of the revolutionary liberation struggle in Russia at that time. Because "the militaristic nationalist wave stirred up from above, and the various repressive measures used by 'those in power' to retaliate against the 'freedom-loving' border regions, stirred up a counter-current of nationalism at the lower level, which sometimes turned into crude chauvinism. ...The wave of nationalism is approaching more and more violently, threatening to sweep away the working masses." Therefore, "Social Democracy has a noble mission: to fight back against nationalism and prevent the masses from being infected by the general 'epidemic'. ... To confront nationalism with the tried and tested weapon of internationalism, with the united and indivisible class struggle."

Stalin's famous work includes seven parts: Nation, National Movements, The Statement of the Problem, National Cultural Autonomy, The Bund (Its Nationalism, Its Separatism), The Liquidators' Conference, and The National Question in Russia. In this article, Stalin completely and flawlessly created a definition of the nation, proving that the nation is not immutable but a historically formed category, a certain product of social economy, thus refuting the reactionary racial theory.

This article is based on the idea of proletarian internationalism, on the idea of the union and unity of the proletarians and semi-proletarians of all nationalities to carry out a common revolutionary struggle to overthrow the landlords and the bourgeoisie. It sharply criticized "national cultural autonomy," clearly put forward the program of national self-determination and regional autonomy, and clearly answered the urgent question of how nationalities should fight for liberation and democracy against oppression, which is of great revolutionary significance to the liberation struggle of oppressed nationalities.

Volume II of "The Complete Works of Stalin" teaches us the principles and methods of building and consolidating the Party, the highly principled and highly flexible struggle tactics, and the theory and program of combining national liberation struggles with proletarian revolutionary struggles, which will help us to better grasp the ideological weapons of the proletarian struggle.

    “斯大林全集”第二卷出版
    中共中央马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作编译局翻译的“斯大林全集”第二卷已由人民出版社出版，自今日起先在北京、天津、太原、归绥、沈阳、哈尔滨、鞍山、大连、长春、乌兰浩特、上海、南京、杭州、济南、福州、武汉、广州、长沙、南昌、重庆、成都、昆明、西安、兰州、乌鲁木齐等二十五个城市开始发行。
    “斯大林全集”第二卷所包括的，大部分是斯大林在一九○七年至一九一三年的著作。这些著作涉及布尔什维克党历史中最困难的时期之一，这就是在一九○五年俄国第一次革命失败后出现的斯托雷平反动的黑暗年代。在这个时期，工人农民群众遭受沙皇、地主、资本家的残酷迫害，社会民主工党受到严重的打击。在这个时期，革命队伍中的不坚定分子表现悲观、动摇、退却和叛变，孟什维克更加远离革命，进行取消革命和取消无产阶级革命政党的卑鄙活动。在这个时期，民族问题也特别尖锐，在受沙皇政府横暴压迫的俄国各少数民族中，随着革命运动的低落，激起了民族主义的逆流。
    这是党遭逢危机的时期。在这个时期，摆在党面前的重大任务就是：要保卫和巩固无产阶级的革命政党，要采取适应当时环境的策略，坚持革命斗争，并且需要有一个明确的民族问题纲领来把工人革命斗争和被压迫民族解放斗争结合起来。“斯大林全集”第二卷所包括的主要就是关于这些基本问题的论著。
    保卫党就是保卫党在思想、理论、组织、策略等基本问题上的布尔什维克路线。斯大林在为考茨基“俄国革命的动力和前途”一书的格鲁吉亚文版所作序言中，抨击了机会主义的孟什维克路线，保卫了革命的布尔什维克路线，概括地说明了布尔什维克的正确观点：无产阶级在革命中的领导权，农民是革命的同盟者，革命胜利后要建立工农专政，社会民主工党必须参加临时革命政府，以便把革命引导到社会主义的道路上来。
    在“彼得堡的竞选和孟什维克”、“立宪民主党人专制还是人民专制”、“无产阶级在斗争资产阶级在和政府缔结联盟”、“先进的无产阶级和党的第五次代表大会”、“一塌糊涂……”等文中，斯大林继续捍卫布尔什维克的思想和策略基础，斥责孟什维克在竞选中做资产阶级立宪民主党的尾巴。
    一九○七年在伦敦举行的党的第五次代表大会是布尔什维主义对孟什维主义的胜利。斯大林的“俄国社会民主工党伦敦代表大会（一个代表的札记）”非常生动地记述了这次大会的经过情形，从原则问题上揭露了孟什维克的机会主义妥协立场，有力地保卫了布尔什维克的立场。斯大林根据出席代表成分的具体数字，指出孟什维主义是小资产阶级政治思潮的阶级实质。
    一九○八年俄国社会民主工党巴黎第五次代表会议根据列宁的提议，斥责了企图取消秘密的社会民主工党的孟什维克。这时期某些布尔什维克违背了马克思主义原则，要求把杜马中的工人代表召回来，使党脱离群众。这些人被称为“召回派”，列宁揭露他们是“变相的取消派”。
    斯大林在“党的生活”、“高加索来信”等文中抨击了取消派和召回派的观点，以梯弗里斯的孟什维克为例，揭露了取消派在纲领和策略问题上的背叛主张。
    布尔什维克在反动势力嚣张的条件下，在党内危机深重的情况下，并没有被与日俱增的困难所吓倒，而是克服困难巩固了自己的队伍。斯大林在“党内危机和我们的任务”一文中，提出了根治党的疾病的办法：首先要做好联系群众的工作，其次要把互相隔离的地方组织联合起来，团结起来，并且要办一个全国性的报纸，使它不仅成为思想上团结党的工具，而且成为组织上把各个地方组织联合为统一集中的党的工具。“只有具备了这些条件，党才能担负起英勇的俄国无产阶级的名副其实的先锋队这一重大使命”。斯大林这些主张更具体地表现在“巴库委员会一九一○年一月二十二日的决议”中。
    一九一○年年底，斯大林在“自索里维切果茨克流放地寄给党中央的信”中表示拥护列宁和普列汉诺夫结成联盟以反对取消派和托洛茨基派的路线，强调“布尔什维克必须有自己的派别组织”。
    斯大林的这些卓越的意见，是完全符合当时列宁的主张的。一九一二年在布拉格举行的党的第六次代表会议采纳这些意见，把孟什维克取消派从俄国社会民主工党内清除出去，从而为布尔什维克最后形成为独立的政党打下了基础。代表会议决定建立领导俄国革命工作的实践中心——以斯大林为首的中央委员会俄国局，并通过了创办“真理报”的决议。
    斯大林为“真理报”所写的创刊辞“我们的目的”和传单“拥护党！”征示着一个新型的团结在列宁领导核心周围的布尔什维克党形成了。党的队伍巩固了，统一了，这对于后来顺利取得无产阶级专政，是有决定的意义的。
    “斯大林全集”第二卷另一部分文章是论述党的策略问题的。布尔什维克党在第一次革命失败后，在斯托雷平反动时期，在沙皇政府迫害和黑帮分子恐怖活动的情况下，巧妙地利用公开方式和秘密方式，加强了和群众的联系，坚持了斗争，准备了力量以迎接新的革命。
    在公开活动方面，主要是利用国家杜马。斯大林在“给第三届国家杜马社会民主党代表的委托书”中指出：“我们的党团应当借杜马讲坛向全国人民阐明目前革命的全部真实情况，应当大声疾呼地向人民说明，在俄国不可能用和平方法求得人民的解放，通向自由的唯一道路就是全体人民起来反对沙皇政权”。在“彼得堡工人给自己的工人代表的委托书”中更具体地指出了应该怎样利用杜马讲坛。列宁非常重视斯大林的这一文件，把它送交“社会民主党人报”刊登时，在原稿上批道：“一定要交还！不要弄脏。保存这个文件极端重要。”
    创办公开的全国性的报纸“真理报”，起了很大的宣传教育作用，并培养了整整一代的革命战士，保证了一九一七年十月革命的胜利。
    斯大林在巴库和彼得堡两个革命活动时期所写的文章，如“应当抵制协商会议！”、“再论有保障的协商会议”、“石油业主在策略上的转变”、“经济恐怖和工人运动”、“石油业主对经济恐怖的看法”、“他们怎样准备迎接选举”、“初选人的意志”、“关于彼得堡工人选民团的选举结果”、“彼得堡的选举”等，卓越地表现了布尔什维克革命斗争的理论和策略，辩证地灵活地结合了公开和秘密、罢工和协商、局部罢工和同盟罢工等斗争方式。这些文章说明，怎样利用多样化的合法团体，如工会、民众文娱馆、消费合作社、俱乐部、保险社、讲演会、演剧会、戒酒会等配合秘密的革命组织，进行革命斗争。
    “斯大林全集”第二卷的第三个主要内容是关于民族问题的两篇文章，其中“马克思主义和民族问题”是十分杰出的著作。列宁很重视这一论著，他说：“在马克思主义的理论文献中，对于这种实际情况和社会民主党民族纲领的原则，最近已有详细论述（在这方面首屈一指的是斯大林的论文）。”
    斯大林的这一天才著作发展了布尔什维克在民族问题方面的理论和纲领，是布尔什维主义于第一次世界大战前夜在国际舞台上对民族问题所发表的最重要的言论。斯大林在这一著作中说明民族问题是革命总问题的一部分，是各国劳动者和被压迫民族解放斗争的一部分，他非常有力地驳斥了西欧社会民主党的机会主义理论家把民族与无产阶级的阶级斗争分割开来的谬论。
    斯大林对民族问题的解决，是符合当时俄国革命解放斗争的切身利益的。因为“从上层掀起的黩武的民族主义浪潮，‘当权人物’用来报复‘爱好自由’的边疆地区的种种高压手段，在下层激起了民族主义的逆流，这种民族主义有时变成粗暴的沙文主义。……民族主义的浪潮日益汹涌地逼来，大有席卷工人群众之势。”因此，“社会民主党负有崇高的使命：给民族主义一个反击，使群众不受一般‘时疫’的传染。……用久经考验的国际主义武器，用统一而不可分的阶级斗争去对抗民族主义。”
    斯大林的这一名著包括：民族、民族运动、问题的提法、民族文化自治、崩得（它的民族主义、它的分离主义）、取消派代表会议、俄国的民族问题等七个部分。斯大林在这篇文章里完整无遗地创立了民族的定义，证明民族不是一成不变的，而是历史上形成的范畴，是一定的社会经济产物，从而驳斥了反动的种族理论。
    这篇文章是以无产阶级国际主义的思想、是以各民族的无产者和半无产者联合和统一起来为推翻地主和资产阶级而进行共同的革命斗争的思想为基础的，它尖锐地批驳了“民族文化自治”，明确地提出了民族自决权和区域自治的纲领，清楚地答复了民族怎样为反对压迫，为争取解放和民主而斗争的迫切问题，对于被压迫民族的解放斗争具有巨大的革命意义。
    “斯大林全集”第二卷教导我们建党和巩固党的原则与方法，具有高度原则性和高度灵活性的斗争策略，民族解放斗争与无产阶级革命斗争相结合的理论和纲领，这些都将帮助我们更好地来掌握无产阶级斗争的思想武器。
