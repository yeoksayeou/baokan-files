    The US-Li clique utterly destroyed South Korea's schools and educational institutions during the war, and recently has been using the remaining school buildings as barracks and military supply depots. The US-Li clique's actions of destroying education are arousing resistance from South Korean students who have been forced out of school.
    According to evidently incomplete figures revealed by South Korean newspapers, the US-Li clique thoroughly destroyed and burned 11,018 classrooms and 2,607 science research rooms and laboratories during the war.
    After the armistice, they even drove students out of the remaining schools and forcibly occupied the school buildings, using them as barracks and military supply depots. According to a South Korean news agency report, in Seoul alone, the school buildings of a total of thirty universities, middle schools, and other schools were occupied by the US-Li troops and used as barracks and military supply depots.
    According to a report in the South Korean "Chosun Ilbo," more than 600 students from the Sousong National School in Seoul, who were forced out of school due to the US military and the Li puppet army occupying the school buildings, gathered at the school on the morning of December 17, 1953, and held a demonstration demanding that the US-Li troops move out of the school. The US-Li clique even mobilized troops to forcibly drive these students, who were crying and shouting for the right to study, out of the school.

    美李匪帮摧残南朝鲜的教育
    【新华社讯】美李匪帮在战时把南朝鲜的学校与教育机关破坏殆尽，最近又把残存校舍用作兵营和军需仓库。美李匪帮摧残教育的行为，正引起南朝鲜失学学生的反抗。
    据南朝鲜报纸透露的显然不完全的数字，美李匪帮在战争期间彻底破坏了和烧毁了一万一千零十八间教室和两千六百零七间科学研究室和实验室。
    停战后，他们还从残存的学校里把学生赶出去，强占校舍，用作兵营和军需仓库。据南朝鲜通讯社消息：仅汉城一地，就共有大学、中学等共三十所学校的校舍被美李匪军侵占，用作兵营和军需仓库。
    据南朝鲜“朝鲜日报”报道：因美军和李伪军侵占校舍而失学的汉城市寿松国民学校的学生六百余人，在一九五三年十二月十七日早晨，到该校聚集，举行示威，要求美李匪军搬出学校。美李匪帮竟动员军队，把这些连喊带哭的要求读书的学生强制赶出学校。
