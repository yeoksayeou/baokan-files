    Shanxi Province Actively Builds Water Conservancy Projects, Irrigated Land More Than Doubles in Four Years
    Shanxi Province has a high terrain and suffers from spring droughts and summer dryness, which greatly affects crop growth. In the past four years, the Party and government leading organs of Shanxi Province have mobilized the masses to build more than 37,000 river and canal irrigation projects, newly dug and restored more than 115,000 wells, drilled more than 450 artesian wells, and loaned more than 38,000 waterwheels. In terms of large and medium-sized irrigation projects, more than ten modern projects have been newly opened, including the Hutuo River, Xiao River, Fen River, and Sanggan River irrigation areas, as well as the Linfen Farm and the Changzhi Pengpai Village mechanical pumping stations. Water conservancy construction was also carried out for Jinyuan, Gaocun, Xinzhuang, and other farms. At the same time, democratic reforms have been universally carried out on all river systems, abolishing feudal water regulations and implementing rational irrigation. The above items have expanded the irrigation area by more than 4.5 million mu in total. Calculated based on an increase of 60 jin of grain per mu of dry land converted to irrigated land, the province annually harvests more than 270 million jin of grain. At present, the irrigated land area in the province has reached more than 7.9 million mu, which is about 1.3 times more than four years ago. The average irrigated land per person in the province is 0.6 mu, which is also more than double the past. The construction of water conservancy has also promoted the development and consolidation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in some areas, and cultivated the ability and belief of farmers to collectively resist disasters and develop interests. Farmers in Huayan Village, Fanshi County, have developed from collectively silting beaches for rice planting to an agricultural production cooperative, and are now vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction. Seventeen silting beach groups in Zhaocheng County collectively silted beaches for rice planting and achieved a bumper harvest, selling a total of 450,000 jin of grain to the state last year.
    Shanxi Province has also carried out soil and water conservation in mountainous areas and flood control work in river channels in response to the characteristics of concentrated rainfall in summer, which often causes mountain floods and river flooding. In the past four years, a total of more than 1.1 million mass-based water storage ponds, interception ditches, backwater channels, and drought canals and wells have been dug, and more than 9.8 million trees have been planted along mountains and rivers. More than 20,000 valley barns have been built, controlling an area of more than 2,100 square kilometers and retaining more than 5.5 million cubic meters of sediment, turning floods in some mountainous areas into trickles, and initially maintaining soil and water. A total of more than 42,000 flood control projects have been carried out, ensuring that more than 2,200 villages and more than 2.3 million mu of land are not threatened by floods. (Yan Mingxiang)

    山西省积极兴修水利四年来水地增加一倍多
    山西省地势高亢，春旱夏干，对农作物生长影响很大。最近四年中，山西省党、政领导机关共发动群众兴修了河渠灌溉工程三万七千余处，新凿与恢复水井十一万五千多眼，开凿自流井四百五十余眼，贷放水车三万八千余部。在大、中型灌溉工程方面，新开了滹沱河、潇河、汾河、桑干河等灌溉区以及临汾农场和长治澎湃村机械抽水站等近代化工程共十余处。并为晋源、高村、辛庄等农场进行了水利建设。同时，在各河系上普遍进行了民主改革，废除封建水规，实行合理灌溉。以上各项，总共扩大灌溉面积四百五十多万亩，按旱地变水地每亩增产六十斤粮计算，全省每年即多收粮食二亿七千多万斤。目前全省水地面积已达七百九十多万亩，约比四年前增加了一点三倍，全省每人平均有水地六分，也比过去增加了一倍多。兴修水利还促进了部分地区互助合作运动的发展和巩固，培养了农民集体抗灾兴利的能力和信念。繁峙县花岩村农民已由集体淤滩种稻发展成为农业生产合作社，现在又大力进行水利建设。赵城县十七个淤滩组，集体淤滩种稻获得丰收，去年共卖给国家四十五万斤粮食。
    山西省还针对夏季雨量集中，经常造成山洪暴发、河流泛滥成灾的特点，进行山区水土保持和河道防洪工作。四年来，共挑挖群众性蓄水池、截水沟、退水渠和旱渠旱井等一百一十多万宗，沿山沿河植树九百八十多万株。建谷坊二万多座，控制面积二千一百多平方公里，拦蓄泥沙五百五十多万立方公尺，使部分山区洪水变成了细水长流，初步保持了水土。防洪工程共做了四万二千多件，保证了二千二百多处村庄、二百三十多万亩土地不受洪水威胁。（阎明祥）
