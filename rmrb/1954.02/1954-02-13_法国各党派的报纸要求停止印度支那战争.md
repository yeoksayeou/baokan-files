    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 11th: Recently, French newspapers of various parties have been increasingly resolute in demanding an end to the Indochina War. "Combat" severely criticized the government's Indochina policy as a "foolish adventure," believing that the government "must be responsible to the nation for this adventure." The newspaper wrote that the trapped French forces in Tonkin (in northern Vietnam) are no longer gaining the upper hand. We are losing the initiative everywhere... The officers and sergeants we have lost at all levels are irreplaceable, not to mention how much money this war costs, and the speed at which this war is developing is unsustainable for us in the long run.
    "Les Echos," the French business and financial newspaper, holds the same attitude towards the Indochina War. The newspaper pointed out that the United States is dissatisfied with the development of the war in Indochina, pointing out that it hopes to strengthen the Bao Dai army. However, as the newspaper acknowledged, Vietnamese people in the French-occupied areas refuse to support the Bao Dai regime and refuse to serve in the puppet army.

    法国各党派的报纸要求停止印度支那战争
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十一日讯：最近法国各党派的报纸愈来愈坚决地要求停止印度支那战争。“战斗报”严厉地指责政府对印度支那的政策是“愚蠢的冒险”，该报认为政府“必须对这种冒险向国家负责”。该报写道，被困的法军在东京（在越南北部）已不再占上风。我们到处都丧失主动权……我们所损失的各级军官和军士是无法弥补的，且不必谈这种战争要耗费多少钱，而且这种战争的发展速度是我们无法长久支持的。
    法国企业与金融界机关报“回声报”对印度支那战争也抱同样态度。该报指出美国对印度支那的战局的发展不满意，指出它希望加强保大军队。然而正如该报所承认的，法占区的越南人都拒绝支持保大政权，并拒绝为傀儡军队服役。
