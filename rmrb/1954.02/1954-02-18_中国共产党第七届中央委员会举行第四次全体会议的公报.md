    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held from February 6th to 10th, 1954. Thirty-five official members and twenty-six alternate members of the Central Committee attended the plenary session. Nine official members and alternate members of the Central Committee were absent due to illness or other reasons. A total of fifty-two leading comrades from the Party, government, military, and people's organizations attended the meeting as observers. Comrade Mao Zedong did not attend the plenary session as he was on vacation. At the plenary session, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPC, delivered the "Report of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee" on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and forty-four other comrades made important speeches. After detailed discussions, the plenary session unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" proposed based on the suggestion of Comrade Mao Zedong, and unanimously adopted the resolution approving the work of the Central Political Bureau since the Third Plenary Session and the resolution to convene a National Congress of the Party within 1954.
    The main points of the "Report of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee" delivered by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session are as follows:
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report is divided into three parts: 1. The work of the Central Political Bureau since the Third Plenary Session; 2. On convening the National Congress of the Party; 3. Striving to strengthen Party unity.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out when talking about the work of the Central Political Bureau since the Third Plenary Session: It has been three and a half years since the Third Plenary Session of the Party in June 1950. During this period, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, led the entire Party and the people of the whole country in carrying out tremendous work. The Party's work during this period was basically guided by the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the Third Plenary Session. During this period, the central leadership of the Party led the entire Party and the people of the whole country in carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the peaceful liberation of Tibet, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the ideological remoulding of intellectuals, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and a series of other social reform movements. At the same time, movements for increasing production and practicing economy, labor emulation, and patriotic production increase, as well as many production reforms, were carried out in factories and rural areas, which greatly increased industrial and agricultural production. Major industrial and agricultural products had exceeded or approached the highest production levels in China's past history by 1952; transportation and commerce had also developed correspondingly; the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure had remained balanced, market prices had remained stable; people's purchasing power had increased, and people's lives had improved. The entire Party and the people of the whole country well implemented the guidelines instructed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and strived for a fundamental improvement in the state's financial and economic situation, enabling China to successfully complete the restoration of the national economy in 1952. In 1952, the total value of national industrial and agricultural production was 170 percent of that in 1949, of which the output value of modern industry was 2.6 times. The output value of modern industry accounted for only 17 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural production in 1949, but it had increased to about 28 percent by 1952. While carrying out economic restoration work, the socialist and semi-socialist economies achieved important growth. He continued to point out: In 1953, China entered a period of planned economic construction and began to implement the first Five-Year Plan. The Central Political Bureau, based on the proposal of Comrade Mao Zedong, determined the Party's general line for the transition period, which was necessary and timely. In the months after the general line was put forward, the Party conducted a large-scale publicity and education campaign on the general line for the transition period to all Party members, cadres, and the people of the whole country, so that the Party's general line for the transition period won the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of the people of the whole country, the socialist ideology established an overwhelming advantage in the country, and the capitalist ideology was deeply criticized. Encouraged by the Party's general line, we successfully completed the task of the first year of the first Five-Year Plan, namely 1953. In terms of industry, the total value of national industrial production is expected to complete 106 percent of the annual plan, an increase of about 34 percent compared with 1952; in terms of capital construction, the central industrial departments can complete 96.8 percent; in terms of agriculture, although there were quite serious disasters in some places last year, the total grain output was still slightly higher than the level of 1952. In the winter of 1953, in order to ensure the supply of national grain and the stability of market prices, to overcome the spontaneous capitalist forces of the peasants, and to fight against the anti-restriction activities of the bourgeoisie, the state has begun to implement the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of grain, and has launched a huge work. He also pointed out: We have also carried out huge work in cultural and educational work, democratic political construction, foreign affairs and international activities, and many other aspects. The united front work uniting all nationalities, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the country has made important progress. While narrating the great victories we have achieved in the struggle against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, on the economic front, and in other aspects since the Third Plenary Session, Comrade Liu Shaoqi emphasized that this is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to our country, and the profound sympathy of the peace-loving people of the world for our country. Then he went on to say: Since the Third Plenary Session, Party education, cadre learning, and Party consolidation and building have also made considerable achievements. There are now 6.5 million Party members, the composition of Party members has improved, and the level of consciousness of Party members and the Party's combat effectiveness have been enhanced. While pointing out the above-mentioned great achievements that the Party has achieved since the Third Plenary Session, he also pointed out the shortcomings and errors existing in the Party's various tasks, and believed that: Timely discovery and correction of shortcomings and errors in work is one of the fundamental reasons for the great achievements of our various tasks, therefore, he requested the entire Party to always maintain a humble attitude and the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and strive to continuously correct and overcome the shortcomings and errors in work.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out when talking about convening the National Congress of the Party: The successful completion of the state's first Five-Year Plan is a decisive key to realizing the Party's general line during the transition period; therefore, the Central Political Bureau requested the Fourth Plenary Session to approve the convening of the National Congress of the Party within 1954 to discuss the outline of the state's first Five-Year Plan and other related issues.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said when talking about fighting to strengthen Party unity: Comrade Mao Zedong put forward suggestions on strengthening Party unity at the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee on December 24, 1953. The Central Political Bureau unanimously agreed with Comrade Mao Zedong's suggestions and drafted a "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" based on his suggestions, and submitted it to the Seventh Plenary Session for discussion.
    The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session pointed out: The unity of the Party, the unity of the working class, the unity of the working people, and the unity of the people of the whole country are the basic guarantees for the victory of the revolution. This is one of the most basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. Relying on the unity of the entire Party, the Communist Party of China led the people of the whole country to complete the New Democratic Revolution and establish the People's Republic of China. However, the revolutionary cause in China has not yet been finally completed, the enemies of the people at home have not been completely eliminated, and the encirclement of imperialism still exists abroad. China is now in the stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation. We must gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually realize the socialist reform of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and build our country into a strong socialist country. This is a more profound and extensive revolution than the revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and contains extremely complex and sharp struggles. In this struggle, on the one hand, foreign imperialism will never sit idly by; on the other hand, those classes at home that have been overthrown will never be reconciled to their demise, and those classes that will be eliminated will never be without resistance. The determined counter-revolutionary elements among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism, using every opportunity to undermine the cause of our Party and the people, attempting to make the Chinese revolutionary cause fail, and restore reactionary rule in China. One of the most important methods for imperialists and counter-revolutionaries to undermine us is to first undermine the unity of our Party and find their agents within our Party. Our Party has produced Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, and the Soviet Party has produced Beria. Such major historical lessons show that the enemy must not only find their agents within our Party, but also have found them, and may still find some unstable, disloyal, and even ulterior motives as their agents in the future.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the report: The Central Political Bureau believes that it should be seriously pointed out that the most dangerous thing for the Party is the danger that the enemy creates division within our Party, creates factional activities, and uses certain factions (if the enemy can really create a faction) as their agents; because the enemy and us are equally clear about this truth: the fortress is most easily breached from the inside. Therefore, the entire Party must not think that it is particularly strange that imperialists who are trying to stage a comeback and bourgeois elements who are resolutely resisting socialist transformation want to create divisions within our Party and find agents; no, if the enemy does not want to divide us, does not want to use the divisions in our ranks, does not want to use the disloyal, unstable, and even ill-intentioned elements in our ranks as agents, that would be truly strange. Therefore, our task is definitely not to use the spirit of "everything is fine" to lift the vigilance of the entire Party, but should be the opposite, we should use the reality of class struggle and historical lessons to raise this vigilance, keep the entire Party in a state of soberness, and answer the enemy's conspiracies with practical actions to strengthen Party unity.
    The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session made a comprehensive analysis of the internal situation of our Party. The resolution pointed out: Based on Marxism-Leninism, on the correct political line and the correct organizational line, and after all kinds of sacrifices and struggles, the Communist Party of China has formed the unified leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the unity of the entire Party. This unity has been increasingly consolidated due to the timely and correct overcoming of hostile activities and erroneous tendencies that endanger Party unity, and finally made the Party an invincible force. However, our Party is still adopting a policy of alliance with the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie still surrounds us like a vast ocean, our Party is very large, the Marxist-Leninist education within the Party is still far from sufficient, and the ideological and political situation among some cadres is still quite complex; at the same time, some cadres, even some senior cadres, in our Party still do not have enough understanding of the importance of Party unity, do not have enough understanding of the importance of collective leadership, and do not have enough understanding of the importance of consolidating and enhancing the prestige of the Central Committee; especially because after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in China, a very dangerous sense of pride has grown in some cadres within the Party. They are overwhelmed by some achievements in their work, forgetting the humble attitude and the spirit of self-criticism that a Communist Party member must have, exaggerating the role of individuals, emphasizing the prestige of individuals, thinking that they are the best in the world, can only listen to flattery and praise, cannot be criticized and supervised, suppressing and retaliating against critics, and even regarding the regions and departments they lead as their personal capital and independent kingdoms. All these situations show that at this critical historical juncture when our country is implementing socialist transformation, it is extremely necessary to awaken all comrades in the Party to raise revolutionary vigilance and strengthen Party unity. Party unity is the life of the Party and a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism, and undermining Party unity is violating the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is helping the enemy to harm the life of the Party. The resolution requires all comrades in the Party to cherish Party unity with a high degree of consciousness and strive to strengthen Party unity. In particular, the responsible comrades of the Central Committee and above the provincial (municipal) committees and the senior responsible comrades of the armed forces should have a high degree of consciousness about the necessity of Party unity and the importance of their own responsibilities, and should make great efforts and necessary work within the Party.
    For this purpose, the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session stipulates various specific methods to strengthen Party unity, and at the same time points out: Party unity must be and can only be unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, unity on the basis of correct political principles and correct organizational principles. In order to strengthen Party unity, not only is it not allowed to reduce intra-Party democracy and intra-Party criticism and self-criticism, but it is necessary to ensure the full development of intra-Party democracy and the full development of intra-Party criticism and self-criticism, in order to try to avoid all avoidable shortcomings and errors and ensure the smooth progress of the Party's cause. Criticism of the shortcomings or errors of Party members should distinguish between different situations and adopt different policies. For those who intentionally undermine Party unity, confront the Party, insist on not correcting their mistakes, and even engage in sectarian activities, split activities, and other harmful activities within the Party, the Party must carry out a ruthless struggle, impose strict sanctions, and even expel them from the Party when necessary. Because only in this way can we maintain Party unity, maintain the interests of the revolution, and the interests of the people. However, for those comrades who have shortcomings that are relatively unimportant in nature or have committed errors that are relatively unimportant in nature, or for those who, although have serious or relatively serious shortcomings and have committed serious or relatively serious errors, but can still put the interests of the Party above their personal interests after being criticized and educated, and are willing to correct and implement corrections, we should adopt the policy of "being kind to others" and "curing the disease to save the patient". For their shortcomings or errors, we must conduct serious criticism or necessary struggles according to the specific circumstances; but this kind of criticism or struggle should implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong: "Starting from unity, reaching the goal of unity through criticism or struggle", we should not deny them the opportunity to correct their mistakes, let alone deliberately exaggerate their individual, partial, temporary, and relatively unimportant shortcomings or errors into systematic and serious shortcomings or errors, because this attitude does not start from unity, cannot achieve the goal of unity, and is not conducive to the Party.
    The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session finally pointed out: The unity of the responsible comrades of the Central Committee and above the provincial (municipal) committees and the senior responsible comrades of the armed forces is the key to the unity of the entire Party. These responsible comrades bear the main responsibility in the cause of strengthening Party unity. The resolution calls on these comrades and, through these comrades, educates Party cadres to set an example, work together with one heart and one mind, and "unite the entire Party as a harmonious family, as a solid piece of steel, on the basis of the consistency of Marxist-Leninist thought", in order to unite the entire working class, unite all working people, and the people of the whole country, to fight against any destructive conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad, and ensure the victory of the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.
