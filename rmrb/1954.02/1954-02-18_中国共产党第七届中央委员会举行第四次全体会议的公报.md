    The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held from February 6th to 10th, 1954. Thirty-five official members and twenty-six alternate members of the Central Committee attended the plenary session. Nine official members and alternate members of the Central Committee were absent due to illness or other reasons. A total of fifty-two leading comrades from the Party, government, military, and people's organizations attended the meeting as observers. Comrade Mao Zedong did not attend the plenary session as he was on vacation. At the plenary session, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPC, delivered the "Report of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee" on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and forty-four other comrades made important speeches. After detailed discussions, the plenary session unanimously adopted the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" proposed based on the suggestion of Comrade Mao Zedong, and unanimously adopted the resolution approving the work of the Central Political Bureau since the Third Plenary Session and the resolution to convene a National Congress of the Party within 1954.
    The main points of the "Report of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee" delivered by Comrade Liu Shaoqi on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session are as follows:
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report is divided into three parts: 1. The work of the Central Political Bureau since the Third Plenary Session; 2. On convening the National Congress of the Party; 3. Striving to strengthen Party unity.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out when talking about the work of the Central Political Bureau since the Third Plenary Session: It has been three and a half years since the Third Plenary Session of the Party in June 1950. During this period, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, led the entire Party and the people of the whole country in carrying out tremendous work. The Party's work during this period was basically guided by the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee and the Third Plenary Session. During this period, the central leadership of the Party led the entire Party and the people of the whole country in carrying out the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the peaceful liberation of Tibet, land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the ideological remoulding of intellectuals, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and a series of other social reform movements. At the same time, movements for increasing production and practicing economy, labor emulation, and patriotic production increase, as well as many production reforms, were carried out in factories and rural areas, which greatly increased industrial and agricultural production. Major industrial and agricultural products had exceeded or approached the highest production levels in China's past history by 1952; transportation and commerce had also developed correspondingly; the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure had remained balanced, market prices had remained stable; people's purchasing power had increased, and people's lives had improved. The entire Party and the people of the whole country well implemented the guidelines instructed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and strived for a fundamental improvement in the state's financial and economic situation, enabling China to successfully complete the restoration of the national economy in 1952. In 1952, the total value of national industrial and agricultural production was 170 percent of that in 1949, of which the output value of modern industry was 2.6 times. The output value of modern industry accounted for only 17 percent of the total value of industrial and agricultural production in 1949, but it had increased to about 28 percent by 1952. While carrying out economic restoration work, the socialist and semi-socialist economies achieved important growth. He continued to point out: In 1953, China entered a period of planned economic construction and began to implement the first Five-Year Plan. The Central Political Bureau, based on the proposal of Comrade Mao Zedong, determined the Party's general line for the transition period, which was necessary and timely. In the months after the general line was put forward, the Party conducted a large-scale publicity and education campaign on the general line for the transition period to all Party members, cadres, and the people of the whole country, so that the Party's general line for the transition period won the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of the people of the whole country, the socialist ideology established an overwhelming advantage in the country, and the capitalist ideology was deeply criticized. Encouraged by the Party's general line, we successfully completed the task of the first year of the first Five-Year Plan, namely 1953. In terms of industry, the total value of national industrial production is expected to complete 106 percent of the annual plan, an increase of about 34 percent compared with 1952; in terms of capital construction, the central industrial departments can complete 96.8 percent; in terms of agriculture, although there were quite serious disasters in some places last year, the total grain output was still slightly higher than the level of 1952. In the winter of 1953, in order to ensure the supply of national grain and the stability of market prices, to overcome the spontaneous capitalist forces of the peasants, and to fight against the anti-restriction activities of the bourgeoisie, the state has begun to implement the policy of planned purchase and planned supply of grain, and has launched a huge work. He also pointed out: We have also carried out huge work in cultural and educational work, democratic political construction, foreign affairs and international activities, and many other aspects. The united front work uniting all nationalities, democratic parties, and people's organizations in the country has made important progress. While narrating the great victories we have achieved in the struggle against U.S. aggression and aid Korea, on the economic front, and in other aspects since the Third Plenary Session, Comrade Liu Shaoqi emphasized that this is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to our country, and the profound sympathy of the peace-loving people of the world for our country. Then he went on to say: Since the Third Plenary Session, Party education, cadre learning, and Party consolidation and building have also made considerable achievements. There are now 6.5 million Party members, the composition of Party members has improved, and the level of consciousness of Party members and the Party's combat effectiveness have been enhanced. While pointing out the above-mentioned great achievements that the Party has achieved since the Third Plenary Session, he also pointed out the shortcomings and errors existing in the Party's various tasks, and believed that: Timely discovery and correction of shortcomings and errors in work is one of the fundamental reasons for the great achievements of our various tasks, therefore, he requested the entire Party to always maintain a humble attitude and the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and strive to continuously correct and overcome the shortcomings and errors in work.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out when talking about convening the National Congress of the Party: The successful completion of the state's first Five-Year Plan is a decisive key to realizing the Party's general line during the transition period; therefore, the Central Political Bureau requested the Fourth Plenary Session to approve the convening of the National Congress of the Party within 1954 to discuss the outline of the state's first Five-Year Plan and other related issues.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said when talking about fighting to strengthen Party unity: Comrade Mao Zedong put forward suggestions on strengthening Party unity at the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee on December 24, 1953. The Central Political Bureau unanimously agreed with Comrade Mao Zedong's suggestions and drafted a "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" based on his suggestions, and submitted it to the Seventh Plenary Session for discussion.
    The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session pointed out: The unity of the Party, the unity of the working class, the unity of the working people, and the unity of the people of the whole country are the basic guarantees for the victory of the revolution. This is one of the most basic principles of Marxism-Leninism. Relying on the unity of the entire Party, the Communist Party of China led the people of the whole country to complete the New Democratic Revolution and establish the People's Republic of China. However, the revolutionary cause in China has not yet been finally completed, the enemies of the people at home have not been completely eliminated, and the encirclement of imperialism still exists abroad. China is now in the stage of socialist revolution, that is, socialist transformation. We must gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually realize the socialist reform of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, and build our country into a strong socialist country. This is a more profound and extensive revolution than the revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and contains extremely complex and sharp struggles. In this struggle, on the one hand, foreign imperialism will never sit idly by; on the other hand, those classes at home that have been overthrown will never be reconciled to their demise, and those classes that will be eliminated will never be without resistance. The determined counter-revolutionary elements among them will inevitably collude with foreign imperialism, using every opportunity to undermine the cause of our Party and the people, attempting to make the Chinese revolutionary cause fail, and restore reactionary rule in China. One of the most important methods for imperialists and counter-revolutionaries to undermine us is to first undermine the unity of our Party and find their agents within our Party. Our Party has produced Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, and the Soviet Party has produced Beria. Such major historical lessons show that the enemy must not only find their agents within our Party, but also have found them, and may still find some unstable, disloyal, and even ulterior motives as their agents in the future.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in the report: The Central Political Bureau believes that it should be seriously pointed out that the most dangerous thing for the Party is the danger that the enemy creates division within our Party, creates factional activities, and uses certain factions (if the enemy can really create a faction) as their agents; because the enemy and us are equally clear about this truth: the fortress is most easily breached from the inside. Therefore, the entire Party must not think that it is particularly strange that imperialists who are trying to stage a comeback and bourgeois elements who are resolutely resisting socialist transformation want to create divisions within our Party and find agents; no, if the enemy does not want to divide us, does not want to use the divisions in our ranks, does not want to use the disloyal, unstable, and even ill-intentioned elements in our ranks as agents, that would be truly strange. Therefore, our task is definitely not to use the spirit of "everything is fine" to lift the vigilance of the entire Party, but should be the opposite, we should use the reality of class struggle and historical lessons to raise this vigilance, keep the entire Party in a state of soberness, and answer the enemy's conspiracies with practical actions to strengthen Party unity.
    The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session made a comprehensive analysis of the internal situation of our Party. The resolution pointed out: Based on Marxism-Leninism, on the correct political line and the correct organizational line, and after all kinds of sacrifices and struggles, the Communist Party of China has formed the unified leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and the unity of the entire Party. This unity has been increasingly consolidated due to the timely and correct overcoming of hostile activities and erroneous tendencies that endanger Party unity, and finally made the Party an invincible force. However, our Party is still adopting a policy of alliance with the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie still surrounds us like a vast ocean, our Party is very large, the Marxist-Leninist education within the Party is still far from sufficient, and the ideological and political situation among some cadres is still quite complex; at the same time, some cadres, even some senior cadres, in our Party still do not have enough understanding of the importance of Party unity, do not have enough understanding of the importance of collective leadership, and do not have enough understanding of the importance of consolidating and enhancing the prestige of the Central Committee; especially because after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in China, a very dangerous sense of pride has grown in some cadres within the Party. They are overwhelmed by some achievements in their work, forgetting the humble attitude and the spirit of self-criticism that a Communist Party member must have, exaggerating the role of individuals, emphasizing the prestige of individuals, thinking that they are the best in the world, can only listen to flattery and praise, cannot be criticized and supervised, suppressing and retaliating against critics, and even regarding the regions and departments they lead as their personal capital and independent kingdoms. All these situations show that at this critical historical juncture when our country is implementing socialist transformation, it is extremely necessary to awaken all comrades in the Party to raise revolutionary vigilance and strengthen Party unity. Party unity is the life of the Party and a basic principle of Marxism-Leninism, and undermining Party unity is violating the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is helping the enemy to harm the life of the Party. The resolution requires all comrades in the Party to cherish Party unity with a high degree of consciousness and strive to strengthen Party unity. In particular, the responsible comrades of the Central Committee and above the provincial (municipal) committees and the senior responsible comrades of the armed forces should have a high degree of consciousness about the necessity of Party unity and the importance of their own responsibilities, and should make great efforts and necessary work within the Party.
    For this purpose, the "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session stipulates various specific methods to strengthen Party unity, and at the same time points out: Party unity must be and can only be unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, unity on the basis of correct political principles and correct organizational principles. In order to strengthen Party unity, not only is it not allowed to reduce intra-Party democracy and intra-Party criticism and self-criticism, but it is necessary to ensure the full development of intra-Party democracy and the full development of intra-Party criticism and self-criticism, in order to try to avoid all avoidable shortcomings and errors and ensure the smooth progress of the Party's cause. Criticism of the shortcomings or errors of Party members should distinguish between different situations and adopt different policies. For those who intentionally undermine Party unity, confront the Party, insist on not correcting their mistakes, and even engage in sectarian activities, split activities, and other harmful activities within the Party, the Party must carry out a ruthless struggle, impose strict sanctions, and even expel them from the Party when necessary. Because only in this way can we maintain Party unity, maintain the interests of the revolution, and the interests of the people. However, for those comrades who have shortcomings that are relatively unimportant in nature or have committed errors that are relatively unimportant in nature, or for those who, although have serious or relatively serious shortcomings and have committed serious or relatively serious errors, but can still put the interests of the Party above their personal interests after being criticized and educated, and are willing to correct and implement corrections, we should adopt the policy of "being kind to others" and "curing the disease to save the patient". For their shortcomings or errors, we must conduct serious criticism or necessary struggles according to the specific circumstances; but this kind of criticism or struggle should implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong: "Starting from unity, reaching the goal of unity through criticism or struggle", we should not deny them the opportunity to correct their mistakes, let alone deliberately exaggerate their individual, partial, temporary, and relatively unimportant shortcomings or errors into systematic and serious shortcomings or errors, because this attitude does not start from unity, cannot achieve the goal of unity, and is not conducive to the Party.
    The "Resolution on Strengthening Party Unity" adopted by the plenary session finally pointed out: The unity of the responsible comrades of the Central Committee and above the provincial (municipal) committees and the senior responsible comrades of the armed forces is the key to the unity of the entire Party. These responsible comrades bear the main responsibility in the cause of strengthening Party unity. The resolution calls on these comrades and, through these comrades, educates Party cadres to set an example, work together with one heart and one mind, and "unite the entire Party as a harmonious family, as a solid piece of steel, on the basis of the consistency of Marxist-Leninist thought", in order to unite the entire working class, unite all working people, and the people of the whole country, to fight against any destructive conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad, and ensure the victory of the great cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    中国共产党第七届中央委员会举行第四次全体会议的公报
    中国共产党第七届中央委员会，于一九五四年二月六日至十日举行了第四次全体会议。出席全会的正式中央委员三十五人，候补中央委员二十六人，正式中央委员和候补中央委员因病因事缺席九人。列席全会的有党、政、军和人民团体的主要负责同志共五十二人。毛泽东同志因在休假期间没有出席全会。在全会上，中共中央书记处书记刘少奇同志受党中央政治局和毛泽东同志的委托作了“中共中央政治局向第七届第四次中央全会的报告”，朱德、周恩来等四十四个同志作了重要的发言，经过详细的讨论，全会一致通过了根据毛泽东同志的建议而提出的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，并一致通过了批准三中全会以来中央政治局的工作和在一九五四年年内召开党的全国代表会议的决议。
    刘少奇同志受党中央政治局和毛泽东同志的委托所作的“中共中央政治局向第七届第四次中央全会的报告”和全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”，其要点如下：
    刘少奇同志的报告共分三个部分：一、三中全会以来中央政治局的工作；二、关于召开党的全国代表会议；三、为增强党的团结而斗争。
    刘少奇同志在讲到三中全会以来中央政治局的工作时指出：从一九五○年六月党的三中全会到现在，已经过了三年半，在这个期间，党的中央政治局以毛泽东同志为首领导着全党和全国人民进行了巨大的工作。党在这时期的工作，基本上是以七届二中全会和三中全会的决议为指针的。在这期间，党的中央领导着全党和全国人民进行了抗美援朝运动、和平解放西藏、土地改革、镇压反革命、对知识分子的思想改造、“三反”“五反”以及其他一系列的社会改革运动。同时，在工厂和农村中进行了增产节约、劳动竞赛和爱国增产运动以及生产上的许多改革工作，大大地提高了工农业生产。主要工农业产品，在一九五二年均已超过或接近我国过去历史上的最高生产水平；交通运输和商业均有相应的发展；国家财政的收支一直保持平衡，市场的物价一直保持稳定；人民的购买力已有提高，人民的生活已有改善。全党和全国人民很好地实现了党中央和毛泽东同志所指示的方针，争取了国家财政经济状况的基本好转，使我国在一九五二年胜利地完成了国民经济的恢复工作。一九五二年全国工农业生产总值为一九四九年的百分之一百七十，其中现代工业产值则为二点六倍。现代工业的产值，在一九四九年只占工农业总产值的百分之十七，至一九五二年已增至百分之二十八左右。在进行经济恢复工作的同时，社会主义和半社会主义性质的经济获得了重要的增长。他继续指出：一九五三年，我国已进入有计划的经济建设时期，并开始执行第一个五年建设计划。中央政治局根据毛泽东同志的提议，确定了党在过渡时期的总路线，是必要的和适时的。在这条总路线提出以后的几个月中，党向全体党员干部和全国人民进行了规模巨大的关于过渡时期总路线的宣传和教育工作，使党在过渡时期的总路线获得了全国绝大多数人民的热诚拥护，使社会主义的思想在国内树立了压倒一切的优势，使资本主义思想受到了深刻的批判。在党的总路线的鼓舞下，我们胜利地完成了第一个五年建设计划的第一年即一九五三年的任务，在工业方面，全国工业生产总值预计可完成年度计划的百分之一○六，较一九五二年约增长百分之三十四；在基本建设方面，中央各工业部可完成百分之九十六点八；在农业方面，去年有些地方虽然发生了相当严重的灾害，但粮食的总产量仍略高于一九五二年的水平。一九五三年冬季，为了保证国家粮食的供应和市场物价的稳定，为了克服农民的资本主义自发势力，并与资产阶级的反限制的活动进行斗争，已开始由国家实行粮食的计划收购和计划供应的政策，并展开了巨大的工作。他又指出：我们在文化教育工作，民主的建政工作，外交和国际活动方面以及其他许多方面都进行了巨大的工作。团结全国各民族、各民主党派、各人民团体的统一战线工作有了重要的进步。刘少奇同志在叙述三中全会以来，我们在抗美援朝斗争、在经济战线上以及其他各方面工作中的伟大胜利时，他着重指出这是与伟大苏联和各人民民主国家对我国的无私的援助以及世界爱好和平人民对我国的深厚同情分不开的。接着他又说到：三中全会以来，党内教育，干部学习，整党建党工作也获得了不少成绩。现有党员六百五十万人，党员成份已有改善，党员的觉悟程度和党的战斗力已有提高。在指出了三中全会以来党已获得上述巨大成就的同时，他又指出了党在各项工作中存在着的缺点和错误，并认为：及时地发现和纠正工作中的缺点和错误，乃是我们各项工作获得巨大成就的根本原因之一，因此要求全党始终保持谦逊态度和批评与自我批评精神，为不断纠正和克服工作中的缺点和错误而奋斗。
    刘少奇同志在讲到关于召开党的全国代表会议时指出：国家第一个五年建设计划的胜利完成是实现党在过渡时期的总路线的一个决定性的关键；因此，中央政治局请求四中全会批准在一九五四年年内召开党的全国代表会议，以讨论国家第一个五年建设计划纲要及其他有关各项问题。
    刘少奇同志在讲到为增强党的团结而斗争时说：毛泽东同志在一九五三年十二月二十四日党的中央政治局的会议上提出了关于增强党的团结的建议。中央政治局一致同意了毛泽东同志的建议，并根据他的建议起草了“关于增强党的团结的决议”草案，提交七届四中全会讨论。
    全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”内指出：党的团结，工人阶级的团结，劳动人民的团结，全国人民的团结，是革命胜利的基本保证。这是马克思列宁主义的最基本原理之一。中国共产党依靠全党的团结，领导着全国人民完成了新民主主义革命，建立了中华人民共和国。但是，现在中国的革命事业还没有最后完成，在国内人民的敌人还没有完全消灭，在国外还存在着帝国主义的包围。现在中国正处在社会主义革命即社会主义改造的阶段，我们要逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步实现对农业对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，这是一个比反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命更深刻更广泛的革命，包含着极复杂极尖锐的斗争。在这场斗争中，一方面，外国帝国主义，决不会袖手旁观；另一方面，国内那些已经被打倒的阶级决不会甘心于自己的死亡，那些将被消灭的阶级也决不会没有反抗，他们中的坚决反革命分子必然要和外国帝国主义互相勾结起来，利用每一个机会来破坏我们党和人民的事业，企图使中国革命事业归于失败，使反动统治在中国复辟。帝国主义者和反革命分子破坏我们的最重要的方法之一就是首先破坏我们党的团结，并在我们党内寻找他们的代理人。我们党内产生过陈独秀、张国焘，苏联党内产生过贝利亚，这样重大的历史教训表明，敌人不但一定要在我们党内寻找他们的代理人，而且曾经找到过，在今后也还可能找到某些不稳定的、不忠实的、以至别有企图的分子作为他们的代理人。
    刘少奇同志在报告中说：中央政治局认为应当严肃地指出：对于党最危险的，乃是敌人在我们党内制造分裂，制造派别活动，利用某种派别（如果敌人真能造成一种派别的话）作为他们的代理人的危险；因为敌人和我们同样明了这个真理：堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的。所以全党千万不要以为力求卷土重来的帝国主义者和坚决抵抗社会主义改造的资产阶级分子要在我们党内制造分裂、寻找代理人是什么特别奇怪的事；不是的，如果敌人不想分裂我们，不想利用我们队伍里面的分歧，不想利用我们队伍里面的不忠实、不稳定以至别有用心的分子作为代理人，那才是真正奇怪的事。因此我们的任务决不是用万事大吉的精神来解除全党的警惕性，而应当是相反，应当用阶级斗争的现实和历史的教训来提高这种警惕性，使全党处于清醒状态，并且用增强党的团结的实际行动来答复敌人的阴谋。
    全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”对我们党的内部情况作了全面的分析。决议指出：中国共产党在马克思列宁主义的基础上，在正确的政治路线和正确的组织路线的基础上，经过种种牺牲奋斗，形成了以毛泽东同志为首的中央的统一领导和全党的团结一致，这个团结又由于及时地正确地克服了危害党的团结的敌对活动和错误倾向而日益巩固，终于使党成为一个不可战胜的力量。但是，我们党现在还采取着和资产阶级联合的政策，小资产阶级还像汪洋大海似地包围着我们，我们的党很大，党内的马克思列宁主义的教育还很不够，一部分干部中的思想政治情况还相当复杂；同时，我们党内一部分干部甚至某些高级干部对于党的团结的重要性还认识不足，对于集体领导的重要性还认识不足，对于巩固和提高中央威信的重要性还认识不足；特别是由于在中国新民主主义革命胜利后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，他们因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神，夸大个人的作用，强调个人的威信，自以为天下第一，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国。所有这些情况都说明，当此我国实行社会主义改造的紧要历史关头，有极大的必要来唤起全党同志更加提高革命警惕性，更加增强党的团结。党的团结是党的生命，是马克思列宁主义的基本原则，而破坏党的团结就是违反马克思列宁主义的基本原则，就是帮助敌人来危害党的生命。决议要求全党的同志都以高度的自觉来爱护党的团结，为增强党的团结而努力。特别是中央委员会和省（市）委员会以上的负责同志和武装部队的高级负责同志，对于党的团结的必要和自身责任的重大都应有很高的自觉，并应在党内作很大的努力和必要的工作。
    为此目的，全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”中规定了各项增强党的团结的具体办法，同时又指出：党的团结必须是也只能是在马克思列宁主义基础上的团结，在正确的政治原则和正确的组织原则的基础上的团结。为了增强党的团结，不但不允许缩小党内民主和党内的批评和自我批评，而且必须保证充分发展党内民主，充分发展党内的批评和自我批评，以求竭力避免一切可能避免的缺点和错误，使党的事业得到顺利的进展。对于党员的缺点或错误进行批评，应当区别不同的情形，采取不同的方针。对于那种有意地破坏党的团结，而与党对抗，坚持不改正错误，甚至在党内进行宗派活动、分裂活动和其他危害活动的分子，党就必须进行无情的斗争，给以严格的制裁，直至在必要时将他们驱逐出党。因为只有这样，才能维护党的团结，才能维护革命的利益和人民的利益。但是对于那种具有在性质上比较不重要的缺点或犯有在性质上比较不重要的错误的同志，或者对于那种虽然具有严重或比较严重的缺点、犯有严重或比较严重的错误，但在受到批评教育以后，仍能把党的利益放在个人的利益之上，愿意改正并实行改正的同志，应当采取“与人为善”、“治病救人”的方针。对于他们的缺点或错误必须按照具体情况进行严肃的批评或必要的斗争；但是这种批评或斗争应当贯彻中央和毛泽东同志的指示：“从团结出发，经过批评或斗争达到团结的目的”，不应当不给他们改正的机会，更不应当故意将他们的个别的、局部的、暂时的、比较不重要的缺点或错误夸大为系统的、严重的缺点或错误，因为这种态度就不是从团结出发，就不能达到团结的目的，就不利于党。
    全会通过的“关于增强党的团结的决议”最后指出：党的中央委员会和省（市）委员会以上负责同志以及武装部队的高级负责同志的团结，是全党团结的关键。在增强党的团结的事业上，这些负责同志担负着主要的责任。决议号召这些同志并经过这些同志教育全党干部以身作则，同心同德，“在马克思列宁主义思想一致的基础上，团结全党如同一个和睦的家庭一样，如同一块坚固的钢铁一样”，以便团结整个工人阶级，团结全体劳动人民和全国人民，为战胜内外敌人的任何破坏阴谋，保证社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大事业的胜利而奋斗。
