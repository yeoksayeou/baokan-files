Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The United States government is not only sending air force power to participate in the invasion of Indochina on an increasingly large scale, but is also conspiring to send the United States' navy and army, as well as armies from various Asian puppet groups, to participate in this war.

	The United States' actions in sending air force power to participate in the war in Indochina have become more blatant with the activities of the Commander of the U.S. Far East Air Force, Weyland, in Indochina. After Weyland returned to Tokyo from Indochina on the 11th, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force in Washington publicly announced on the 12th that the U.S. Air Force's 315th Division stationed in Japan is using the U.S. Air Force base in Tachikawa, near Tokyo, to intensify the airlift of U.S. Air Force personnel, equipment, and supplies to Indochina on an expanding scale. According to an International News Service dispatch from Tokyo on the 11th, 600 to 700 U.S. Air Force officers and soldiers have been rushed to Indochina in recent weeks. These "American aviation personnel, as pilots and technicians, fly in two batches every day from Japanese air force bases to Indochina airports." The U.S. Air Force's 374th Troop Carrier Wing, which is responsible for this airlift mission, "will intensify its flight plans in the next few days." The U.S. Far East Air Force Command also announced on the 10th that in addition to supplying the French aggressor army with B-26 bombers, it is also supplying C-119 giant transport aircraft and other air force equipment. The "Japan Times" in Tokyo pointed out that the U.S. Far East Air Force's recent large-scale airlift to Indochina may be "a precursor" to the United States further dispatching "tactical aircraft" to participate in the war.

	Many sources in Washington have revealed that the "Strategic Planning Committee," specially appointed by Eisenhower and headed by Under Secretary of State Smith and Under Secretary of Defense Keyes, is actively considering "further steps" and "various measures" to actually dispatch U.S. military forces to participate directly in the war and have the United States directly command the war in Indochina, under the guise of "not directly participating in the war." According to United Press International and International News Service, "major decision-makers in the U.S. military," Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford, "favors the United States openly participating in the Indochina War." It is said that "two proposals are being studied, one of which advocates placing greater emphasis on the work of delivering the aircraft requested by France, and sending a high-level military delegation to assist France in planning strategy." At the same time, Radford is also making every effort to advocate "naval blockades" of ports controlled by the Vietnamese people. The Smith-Keyes Committee is "actively considering" this measure. According to a broadcast from Manila Radio on the 12th, a "high-level envoy" that the United States will send to the Far East even blatantly and provocatively said: "The United States may now be considering sending U.S. troops" to invade the northern border areas of Indochina bordering the People's Republic of China.

	At the same time, the U.S. authorities, in accordance with Eisenhower's despicable plan of "using Asians to fight Asians," are conspiring to instruct puppet regimes such as Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek, Magsaysay, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, and Yoshida to send cannon fodder troops and military personnel to participate in the Indochina War. Under the direction of the United States, Syngman Rhee has already proposed sending a division of South Korean puppet troops to participate in the Indochina War. The U.S. State Department specifically "confirmed" Syngman Rhee's proposal on the 12th, and explained that Hull, Commander of the U.S. Forces in the Far East, who is currently in secret talks with Washington and the military, is "considering" Syngman Rhee's proposal in his capacity as "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces" conducting the war of aggression against Korea. Hull also publicly said on the 11th that he believed that sending Rhee's puppet troops to participate in the Indochina War had "certain benefits," because "this would be an Asian country rushing to aid another Asian country." At the same time, in the mouths of U.S. officials and in U.S. newspapers and magazines, there has been constant talk recently about the conspiracy to instruct various Asian puppet groups to send troops to participate in the war.

	In order to create a tense atmosphere and conditions for further participation in the Indochina War, the United States has dispatched its naval vessels and aircraft in the Far East, and gathered naval vessels and aircraft from Britain and France, to hold a large-scale joint naval exercise of the three countries in the waters off the coast of Indochina and near China's territorial waters, starting on February 15 and lasting for ten days. United Press International said that the sea area where the exercises are being held is the sea area through which the United States "transports an increasing amount of military supplies to Indochina."

    美国积极参加印度支那战争
    【新华社十五日讯】美国政府不仅正在以越来越大的规模派遣空军力量参加侵略印度支那的战争，而且正在阴谋派遣美国的海军和陆军以及亚洲各傀儡集团的军队参加这场战争。
    美国派遣空军力量到印度支那参战的行动，已随着美国驻远东空军司令威兰到印度支那的活动而更加明目张胆地进行。在威兰于十一日从印度支那回到东京之后，华盛顿的美国空军方面的发言人就在十二日公开宣布，驻在日本的美国空军第三一五师正利用东京附近的立川的美国空军基地，以日益扩大的规模将美国空军人员及空军的装备和供应加紧空运到印度支那去。据国际新闻社东京十一日电透露说：在近几周内被赶运到印度支那的美国空军军官与士兵已有六百名到七百名。这些“美国航空人员以飞行机师与技术人员的身份每天分两批由日本的空军基地飞往印度支那的机场”。担任这项空运任务的美国空军第三七四运兵联队，“在几天以内将要加紧进行它的飞行计划”。美国远东空军司令部在十日并曾宣布，美国除供给法国侵略军以B—二十六型的轰炸机之外，还正在供给C—一一九型的巨型运输机及其他空军装备。东京的“日本时报”指出：美国远东空军最近对印度支那进行大规模空运的行动，可能是美国进一步派遣“战术飞机”参战的“一个预兆”。
    华盛顿的许多消息都透露：艾森豪威尔所特别任命的以副国务卿史密斯和国防部副部长凯斯为首的“战略计划委员会”，正在所谓“不直接参战”的幌子下，积极考虑采取实际上派遣美国军事力量直接参战、并由美国直接指挥印度支那战争的“进一步步骤”和“各种措施”。据合众社和国际新闻社透露：美国“军方的主要决策人物”、美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福“赞成美国公然参预印度支那战争”。据说：“有两项建议正在研究中，就是主张更加着重地进行关于交付法国所要求的飞机的工作，并派遣一个高级军事代表团去协助法国计划战略。”同时，雷德福并竭力主张对越南人民控制的港口“实行海军封锁”。史密斯—凯斯委员会正在“积极考虑”这个措施。而根据马尼拉电台十二日广播，美国将派到远东的一个“高级使节”更公然以挑衅的口气说：“美国现在可能正在考虑派遣美国部队”去侵占印度支那北部与中华人民共和国接壤的边境地区。
    与此同时，美国当局正在按照艾森豪威尔的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的卑鄙计划，阴谋指使李承晚、蒋介石、麦格赛赛、銮披汶和吉田等傀儡派出炮灰部队和军事人员到印度支那去参战。在美国的指使下，李承晚已经建议派遣南朝鲜伪军一个师参加印度支那战争。美国国务院在十二日特别“证实”了李承晚的这项建议，并说明：现在正在华盛顿和军方进行秘密商谈的远东美军总司令赫尔，以进行侵朝战争的“联合国军总司令”的身份“正在考虑”李承晚的建议。赫尔在十一日并曾公开地说：他认为派遣李伪军去参加印度支那战争有“某些好处”，因为“这将是一个亚洲国家赶去援助另一个亚洲国家”。同时，在美国官员们的口中和美国报纸、杂志上，最近都在不断谈论着指使亚洲各傀儡集团派兵参战的阴谋。
    为了给进一步参加印度支那战争制造紧张气氛和条件，美国已经出动它在远东的海军舰只和飞机，并纠集英国和法国的海军舰只和飞机，从二月十五日起在印度支那海岸及中国领海附近的海面，举行一次历时十天的三国海军的大规模联合演习。合众社说：举行演习的海面是美国往印度支那“运送不断增加的军需品的供应线所经过的海面”。
