Farmers and Production Corps of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang Actively Prepare for Spring Plowing

In most areas of Xinjiang Province, farmers of all ethnic groups have actively launched preparations for spring plowing and production. Many farmers are investing most of their surplus grain sales and sideline production income into agriculture to expand production. In some areas, the People's Bank has also issued loans for increasing livestock and protecting livestock in advance this year. This has expanded farmers' investment in agricultural production this year. Not only have they repaired existing farm tools, but they have also purchased a large number of draught animals and farm tools. For example, farmers in Yuepuhu County sold more than 300,000 catties of surplus grain to the state and bought back more than 400 draught animals, 34 carts, and more than 700 other farm tools. Farmers in Quli Hai Township, Yining County, used their sideline income to buy back more than 20 draft horses, 20 carts, and more than 170 other farm tools. Shawan County has organized carpenters and blacksmiths to focus on repairing carts, plows, and other farm tools. Farmers in various places have also come up with various ways to accumulate and produce fertilizer and actively transport it. In Artush County, farmers in two townships, in half a month, used donkeys to carry back more than 4,700 loads of thorn grass from the Gobi Desert to make fertilizer. Farmers in the Second District and Sixth Township of Mulei River County have accumulated more than 7,000 carts of fertilizer, and more than 2,000 carts have been transported to the fields. In order to facilitate the transportation of fertilizer, farmers in some places have also repaired the bridges on the large and small roads in the villages.

In addition to making material preparations earlier, some areas in Xinjiang have also paid attention to the preparation of technological reforms. Many special districts and counties have held meetings of labor models and mutual aid team leaders in winter to summarize and promote local effective experience in increasing production. Di Hua, Yanqi, and other special districts and counties have also held short-term agricultural technology training classes, absorbing district and township cadres, labor models, mutual aid team leaders, and some production activists to participate in learning, so that they can initially understand general agricultural production knowledge and simple farming techniques, and teach them how to use several new types of farm tools, so that mass production experience and science and technology can be initially combined. In order to further promote the spring plowing preparation work in various places, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government has extracted responsible comrades from relevant units and led inspection teams to go to various places for inspection in late January.

In addition, the agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are also actively carrying out various spring plowing preparation work. The production troops plan to cultivate more than 820,000 mu of farmland this year. In order to strive for a large-scale bumper harvest, various departments seized the time to repair canals and carry out winter irrigation before the freezing. The new Sheng Canal repaired by a certain unit on the banks of the Manas River can increase the irrigation area by 30,000 mu compared to the original. The preparatory work done by the production troops in the Manas River Basin before freezing can save more than 100,000 workdays for spring plowing and production this year. Various departments have also launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign, and everyone is actively picking up wild manure, accumulating manure in pens, and using weeds and leaves to make fertilizer. Livestock keepers are striving to feed the horses to make them strong and sturdy. Various mechanized farms are generally carrying out tractor maintenance, parts replacement, and cleaning and maintenance work, so as to exert greater power in spring plowing and production.

    新疆各族农民和生产部队积极准备春耕
    新疆省大部分地区各族农民已积极展开各项春耕生产的准备工作，很多农民把卖余粮和副业生产收入大部投入农业，扩大生产；有些地区的人民银行还提前发放了今年的增畜保畜贷款。这样就扩大了农民今年农业生产的投资，各地不但修理了原有农具，还大量添置了耕畜和农具。如岳普湖县农民把三十多万斤余粮卖给国家，买回耕畜四百多头、大车三十四辆、其他农具七百多件。伊宁县曲里海乡农民用副业收入买回耕马二十多匹、大车二十辆和其他农具一百七十多件。沙湾县已组织了木匠、铁匠，集中修理大车、犁等农具。各地农民还想出各种各样的办法积肥造肥并积极送肥。阿图什县两个乡的农民，在半个月内就用毛驴从戈壁滩上驮回刺草四千七百多驮子，沤了肥料。木垒河县二区六乡农民已积肥七千多车，拉到地里去的已有二千多车。有些地方农民为了运送肥料方便，还将乡村里大小道路上的桥梁重新修补了一次。
    新疆各地除较早地进行物质准备外，有的地区还注意了技术改革的准备。不少专区和县都在冬季召开了劳动模范及互助组长会议，总结和推广了当地行之有效的增产经验。迪化、焉耆等专区、县还举办了短期农业技术传授班，吸收区乡干部、劳动模范、互助组长和一些生产积极分子等参加学习，使他们初步懂得一般的农业生产知识和简单耕作技术，并教会了几种新式农具的使用方法，使群众生产经验与科学技术得到初步结合。为了更进一步推动各地春耕准备工作，新疆省人民政府已由有关单位中抽出负责同志，带领检查小组，在一月下旬分赴各地进行检查。
    此外，中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队也积极进行各项春耕准备工作。生产部队计划今年耕种八十二万多亩田地，为了争取大面积丰收，各部在封冻前就抓紧整修渠道进行了冬灌。某部在玛纳斯河畔整修的新盛渠，比原来可增加灌溉面积三万亩。玛纳斯河流域的生产部队在封冻前做的准备工作，约可为今年春耕生产节省十万个以上的劳动日。各部还掀起了积肥运动，大家都积极拾野粪、积圈肥和利用杂草、树叶沤制肥料。牲畜饲养员都争取把马匹喂得膘满力壮，各机耕农场普遍进行拖拉机检修、配件和清洁护养工作，以便在春耕生产中发挥更大的力量。
