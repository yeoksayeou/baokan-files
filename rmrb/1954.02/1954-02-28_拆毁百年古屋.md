Demolishing a Century-Old House
Soviet Union, Marshak

From newspaper reports: On Fifth Avenue in New York, a house where Mark Twain lived and worked from 1904 to 1908 is soon to be demolished. Here—in this old house, at the beginning of this century, Mark Twain once lived. Even though this old house is now cold and deserted, it still clearly remembers the white-haired tenant, how bright his eyes were. But this century-old house is about to be demolished, a decision made by a wealthy merchant. And right next to the table in this house, Mark Twain once labored diligently. The barbarian merchant has decided to completely flatten this residence, and then build a rental house in its place to make a profit. “But Mark Twain lived here!” “Oh, is that so?” the merchant replied, “I'll ask McCarthy to find out if this Twain guy is a radical... Then, not only this house, but even he himself will be purged!" (Translated by Gu Yin from the Soviet "Labor Daily" on January 23rd)

    拆毁百年古屋
    苏联　马尔夏克
    据报纸消息：在纽约的五马路上，有一座马克·吐温曾于一九○四年到一九○八年居住过和工作过的房屋，不久要被拆毁了。在这里——在这座古老的房屋之中，本世纪的开头，曾经住过马克·吐温。纵然这座古屋已冷冷清清，但直到如今它仍记得分明，那位白发苍苍的房客，两眼是多么炯炯有神。可是，这座百年古屋马上就要拆毁，一个巨商这样决定。而就在这屋里的桌子旁边，马克·吐温曾经辛勤劳动。野蛮的商人下了决心，要把这所住宅彻底夷平，然后再在原来的地方，盖一座出租房子把利来生。“可是这里住过马克·吐温！”“噢，是这样吗？”那个商人回答，“我要到麦卡锡那里打听打听，他是不是偏激分子，这位吐温先生……那时候啊，不仅是这座房屋，就连他本人我们也要肃清！”（谷音译自一月二十三日苏联“劳动报”）（附图片）
