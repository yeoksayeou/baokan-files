Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 4th. Under the leadership principle of active leadership and steady development, the CCP committees at all levels in Hebei Province have smoothly completed the first batch of agricultural production cooperative development work. From the end of December last year to mid-January this year, 1,303 new cooperatives have been established in the ten special districts of the province, and another 3,672 new cooperatives are about to be completed. Thus, half of the province's original plan to develop approximately 10,000 new cooperatives before spring plowing has been accomplished. Currently, the province has trained backbone personnel for the second batch of new cooperatives, and the development work for this later batch has been fully launched. By the end of February, after the second batch of new cooperatives is completed, and adding the existing 3,600+ old cooperatives, the total number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province will reach 15,000. At that time, counties with a relatively strong foundation in mutual aid and cooperation will be able to have cooperatives in every township, and many advanced villages in cooperative farming will emerge. The number of members in agricultural production cooperatives will increase from more than 58,000 households last year to about 270,000 households.

The establishment of the first batch of agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province has not only consolidated and expanded the existing old cooperatives but also promoted the development of mutual aid teams. When Changli County established its first batch of agricultural production cooperatives, it developed 382 mutual aid teams. The 407 mutual aid teams that had collapsed last autumn have been restored, and 382 temporary mutual aid teams have been converted into long-term mutual aid teams. It is estimated that by the end of February, after all 10,000 new cooperatives in the province are completed, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations will increase from 42 percent of the province's total peasant households last year to about half.

The development of 10,000 new cooperatives in Hebei Province is being carried out in strict accordance with the principle of active leadership and steady development. After the peasants in the province were universally educated on the general line, their political awareness rapidly improved, and more than 17,200 mutual aid teams requested to be transformed into cooperatives. In order to meet the peasants' urgent demands, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP promptly shifted its leadership focus to the development of agricultural production cooperatives in mid-January, and increased the planned target of establishing 5,000 new cooperatives before spring plowing to about 10,000. Guo Fang and Ma Aimu, deputy directors of the Rural Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, led work teams to the countryside to personally inspect the cooperatives. The secretaries of the CCP county committees all led the cooperative establishment work themselves in accordance with the instructions of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, forming a leadership force with the secretaries of the CCP committees at all levels personally handling the cooperative establishment work for the whole party. In early January, the province trained about 20,000 backbone personnel for cooperative establishment. Wanxian and Wangdu counties in the province also organized many cadres from old cooperatives to help mutual aid teams that requested to be transformed into cooperatives, solving the difficulty of insufficient leadership. In addition, Hebei Province also relied on more than 40,000 rural party and youth league grassroots organizations and 2 million Communist Party members and Youth League members to promote the cooperative establishment work and encourage peasants to join cooperatives and teams.

    河北省大力发展农业生产合作社
    首批五千个社即将建成
    【新华社保定四日电】中共河北省各级党委按照积极领导稳步发展的领导原则，已顺利地完成了第一批农业生产合作社的发展工作。从去年十二月底到今年一月中旬，全省十个专区已建成新社一千三百零三个，另有三千六百七十二个新社即将建成。至此，该省原订春耕前发展新社一万个左右的建社计划就完成了一半。现在该省已经训练好第二批新社的骨干分子，后一批新社的发展工作业已全面展开。到二月底，第二批新社建成后，再加上原有的三千六百多个旧社，全省的农业生产合作社可达到一万五千个。那时，一般互助合作基础较强的县份就能作到乡乡有社，并可出现不少合作化的先进村庄。农业生产合作社的社员，将由去年的五万八千多户增加到二十七万户左右。
    河北省建成第一批农业生产合作社，不仅巩固和扩大了已有的旧社，并且带动了互助组的发展。昌黎县在建立第一批农业生产合作社时，便发展了三百八十二个互助组。去年秋天已经垮台的四百零七个互助组又恢复起来，还有三百八十二个临时互助组转为长期互助组。估计到二月底，该省一万个新社全部建成后，参加互助合作组织的农户，将会由去年占全省总农户的百分之四十二增加到占半数左右。
    河北省一万个新社的发展是切实遵照积极领导稳步发展的原则进行的。该省农民普遍受到总路线教育后，政治觉悟迅速提高，有一万七千二百多个互助组提出了转社的要求。为满足农民的迫切要求，中共河北省委员会在一月中旬便及时把领导重点转到发展农业生产合作社方面，并将春耕前建立五千个新社的计划指标增加到一万个左右。中共河北省委农村工作部副部长郭芳和马艾木，带领工作组下乡，深入到社亲自检查。各县的中共县委会书记都按照中共河北省委的指示，亲手来领导建社工作，组成由各级中共党委书记亲自动手全党办社的领导力量。一月初，全省便训练了约两万名的建社骨干分子。该省完县、望都等地，还组织了不少旧社干部到要求转社的互助组帮助建社工作，解决领导力量不足的困难。此外，河北省还依靠四万多个农村中的党、团基层组织和二百万共产党员、青年团员，来推动建社工作和带动农民入社入组。
