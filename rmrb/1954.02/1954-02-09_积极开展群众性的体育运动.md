The First Plenary Session of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, based on the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, reviewed and summarized the sports work of 1953, determined the working policy of "combining with the actual situation to carry out mass sports activities and gradually popularizing and regularizing them," and formulated the work plan for 1954. This working policy and plan are the specific manifestations of sports work serving the general line of the transition period, and party committees and people's governments at all levels should lead and supervise sports institutions at all levels and other relevant parties to implement them earnestly.

In recent years, under Chairman Mao's instruction to "develop sports and improve the people's physique," mass sports activities in our country have developed rapidly, and have begun to show a significant role in improving the health of the broad masses, and increasing production, work, and study efficiency. Many athletes have not only achieved excellent sports results, but also become production experts or models for study and work. Facts have proved that sports are not only an effective way to improve people's health and enhance their physique, but also an important means to cultivate people's excellent qualities such as courage, perseverance, quickness, optimism, diligence, and collectivism. Today, as the country has entered a period of planned economic construction, vigorously carrying out sports activities is of great significance.

However, the current development of sports is far behind actual needs. An important reason why sports activities have not been better developed is, on the one hand, the poor foundation of sports in the past, and more importantly, some people do not yet understand the important significance of sports activities. Some people believe that "sports are dispensable," and some leaders of factories and mines are afraid that "engaging in sports will delay production and affect work." These views are obviously incorrect. It must be recognized that people are the most valuable capital for building socialism, and a healthy body and a strong will are important guarantees for building socialism. And carrying out mass sports activities is an important way to enhance the people's physique.

Any incorrect understanding of people's sports will inevitably hinder the smooth development of sports activities. It is necessary to publicize widely to make people generally recognize the close relationship between sports activities and production and construction, and national defense construction, and understand that enhancing the physique is not only a matter for oneself, but also a major event related to future generations. As long as everyone recognizes the importance of sports, mass sports activities will gradually develop. In fact, with the improvement of economic life, workers are eager for appropriate cultural and recreational life; especially after Chairman Mao issued the instruction to the youth of the country to be "good in health, good in study, and good in work," young people, especially young workers and students, generally attach great importance to physical exercise. As long as the responsible comrades of party organizations and administrative departments in various places attach importance to this work, sports activities will be gradually developed with leadership and planning.

Party committees and people's governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over sports work, first of all, to strengthen the ideological leadership of sports work. It must be deeply recognized that sports work is one of the important works of our Party. At present, some of the cadres (including physical education teachers) engaged in sports work were professional sports workers in the past, and some were transferred from other posts. The former generally have a certain level of sports expertise, but they also retain more or less old sports views, and their ways of thinking and education methods need to be continuously improved to meet the requirements of the new sports work. We should continuously help them improve their political and ideological level so that they can better serve to promote people's health. For comrades who are newly participating in sports work, they should be made to love their work, strengthen their professional study, and quickly transform them from laymen into experts. This is the decisive link in whether the sports cause can develop healthily in the future. Party committees and people's governments at all levels should allocate necessary cadres as far as possible to establish or enrich sports work institutions at all levels.

To make sports activities become a broad mass movement, propaganda work must be strengthened. One of the important reasons why sports activities have not been widely carried out in the past is that propaganda work has not been done enough. The propaganda departments of party committees in many places have not yet included the propaganda of sports activities in their business scope. This situation should be changed. In a resolution on carrying out sports activities passed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on December 27, 1948, it specifically mentioned the issue of carrying out propaganda and mobilization work for sports activities. In the content of our future propaganda work, on the one hand, we must strive to publicize the purpose, significance, and scientific value of sports activities, strengthen technical guidance, and introduce advanced theories and experiences of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in a planned way; on the other hand, we must also systematically introduce typical experiences of some of our grassroots units in carrying out mass sports activities, and educate the broad masses of people through concrete and vivid facts to promote them to actively participate in physical exercise. In terms of propaganda methods, not only should propaganda be carried out through newspapers, magazines, radio stations, movies, slides, propaganda posters, and photo exhibitions, but also various mass sports evenings or demonstration performances can be organized according to specific circumstances. Sports institutions should formulate propaganda plans under the guidance of the propaganda departments of party committees and earnestly implement them.

To deeply carry out sports activities, attention must be paid to inspection work. According to the guiding principles, tasks, and work plans determined by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the implementation of sports institutions at all levels should be inspected in a timely manner to see which works are done well, which works are done poorly, what experiences and lessons are learned, which experiences should be promoted, and which deviations should be corrected. In order to prevent the deviation of sports work from the masses, the coordination of sports institutions at all levels with the Communist Youth League, trade union organizations, and education departments, as well as their assistance to sports institutions in completing tasks should be focused on checking.

The Party Central Committee instructed us: "Make mass sports activities earnestly carried out first in factories, mines, schools, troops, and government agencies." Trade unions at all levels should attach importance to the specific leadership of sports activities in factories and mining enterprises, and according to needs and possibilities, through activists, firmly grasp the working policy of "preparing, planning, and gradually promoting" from point to area, so that factory and mining sports activities can develop normally. Young students are in a period of development, and they will soon participate in national construction work. The Communist Youth League should regard carrying out sports activities among young students as an important task of its own. Organizations of the Communist Youth League at all levels, especially the working committees of the Communist Youth League in major and medium-sized cities, should improve the military sports department and establish their own business, so that the Communist Youth League organizations can play a backbone role in the sports cause. For school sports, the education departments and the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission should jointly formulate practical and feasible sports teaching plans in order to continue to promote school sports on the existing basis. Military sports activities have a relatively good foundation. In order to build a modernized and regularized national defense army, mass sports activities should be further carried out throughout the army on the existing basis. The physical fitness of staff in government agencies is generally not very strong. The administrative and Party branches and the Communist Youth League branches of government agencies should organize and promote the staff of the entire agency to carry out regular physical exercise.

Sports institutions at all levels must frequently ask for instructions and report to the party committees and people's governments at the same level, strive for the leadership, supervision, and inspection of the Party and the people's government, and proactively contact the relevant departments, and under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, divide responsibilities and cooperate fully. Only in this way can the smooth progress of sports work be guaranteed.

### 积极开展群众性的体育运动

    积极开展群众性的体育运动
    中央人民政府体育运动委员会第一次全体委员会议根据国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，检查和总结了一九五三年的体育工作，确定了“结合实际情况开展群众性的体育运动，并逐步地使之普及和经常化”的工作方针，并制订了一九五四年的工作计划。这个工作方针和计划，就是体育工作服务于过渡时期总路线的具体表现，各级党委和人民政府应该领导和监督各级体育机构和其它有关方面认真执行。
    几年来，在毛主席“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”的指示下，我国群众性的体育运动已经有了迅速的发展，对改善广大群众的身体健康状况，提高生产、工作和学习效率，开始表现了显著的作用。许多运动员不但取得了优良的体育成绩，而且成为生产能手或学习、工作的模范。事实证明，体育运动不但是改善人民健康状况、增强人民体质的有效方法，而且是培养人民的勇敢、坚毅、机敏、乐观、勤劳等优良品质和集体主义精神的重要手段。在国家进入了有计划的经济建设时期的今天，大力开展体育运动，是有很重大的意义的。
    但目前体育运动的开展还远远落后于实际的需要。体育运动未能更好地开展的重要原因，一方面是过去体育运动基础差，而更重要的，是有些人还不了解体育运动的重要意义。有些人认为“体育是可有可无的东西”，有的厂矿领导干部害怕“搞体育会耽误生产，影响工作”。这些看法显然是不对的。必须认识：人是建设社会主义的最宝贵的资本，健康的身体和坚强的意志，乃是建设社会主义的重要保证。而开展群众性的体育运动则是增强人民体质的重要方法。
    对人民体育运动的任何不正确的认识，都必然会妨害体育运动的顺利开展。必须广泛宣传，使人民普遍认识体育运动和生产建设、国防建设的密切关系，了解增强体质不仅是关系自己，同时也是关系后代的一件大事。只要大家认识了体育的重要性，群众性的体育运动便会逐渐开展起来。实际上，随着经济生活的改善，工人迫切要求适当的文化娱乐生活；尤其是毛主席向全国青年发出“身体好，学习好，工作好”的指示以后，青年们特别是青年工人、学生，一般都很重视体育锻炼。只要各地党组织和行政部门的负责同志重视这一工作，体育运动一定会有领导、有计划地逐渐开展起来。
    各级党委和人民政府必须加强对体育工作的领导，首先是加强体育工作的思想领导。必须深刻认识体育工作是我们党的重要工作之一。目前从事体育工作的干部（包括体育教师），有的是过去的专业体育工作者，有的是从其他工作岗位上调来的。前者大都有一定的体育业务水平，但也或多或少地保留着旧的体育观点，他们的思想方法和教育方法，需要不断改进，以适合新的体育工作的要求。应该不断地帮助他们提高政治水平和思想水平，使他们更好地为增进人民的健康服务。对于新参加体育工作的同志，则应使他们热爱自己的工作，加强业务学习，使他们迅速地由外行变成内行。这是今后体育事业能否健康地开展的决定性环节。各级党委和人民政府应尽可能地配备必要的干部，以建立或充实各级体育工作机构。
    要使体育运动成为广泛的群众运动，必须加强宣传工作。过去体育运动开展得不够广泛的重要原因之一，是宣传工作做得不够。许多地方的党委宣传部门，还没有把体育运动的宣传列入自己的业务范围。这种状况应该加以改变。苏联共产党中央委员会在一九四八年十二月二十七日通过的一项关于开展体育运动的决议中，特别提到开展体育运动的宣传鼓动工作问题。我们今后的宣传工作，在内容上一方面要努力宣传体育运动的目的、意义和科学价值，加强技术指导，有计划地介绍苏联和各人民民主国家的先进理论和经验；另一方面，还必须系统地介绍我们自己的一些基层单位开展群众性体育运动的典型经验，通过具体、生动的事实来教育广大人民群众，推动他们积极地参加体育锻炼。而在宣传方式方面，不仅要通过报纸、杂志、广播电台、电影、幻灯、宣传画、图片展览等进行宣传，同时还可以根据具体情况组织各种群众体育晚会或示范表演。体育机构应在党委宣传部门的指导下，制订宣传计划，并认真地贯彻执行。
    要深入开展体育运动，必须注意检查工作。要根据中央体育运动委员会所确定的方针任务和工作计划，及时检查各级体育机构的执行情况，看看那些工作作得好，那些工作作得坏，有什么经验教训，那些经验应当推广，那些偏向应当纠正。为了防止体育工作脱离群众的偏向，应着重检查各级体育机构与各级青年团、工会组织和教育部门配合的情况，以及它们协助体育机构完成任务的情况。
    党中央指示我们：“使群众性的体育运动首先在厂矿、学校、部队和机关中切实地开展起来。”各级工会应该重视对厂矿企业体育活动的具体领导，根据需要和可能，通过积极分子，紧紧掌握“有准备，有计划，逐步推行”的由点到面的工作方针，使厂矿体育活动得到正常的发展。青年学生正处在发育时期，他们即将参加国家建设工作，青年团应当把在青年学生中开展体育运动作为自己的一项重要任务。各级青年团的组织、首先是各大、中城市的青年团工作委员会，要健全军事体育部，并建立自己的业务，使青年团组织在体育事业中发挥骨干作用。对于学校体育，教育部门和中央体育运动委员会应共同制订切实可行的体育教学计划，以便把学校体育在现有基础上继续向前推进。部队体育活动比较有基础。为了建设现代化、正规化的国防军，应在现有基础上进一步在全军中开展群众性的体育运动。机关工作人员体质一般都不很强，机关行政和党的支部和青年团支部，应该组织、推动全机关工作人员进行经常的体育锻炼。
    各级体育机构必须经常向同级党委和人民政府请示报告，争取党和人民政府的领导、督促和检查，并主动地和有关部门取得联系，在党和政府的统一领导下，分工负责，通力合作。只有这样，才能保证体育工作的顺利进行。
