Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 25th: Nineteen foreign civilians preparing to go to the American side have arrived in Kaesong. The Korean-Chinese side has today given their names to the American side, and will assist them in going to the American side on March 1st.

　　Of these nineteen foreign civilians, eleven are Turkish civilians and eight are stateless civilians. They all used to live in Seoul, and were taken in by the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the end of July 1950. The oldest is a 72-year-old stateless merchant, and the youngest is a baby just three months old. There are three families among these civilians. The family of Turkish civilian Garin Sharahuddin has a total of ten people, and he used to be a businessman. The family of stateless civilian Ivan Feodorovich Kirin has a total of five people, and he used to run a clothing store. Stateless civilian Dimitri Ivanovich Florosov married a Turkish woman in North Korea. Under the care of the Korean authorities, his wife safely gave birth to a boy, who is just three months old.

　　They came to Kaesong by train. Twenty-one-year-old Turkish civilian Shajid Sharahuddin said: "The journey was very comfortable." Mrs. Florosov, carrying the baby, said: "On the train, we had a bedroom with two berths, so the child could sleep, which was great." She thanked the Korean authorities for their help, which allowed them to bring all their personal belongings.

　　They received good care from the Korean authorities in Kaesong. Each family has a separate bedroom, and there are also common libraries and dining rooms. Everyone praised the food as good. Shajid said: "We have meat, fish, eggs, as well as fresh milk, butter, and bread. We Turks don't eat pork, but we can get beef." There is a doctor and two nurses to take care of their health. But, Shajid said: "No one has seen a doctor, because everyone is very healthy."

    准备前往美方地区的外籍平民到达开城
    【新华社开城二十五日电】十九名准备前往美方地区的外籍平民已经到达开城。朝中方面今天已把他们的名单交给美方，并将在三月一日协助他们前往美方地区。
    在这十九名外籍平民中，有土耳其平民十一人，无国籍平民八人。他们以前都居住在汉城，在一九五零年七月底，为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国当局所收容。其中年纪最大的是一个七十二岁的无国籍的商人，年纪最小的是一个刚满三个月的婴儿。这些平民中有三个家庭。土耳其平民加林·沙拉胡丁的家庭共有十人，他以前经商。无国籍平民伊凡·费奥道罗维奇·基林的家庭共五人，他以前经营服装店。无国籍平民季米特里·伊凡诺维奇·佛罗索夫在北朝鲜和一个土耳其女子结了婚。在朝鲜当局的照顾下，他的妻子平安地生了一个男孩子，刚满三个月。
    他们是乘火车来到开城的。二十一岁的土耳其平民沙吉德·沙拉胡丁说：“旅途非常舒服。”带着婴儿的佛罗索夫夫人说：“在火车上，我们有一个两张卧铺的卧室，孩子可以睡觉，真好。”她感谢朝鲜当局对他们的帮助，使他们能带着所有的私人行李。
    他们在开城受到朝鲜当局的良好照顾。每个家庭都有单独的卧室，此外，还有公用的图书室和餐室。每个人都称赞伙食良好。沙吉德说：“我们有肉、鱼、鸡蛋，还有新鲜的牛奶、牛油和面包。我们土耳其人不吃猪肉，但是能得到牛肉。”有一个医生和两个护士照顾他们的健康。但是，沙吉德说：“没有人去看病，因为大家都很健康。”
