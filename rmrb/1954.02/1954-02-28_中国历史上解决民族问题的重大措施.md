    Major Measures in Chinese History for Solving Ethnic Problems
    The 204th meeting of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on January 28th unanimously agreed to the resolution of the First Session of the Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Suiyuan Province to incorporate Suiyuan Province into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, abolish the administrative establishment of Suiyuan Province, abolish the Suiyuan Provincial Military and Political Committee and the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, and submit it to the Central People's Government Committee for formal approval.
    This is a major measure in Chinese history to solve ethnic problems in the spirit of ethnic equality, unity, and mutual assistance; it is a major event in the political life of the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and all ethnic groups in the country; it is a correct and necessary measure to further solve ethnic problems and promote the cause of national construction under the brilliant illumination of the general line for the transition period; it is a great event that could only occur in the People's Democratic China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.
    For a long historical period, the reactionary ruling class implemented a policy of national oppression, resulting in ethnic relations in China characterized by mutual discrimination and even mutual killing. During the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule, they even denied that China was a multi-ethnic country. They absurdly claimed: "The Chinese nation is formed by the fusion of many clans," and that various ethnic groups are "large and small branches of the same bloodline." The Mongolian ethnic group was also denied by the reactionary rulers. They forcibly divided the concentrated Mongolian ethnic groups, assigning Mongolian people to different provinces and regions. The establishment of Suiyuan Province (1928) and its counties was an important step in the Kuomintang reactionary rulers' policy of national oppression and assimilation. In complete contrast to the reactionary rulers, the Chinese Communist Party firmly opposed the policy of national oppression and resolutely implemented a policy of ethnic equality. Since its establishment, the Chinese Communist Party has used the Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues to solve the ethnic problems in our country. The history of the Chinese Communist Party leading the Mongolian national liberation movement for more than 30 years vividly illustrates this point. As early as the First Revolutionary Civil War period, the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong cultivated a group of revolutionary backbones for the Mongolian ethnic group; during the Second Revolutionary Civil War period, they led the Mongolian and Han revolutionary youth and laboring people in various regions of Inner Mongolia in opposing the reactionary rulers of the time; during the Anti-Japanese War period, they organized and led the anti-Japanese struggle of the Mongolian and Han people in the Suiyuan region, and established the Daqingshan Anti-Japanese Base Area. They also founded the Nationalities Institute in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, training a group of revolutionary cadres of the Mongolian ethnic group; during the Third Revolutionary Civil War period, they led the ethnic autonomy movement in the Inner Mongolia region, and on the basis of the victorious development of the autonomy movement, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established on May 1, 1947. In the past seven years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved unprecedented development in political, economic, cultural, and other aspects, entering a new era of prosperity, and becoming a good example for various ethnic autonomous regions in China. The approval by the Government Administration Council to incorporate Suiyuan into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region further demonstrates that the policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government in solving domestic ethnic problems is great and correct.
    The important content of Comrade Mao Zedong's basic policy of applying Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues to solve our country's ethnic problems—the policy of ethnic regional autonomy—is that in China, where the people's democratic revolution has been victorious and the system of national oppression has been fundamentally eliminated, we must, based on the different historical stages of development of various ethnic minorities, systematically help them develop their political, economic, and cultural undertakings over a long period, eliminate the de facto inequality between ethnic groups left over from history, gradually raise them to the ranks of advanced ethnic groups, and jointly transition to a socialist society. This great and sincere help is also an important condition for achieving brotherly unity among the people of all ethnic groups. This brotherly unity is necessary for building our socialist industrialized motherland. After Suiyuan is incorporated into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the number of Han people in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will increase compared to the past. The participation of the majority of Han people in the autonomous region will further facilitate the Han people in helping their brotherly ethnic groups in construction. This assistance is a concrete manifestation of the high degree of unity and mutual assistance among the various ethnic groups in our country. It will certainly play an extremely important role in promoting the rapid development of various construction undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In the past, the growth and development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was inseparable from the brotherly and enthusiastic assistance of the Han people; now, the Mongolian people should more enthusiastically welcome this assistance and better unite and cooperate closely with the Han people to build the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. For the Han people of Suiyuan, helping the Mongolian people and jointly building the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with the Mongolian people is their due responsibility and an extremely glorious thing, which is entirely in line with the common, long-term, and fundamental interests of the Mongolian and Han people. As Comrade Stalin said: "...it is necessary for the proletariat of the advanced nation, which has already won, to help, effectively and for a long time, the cultural and economic development of the laboring masses of the backward nations, to help them rise to the highest stage of development and catch up with the nations that are ahead. Without such help, it is impossible to establish peaceful cohabitation and brotherly cooperation among the laborers of all nations and tribes in the unified world economy, and this peaceful cohabitation and brotherly cooperation is precisely what is necessary for the complete victory of socialism." (Marxism and the National and Colonial Question) Obviously, the close unity and mutual cooperation between the Mongolian and Han ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is one of the driving forces for promoting the development of political, economic, cultural, and other construction undertakings in the autonomous region. The key lies in the leadership of the Communist Party and the unity of the Party.
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has gradually grown and developed and reached its current scale along with the development and victory of the People's Great Revolutionary Movement led by the Chinese Communist Party, through a series of arduous struggles, under conditions of gradual maturity and gradual advancement of work. The same is true for the changes in the administrative divisions of the autonomous region. Before 1949, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region only governed the five leagues of Hulunbuir, Naven Muren, Xing'an, Xilin Gol, and Chahar. When the Northeast Administrative Region abolished the administrative establishment of Liaobei Province in 1949, the Jerim League of Liaobei Province and the Zhaowuda League of Rehe Province were incorporated into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Before the abolition of the administrative establishment of Chahar Province in 1952, the North China Administrative Committee incorporated the three counties of Duolun, Baochang, and Huade, where Mongolian and Han people lived together, into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. After Suiyuan is incorporated into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, an Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with Gui Sui as its center, an area of more than one million square kilometers, and a population of more than five million will be formed. This will inevitably greatly promote the enthusiasm and initiative of the Mongolian ethnic group and other ethnic groups in building a socialist industrialized motherland, create favorable conditions for the further development and prosperity of the Mongolian ethnic group and other ethnic groups within the region in political, economic, cultural, and other construction undertakings, and mark the consolidation and strengthening of the brotherly, intimate, and unbreakable ethnic unity in our motherland—the great family of friendly cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups. The Party's great ethnic policy guarantees that all ethnic groups in China have an infinitely bright and beautiful future.
    From the perspective of the actual situation in Suiyuan, the measure of incorporating Suiyuan into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is also very necessary. After the liberation of Suiyuan, national oppression has been fundamentally eliminated, and ethnic relations have greatly improved, but the unreasonable coexistence of flag and county political power and the undue contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry left over from history still hinder the further unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups and the further development of various construction undertakings. More importantly, the continued existence of the flag and county coexistence affects the rapid elimination of ethnic barriers between the Mongolian and Han people. After Suiyuan Province is incorporated into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the confidence of the Mongolian people in being masters of their own affairs can be further enhanced and consolidated, and under the unified leadership of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, problems that are not conducive to ethnic unity and production development, such as the coexistence of flags and counties and the contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry, can be properly resolved in a reasonable manner. After the abolition of the administrative establishment of Suiyuan Province, on the basis of the Jining and Shanba special districts, where the Han people lived in relatively concentrated areas, Pingdiquan and Hetao administrative regions, dominated by the Han ethnic group, will be established, including 2.4 million Han people and nearly 50,000 Mongolian people and other ethnic groups. That is to say, more than 80% of the Han people in the original Suiyuan Province will directly manage their own affairs under the form of political power dominated by the Han ethnic group. These two administrative regions are also a level of political power under the leadership of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is in line with the spirit of the Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy and is conducive to ethnic unity.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Suiyuan Province have gone through a long period of revolutionary struggle. After the liberation of the entire territory of Suiyuan on September 19, 1949, the Party and government leading organs of Suiyuan Province widely united the people of all ethnic groups and strata, carried out a series of social reforms and restored and developed production and many other tasks, implemented the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's ethnic policies, and established the two autonomous leagues of Ulanqab League and Ikh Zhao League, and the Hui autonomous regions of Gui Sui and Baotou cities, creating the necessary conditions for today's implementation of the measure of incorporating Suiyuan into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Therefore, when the Mongolian and Suiyuan Sub-bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to the First Session of the Third People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Suiyuan Province on January 13 to incorporate Suiyuan into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and abolish the administrative establishment of Suiyuan Province, it won the enthusiastic support of all the representatives, who unanimously believed that this was a great happy event. This proves that this measure is completely timely and correct.
    After Suiyuan Province is incorporated into the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has embarked on a new period of further construction. The tasks for the future should be: to jointly build the great family of the motherland with all brotherly ethnic groups in the country; in the development of the common cause of the motherland, to follow the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, to further develop the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the autonomous region, and to gradually improve the material and cultural living standards of the people of all ethnic groups; to continue to eliminate the de facto inequalities left over from history among the various ethnic minorities within the region, to raise them to the level of advanced ethnic groups, and to jointly transition to a socialist society with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland. The tasks are arduous and glorious. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the Central People's Government, the cadres and people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should unite more closely and strive forward to accomplish this task.

    中国历史上解决民族问题的重大措施
    中央人民政府政务院一月二十八日举行的第二百零四次政务会议，经讨论一致同意绥远省第一届第三次各界人民代表会议的决议，将绥远省划归内蒙古自治区，撤销绥远省建制，撤销绥远省军政委员会和绥远省人民政府，并将报请中央人民政府委员会正式批准。
    这是中国历史上以民族平等、团结互助的精神解决民族问题的重大措施；是内蒙古自治区，也是全国各民族人民政治生活中的一件大事；是在国家过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下，进一步解决民族问题，推进国家建设事业的正确的、必要的措施；是只有在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的人民民主的中国才可能出现的伟大事件。
    在很长的历史时期中，反动统治阶级实施民族压迫政策的结果，造成了中国各民族间互相歧视甚至互相仇杀的民族关系。到国民党反动统治时期，更否认中国是一个多民族的国家。他们荒谬地宣称：“中华民族是多数宗族融和而成的”，各民族是“同一血统的大小宗支”。蒙古民族也是被反动统治者否认了的。他们并强制地把聚居的蒙古民族分割开来，使蒙族人民分属于不同的省区。绥远地区的设省（一九二八年）立县，就是国民党反动统治者这种民族压迫、民族同化政策的一个重要步骤。与反动统治者完全相反，中国共产党则是坚决反对民族压迫政策，并坚决实行民族平等政策的。中国共产党从成立之日起，就是以马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的学说来解决我国民族问题的。三十多年来，中国共产党领导蒙古民族解放运动的历史，极其生动地说明了这一点。远在第一次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党和毛泽东同志即为蒙古民族培养了一批革命骨干；第二次国内革命战争时期，领导了内蒙古各地区的蒙汉革命青年和劳动人民，反对了当时的反动统治者；抗日战争时期，组织与领导了绥远地区蒙汉人民的抗日斗争，建立了大青山抗日根据地。并在革命圣地——延安，创办了民族学院，培养了一批蒙古民族的革命干部；第三次国内革命战争时期，领导了内蒙古地区的民族自治运动，并在自治运动胜利发展的基础上，于一九四七年五月一日成立了内蒙古自治区人民政府。近七年来，内蒙古自治区在政治、经济、文化等各方面均获得空前发展，进入了一个欣欣向荣的新时代，成为中国各个民族自治区的良好榜样。这次政务院通过绥远划归内蒙古自治区，更充分地说明了中国共产党和人民政府解决国内民族问题的政策是伟大的与正确的。
    毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的学说来解决我国民族问题的基本政策——民族区域自治政策的重要内容，就是在人民民主革命胜利了的中国，根本消除了民族压迫制度之后，根据各个少数民族发展的不同历史阶段，长期地、有系统地帮助各少数民族发展他们的政治、经济、文化事业，消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使他们逐步提高到先进民族的行列，共同过渡到社会主义社会。这种伟大的真诚的帮助，同时是达到各民族人民兄弟般团结的重要条件。这种兄弟般的团结是建设我们社会主义工业化的祖国所必需的。绥远划归内蒙古自治区之后，内蒙古自治区内的汉族人民比过去增多了。多数的汉族人民参加了自治区，就更加便利于汉族人民帮助兄弟民族进行建设。这种帮助，是我国各兄弟民族间高度的团结互助精神的具体表现。对内蒙古自治区各项建设事业的迅速发展，一定会起极为重大的推进作用。过去，内蒙古自治区的成长和发展，是与汉族人民兄弟般地、热诚地帮助分不开的；现在，蒙族人民更应热诚地欢迎这种帮助，并更好地与汉族人民互相团结，亲密合作，建设内蒙古自治区。对绥远的汉族人民来说，帮助蒙族人民并和蒙族人民共同来建设内蒙古自治区，是自己应尽的责任，也是一种极为光荣的事情，是完全符合蒙汉各民族人民共同的长远的和根本的利益的。正如斯大林同志所说：“……必须使先进民族的已经胜利了的无产阶级去帮助、有效地和长期地去帮助落后民族劳动群众的文化与经济的发展，帮助他们提高到最高的发展阶段，赶上走在前边的民族。没有这样的帮助，就不可能建立各民族和部族劳动者在统一的世界经济内的和平共居和兄弟般的合作，而这种和平共居和兄弟般的合作正是社会主义的彻底胜利所必需的。”（马克思主义与民族、殖民地问题）很显然，内蒙古自治区内，蒙汉民族的亲密团结和互助合作，是促进自治区政治、经济、文化等建设事业发展的动力之一。而其关键则在于共产党的领导和党的团结。
    内蒙古自治区是随着中国共产党所领导的人民大革命运动的发展和胜利，经过了一系列艰苦的斗争，在条件逐步成熟、工作逐步推进的情况下，才逐渐成长和发展起来，从而达到现有规模的。自治区区划的变动也是这样。一九四九年以前，内蒙古自治区只管辖呼伦贝尔、纳文慕仁、兴安、锡林郭勒、察哈尔五个盟。一九四九年东北行政区撤销辽北省建制时，将辽北省的哲里木盟及热河省的昭乌达盟划归内蒙古自治区。一九五二年察哈尔省建制撤销前，华北行政委员会又将蒙、汉民族杂居的多伦、宝昌、化德三县划归内蒙古自治区。绥远划归内蒙古自治区之后，以归绥为中心，面积达一百余万平方公里，人口在五百万以上的内蒙古自治区形成了，这必然会大大地发挥蒙古民族与其它民族对建设社会主义工业化的祖国的积极性和自动精神，为蒙古民族及境内其它民族创造了政治、经济、文化等建设事业进一步发展和繁荣的有利条件，标志着我们祖国——各民族人民友爱合作的大家庭中，兄弟般的、亲密无间的、牢不可破的民族团结的日益巩固和加强。党的伟大的民族政策，保证了中国各个民族都有一个无限光明美好的前途。
    从绥远的现实情况来看，将绥远划归内蒙古自治区这一措施也是十分必要的。绥远解放后，民族压迫已根本消除，民族关系有很大改善，但是，历史上遗留下来的不合理的旗、县政权同时并存与不应有的农牧矛盾现象，仍然阻碍着各民族间进一步的团结互助和各项建设事业的进一步发展。而更重要的是旗县并存状态的继续存在，影响着蒙族人民和汉族人民之间民族隔阂的迅速消除。绥远省划归内蒙古自治区之后，就可以更加提高和巩固蒙族人民当家作主的信心，就可以在内蒙古自治区人民政府统一领导下，将旗县并存和农牧矛盾等不利于民族团结与发展生产的问题，加以合情合理的妥善解决。绥远省建制撤销后，在原汉族人民居住较为集中的集宁、陕坝两专区的基础上，将分别建立平地泉、河套两个以汉族为主体的行政区，包括二百四十万汉族人民与近五万蒙族人民及其它民族人民。也就是说，原绥远省百分之八十以上的汉族人民，将在以汉族为主体的政权形式下，直接来管理自己的事务。而这两个行政区又是在内蒙古自治区人民政府领导下的一级政权，这也是符合于民族区域自治实施纲要的精神和有利于民族团结的。
    绥远省各族人民，在中国共产党领导下，经过了长期革命斗争。一九四九年九月十九日绥远全境解放后，绥远省党、政领导机关，广泛团结了各民族、各阶层人民，进行了一系列社会改革和恢复、发展生产及其他很多工作，贯彻了党和毛泽东同志的民族政策，建立了乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟两个自治区和归绥、包头二市的回民自治区，为今天实现绥远划归内蒙古自治区的措施，创造了应有的条件，所以，当中共中央蒙绥分局在一月十三日向绥远省第一届第三次各界人民代表会议提出将绥远划归内蒙古自治区，并撤销绥远省建制的建议后，博得全体代表的热烈拥护，他们一致认为这是一件大喜事。这证明这一措施是完全适时而正确的。
    绥远省划归内蒙古自治区之后，内蒙古自治区走上了进一步建设的新时期。今后的任务应该是：与全国各兄弟民族共同建设祖国大家庭；在祖国共同事业的发展中，遵循着国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，进一步发展自治区的政治、经济与文化事业，逐步提高各族人民的物质与文化生活水平；继续消除境内各少数民族历史上遗留下来的事实上的不平等，提高到先进民族的水平，与祖国各族人民共同过渡到社会主义社会。任务是艰巨而光荣的。内蒙古自治区蒙汉各族干部和人民，在中国共产党、毛泽东同志和中央人民政府的领导下，应更加亲密地团结起来，为完成这一任务而奋勇前进。
