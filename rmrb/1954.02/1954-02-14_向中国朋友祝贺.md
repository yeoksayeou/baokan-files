    Congratulations to Chinese Friends
    Socialist Labor Hero, Chairman of the Soviet "October 12th" Collective Farm
    Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federal Republic, P. Marinina
    On the fourth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the dear Chinese people. We Soviets are proud of the achievements of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its long-tested leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved tremendous achievements in the development of industry and agriculture in a very short period of time.
    When we learn from newspapers and radio broadcasts that many new factories and power stations have been established in your country, and that agriculture is also undergoing tremendous transformation, our hearts are filled with joy. We are excited about the achievements of Wang Chonglun, a planer at the Machine Shop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Labor Hero, Ma Minghe, a turner at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, and many other patriots and advanced producers, who are the vanguard of the builders of the new China.
    On the second anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I accompanied the Soviet delegation to your country. I visited Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Harbin and many other cities in China. We participated in the National Day celebrations in Beijing and were personally received by Comrade Mao Zedong. These meetings are unforgettable.
    Wherever we went—whether in the Chinese countryside or in industrial enterprises—people received us everywhere like dear brothers and sisters. I recall a meeting with the peasants. They told us how they drove out the landlords from their villages and acquired land, and how they were living a new and happy life. I told them about our experience in building collective farms and the achievements of the Soviet people. That discussion was lively and enthusiastic. After the discussion, we—Soviets and Chinese—sang and rejoiced to our hearts' content. After returning to the motherland, I told the farmers of our collective farm about your achievements and the warm reception given to the Soviet delegation.
    The collective farmers are keenly interested in Chinese life. The films "The White-Haired Girl," "The Victory of the People of Inner Mongolia," and other films reporting the heroic deeds of the Chinese people have been widely and warmly welcomed by the farmers of our collective farm. These films are also shown in our club. Lectures and reports about China have also been held in our club.
    The Soviet people and the Chinese people are consolidating world peace with their labor achievements. Currently, our country is carrying out major work to rapidly increase the production level of all sectors of agriculture. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has put forward a task to provide the residents with abundant food and light industry with sufficient raw materials within the next two to three years. Collective farmers and agricultural mechanics are working hard to complete this task.
    In 1953, the average milk yield per dairy cow in our collective farm exceeded 5,000 liters. We sold and supplied a large amount of potatoes, meat, milk, oil and vegetables to the state and the market. The collective farm received a monetary income of more than one million rubles. All the collective farmers are living a civilized and prosperous life. There are hundreds of livestock on the collective farm, and all crops are abundant.
    All field work and animal husbandry work have been basically mechanized. The farm itself owns twelve automobiles.
    This year, we have decided to obtain 5,300 liters of milk from each dairy cow, harvest two and a half tons of grain from each hectare of land, and produce twenty-five tons of potatoes from each hectare of land.
    We wish our dear Chinese friends all the best in further consolidating world peace with their labor achievements.

    向中国朋友祝贺
    社会主义劳动英雄  苏联“十月十二日”集体农庄主席
    俄罗斯联邦共和国最高苏维埃代表  普·马里宁娜
    在中苏友好同盟互助条约签字四周年的这一天，我衷心地向亲爱的中国人民祝贺。我们苏联人以中国人民的成就而自豪。中国人民在中国共产党及其久经考验的领袖毛泽东的领导下，在很短的时间内取得了发展工业和农业的巨大成就。
    当我们从报纸和无线电广播中得知在你们国家建立了许多新的工厂和发电站，并且农业也正在实行巨大的改造的时候，我们的心里充满了喜悦。我们为鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂的刨工、劳动英雄王崇伦、沈阳第一机床制造厂的镟工马鸣贺，以及其他许多爱国者、生产先进者的成就而感到兴奋，他们是新中国建设者的先头部队。
    在中华人民共和国成立二周年的时候，我曾随同苏联代表团来到你们的国家。我访问了北京、上海、南京、哈尔滨和中国的其它许多城市。我们参加了北京的国庆盛典，并蒙毛泽东同志亲自接见。这些会面是永远不能使人忘怀的。
    不论我们到什么地方——在中国乡村里，还是在工业企业里，人们到处像对亲兄弟亲姐妹一样地接待我们。我回想起了同农民们的一次会面。他们对我们谈到他们如何从自己的村子里赶走地主并获得土地，他们怎样过着新的幸福生活。我把我国建设集体农庄的经验和苏联人民的成就告诉他们。那次座谈会进行得生动而热烈。座谈会之后，我们——苏联人和中国人，纵情地歌唱、欢乐。在回到祖国之后，我把你们的成绩和对苏联代表团的热烈招待，告诉了我们集体农庄的农民们。
    集体农民们对中国的生活发生浓厚的兴趣。影片“白毛女”、“内蒙人民的胜利”及其它一些报道中国人民英勇事迹的影片，在我们集体农庄的农民中受到了广泛的热烈欢迎。这些影片也在我们的俱乐部里上演。在我们的俱乐部里还曾举办了有关中国的讲演会和报告会。
    苏联人民和中国人民用他们的劳动业绩巩固着世界和平。目前我国正在进行迅速提高农业所有部门生产水平的重大工作。苏联共产党提出了一项任务，要在最近两三年内给居民以丰足的粮食和给轻工业以充分的原料。集体农民和农业机械师们正在为完成这个任务而努力劳动着。
    一九五三年我们集体农庄每头乳牛的平均产奶量，超过了五千公升。我们向国家和市场交售和供应了大量的马铃薯、肉、牛奶、油和蔬菜。集体农庄得到了一百多万卢布的货币收入。所有的集体农民都过着文明的、富裕的生活。在集体农庄里有成百的牲畜，所有的农作物都获得丰收。
    所有田间工作和饲畜工作都已基本上机械化了。农庄本身拥有十二部汽车。
    今年我们决定要从每头乳牛获得五千三百公升的牛奶，从每公顷土地上收获两吨半的谷物，使每公顷土地生产二十五吨马铃薯。
    我们预祝亲爱的中国朋友用他们的劳动业绩来进一步巩固世界和平。
