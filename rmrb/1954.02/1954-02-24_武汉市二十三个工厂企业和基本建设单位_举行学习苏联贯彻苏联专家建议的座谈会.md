    Wuhan City Twenty-Three Factories, Enterprises, and Basic Construction Units
    Hold Symposium on Studying the Soviet Union and Implementing Soviet Expert Suggestions
    Representatives from twenty-three factories, enterprises, and basic construction units in Wuhan City held a symposium on February 12 to study the Soviet Union and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts.
    Representatives from each unit unanimously pointed out in their speeches that conscientiously implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts is of extremely important significance to production and construction. During the construction of the Hanshui Railway Bridge, thanks to the help and suggestions of Soviet experts, various difficulties were overcome, ensuring the timely commencement of construction. The No. 4 bridge pier also completed the pile driving task five days ahead of schedule due to the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. In the Wuchang Shipyard, the basic construction projects, including the slipway project, from site determination and design to construction, the suggestions of Soviet experts played a decisive role. In particular, the acceptance of a series of suggestions from Soviet experts on the original design ensured that the construction of this project conformed to the requirements of the country's socialist industrialization. After the successful reconstruction of the factory, the output can be increased by more than six times compared to the present, while the labor force only needs to be increased by 50 percent. The design of the Hankou Rice Mill reconstruction project also accepted the suggestions of Soviet experts and made major revisions. The factory built according to the new design will save 40 percent of labor compared to the original design, while the production capacity will be one and a half times larger, and the processed rice will be particularly clean. Similarly, in existing factories and enterprises, the suggestions of Soviet experts have also had a significant effect. The Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, due to the conscientious implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, strengthened planned management and the system of one-chief responsibility, reversed the situation in the first half of last year where the state plan could not be completed every month, and leaped to become an advanced railway factory in the country. In terms of production technology, the Wuhan Power Machine Factory implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts in December last year, which also reversed the situation where the state plan could not be completed for eleven months last year. In January of this year, the factory completed 161 percent of the plan for its main products. The Red Star Rice and Flour Mill also achieved significant results in implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. The speeches also exchanged experiences and insights on implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, explaining that to realize the suggestions of Soviet experts, leaders must pay attention, give play to organizational forces, and conduct ideological education for the masses, so that the suggestions of Soviet experts can become a huge material force promoting production and construction.

    武汉市二十三个工厂企业和基本建设单位
    举行学习苏联贯彻苏联专家建议的座谈会
    武汉市二十三个工厂企业和基本建设单位的代表，在二月十二日举行了一个学习苏联、贯彻苏联专家建议的座谈会。
    各单位代表在发言中一致指出认真贯彻苏联专家建议，对生产建设有着极重要的关系。汉水铁桥在施工过程中由于苏联专家的帮助和建议，克服了种种困难，保证了如期开工，四号桥墩也由于执行了苏联专家的建议而提前五天完成了打桩任务。武昌造船厂包括滑道工程在内的基本建设工程，从厂址确定、设计以至施工，苏联专家的建议都起了决定性的作用；特别是接受了苏联专家们对原有设计的一系列的建议，保证了这个工程建设符合于国家社会主义工业化的发展要求，该厂改建成功后，产量可比现在提高六倍以上，而劳动力只需增加百分之五十。汉口米厂改建工程的设计，也接受苏联专家的建议，进行了重大的修正，按新设计建设的工厂将比原设计的工厂节省劳动力百分之四十，而生产能力却要大一倍半，加工的大米还特别干净。同样，在现有的工厂企业中，苏联专家的建议也发生了显著的效果。江岸机车车辆修理工厂由于认真贯彻了苏联专家的建议，加强了计划管理和一长负责制，就扭转了去年上半年月月不能完成国家计划的局面，一跃而为全国先进的铁路工厂。在生产技术上，武汉动力机厂在去年十二月份执行了苏联专家的建议，也扭转了去年十一个月不能完成国家计划的局面，今年一月份，该厂主要产品计划完成了百分之一百六十一；红星米面厂在执行苏联专家的建议中也同样获得了显著的成绩。发言中还交流了贯彻苏联专家建议的经验和体会，说明要实现苏联专家的建议，还必须领导重视，发挥组织力量，对群众进行思想教育，这样才能使苏联专家的建议成为巨大的推动生产建设的物质力量。
