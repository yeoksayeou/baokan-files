    Expansion Project of Dalian No. 2 Power Plant to Commence in February

    [This Dispatch] The large-scale expansion project of the Dalian No. 2 Power Plant is about to commence. This is one of the 141 enterprises that the Soviet Union is helping China to build and expand. After the expansion, the entire production process of the Dalian No. 2 Power Plant will be automated and mechanized, able to provide sufficient power for the development of Dalian's industry and the needs of the people's lives. It can also supply a large amount of steam for nearby factories to use in production.

    Currently, the Dalian Power Bureau is actively carrying out various construction preparations. The technical design of the project is underway; the equipment supplied from abroad will be shipped in continuously in the first half of this year; and timber and red bricks for civil construction will be transported to the construction site one after another. The entire expansion project of the Dalian No. 2 Power Plant is contracted and constructed by the Thermal Power Engineering Company and the Civil Engineering Company, both affiliated to the Northeast Electric Power Bureau. Both parties have established organizational structures to lead the expansion project – the Expansion Office and other affiliated institutions – and have carried out specific construction preparations such as site clearing, geological exploration, and material supply. The preparatory work for the first batch of projects has now been basically completed, and a detailed construction plan has been formulated, the project progress has been arranged, and construction will commence in February.

    旅大市第二发电厂扩建工程二月份动工
    【本报讯】规模巨大的旅大市第二发电厂扩建工程即将动工。这是苏联帮助我国新建和扩建的一百四十一项企业之一。扩建后的旅大第二发电厂全部生产过程都将自动化、机械化，能以充分的电力供应旅大市工业的发展和人民生活的需要，还可以大量的水蒸气供给附近工厂生产使用。
    现在，旅大市电业局正在积极进行各项施工准备工作。工程的技术设计正在进行；国外供应的设备今年上半年就可源源运来；土木建筑工程用的木材、红砖，即将陆续运到工地。全部旅大市第二发电厂的扩建工程由东北电业局所属的火电工程公司和土建工程公司分别承包施工。甲乙双方已成立了领导扩建工程的组织机构——扩厂办公室和其他附属机构，进行了场地清理、地质钻探、材料供应等具体的施工准备工作。首批工程的准备工作现已基本完成，并拟定较细致的施工计划，排列了工程进度，将于二月份动工。
