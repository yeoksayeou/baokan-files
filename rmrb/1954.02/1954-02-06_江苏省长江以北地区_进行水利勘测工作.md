    Conducting Water Conservancy Survey Work
    Xinhua News Agency: In order to prepare systematic data for large-scale farmland water conservancy construction and to thoroughly eradicate waterlogging disasters, cadres from the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Department are intensively carrying out water conservancy survey work in the vast plains north of the Yangtze River and south of the abandoned Yellow River. At present, they have completed 3,230 square kilometers of triangular topographic surveying in the Gaoyou Lake and Baoying Lake area, completed 6,500 square kilometers of surveying in the Lixiahe area east of the Grand Canal, and completed the measurement of the Doulonggang, Sheyang River, and Xinyang River estuary waterways in the coastal area. Nearly a thousand survey personnel dispatched by the Jiangsu Provincial Huai River Harnessing Headquarters are participating in this water conservancy survey work. They persist in working despite the difficult conditions of the severe cold weather. Local farmers, anticipating the bountiful harvest scenery after the elimination of waterlogging, are automatically and actively assisting in the surveying work.

    江苏省长江以北地区
    进行水利勘测工作
    为了给大规模兴修农田水利、彻底根治内涝灾害准备各种系统的资料，江苏省水利部门的干部正在长江以北废黄河以南的广大平原上紧张进行水利勘测工作。目前，他们已在高邮湖、宝应湖一带完成三千二百三十平方公里的三角地形测量，在运河以东里下河地区完成六千五百平方公里的勘测工作，在沿海地区完成斗龙港、射洋河、新洋河等入海水道的测量。参加这次水利勘测工作的有江苏省治淮指挥部派出的近千勘测人员，他们在天气严寒的困难条件下仍然坚持工作。当地农民预计到根除内涝后的丰收美景，都自动地积极协助勘测工作。
