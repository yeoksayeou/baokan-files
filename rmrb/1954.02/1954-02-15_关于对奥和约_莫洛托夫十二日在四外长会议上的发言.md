The Soviet government attaches great importance to the immediate resolution of the Austrian question.

Concluding the Austrian State Treaty based on the previous agreement reached by the four powers on the clauses of the draft treaty would restore Austria to a free and independent state. Such a resolution of the Austrian question is in the interests of consolidating peace in Europe and also in line with the task of safeguarding the national rights of the Austrian people.

The Soviet government believes that it is abnormal that negotiations on the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty have been going on for seven years without reaching an agreement so far.

As everyone knows, it took more than two years to reach a consensus on the clauses concerning former German assets in the Austrian State Treaty in 1949, even though the clauses on this issue in the draft were fully based on the Potsdam Conference decisions and other four-power agreements on Austria's political and economic issues.

In 1949, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States reached an agreement on the draft Austrian State Treaty in general, except for a few individual clauses.

The unwillingness of the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to study the issues closely related to the future independence and freedom of Austria is a major obstacle to completing the preparation of the Austrian State Treaty.

The Soviet government believes that the United States and Britain must fulfill their obligations regarding the Free Territory of Trieste under the Italian Peace Treaty. The Soviet government has always believed that the United States and Britain's failure to fulfill their obligations in this regard and the de facto transformation of the Free Territory of Trieste into an American and British military base is unacceptable.

In view of this, the Soviet government naturally strives to prevent Austria from suffering the same fate. Therefore, we cannot avoid discussing the issue of the Free Territory of Trieste.

The last two years, namely 1952 and 1953, were almost entirely spent overcoming another obstacle on the road to concluding the Austrian State Treaty.

In March 1952, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France suddenly put forward a so-called "abbreviated treaty" draft, unilaterally drafted by the three countries without Soviet participation. Obviously, their recently developed habit of taking unilateral action relapsed here.

Unexpectedly, the Austrian government actively supported this new draft, which contradicted the four-power decisions previously agreed upon and Austria's previous position. This shows that the Austrian government cannot shirk its responsibility for the delayed resolution of the Austrian State Treaty issue.

As everyone knows, the Soviet Union cannot accept the "abbreviated treaty" draft at all. Because, first, it ignores the democratic rights of the Austrian people, while the draft Austrian State Treaty has very clear and unanimously agreed provisions on the democratic rights of the Austrian people;

Second, it seriously infringes upon the rights recognized by the Potsdam decision, such as the Soviet Union's rights in "former German assets," which the United States and Britain signed on, and France later supported.

It has been almost two years since the governments of the United States, Britain, and France refused to abandon their unilaterally drafted "abbreviated treaty" draft and insisted on this unfortunate proposition. Now, as we understand it, the three governments have finally withdrawn the "abbreviated treaty" draft. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that it is possible and necessary to make every effort to speed up the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty.

What is the situation now?

The Soviet government believes that today it is entirely possible to restore Austria to an autonomous, independent, and democratic state, to lift the four-power control over Austria through the Allied Control Council, and to abolish all institutions established for the occupation of Austria. At the same time, events in recent years have shown that this treaty must pay special attention to ensuring the democratic and peaceful development of Austria as an independent state.

Therefore, a clause must be included in the Austrian State Treaty stipulating that Austria shall not participate in any alliance or military bloc aimed at opposing any country that participated with its troops in repelling Nazi aggression and liberating Austria, and that no foreign military bases shall be established on Austrian territory.

This proposal by the Soviet government is in line with the interests of guaranteeing Austria's national independence and security. Including such a clause can also ensure that Austrian manpower and material resources are not used for foreign interests. That is to say, a free, independent, and peaceful Austria will become an important stabilizing factor in the center of Europe, which will be a major contribution to consolidating European security.

Secondly, we must talk about some specific aspects.

The Soviet government cannot fail to take into account that the Western three powers are not in a hurry to conclude a German peace treaty to enable the entire Germany to achieve democratic and peaceful development. We cannot ignore the plans for the revival of militarism in West Germany, especially the Paris Treaty on the "European Defense Community."

We must not forget that when German militarism engaged in aggression in Europe in recent decades, it first dragged Austria into military blocs against the people of other European countries in some way. As a result, Austrian manpower and material resources were used to achieve the aggressive purposes of German militarism, and in the most recent war, this situation was caused by the annexation of Austria by Germany.

All this requires taking very effective measures to prevent West Germany from reattempting to annex Austria, and to truly guarantee the independence of democratic Austria, its territorial integrity, and the inviolability of its borders.

The draft Austrian State Treaty that has been prepared already takes this requirement into account. For example, Article 3 of the draft Austrian State Treaty stipulates (according to the Russian translation of the draft Austrian State Treaty):

"The Allied and Associated Powers shall insert in the Treaty with Germany provisions ensuring that Germany recognizes the sovereignty and independence of Austria and renounces all territorial and political claims in respect of Austria and Austrian territory."

A specific clause in the draft treaty currently under discussion prohibits the Anschluss of Austria and Germany. For example, Article 4, Paragraph 1 states: "The Allied and Associated Powers declare that political or economic union between Austria and Germany is forbidden. Austria fully recognizes its responsibilities in this matter and shall not conclude any political or economic union with Germany."

Finally, Article 27 of the draft Austrian State Treaty tasks Austria and the Allied and Associated Powers with working together to prevent Germany from taking any measures to rebuild its armed forces outside German territory.

The fact that the reviving West German militarism poses a major threat to Austria particularly clearly illustrates the importance of the above-mentioned clauses. We cannot but ask everyone to pay attention to the remarks made by some newspapers close to the West German government, which are now creating a malicious rumor that Austria cannot exist independently and must be subordinate to West Germany. Some remarks by official spokesmen in West Germany also prove this point. West German monopoly capital is already taking some practical measures to gradually make Austria economically dependent on itself.

The new German-Austrian merger plans formulated by West German militarists and revanchists are even supported by some representatives of the Austrian ruling groups.

This cannot be ignored, especially because the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have repeatedly delayed the conclusion of the German peace treaty, which could guarantee the restoration of German unity and its democratic and peaceful development. Concluding a German peace treaty that can eliminate the possibility of the revival of German militarism would provide the most important guarantee for the existence of Austria as an independent and autonomous state. Unfortunately, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France did not accept the Soviet Union's proposal on preparing and concluding the German peace treaty, and the issue of the German peace treaty has been dragged on to this day without a resolution.

In this situation, in order to consolidate peace in Europe, the four powers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must take measures when resolving the Austrian issue to prevent West Germany's German-Austrian merger conspiracy and to guarantee Austria's independence.

The Soviet government believes that once the German peace treaty is concluded, all these measures will be unnecessary and superfluous.

The Soviet government's proposal on speeding up the conclusion of the German peace treaty is for the same purpose. The German and Austrian peoples, as well as the people of other European countries, advocate this way of resolving the issue of the German peace treaty.

Today we heard the speech by Austrian Foreign Minister Figl. When the Soviet delegation proposed including the Austrian State Treaty issue on the meeting's agenda, it considered it necessary to listen to the Austrian delegation's opinion when discussing this issue.

We welcome the Austrian representatives to participate in our meeting. Austrian representatives must be given the opportunity to present their views at this meeting.

When discussing the German issue, we did not have the opportunity to listen to the opinions of the representatives of the German people, namely the representatives of East and West Germany. We cannot but express our regret that the Western three foreign ministers rejected the proposal to invite German representatives to participate in this meeting.

Mr. Figl, representing the Austrian government, requested that Austria be able to use Austrian goods instead of US dollars to repay the former German assets transferred by the Soviet Union to Austria in accordance with Article 35 of the draft treaty.

The Soviet government is willing to grant this request. The Soviet government has considered this request from the Austrian government and agrees that Austria may repay the amount stipulated in the aforementioned Article 35 with goods instead of US dollars.

As for other opinions related to Article 35, we should consider that further discussion of such issues will only create new entanglements and delays in resolving the Austrian State Treaty issue, without producing any other results.

We have heard speeches here about the sacrifices Austria made during and after the war. But we must not forget that the Austrian troops incorporated into Hitler's army brought enormous losses to the Soviet Union and not only to the Soviet Union. For this reason, the well-known Moscow Declaration of November 1, 1943, pointed out that Austria should be held responsible for the fact that it participated in the war on the side of Hitler's Germany. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union has not and does not force Austria to assume any obligation to compensate for at least part of the losses it caused. Article 35 of the draft Austrian State Treaty only concerns the former German assets in Austria, which are not Austrian property, and even these former German assets will become Austrian property after the period stipulated in the treaty has passed.

The Soviet Union's proposal to be submitted to this meeting for discussion is based on these considerations I have put forward. The content of the Soviet proposal is as follows:

"On the Conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty to Restore Austria as an Independent, Democratic State.

The governments of the four powers, the Soviet Union, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, believe that in order to consolidate peace in Europe and to safeguard the national rights of the Austrian people, Austria must be restored as a free and independent state as soon as possible; and believe that the resolution of the Austrian issue must be based on the existing four-power agreements.

Therefore, the four governments agree:

1.  To instruct the assistants of the four foreign ministers to complete the final draft of the 'Austrian State Treaty to Restore Austria as an Independent, Democratic State' within three months, drafting it based on the following principles:

	A. To complete the drafting of the Austrian State Treaty draft basically agreed upon by the four powers in 1949, which stipulates that Austria shall be restored as an autonomous, independent, and democratic state; to lift the four-power control; to abolish the existing control institutions – the Allied Control Council for Austria and its subordinate institutions; and to terminate the occupation of Austria;

	B. To include the following supplementary clauses in the draft Austrian State Treaty: 'Austria shall guarantee not to participate in any alliance or military bloc aimed at opposing any country that once sent troops to participate in the war against Germany and the war to liberate Austria.

	Austria shall also not allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory, nor shall it use foreign military instructors and military experts to work in Austria.'

	The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union shall abide by the provisions of this clause;

	C. Taking into account the Soviet government's following statement: The Soviet government accepts the Austrian government's request and agrees that Austria shall repay the amount due to the Soviet Union for compensating for former German assets stipulated in Article 35 of the draft Austrian State Treaty with goods.

2.  In order to prevent new German-Austrian merger conspiracies, to postpone the withdrawal of the occupying forces of the four powers in their respective occupation zones in Austria until the German peace treaty is concluded.

	Simultaneously with the abolition of the Allied Control Council for Austria, all foreign troops should withdraw from Vienna.

	The four-power troops temporarily stationed in Austria should no longer be called occupying forces and should not perform occupation tasks, nor should they interfere in Austria's internal affairs, nor should they interfere in its social and political life.

	The legal status of such troops should be stipulated by a special agreement, which should be jointly drafted by the four powers and Austria, and should come into effect simultaneously with the Austrian State Treaty.

3.  To instruct the meeting of the assistants of the four foreign ministers to discuss the Trieste issue in accordance with the Soviet government's proposal, which is: not to use the city of Trieste and its surrounding areas as military bases."

The Soviet delegation hopes that this Berlin conference will complete the major task of resolving the Austrian State Treaty issue. The Soviet Union's proposed solution to the Austrian State Treaty issue is of great significance for easing international tensions. (Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 13th, from TASS)

    关于对奥和约
    ——莫洛托夫十二日在四外长会议上的发言
    苏联政府对于立即解决奥地利问题非常重视。
    根据从前四国就对奥和约草案的条文达成的协议缔结对奥和约，就会使奥地利恢复成为一个自由与独立的国家。这样解决奥地利问题，是符合于巩固欧洲和平的利益，同时也符合于保障奥地利人民的民族权利的任务的。
    苏联政府认为，就缔结对奥和约的问题举行谈判已达七年之久，而至今还没有达成协议，这种情况是不正常的。
    大家知道，花了两年多的时间，才在一九四九年就对奥和约中有关从前德国资产的条文取得一致意见，虽然草案中关于这个问题的条文是完全根据波茨坦会议的决定以及关于奥地利的政治、经济问题的其他四国协议的。
    在一九四九年，苏联、法国、英国和美国除若干个别条文外，大体上就对奥和约草案获致了协议。
    美、英、法三国代表不愿意研究与奥地利未来的独立和自由的命运有密切关系的问题，是完成准备对奥和约工作的一个主要障碍。
    苏联政府认为美国和英国必须履行根据对意和约承担的对的里雅斯特自由区的义务。苏联政府始终认为，美国和英国不履行它们在这方面的义务，并实际上把的里雅斯特区变为美英军事基地，这是不能容许的。
    有鉴于此，苏联政府自然要竭力不使奥地利遭遇同样的命运。所以我们不能避而不谈的里雅斯特自由区问题。
    最近两年，即一九五二年与一九五三年，几乎完全用来克服缔结对奥和约道路上的另一个障碍。
    一九五二年三月，美、英、法三国政府突然提出了没有苏联参加而由三国片面草拟的所谓“简要条约”草案。显然，在这里，它们近来养成的采取片面行动的习气又发作了。
    出乎意料之外的是，奥地利政府居然也积极支持这个新草案，而这个新草案是与四国前已取得协议的决定以及奥地利从前的立场相矛盾的。由此可见，对奥和约问题迟迟不能解决，奥地利政府也不能推卸责任。
    大家知道，苏联完全不能接受“简要条约”草案。因为，第一、它忽视了奥地利人民的民主权利，而对奥和约草案则对奥地利人民的民主权利一点有十分明确的、四国一致同意的规定；
    第二、它严重侵犯了波茨坦决定承认的，例如苏联在“前德国资产”方面的权利，而波茨坦决定是美国和英国在上面签过字，后来法国也支持的。
    自从美、英、法三国政府拒绝放弃它们片面草拟的“简要条约”草案、坚持这种不幸的主张以来，差不多已有两年了。现在，据我们了解，三国政府终于收回了“简要条约”草案。因此，苏联政府认为有可能而且有必要尽力加速缔结对奥和约。
    现在这个问题怎样呢？
    苏联政府认为，今天完全有可能使奥地利恢复成为一个自主的、独立的和民主的国家，解除四国通过盟国管制委员会对奥地利的管制，取消一切为占领奥地利而设立的机构。同时，近几年的事件表明，这个条约必须特别注意保证奥地利作为一个独立国家的民主和平发展。
    因此，必须在对奥和约中列入一条，规定奥地利不得参加任何旨在反对以其军队参与击退纳粹侵略和解放奥地利的任何一个国家的联盟或军事同盟，不得在奥地利领土上建立外国军事基地。
    苏联政府的这个建议符合于保证奥地利的民族独立与安全的利益。列入这样一条，同时可以保证不得利用奥地利的人力和物力为外国利益服务。这就是说，自由的、独立的、和平的奥地利将成为欧洲中心的重要稳定因素，这将是对巩固欧洲安全的重大贡献。
    其次，必须谈一谈某些具体的方面。
    苏联政府不能不考虑到，西方三国并不急于要缔结对德和约，以使整个德国获得民主和平的发展。我们不能忽视在西德复活军国主义的计划，特别是关于“欧洲防务集团”的巴黎条约。
    我们也不能忘记：德国军国主义在近几十年在欧洲从事侵略时，首先就是以某种方式把奥地利拖入反对其他欧洲国家人民的军事集团。结果使奥地利的人力和物力被用来达到德国军国主义的侵略目的，而在最近一次战争中，这种情形是由德奥合并造成的。
    这一切都要求采取十分有效的措施来防止西德重新企图合并奥地利，来真正保障民主奥地利的独立、它的领土完整和边界的不可侵犯。
    在已草拟的对奥和约草案中已考虑到这种要求。例如：对奥和约草案的第三条规定（按对奥和约草案俄文译本）：
    “盟国及参与国将在对德和约中列入一项：保证德国承认奥地利的主权和独立，以及放弃对奥地利和奥地利领土的一切领土和政治要求。”
    目前讨论的和约草案中有一条特别规定禁止德奥合并。例如，第四条第一款说：“盟国及参与国宣布禁止奥地利和德国结成政治和经济同盟。奥地利应完全承认自己在这一问题的责任，不和德国结成任何形式的政治和经济同盟。”
    最后，对奥和约草案第二十七条责成奥地利和盟国及参与国共同合作，防止德国采取任何在德国领土以外重建它的武装的措施。
    正在复活的西德军国主义正形成对奥地利的重大威胁，这一事实特别清楚地说明了上述条款的重要意义。我们不能不要求大家注意一些接近西德政府的报纸的言论，它们现在正在制造一种恶意的谰言，说什么奥地利不可能独立地存在，而必须从属于西德。西德的官方发言人的一些言论也证明了这一点。西德的垄断资本已经在采取若干实际的措施，以便逐渐使奥地利在经济上从属于自己。
    西德军国主义分子和复仇主义分子所制订的新的德奥合并计划，甚至得到奥地利统治集团中的某些代表人物的支持。
    不能不考虑这一点，特别因为美、英、法三国政府一再拖延对德和约的缔结，而对德和约是可以保证德国统一的恢复和它的民主与和平发展的。缔结一个能排除德国军国主义复活的可能性的对德和约，就可以为奥地利作为一个独立自主国家的存在提供最重要的保证。可惜的是，美、英、法三国代表没有接受苏联关于准备和缔结对德和约的建议，对德和约的问题一直拖到现在还没有解决。
    在这种情况下，为了巩固欧洲和平，美、英、法、苏四国在解决奥地利问题的时候，必须采取措施，来防止西德的德奥合并阴谋，来保障奥地利的独立。
    苏联政府认为，一旦缔结了对德和约，所有这些措施就没有必要了，成为多余的了。
    苏联政府所提出的关于尽速缔结对德和约的建议也就是为了同一个目的。德国人民和奥地利人民以及欧洲其他国家的人民都主张这样来解决对德和约的问题。
    今天我们听了奥地利外交部长费格尔先生的发言。苏联代表团在建议将对奥和约问题列入会议议程的时候，就认为有必要在讨论这一问题时听取奥地利代表团的意见。
    我们欢迎奥地利代表参加我们的会议。必须让奥地利代表有机会在这次会议上提出自己的意见。
    在讨论德国问题时，我们未能有机会听取德国人民的代表，即东德和西德的代表的意见。西方三国外长拒绝了关于邀请德国代表参加这次会议的建议，我们对此不能不表示惋惜。
    费格尔先生代表奥地利政府要求奥地利不用美元，而能用奥地利的商品，来偿付根据条约草案第三十五条规定由苏联移交给奥地利的前德国的资产。
    苏联政府愿意答应这一要求。苏联政府考虑了奥地利政府的这一要求，同意奥地利不用美元，而用商品来偿付上述第三十五条所规定的款项。
    至于其他有关第三十五条的意见，我们应当考虑到：再来讨论这种问题，除了徒然在解决对奥和约问题上引起新的纠葛和拖延以外，不会产生任何其他结果。
    我们在这里听到了关于奥地利在战时和战后所付出的牺牲的发言。但是我们不能忘记，编在希特勒军队里的奥地利军队曾经给苏联而且不只是给苏联带来了巨大的损失。正因为如此，人所共知的一九四三年十一月一日的莫斯科宣言指出，奥地利应对它站在希特勒德国一边参加战争这一事实负责。尽管如此，苏联过去和现在都没有强要奥地利承担任何赔偿它所造成的至少是一部分损失的义务。对奥和约草案第三十五条也只是关于在奥地利的前德国的资产方面的，这些资产不是奥地利的财产，而在条约中所规定的期限过去之后，甚至这些前德国的资产也要成为奥地利的财产。
    苏联要提交这次会议讨论的建议就是根据我所提出的这些考虑。苏联建议的内容如下：
    “关于缔结使奥地利恢复成为一个独立、民主的国家的对奥和约。
    苏联、法国、联合王国、美国四国政府认为，为了巩固欧洲的和平，为了保障奥地利人民的民族权利，必须尽速使奥地利恢复成为一个自由和独立的国家；并认为奥地利问题的解决必须根据现有的四国协议。
    因此，四国政府同意：
    一、指令四国外长助理在三个月内把‘使奥地利恢复成为一个独立、民主的国家的对奥和约’的最后草案草拟完毕，起草时应从下列原则出发：
    甲、完成一九四九年四国已基本上同意的对奥和约草案的起草工作，这个草案规定：奥地利应恢复成为一个自主的、独立和民主的国家；取消四国管制；取消现有的管制机构——盟国对奥管制委员会及其所属各机构；并终止对奥的占领；
      乙、将下列补充条款列入对奥和约草案：‘奥地利应保证不参加任何旨在反对任何曾经派遣军队参加对德战争和解放奥地利的战争的国家的联盟和军事同盟。
      奥地利也不得允许在其领土上建立外国军事基地，不得利用外国军事教官和军事专家在奥地利工作。’
    美国、联合王国、法国、苏联四国政府应遵守本款的规定；
    丙、考虑到苏联政府的如下声明：苏联政府接受奥地利政府的要求，同意奥地利以商品来偿付对奥和约草案第三十五条所规定的应向苏联偿付的抵偿前德国资产的款项。
    二、为了防止新的德奥合并阴谋，延期撤退四国在奥地利的各自的占领区内的占领军队，直到对德和约缔结为止。
    与撤消盟国对奥管制委员会同时，一切外国军队应撤离维也纳。
    暂时留在奥地利的四国军队不应再称为占领军并不得执行占领任务，不得干涉奥地利的内政，不得干涉其社会与政治生活。
    此种部队的法律地位应由特别协定规定之，该协定应由四国会同奥地利共同拟定，并与对奥和约同时开始生效。
    三、指令四国外长助理会议按照苏联政府的建议讨论的里雅斯特问题，苏联政府的建议是：不得利用的里雅斯特市及其附近地区作为军事基地。”
    苏联代表团希望这次柏林会议完成解决对奥和约问题这一重大任务。苏联提出的解决对奥和约问题的办法，对于缓和国际紧张局势有着重大的意义。　（新华社据塔斯社柏林十三日电）
